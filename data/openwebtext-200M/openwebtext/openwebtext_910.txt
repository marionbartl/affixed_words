The final of the Eurovision Song Contest saw a wide range of performances from 25 countries .
Norway 's Alexander Rybak swept to victory with a record 387 points .
The UK's Jade Ewen came a respectable fifth .
Here are some of the aspiring entries in this year 's competition , which took place in Moscow .
This piece was originally published on the Blowfish Blog .
So there ’s this trope I sometimes see in monogamous relationships .
( In particular , I see it in advice columns : it came up in a recent Savage Love column , and I ’ve seen it more than once in the Dear Abby / Ann Landers ouvre . )
It goes like this : " My partner has a friend .
The friend 's sexual orientation is towards the gender that my partner happens to be .
Is it reasonable for me to be jealous ?
Should I permit this friendship to continue ? "
( Or the reverse : " I have a friend .
The friend 's sexual orientation is towards my gender .
Is it reasonable for my partner to be jealous , and to want the friendship to end ? " )
Okay .
In trying to make this generic and gender - neutral , I ’m being a little obscure .
So let 's clear it up and make it specific : " My wife has a new friend from work , a straight man she sometimes goes to basketball games with .
Should I be jealous ? "
Or : " I 'm a straight woman who 's developing a friendship with a lesbian .
My husband is jealous .
WTF ? "
( Both real examples from real advice columns , btw .
Dear Abby stupidly advised , " By no means should you permit your wife to attend basketball games with another man " ; Dan Savage , much more wisely , suggested that the husband of the woman with the lesbian friend should get a first class ticket for the clue train . )
Now , I 'm not going to get too deeply into the obvious .
I 'm not going to get into the craziness of the idea that any and all friendships will eventually turn sexual if the sexual orientations line up right .
I 'm not going to get into the fucked - upedness of the notion that people should choose their friends entirely on the basis of gender , for the sole purpose of avoiding possible sexual attraction .
I 'm not going to get into the absurd paranoia that even the slightest hint of sexual attraction in a friendship will eventually overwhelm it with uncontrollable passion .
( Hey , for some of us , having a little attraction for a friend makes a friendship more interesting ... even when we have no plans whatsoever to act on the attraction , ever . )
And I 'm not going to point out that , according to this theory , gay men could never have gay male friends , and lesbians could never be friends with other lesbians .
I 'm not even going to get into the borderline - evil concept that people in relationships have veto power over their partners ' friends .
This is just R - O - N - G Rong , stupidly and evilly wrong , in all but the most extreme circumstances .
( " My partner is making friends with the man who tried to murder me . "
Okay , you have veto power .
Everyone else , shut up .
Your partner is a free agent , with the right to make their own damn friends independent of you . )
Here 's what I want to say instead :
So what are we bisexuals -- chopped liver ?
According to this theory , bisexuals could never , ever have any friends at all .
We could n't be friends with gay men , straight men , straight women , lesbians .
And we definitely could n't be friends with other bisexuals .
According to this theory , the fact that we 're attracted to both women and men makes us ineligible to be friends with anybody , of any gender , ever .
No , that 's not quite true .
We could be friends with non-monogamous people , and with single people .
But once those single get into monogamous relationships -- blammo .
That 's the end of that friendship .
I 'm not just writing this to point up the stupidity and irrationality of this particular form of jealousy .
I 'm writing it to point up the stupidity and irrationality of bisexual invisibility .
We used to be a culture that assumed heterosexuality .
We still are , to a great extent .
But even when we do n't assume heterosexuality , we are still , far too often , a culture that assumes monosexuality .
We are still a culture that asks , " Is he gay or straight ? "
We are still a culture that sees a woman dating a man and says , " Wait a minute -- she 's straight ?
I thought she was a lesbian ! "
( Or a woman dating a woman , vice versa . )
We are still a culture that ignores the Kinsey scale , the spectrum of sexual orientation -- and the shifts that many of us make over that spectrum throughout our lives .
And this assumption leads to some truly convoluted errors in logic .
I recently wrote about an example of this here in this blog , about how the " Is sexual orientation a choice ? " debates almost always ignore bisexuals ... since even if bisexuals are born bisexual , we still have some degree of choice about which direction to take our lives in .
And the bisexual wars in the lesbian community led to my favorite piece of Alice in Wonderland political logic ever :
" The lesbians will decide who is a lesbian . "
I can see why people tend to overlook bisexuals .
Our existence does poke holes in a lot of conventional wisdoms -- especially when it comes to sorting our society by gender and sexual orientation .
But ... well , that 's actually my point .
The existence of bisexuals pokes holes in the sorting of our society by gender and sexual orientation , pointing up ridiculous contradictions and convoluted logic that would be hilarious if it were n't so annoying .
So maybe we should quit sorting our society by gender and sexual orientation .
And maybe we should start with our friendships .
And the friendships of our spouses and partners .
Which are none of our damn business anyway .
The informant was not identified in court papers unsealed on Wednesday in Manhattan .
But according to a person briefed on the case , the informant is Shahed Hussain , the central prosecution witness in a 2004 federal sting focusing on a pizzeria owner and an imam at an Albany mosque .
Lawyers for those men argued that Mr. Hussain , who had posed as a wealthy Muslim radical , had entrapped their clients in an ultimately fictional plot to kill a Pakistani diplomat with a missile .
But a federal jury convicted the two men , and they were sentenced to 15 years in prison .
“ Any defense attorney worth his salt is going to argue entrapment , ” Raymond W. Kelly , the New York police commissioner , said Friday when asked about the use of an informant in the Newburgh case .
“ The argument will be made in court .
But in essence , the law says you have to be otherwise not disposed to do the crime to successfully use the defense of entrapment . ”
The government ’s court filings present the informant as someone who merely assisted the violent intentions of the four men .
Federal authorities have asserted that one of the defendants , James Cromitie , was angry about the war in Afghanistan and was determined to strike at America , and later at Jews .
The informant , who told the men he had connections to a Pakistani terror group , then provided the men with what they believed to be sophisticated explosives and a missile .
Asked whether he thought the four men were a serious security risk before they were approached by the informant , Joseph M. Demarest Jr. , who heads the F.B.I. ’s New York office , said : “ It was their plot and their plan that they pushed forward .
We merely facilitated .
They asked for the explosives .
They asked for the Stingers , or rockets , I think , is the way they described it .
They did leave the packages of what they believed to be real explosives , the bags , in front of two temples in the Bronx . ”
Vincent L. Briccetti , who represents Mr. Cromitie , said he was aware of Mr. Hussain ’s role in the Albany case , which was reported on Friday in The New York Post .
“ His history is of interest to us , ” Mr. Briccetti said .
Court records from the Albany case show that Mr. Hussain came to the United States from Pakistan in 1993 or 1994 .
He appears to have held a variety of jobs , and come to own a number of businesses and properties .
But in 2002 , he was charged with a scheme involving taking money to illegally help people in the Albany area get driver ’s licenses .

Migrants from new EU countries are going home again at double their previous rate , Home Office figures show
The number of foreign - born workers leaving Britain rose by nearly 30 % as the economic recession started to bite last year , according to statistics published today .
The latest official figures confirm that immigration to Britain has stalled , with the number of Polish and other east European migrants registering to work in Britain falling by 50 % in January to March this year compared with the same period in 2008 .
The number of Polish and other east European workers going home to live doubled in the 12 months to September 2008 as the British economy began to contract .
Overall , estimates from the international passenger survey published today show that net migration to Britain – the number coming to stay for more than a year minus those who are relocating abroad – has fallen from 207,000 to 147,000 over the 12 months to September 2008 , compared with the previous year .
Further evidence that the rise in immigration in recent years to Britain has stalled is provided by new national insurance numbers allocated to foreign - born workers in Britain , which are down 7 % to 720,000 over the same period .
But the latest Home Office figures show a surge of 27 % in asylum applications from those coming to Britain to flee the world 's troublespots , with Zimbabwe and Afghanistan at the top of the list .
The number of new asylum seekers coming to Britain rose by 700 to 5,145 between January and March this year , with 41 % given permission to stay on initial decision and a further 26 % on appeal .
The figures show that the continued drive to deport foreign prisoners continues to take its toll on the removal figures of failed asylum seekers and other illegal migrants .
A total of 15,840 people were removed from Britain between January and March this year .
This included 2,805 failed asylum seekers – down 7 % – and 13,035 non-asylum cases – down 5 % .
The 27 % rise in asylum applications to Britain compares with an average increase of just 2 % across the whole of the European Union .
The Office of National Statistics said the international passenger survey showed that the fall in emigration during the second half of 2007 was driven by a decline in emigration of British citizens , whereas the more recent increase in emigration was being driven predominantly by non-British citizens going home in their hundreds of thousands .
The recession is deterring new workers from leaving eastern Europe for Britain .
The number of migrants from Poland and seven other new EU members who applied under the workers ' registration scheme between January and March this year fell to 23,000 compared with 49,000 over the same period in 2008 and 52,000 in the first months of 2007 .
New figures on citizenship published today show that applications for British passports fell by 1 % last year to 156,015 , with the number being granted British citizenship down 21 % to 129,375 .
A total of 91,450 citizenship ceremonies were held in 2008 , down by 24 % on the figure for 2007 , which was the first year in which the ceremonies were held .
* Gold ATMs intended to whet appetite for physical gold
* Private investor inquiries doubling every six weeks
* Plan is for 500 gold ATMs in Germany , Switzerland , Austria
FRANKFURT , May 19 ( Reuters ) - Private investors should hold up to 15 percent of their wealth in physical gold , according to a German asset management company which plans to set up 500 “ Gold - To - Go ” ATMs in Germany , Switzerland and Austria this year .
A gold - dispensing automatic teller machine ( ATM ) was on display at Frankfurt ’s main railway station for a one - day marketing test on Tuesday .
A one - gram ( 0.0353 ounce ) piece of gold , the size of a child 's little fingernail and about as thin , cost 31 euros ( $ 42.25 ) -- a 30 percent premium to the spot market price XAU= .
The flat rectangular piece , bearing the imprint of Belgian metals and speciality materials firm Umicore UMI.BR , came out of the cash - only ATM in a tin box , including a certificate of authenticity .
“ This is more than a marketing gimmick , ” said Thomas Geissler , chief executive of TG - Gold - Super - Markt.de , the company planning to set up the 500 gold ATMs at a cost of 20,000 euros apiece .
“ It is an appetizer for a strategic investment in precious metals .
Gold is an asset everyone should have , between 5 and 15 percent of your liquid assets in physical gold , ” he told Reuters in an interview .
DEMAND
Private investor demand for gold is on the rise in Germany and elsewhere as a result of the financial markets crisis , which has made many investors wary of holding traditional assets such as equities , bonds or mutual funds investing in such securities .
“ In absolute numbers , the demand for physical gold is still tiny in Germany , ” Geissler said .
“ But in relative terms , the growth is explosive , inquiries have been doubling every six weeks , ” Geissler said of the trend in recent months .
TG - Gold - Super - Mark.de ’s main precious metals business idea is based on online commerce .
The gold ATMs to be set up at central locations such as airports , railway stations and shopping malls are intended to gradually accustom people to the idea of investing in physical gold , Geissler said .
The ATMs will dispense 1 - gram , 5 - gram and 10 - gram pieces of gold as well as Krugerrand gold coins .
Each ATM can hold up to 1,500 pieces , he said .
The company ’s internet website ( www.gold-super-mark.de), through which investors can purchase units between 1 gram and 1,000 grams , is updating precious metals prices every 10 minuntes .
The ATMs will be equipped with technology ensuring that the prices charged by the ATMs keep pace with those on the website .
TG - Gold - Super - Markt.de is a subsidiary of German online investment fund company INFOS GmbH founded in 1994 .
INFOS now manages 170 million euros worth of assets on behalf of about 5,000 customers .

Windows only : Free application Portable Ubuntu for Windows runs an entire Linux operating system as a Windows application .
As if that were n't cool enough , it 's portable , so you can carry it on your thumb drive .

Built from the same guts as the andLinux system that lets you seamlessly run Linux apps on your Windows desktop , Portable Ubuntu is a stand - alone package that runs a fairly standard ( i.e. orange - colored , GNOME - based ) version of the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution .
It just does n't bother creating its own desktop , and puts all its windows inside your Windows , er , windows .
The coolest parts about Portable Ubuntu are :
It actually works ( in most cases , on most systems ) .
It fits on a ( larger ) thumb drive and can run entirely from it .
It can work on , and save to , your Windows folders and files .
It 's persistent , so changes you make and apps you install are carried around with you .
It 's easily manageable from Windows , and works great on dual monitors .
Wanna give it a go ?
Grab the latest Portable Ubuntu package ( about 438 MB as of this writing ) , then double - click to unpack it to a folder .
On Vista or Windows 7 , you 'll have to open your command prompt as an administrator ( hit Windows key , type in cmd , then right - click on the " Command Prompt " option that appears and select " Run as Administrator " ) ; on XP , you 'll probably just have to launch a command prompt .
Head to the folder where you extracted your Portable Ubuntu , and enter run_portable_ubuntu and hit Enter to launch the .bat script .

Your machine will whir and decompress for a while , and you 'll likely get a few prompts to " Unblock " coLinux and a few other apps ' abilities on your system .
Unblock all of them , and you 'll eventually get a small , move - able menu bar on your desktop , as seen in the top screenshot .
Drag this wherever it 's comfortable to keep it , and you 're on your way .
From those three pop-out menus — Applications , Places , and System — you can accomplish pretty much the same thing as any Linux user can , just without the full desktop .
Launch a program , and it appears in a window that looks like any other on your Windows system .
Open a file browser from " Places , " and you can get to your Windows files by heading to / mnt / C ( or substitute your drive name / letter for " C " ) .
Feel free to carry around Audacity , GIMP , or any other editing programs that lack a Windows equivalent and start getting creative with them .

Whatever changes you make to your system stick with it .
So if you , say , want to install VLC media player for some on - the - go media , you can install it from the Add / Remove dialog or tackle it manually in Accessories -> Terminal , and it'll be planted right in the Sound & Video menu .
The same goes for system tweaks or startup apps you add to your little Ubuntu package .
Update :
For those who miss it over at the Portable Ubuntu page , the default root password is 123456 .

Portable Ubuntu makes for a great place to test out your more cutting - edge stuff , without having to worry about messing up your working Windows system .
The latest beta of Firefox 3.1/3.5 ?
Even easier to run than the portable solution , and you can keep both your Windows and Portable - Ubuntu - launched Firefox browsers open at once .

When you 're running Portable Ubuntu , Windows treats it like any other program .
You can close down individual app windows from your taskbar , and pop it onto and off your desktop with little hassle .
Portable Ubuntu is a free , portable download that runs from Windows systems only .

The loans are said to have led to HBOS losses of £ 250 m
A BBC News investigation has uncovered alleged lending irregularities at HBOS , the bank now owned by Lloyds .
File on 4 has heard from firms that claim they were ruined by the actions of a senior executive , and management consultants recommended by the bank .
The bank and management consultants Quayside Corporate Services have denied any wrongdoing .
The loans from HBOS 's " high risk " unit between 2002 and 2007 are said to have led to losses at the bank of £ 250 m .
The unit was based in Reading , Berkshire .
File on 4 heard from businesses alleging that a bank executive , Lynden Scourfield , required them to employ consultants Quayside Corporate Services as a condition for getting a loan .
Nikki and Paul Turner , whose music production and publishing business needed loan finance from HBOS , claimed the business suffered as a result of the involvement with Lynden Scourfield and Quayside and are currently facing eviction from their home by the bank .
Their account of events is strongly disputed by the bank and Quayside .
The Turners ' MP , James Paice , told File on 4 that HBOS 's new owners Lloyds were not taking seriously their complaints and those of other businesses .
FIND OUT MORE Listen to File on 4 archive Mr Paice said that a number of businesses ended up in more debt than before Quayside got involved .
He said : " The whole thing stinks .
" The contention that I and my colleagues have is that the bank or some of the bank 's then officials were significantly party to allowing or indeed encouraging these businesses to get into greater difficulty than they may or may not have been in the first place they flatly refuse [ to accept ] that . "
Mr Paice has secured a Commons debate next Tuesday .
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : " If half of what I hear is true this is a very , very serious matter . "
Mr Cable has called on the Financial Services Authority to investigate evidence of " very , very serious allegations " .
' Fair and responsible ' Mr Scourfield refused to comment .
David Mills , who founded Quayside , denied any wrongdoing and said : " I and Quayside Corporate Services acted as advisers to a number of banks and accounting firms to help implement commercial decisions made by our clients to try to turn around failing businesses .
" I always kept the banks fully informed of progress with the businesses .
Unfortunately , in a number of cases , companies were unable to pay off large debts incurred before Quayside Corporate Services ' involvement . "
MPs have criticised Lloyds Banking Group for not properly investigating business customers ' complaints .
No-one from the group would be interviewed but in a statement it told the BBC : " We simply cannot comment on individual circumstances .
However , we strongly believe that we have acted throughout in a fair and responsible way .
" Bank of Scotland deals in a sensitive and fair way with all of its corporate banking customers , including those experiencing difficulties .
We stand by our customers and support them closely in managing their financial difficulties . "

Introduction
My previous HTML5 Canvas tutorial provided you with insight into the numerous use cases for Canvas in web applications .
In this article we will explore how you can write your own Canvas - based painting application .
Making a web application that allows users to draw on a Canvas requires several important steps : setting up your HTML document with a Canvas context ( a < canvas > element with an id ) , setting up your script to target that Canvas context and draw inside it and adding the required mouse event handlers for user interaction and associated logic .
Once the event handlers are in place , it ’s then fairly simple to add any desired functionality .
The final painting application example looks like this :
To make it easier to follow along with the code walkthrough presented below , you can download the full code example and follow along with it as you read the article .
Getting started with the HTML
We shall begin with a minimal HTML document :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html lang= " en " > < head > < meta charset= " utf - 8 " > < title > Paint </ title > < style > # container { position : relative ; } #imageView { border : 1 px solid # 000 ; } </ style > </ head > < body > < div id= " container " > < canvas id= " imageView " width= " 400 " height= " 300 " > < p >
Unfortunately , your browser is currently unsupported by our web application .
We are sorry for the inconvenience .
Please use one of the supported browsers listed below , or draw the image you want using an offline tool .
</p> < p >
Supported browsers : < a href= " https://www.opera.com " > Opera </a > , < a href= " http://www.mozilla.com " > Firefox </a > , < a href= " http://www.apple.com/safari " > Safari </a > , and < a href= " http://www.konqueror.org " > Konqueror </a> .
</ p> </ canvas > </div > < script src= " example1.js " ></script > </ body > </html >
As you can see , we only have the bare bones of an HTML document here , with a < canvas > element contained inside .
If the browser does not support Canvas , then the fallback content will show .
We will add more markup later on , but this is all we need for now .
The fallback content you provide should be as helpful as possible .
You should not just say something like “ this web application is unsupported by your browser ” — that would be basically useless .
Tell the user what he / she can do to get your application to work ( eg use a different web browser ) , or provide alternative solutions , like a file upload input which allows the user to upload a painting created offline .
Even better would be to detect Canvas support and then serve the application as is to browsers that support it , and the upload solution to browsers that do n’t , automatically .
Naturally , the fallback content depends on the context in which the painting application appears .
Canvas interaction
Now we have the < canvas > element in place , the next step is to make the element somehow interact with the mouse .
We shall first test our interaction , and then go on to start adding in the functions we want our application to perform .
Testing the Canvas interaction
For testing purposes we shall first try to paint something under the mouse .
We can do that by attaching a mousemove event handler to the < canvas > element .
Here ’s the gist of the mousemove example script :
function init ( ) { //
Attach the mousemove event handler canvas.addEventListener(' mousemove ' , ev_mousemove , false ) ; } //
The mousemove event handler var started = false ; function ev_mousemove ( ev ) { var x , y ; //
Get the mouse position relative to the < canvas > element if ( ev.layerX || ev.layerX == 0 ) { // Firefox x = ev.layerX ; y = ev.layerY ; } else if ( ev.offsetX || ev.offsetX == 0 ) { // Opera x = ev.offsetX ; y = ev.offsetY ; } //
The event handler works like a drawing pencil which // tracks the mouse movements .
We start drawing a path made up of lines if ( ! started ) { context.beginPath( ) ; context.moveTo(x , y ) ; started = true ; } else { context.
lineTo(x , y ) ; context.stroke( ) ; } }
Try the mousemove example live .
This code turned out to be a success : we are just starting to see how dynamic and cool Canvas can be .
We use the event . layer * / offset * properties to determine the mouse position relative to the < canvas > element .
That ’s all we need to start drawing .
Implementing events
Let ’s take this script one step further .
It ’s best to have a single event handler that only determines the coordinates relative to the < canvas > element .
The implementation of each drawing tool should be split into independent functions .
Lastly , drawing tools need to interact with the user for events like mousedown and mouseup as well , not just when moving the mouse ( mousemove ) .
Therefore , multiple event listeners will be added to the script .
The updated script including events contains the following snippet :
function init ( ) { //
The pencil tool instance tool = new tool_pencil ( ) ; //
Attach the mousedown , mousemove and mouseup event listeners canvas.addEventListener(' mousedown ' , ev_canvas , false ) ; canvas.addEventListener(' mousemove ' , ev_canvas , false ) ; canvas.addEventListener(' mouseup ' , ev_canvas , false ) ; } //
This painting tool works like a drawing // pencil which tracks the mouse movements function tool_pencil ( ) { var tool = this ; this .
started = false ; //
This is called when you start holding down the mouse button //
This starts the pencil drawing this .
mousedown = function ( ev ) { context.beginPath ( ) ; context.moveTo( ev._x , ev._y ) ; tool.started = true ; } ; //
This function is called every time you move the mouse .
Obviously , it only // draws if the tool .
started state is set to true ( when you are holding down // the mouse button ) this .
mousemove = function ( ev ) { if ( tool.started ) { context.lineTo(ev._x , ev._y ) ; context.stroke( ) ; } } ; //
This is called when you release the mouse button this .
mouseup = function ( ev ) { if ( tool.started ) { tool.mousemove( ev ) ; tool.started = false ; } } ; } //
The general - purpose event handler .
This function just determines // the mouse position relative to the < canvas > element function ev_canvas ( ev ) { // Firefox if ( ev.layerX || ev.layerX == 0 ) { ev._x = ev.layerX ; ev._y = ev.layerY ; // Opera } else if ( ev.offsetX || ev.offsetX == 0 ) { ev._x = ev.offsetX ; ev._y = ev.offsetY ; } // Call the event handler of the tool var func = tool [ ev.type ] ; if ( func ) { func ( ev ) ; } }
Try the updated freehand Canvas example .
The script has been split into multiple functions .
Now the Canvas has three event listeners ( mousedown , mousemove and mouseup ) .
The ev_canvas ( ) function adds two new properties to the DOM event object , _x and _y , which simply hold the mouse coordinates relative to the canvas .
This event handler acts like a “ proxy ” by calling other functions , depending on the event type .
If the event is mousemove , then tool.mousemove( ) is called , and so on .
The event handlers associated with the active tool can use the properties added to the DOM event object .
With the above changes made , we are ready to kick things off .
The drawing pencil works fine now , with the added start and end functions .
All the pencil - related functions are grouped together in a single function object .
Currently we only have the tool_pencil object present , instanced as tool , but we can easily add more objects .
Let ’s add some more drawing tools , by adding more tool objects .
Each new tool needs to implement some of the available events .
First , a drop - down menu will be added , to allow the user to select the different drawing tools .
This is achieved by adding the following into the HTML document :
< label > Drawing tool : < select id =" dtool " > < option value = " rect " > Rectangle </option > < option value= " pencil " > Pencil</ option > </ select > </ label >
Then we update the script to handle more than just one tool :
// The active tool instance .
var tool = false ; var tool_default = ' rect ' ; function init ( ) { //
Get the tool select input var tool_select = document.getElementById(' dtool ' ) ; if ( ! tool_select ) { alert ( ' Error : failed to get the dtool element ! ' ) ; return ; } tool_select.addEventListener(' change ' , ev_tool_change , false ) ; //
Activate the default tool. if ( tools [ tool_default ] ) { tool = new tools [ tool_default ] ( ) ; tool_select.value = tool_default ; } } //
The event handler for any changes made to the tool selector function ev_tool_change ( ev ) { if ( tools[ this.value ] ) { tool = new tools [ this.value ] ( ) ; } } //
This object holds the implementation of each drawing tool var tools = {} ; //
The drawing pencil .
tools. pencil = function () { // … } ;
That should be enough .
The code above just sets up an event handler for the < select > element .
The implementation of each drawing tool is now inside a single tools object , and the tool variable just holds an instance of the active tool .
The ev_tool_change ( ) function makes sure that the tool variable is always an object instance of the tool picked by the user .
The benefit of the above code is that any tool can have its own instance logic , dependent on any factors you see fit .
You can do anything you want when the tool is activated , for example ask the user for a string , number or some other input .
Now we ’ve set up a solid groundwork for the tools and looked at the pencil implementation , let ’s now look at implementing some of the other individual tools .
Rectangle
You are now in for a surprise .
Let ’s implement the rectangle tool and then test the code .
Here ’s the updated script :
tools.rect = function ( ) { var tool = this ; this .
started = false ; this .
mousedown = function ( ev ) { tool .
started = true ; tool.x0 = ev._x ; tool.y0 = ev._y ; } ; this .
mousemove = function ( ev ) { if ( !tool.started ) { return ; } var x = Math.min( ev._x , tool.x0 ) , y = Math.min( ev._y , tool.y0 ) , w = Math.abs( ev._x - tool.x0 ) , h = Math.abs( ev._y - tool.y0 ) ; context.clearRect(0 , 0 , canvas.width , canvas.height ) ; if ( !w || !h ) { return ; } context.strokeRect(x , y , w , h ) ; } ; this .
mouseup = function ( ev ) { if ( tool.started ) { tool.mousemove( ev ) ; tool.started = false ; } } ; } ;
The implementation of the new rectangle tool should be straight - forward and thus easy to understand .
It maintains the same basic structure as the pencil tool .
The difference is that for the rectangle we store the start point , which is needed so we can then draw the rectangle for each mouse move ( live feedback ) .
Now , for the surprise : Access the above example link and try drawing two rectangles .
Notice any problem ?
Yes , that ’s right : the previous drawing is always lost because of the clearRect ( ) method call .
We cannot remove this call , because the tool becomes useless if we do so ( every rectangle resize remains on screen , before you even release the mouse button to make your selection ) .
The solution is to use a temporary canvas for live feedback operations .
The script initialization adds a new < canvas > element with the same dimensions as the original one , positioned on top .
All tools must draw on the temporary canvas .
When their drawing operation ends , the pixels they generated are then moved onto the background canvas .
Try the updated rectangle example — the rectangle tool now works fine .
Here are the script changes required .
The initialization function now looks like so :
var canvas , context , canvaso , contexto ; function init ( ) { //
Find the canvas element canvaso = document.getElementById('imageView ' ) ; if ( ! canvaso ) { alert ( ' Error : I cannot find the canvas element ! ' ) ; return ; } if ( !canvaso.getContext ) { alert ( ' Error : no canvas.getContext !') ; return ; } // Get the 2D canvas context contexto = canvaso.getContext ( ' 2d ' ) ; if ( ! contexto ) { alert ( ' Error : failed to getContext ! ' ) ; return ; } //
Add the temporary canvas var container = canvaso.parentNode ; canvas = document.createElement (' canvas ' ) ; if ( ! canvas ) { alert ( ' Error : I can not create a new < canvas > element ! ' ) ; return ; } canvas.id = ' imageTemp ' ; canvas.width = canvaso .width ; canvas.height = canvaso.height ; container.appendChild(canvas ) ; context = canvas.getContext ( ' 2d ' ) ; }
The new img_update ( ) function is as follows :
// This function draws the #imageTemp canvas on top of #imageView , // after which #imageTemp is cleared .
This function is called each time when the // user completes a drawing operation function img_update ( ) { contexto.drawImage( canvas , 0 , 0 ) ; context.clearRect(0 , 0 , canvas.width , canvas.height ) ; }
When any drawing operation is complete , the img_update ( ) function must be invoked , so that the new pixels get stored in the image .
For example , here is the minor update for the pencil tool :
//
The drawing pencil tools . pencil = function ( ) { this .
mouseup = function ( ev ) { if ( tool.started ) { tool.mousemove( ev ) ; tool.started = false ; img_update ( ) ; } } ; } ;
In the case of the rectangle and pencil tools , the drawing operation is complete once the user releases the mouse button , so we simply add the call to img_update ( ) into the mouseup event handler .
However , note that this call is dependent on each drawing tool implementation , in order to ensure the additional flexibility required by other use cases .
The last part needing a minor update is the HTML document ’s CSS :
< style > # container { position : relative ; } #imageView { border : 1 px solid # 000 ; } #imageTemp { position : absolute ; top : 1 px ; left : 1 px ; } </style >
The CSS above rules are needed to properly position the temporary < canvas > element on top of the original one .
Line
With everything in place , adding new tools becomes easier and easier .
The JavaScript implementation including the line tool looks like this :
tools .
line = function ( ) { var tool = this ; this .
started = false ; this .
mousedown = function ( ev ) { tool .
started = true ; tool.x0 = ev._x ; tool.y0 = ev._y ; } ; this .
mousemove = function ( ev ) { if ( !tool.started ) { return ; } context.clearRect(0 , 0 , canvas.width , canvas.height ) ; context.beginPath( ) ; context.moveTo(tool.x0 , tool.y0 ) ; context.lineTo(ev._x , ev._y ) ; context.stroke( ) ; context.closePath( ) ; } ; this .
mouseup = function ( ev ) { if ( tool.started ) { tool.mousemove( ev ) ; tool.started = false ; img_update ( ) ; } } ; } ;
That ’s it !
Try the line - drawing example for yourself .
The line tool is very similar to the rectangle tool .
The mousedown ( ) function stores the starting point , which is then used in mousemove ( ) for drawing the actual line .
What ’s next ?
The above should give you a fairly good understanding of what it takes to start developing an online paint application .
Besides just drawing on the Canvas you need to take into consideration other aspects as well , such as :
The current structure of the drawing tool objects is roughly events - based .
You will need events for pre-activation , post-activation and deactivation for some of your tools .
For example , an “ Insert image ” tool might ask the user for the URL , but if the user decides to cancel , your script must somehow cancel the activation of said tool .
You will certainly need more event listeners , not just the three listed in the previous point ( think of context menus , double clicks and more ) .
Adding any new event to the list is a trivial task .
You need a way to store history steps for undoing / redoing operations .
There are three approaches for this : store the entire image in memory for each step , remember each operation executed ( like a macro ) , or a hybrid between the two methods .
Each method has its own pros and cons .
The first method is faster and easier to implement , but uses too much memory , and with big images it is slow to store the image in the history .
The second method is more complex , but faster when considering just storing the macro commands for each step ; there is still a slowness associated with actually executing undo / redo however — you have to re-execute the commands in history .
The hybrid method is the most complex approach , but depending on your implementation it should be the fastest .
Keyboard shortcuts for most drawing operations are needed .
This means that the drawing tool objects need more event handlers .
I will deal with the keyboard accessibility of this application in a future article — watch this space .
Each tool should have its own set of properties and options ( colors , line thickness , and more ) .
You might want to consider combining SVG with Canvas , for more possibilities .
What makes or breaks an application is its user interface : commands , tools , keyboard shortcuts , and the general use - cases best handled by the application .
You have to make your application pleasant for daily usage as well as cool .
If you want to learn more , you can take a look at the open - source project Paint .
Web .
This tutorial is based on the code used for Paint .
Web , thus you should already have a head - start in understanding that code .
At the moment , Paint .
Web is in a permanent state of evolution , and it has already tackled some of the aspects mentioned above .

The real speech re-created by an actor

If you know your history , you know that in 1934 there was an attempted coup in the United States that was thwarted largely due to the efforts of U.S. Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler ( ret . )
Look it up .
Among other things , Butler was only one of 19 people ever awarded the Medal of Honor twice and the only person to be awarded a Marine Corps Brevet Medal and a Medal of Honor for two different actions .
After it dawned on him how his heroism and the heroism of the troops under his command had been misused , he wrote a book called " War is a Racket " which I can virtually guarantee you never heard about in school .
Butler concluded there are only two reasons to ever take up arms :
1 . To defend the country against real - not manufactured - attacks
2 . To defend the Bill of Rights
Sounds good to me .

The recently renamed SyFY network has decided to change their name once again to FUGeeks , as they felt SyFy did n't make it clear enough to the public that they hated their core audience of geeks .
Network President Dave
Howe said , " We seriously pissed off geeks with our comments about basement - dwelling , anti-social nerds , but I think that when the general public hears SyFy they 're still thinking geeks .
The new name makes it clear that we hated geeks and nerds just like the majority of society .
How else are we going to get them to come watch shows like Caprica and the new Stargate SG - 99 sitcom ? "
Geeks responded with outrage and promptly created an online petition to start a boycott of FUGeeks .
Many also vowed to download every episode of Battlestar Galactica on BitTorrent if they had n't already done so .
One commenter on the newly created FUFUGeeks.com said , " If that 's the way they want to be , I 'm going to create a sarcastic T - shirt about them . "
Demographic information shows that people describing themselves as " geeks " is on the rise , and that geeks are getting more respect than they have in the past , so the move by FUGeeks might be a mistake .
Sociologist Sarah Winkleman said , " Geeks used to rank just above dweebs , but now they 've separated themselves from the pack .
They are right under taxi drivers and telephone sanitizers now . "
Howe was n't worried by the trends in demographics .
" There are still many more non -geeks as there are geeks .
Many of these self - described geeks would n't even be considered geeks by real geeks .
I mean , just because you have a Facebook page does n't mean you 're a geek . "
Related News Top 11 Worst Jobs in Science Fiction Study Show that 68 % of Science Stories have Scientific Errors Top 11 Signs You 're Watching Too Much Battlestar Galactica Industry watchers think this might start a new trend in naming networks .
Ben Carmen of Nielsen said , " Everyone 's so pissed off with the economy that there 's anger in the air .
I would n't be surprised if FoxNews changed their name to FULibs or CNBC changed to FUJonStewart or FUPoorPeople . "
Howe said that FUGeeks narrowly beat out the two alternatives , " Testosterone " and " Nothing To Do With Science - Fiction , Really , We 're Serious About That . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Job losses in the U.S. private sector accelerated in March , more than economists ’ expectations , according to a report by ADP Employer Services on Wednesday .
Private employers cut jobs by a record 742,000 in March versus a 706,000 revised cut in February that was originally reported at 697,000 jobs , said ADP , which has been carrying out the survey since 2001 .
The big drop foreshadows a huge decline in the non-farm payroll reading in the government ’s employment report that will be released on Friday , some analysts said .
“ It ’s a terrible number .
It is almost a loss of three quarters of a million jobs which is possibly the highest we have seen so far over the length of this crisis , ” said Matt Esteve , foreign exchange trader with Tempus Consulting in Washington .
U.S. stock futures and the dollar fell after news of the bigger - than - expected job losses , while U.S. Treasury bonds regained some of their lost ground .

Both are due to appear in Surrey Provincial Court Monday .
Jackman also faces separate charges in connection to a March 8 attack against a Red Scorpians gang associate where a 27 - year - old man was hit repeatedly with a sledgehammer .
Cpl . Dave Carr said Barber 's death is connected to drugs .

Police have not linked the attack to Metro Vancouver 's ongoing gang war that has seen dozens of shootings - many fatal - since early this year .
The murder charges follow an intense one month investigation .

For the last 400 years , since Henry Hudson arrived on these shores , Manhattan has been a place where people have seen what they wanted to see , and then remade it in that image .
It ’s been a Rauschenberg canvas , built out , cut away , layered thick with new visions , with little thought to what was there before , after which the new visions are torn away themselves .
But before the towers and brownstones , before the street grid and infill , before Bloomingdale Road , before Broadway , before the farms , before the British , before the Dutch , before Henry Hudson himself , was a place called Mannahatta , island of many hills .
New research by Eric W. Sanderson , a landscape ecologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society , based at the Bronx Zoo , augmented by digital re-creations by Markley Boyer — their work is the basis of an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York opening May 20 and a new book , Mannahatta , published by Abrams next month — has opened a window onto what New York City was like before Europeans arrived .
The window has remarkable resolution — the height of the hills , the species of trees , the wandering paths of the creeks — geo - referenced to the current street grid .
Mannahatta was occupied by the Lenape — the “ real people , ” the most venerable of the Algonquin groups .
Mannahatta was , essentially , their summer place — the Hamptons to the Lenape longhouses in the Bronx and possibly points north .
It was both a hunting ground and , amazingly , a rich fishing camp , with shad , bass , sturgeon , and oysters .
Their empty shells accumulated in mountainous piles called middens .
Analysis of their cooking fires has shown that grains and legumes were secondary in their diet to seafood .
The biggest settlement was in Inwood .
The downtown community was centered on what is now Foley Square , near a large pond .
In the West Village was a fishing camp , a stream known as Minetta wandered past Washington Square Park along the course of Minetta Street , thence through Sapokanikan , now called the West Village — where tobacco was grown , according to Dutch reports — and into the Hudson at Charlton Street .
Henry Hudson ’s main imagining was of a passage to the east .
So when he anchored the Half Moon — his gaily painted , 85 - foot ship — off the island in September 1609 , he saw Manhattan in nautical terms :
It was “ very abundant in all kinds of timber suitable for ship - building , ” according to the ship ’s log .
He also made note of the Lenape ’s impressive copper tobacco pipes .
( The Lenape are said to have believed his ship to have been “ a large house of various colors . ” )
Hudson ’s crew did not manage to take the full measure of the island they had found .
But for the Lenape , the appeal of Mannahatta was in the diversity of its ecosystems .
There were more ecological communities per acre than Yellowstone , more native plant species per acre than Yosemite — 30 kinds of orchids , for instance .
There were also 230 types of birds , nearly 80 kinds of fish , plus bears , wolves , beavers , otters , and numerous others .
By contrast , there were no starlings — they were introduced to Central Park near the end of the nineteenth century — and possibly no Canadian geese .
Supporting this richness were 66 miles of streams , 21 ponds , and 300 springs , fed by water stored in the underlying sand and gravel pushed here by the glaciers that shaped Mannahatta some 14,000 years ago .
On Mannahatta , as elsewhere in the eastern forests , the Lenape modified the environment , too , by burning , to clear land for travel and , more important , to create better ecosystems for hunting — East Harlem was a meadowed , savannalike expanse created by regular burning that was likely a favored hunting ground .

An SGU listener by the name of Jenny recently sent me the following question :
When we skeptics are faced with an unexplained occurrence , we work up a list of possible explanations based on our knowledge of how the world works and then use Occam ’s Razor to prune out the most unlikely ones .
We often preemptively wield the razor by leaving off the list supernatural explanations that have been tried and debunked dozens of times .
This is a tempting time - saving measure , but it ’s also a violation of our proclaimed skeptic ’s creed of being open to ANY explanation that is supported by evidence .
I often wonder how Richard Saunders manages to stick to the creed with such good humor –I do n’t have the patience , myself .
This misuse of Occam ’s Razor is , in a way , the reciprocal of the argument from ignorance – the argument from presumed knowledge , let ’s say .
For we skeptics to state categorically that a supernatural explanation CANNOT be true is just as much a logical fallacy as for a credulous person to state that our naturalistic explanations cannot explain the phenomenon in question .
It also leaves us open to accusations of arrogance and closed - mindedness , which in this case actually have some basis .
This is a great question .
While Jenny is a skeptic who is just trying to understand skeptical philosophy , similar arguments are often used by the proponents of various supernatural explanations , and so a detailed answer is helpful on multiple fronts .
Being Open
It is certainly a virtue to be open - minded , but trouble arises in how we define “ open- minded ” .
It is often used by true - believers as an equivalent of faith , meaning that any odd belief must be accepted regardless of the logic and evidence against it .
Whereas being open - minded in the scientific sense means treating all propositions fairly , without ideological bias .
And then letting the empirical chips fall where they may – allowing science to function as a meritocracy of ideas .
In other words , we do not a - prior reject ideas , but once the evidence is in it is acceptable to reject failed notions in science .
Jenny is taking this principle but then making an unstated assumption that leads her astray .
She is assuming that if we did not “ preemptively wield the razor ” by leaving off our initial list of possible hypotheses supernatural explanations , that the resulting list would be finite .
Rather , if no filter or criteria were used in forming an initial list of hypothesis , the resulting list would be unending , limited only by our time and imagination .
One might then argue that only supernatural explanations which are already believed by some would need to go on the list , but this is just applying another criterion – popularity .
It that not being closed - minded to ideas that are not popular ?
It is not the fault of an idea that no one has yet been clever enough to think of it .
We must apply some criteria in forming our list of possible explanations .
Once this is recognized , we can then consider the appropriateness of popularity as a criterion .
History has shown it is not a very good criterion .
What scientists generally do ( and certainly within the applied science of medicine we take great pains to do ) is to form a list of hypotheses from most likely to least likely .
We then test the most likely explanations first ( although sometimes we also go after the low - hanging fruit by testing the easiest to test hypotheses first , even if they are not the most likely ) .
But “ least likely ” trails off into infinity without objective end .
So the real question is , how far down the list of prior probability are we going to go ?
That is a judgment call , but one that scientists have to make .
In practice what scientists often do is start testing hypotheses , starting with the most likely and most testable , until they find a hypothesis that is confirmed by evidence .
But then they must also confirm this hypothesis by showing that alternative explanations are not true .
But how many alternative explanations must be show to be untrue ?
As I argued above , the answer cannot be “ all of them ” because there is no limit to the number of alternate hypotheses unless we use some criteria of prior probability .
In practice the answer is “ all reasonable alternatives ” with “ reasonable ” being a judgment call .
This is not only fair , it is necessary , otherwise science would grind to a halt testing an unlimited list of alternate hypotheses to each theory .
Further , it does not exclude even the most unlikely explanation from science .
If such an alternate hypothesis turned out to be true , then the “ more likely ” hypotheses should all fail .
Once scientists have exhaustively excluded their list of reasonable hypotheses , they will go back to the drawing board to see where they went wrong or too extend their list of hypotheses further down to previously considered “ unlikely ” alternatives .
Eventually they will get to the right answer , and they will already have done the necessary work of excluding more likely hypotheses .
Supernatural Hypotheses
The second problem with Jenny ’s position is the claim that skeptics assume supernatural explanations cannot be true .
Depending upon how one defines “ supernatural ” this statement may be little more than a tautology .
But actually Jenny here is confusing philosophical naturalism with methodological naturalism .
The scientific method is dependent upon methodological naturalism – meaning that we cannot invoke the equivalent of “ magic ” as an explanation .
This is because all ideas in science must be testable – there must be a way to falsify any scientific hypothesis with evidence .
A supernatural hypothesis by definition cannot be tested because it is not contained within the laws of nature .
Therefore supernatural notions are not scientific hypotheses because they cannot be tested , and they therefore do not belong on a list of alternate hypotheses .
These are the rules of science – if you do n’t play by these rules , you are not doing science .
But “ supernatural ” does not merely mean currently unknown .
Science explores news laws and new types of explanations all the time .
Again , once we exhaust our list of possible explanations based upon current knowledge , we then need to seek new knowledge .
This is often the most difficult , and creative , part of science – coming up with entirely new ideas and then ( sometimes even harder ) figuring out a way to test these ideas .
But science is actually agnostic toward the question of whether or not there are supernatural forces at work in the universe .
Again – definitions get tricky here , because one could argue that any force at work in the universe is by definition natural .
But let ’s say that a supernatural notion would include the claim that there is an undetectable agency at work in the universe that could arbitrarily suspend the laws of nature .
Such a claim is untestable .
At best science could detect enduring anomalies – observations that forever defy scientific explanation .
But science could never confirm that a supernatural explanation were correct .
From a practical point of view we keep coming back to the primary criterion of a scientific hypothesis – it must be testable and falsifiable .
If it is , then it can go on the list of possible hypotheses .
If it is n’t , then it is not scientific and it does not go on the list .
The “ natural vs supernatural ” distinction is ultimately meaningless except for this feature .
This is methodological naturalism , and science requires it to work .
For any ideas outside of methodological naturalism , science does not hold that they are false , just unknowable to science .
Conclusion
Finally , it must be recognized that science builds upon itself .
With each new question or idea we are not starting from scratch , as if we have no prior knowledge .
It is not only practical , it is necessary , to approach questions in light of what has already been well - established .
Only when that approach fails should we consider alternate explanations – but any testable hypothesis is ultimately fair game .
Today ’s Republican Party is a comedy of incompetence and strife .
Yet beneath the hijinks lurks a struggle to define the proper relationship of the individual to society and to the state .
If we do n’t dig too deep , the fight for the soul of the conservative movement looks something like this :
In the rugged individualist corner is Fox News performance artist Glenn Beck — today ’s most spirited and surreal public defender of the American tradition of flinty self - reliance .
In the collectivist corner is heavyweight conservative columnist David Brooks , who has used his New York Times platform to wage a relentless “ scientific ” campaign against what he sees as the pernicious individualism of Goldwater conservatives like Beck and Rush Limbaugh .
“ Your rights as an American are individual rights , ” Beck reminds us .
“ I feel like I need to keep saying that word so it stays in the front of your and everybody ’s mind — individual , individual , individual ! ”
To add heft to his indignant free - associative musings , Beck turns regularly to semi-pro philosophers such as Ayn Rand Institute president Yaron Brook to decry the “ ideology of altruism and collectivism ” before his considerable television audience .
“ The problem is , this individualist description of human nature seems to be wrong , ” David Brooks contended in a column from last fall that was aimed directly at the heart of the Goldwaterite right .
“ Over the past 30 years , there has been a tide of research in many fields , all underlining one old truth — that we are intensely social creatures , deeply interconnected with one another and the idea of the lone individual rationally and willfully steering his own life course is often an illusion . ”
Brooks has even gone so far as to suggest that Western civilization may founder on the individualist “ illusion ” and that science confirms that “ the Chinese are right to put first emphasis on social contexts . ”
The GOP is at risk , Brooks says , because its emphasis on individual freedom “ is the main impediment to Republican modernization . ”
Brooks is right that we humans are , as the biologists say , “ hypersocial ” animals .
And it is true that many proponents of tough - minded individualism fail to grasp the profound importance of human sociality while falling for romantic myths of isolated genius .
But Brooks goes wrong when he leaps from the biological facts of life to the “ illusion ” of individual agency and the desirability of a more communitarian culture .
Beck and his friends from the Ayn Rand Institute do not defy science when they contend that real freedom is individual freedom .
They do not flout Darwin when they argue that life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness are best ensured by an ethos of individualism and a government limited by its deference to individual rights .
Humans are unique among animals in our capacity to transmit cultural beliefs and customs from one generation to the next .
The human mind is not a blank slate but a “ fill - in - the - blanks slate , ” outlined by nature and filled in by socialization .
Yet the fact that we are thoroughly social creatures built to learn and inhabit culture does not tell us what the content of our culture should be .
Our hands did not evolve to play the piano and our cultural capacity did not evolve to transmit ideals of individual liberty , but it is plainly fallacious to conclude that something is therefore “ wrong ” with Mozart or Madison .
Our cultural capacity is precisely what allows us to transform and transcend our mammalian limits .
So , yes , an individualist ethos is unnatural .
But so are other travesties of nature — such as equality under the law , monotheism , vaccination , and the wheel .
Like these , the American tradition of individualism is a civilizing manifestation of human sociality , not a denial of it .
And individualism works .
As Brooks himself notes , individualistic societies tend to be wealthier than collectivist ones .
And studies show that individualistic societies , which emphasize choice and personal fulfillment , tend to produce happier people than do collectivist societies , which are anchored by conformity , honor , and inherited obligations .
By almost any measure , individualism is a success .
So does Glenn Beck win this round by a knockout ?
That would be funny — but also a misreading of the Right ’s populist persuaders .
Why ?
Because the “ individualism ” of latter - day disciples of Goldwater and Reagan has a strange way of disappearing as soon as they stop arguing about marginal tax rates .
Glenn Beck is no different .
Scratch him and you ’ll find a vehement nationalist whose fiery cable gospel breathes populist life into David Brooks ’ abstract collectivist theology .
Beck ’s “ 9/12 Project , ” meant to revive the fleeting American spirit of grieving , truculent solidarity that followed the 9/11 attacks , lays out nine principles and 11 values of “ the greatest nation ever created . ”
The first principle is “ America is good . ”
What is that if not a recklessly unconditional commitment to the national collective ?
With his fourth principle —
“ The family is sacred ” — Beck simply ignores the fact that no force in human history has been more corrosive to family cohesion than the individualist ideal of self - realization that he champions .
Similarly , when it comes to the “ War on Terror , ” Beck ’s embrace of the rights of individuals against the state just peters out .
Beck ’s nonchalance about warrantless wiretaps and waterboarding betrays a peculiar notion of individual liberty .
And if you ’re an individual from another country exercising your individual right to associate freely with a willing American employer , God forbid the state should belatedly recognize your individual rights by granting you “ amnesty ” !
For too many conservatives , “ individual rights ” is code for their right to remain unburdened by whatever exercise of state power they happen to dislike .
So while Brooks and Beck may come out swinging from their respective corners , their “ fight ” ends in a loving embrace .
Here is the conservative dilemma writ small .
Egghead conservatives like Brooks offer a coherent communitarian philosophy of government , but would suppress ( in the name of science ! ) the cultural innovations that have helped produce the creativity and wealth of the West .
Meanwhile , talkers like Beck offer a politics of strong American families and an even stronger American security state no less collectivist then Brooks ’ .
The language of limited government and individual liberty is mandatory in the theater of populist American nationalism , but the populist Republicans ’ zany pastiche of jingoist tropes merely pretends to value those ideals .
In reality , it offers no real alternative to the sober collectivist vision that explicitly marginalizes them .
As the flags wave and the eagles soar , the American Right ’s commitment to individual liberty continues to crumble .
Conservatism must stand for something .
But here ’s the big question : Can a politics of individual freedom be revived ?
Can it win elections ?
David Brooks — who knows all about “ science ” and the success of the hive - minded Chinese — says it can ’t .
Beck ’s populist Republicans fume that Brooks is wrong , wrong , wrong .
But why , then , does the substance of their politics have so much in common with his ?
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
The British combat mission in Iraq has come to an end after six years in a war that The Guardian called the " most controversial military operation since the Suez crisis more than 50 years ago . "
On Thursday , British Forces handed over their airbase to a US brigade , having completed their mission to train two Iraqi Army divisions .
Almost all 4,000 British troops will leave Iraq by May 31 , with 400 British servicemen remaining in Basra 's port city of Umm Qasr to continue training Iraqi forces .
Now that the final chapter of the United Kingdom 's time in Iraq has officially come to a close , many British citizens and government officials are reflecting on their involvement in the largely unpopular war and looking warily ahead at the escalating conflict in Afghanistan .
" The road to success has been long and , at times , painful , " said Gen. Sir Richard Dannatt , the head of the Army , according to The Guardian newspaper .
" As in any operation of this nature and complexity , things did not always develop as we might have expected .
It is therefore critical that we , as an army and within defence as a whole , learn from our experiences in Iraq and implement those lessons for current and future operations . "
Despite significant security improvements in Basra , many British newspapers highlighted the fact that , rather than handing the airbase over to Iraqi forces , an American brigade slightly larger than the outgoing British forces will take over the base .
Throughout the war , the UK has struggled with public disdain for the soldiers tasked with fighting the contentious war , as happened in the US during the Vietnam War .
For soldiers preparing for a homecoming , the question of how they would be received by the public still loomed large .
" My grandmother took part in marches against the invasion .
I had my own strong doubts .
But we are soldiers ; we follow our orders and all we can do is the best we can and not abuse our power .
I think we have done some good in Basra , but I can fully understand the Iraqis not wanting foreign troops in their country , " one British officer told The Independent .
The Times of London highlighted British Defense Secretary John Hutton 's remarks , delivered at the handover ceremony , about the military 's role in helping to pacify the southern region of Iraq .
He also acknowledged what is regarded by many analysts as the British military 's biggest failing in not stopping militias from infiltrating security forces , which created chaos throughout the city .
A joint Iraqi- coalition operation helped return calm to the city last year , but Mr. Hutton said a " proper investigation " would be made into any potential missteps on behalf of the British military .
" Iraq 's progress over the six years , no matter how uneven or uncertain it may have appeared at times , shows that their sacrifice has not been in vain , " said Hutton in the Times .
Shortly after the handover and a memorial ceremony for the 179 British soldiers who died in Iraq , British politicians began calling for a full inquiry into the mistakes and faulty decisionmaking that led the UK into the war .
Among other issues , the investigation will examine inaccurate intelligence that wrongly cited the presence of weapons of mass destruction , as well as whether the military properly equipped its forces , reports the Daily Telegraph .
" After years of foot dragging , I believe it is the time for the government to announce a proper Franks - style inquiry .
Instead of starting in many months ' time , it should start right now , " said Tory leader David Cameron , according to the Telegraph , referencing the investigation by Lord Franks after the Falklands War in 1982 .
" There are vital lessons to learn and we need to learn them rapidly and the only justification for delay can , I 'm afraid , be a political one . "
While the UK grapples with whether their involvement in Iraq was necessary or misguided , an editorial in The Scotsman argues Britain 's Labour Party is likely to bear the heaviest burden as a result of the conflict .
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair , a Labour Party member , aligned with President Bush at the onset of the war and is largely blamed for dragging the nation to war .
A political cartoon in The Guardian showed already mounting concerns that the nation is shifting its focus from Iraq to Afghanistan .
The Wall Street Journal , however , reports that the UK may find it difficult to take on too great a role in Afghanistan , as its military is contracting in both size and budget .
Since 1997 , the number of personnel in the British military has been reduced by 20 percent to about 200,000 , and military spending accounts for only 2.8 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product , while it accounts for 5 percent of American GDP .
" Facing a dour economy and staggering government debt , the UK is widely expected to shrink its military power further still , despite criticism at home that the forces are so poorly funded they 're ill - equipped for the roles they 're asked to play , " reports The Wall Street Journal .
" Such cuts are sapping strength from US - backed military efforts in places like Afghanistan . "
Commissioner Roger Goodell has suspended Buffalo Bills running back Marshawn Lynch for the first three games of the 2009 season for violating the league 's personal conduct policy .
The NFL announced the suspension on Thursday .
Lynch is expected to appeal the suspension .
Lynch will lose approximately $ 112,000 of his $ 635,000 base salary for 2009 during the suspension .
Lynch was arrested near Los Angeles on Feb. 11 and later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge .
In searching a parked car carrying Lynch , Culver City police found a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun inside a backpack in the trunk .
Prosecutors said the backpack contained other items belonging to Lynch .
Police said they also found four marijuana cigarettes in the car , but no drug charges were filed .
After pleading guilty to having a concealed firearm in a vehicle , Lynch was sentenced last month to 80 hours of community service and three years ' probation .
The Bills ' 2007 first - round draft pick also issued an apology .
" I am embarrassed by my recent arrest and conviction , " Lynch said .
" I deeply regret that I placed myself in this situation . "
Lynch met with Goodell at his office in New York on March 17 .

Ian 's story of being banned from Amazon for returning too many things reminds me of a Seinfeld episode , where Kramer gets banned from Joe 's Fruit Market -- the best fruit market in town -- when he tries to return a sub par peach .
( Kramer spits out his peach )
JERRY : Bad peach ?
KRAMER : It 's terrible !
JERRY : Did you get that at Joe's ?
KRAMER : Yeah , of course I got it at Joe's .
JERRY : That 's surprising , his fruit is usually the best .
KRAMER : You know what I 'm gonna do ?
I 'm gonna return this .
JERRY : You 're returning used fruit ?
KRAMER : Jerry , this peach is sub par . [ at Joe's ]
JOE : Hey , you got a bad peach ?
That 's an act of God .
He makes the peaches .
I do n't make the peaches , I sell the peaches .
You have a problem ?
You talk to him .
KRAMER : You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt , downhill .
I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go .
JOE : Well let me put a solution for you : do your business elsewhere , I do n't want your business .
KRAMER : Oh now you do n't want my business .
JOE : No , I do n't want your business and from this moment you 're banned from the store , you 're banned !
KRAMER : But what am I gonna do for fruit ?
Because in their eyes , Ian had returned one too many Amazon products , they sent him a message ala Joe :
In the normal course of business , the occasional problem is inevitable .
The rate at which such problems have occurred on your account is extraordinary , however , and cannot continue .
Effective immediately , your Amazon.com account is closed and you are no longer able to shop in our store .
And this is not the first time Amazon has banned users .
Without an Amazon account , users like Ian can't access their Kindle books online .
The DRM infecting their local copies of those ebooks prevents them from moving the books to another device they might actually be able to use without being forced to depend on an arbitrary and temperamental owner .
Since they do n't get warning before being banned , they may not even have all of the books they have purchased in the past downloaded to their local device , and being banned means they can't access anything stored under their Amazon account .
The Kindle terms of service warn that they may arbitrarily choose to do this :
Changes to Service .
Amazon reserves the right to modify , suspend , or discontinue the Service at any time , and Amazon will not be liable to you should it exercise such right .
Termination .
Your rights under this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice from Amazon if you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement .
In case of such termination , you must cease all use of the Software and Amazon may immediately revoke your access to the Service or to Digital Content without notice to you and without refund of any fees .
Amazon 's failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights .
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said in the past , " Our vision is every book , ever printed , in any language , all available in less than 60 seconds " -- but like a fortune cookie , to understand what he really means here you need to add " exclusively controlled by us " to the end of the quote .
After extensive argument , Amazon did decide to give Ian one more chance , and restored his account , but this is nonetheless a warning of the way DRM can be used to control users .
Whether it 's right for them to be banning people for returning too many things or not , it is n't right for them to have this much control over what and how people can and can't read .
Take Action
Digg this story !
DRM is rotten and needs to go .
So , taking inspiration from Kramer and Joe , this morning we decided to send Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos some peaches , from Defective By Design .
Turns out fresh peaches of the kind Joe would be proud of are n't in season until May , so we looked for the next best thing appropriate for someone whose company throws frequent temper tantrums to try and control what other people do -- peach baby food .
We hope he gets the message that he 's swindling his customers and in the process undermining important fundamental freedoms to read and share .
Amazon seems to understand this message when it comes to music -- why do n't they get it when it comes to the Kindle ?
You can help us " impeach " Bezos by sending him some more peaches .
Do n't forget to include a gift note with it linking back to DefectiveByDesign.org , and be sure to let us know too , at info@defectivebydesign.org .
Of course , if you have a Kindle , you might want to return that too .

NEW ULM , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
A judge Tuesday ordered chemotherapy for the 13 - year - old Minnesota boy with cancer whose mother had fled with him rather than comply with a doctor 's recommendation that he undergo such treatment .
Daniel Hauser arrives at court Tuesday where a judge ordered he undergo chemotherapy .
Daniel Hauser can remain with his parents , but he will have to start the treatments Thursday at Children 's Hospital in Minneapolis , Minnesota , and his parents will have to comply with the doctor 's treatment schedule , said District Court Judge John Rodenberg , who is overseeing the case .
He said the boy 's tumor has grown since he underwent an initial course of chemotherapy in February .
Dr. Michael Richards examined the boy on Monday .
In his report , made public Tuesday , the pediatric oncologist estimated the tumor 's size at 5.3 inches by 5.1 inches by 6.3 inches , and said it was " protruding outside the chest wall .
There is further compression of the airway , making the initiation of standard chemotherapy imperative this week . "
Richards recommended six cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation .
He added that the " goal will be to include alternative therapies in which the family is interested , as long as there is not data to suggest that a particular danger exists with any alternative medicine . "
Daniel , dressed in khaki pants and a blue short - sleeve shirt , arrived at the courthouse in New Ulm for the Tuesday afternoon hearing accompanied by a law enforcement officer .
He ducked under the dashboard , apparently trying to hide from the news media , before getting out of a green minivan .
But he did not appear in the courtroom .
During the hour - long proceeding , Daniel 's mother , Colleen Hauser , sat near her husband hunched over , sobbing occasionally and daubing her eyes .
In response to questions from Rodenberg about whether she now believes that chemotherapy is the correct course of treatment for her son , she answered that she did .
Watch spokesman describe family 's emotions »
A lawyer representing the family expressed satisfaction with the hearing 's outcome .
" We 're just glad that the judge found that the parents are loving and that Danny is at home where he needs to be , " said Tom Hagen .
He added that , under the agreement , Daniel will also receive " alternative health " treatments to supplement the chemotherapy .
And he dismissed the possibility that the parents might take the boy from the state .
" They 're willing to do whatever the court says to make sure that Daniel stays at home , " he said .
Last week , Colleen Hauser fled with her son from their rural town of Sleepy Eye , Minnesota , to Southern California after a doctor said the boy 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma was worsening and recommended chemotherapy .
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system , which is part of the immune system .
As the disease progresses , it compromises a body 's ability to fight infection .
Colleen Hauser had been planning to take Daniel to Mexico for holistic treatment , but opted instead to return home , a family spokesman said .

With much fanfare this week , Congress and the Administration began a series of actions designed to protect over - leveraged consumers from the high fees imposed by credit card lenders .
As with most other initiatives devised by government , this policy will create a host of unintended consequences that will undermine the benefit the program hopes to create .
Anyone who carries a credit card knows that billing practices have become much more aggressive , punitive , and seemingly arbitrary over recent years .
Sadly , these fees have become one of the only means the companies can use to compensate for the increasing defaults on their unsecured loans .
By mandating that the credit card companies lower their fees , the government will severely hinder their tenuous profitability .
In order to avoid bankruptcy , the companies will have to deny credit to marginal borrowers , which would reverse the easy access policies that have defined the industry over the last generation .
The resulting contraction in consumer credit will run contrary to current Administration efforts to keep Americans spending .
The horns of this dilemma are completely missed in Washington .
In better times , when companies could make money from interest charged on a high - performing loan book , companies could perhaps compete on better customer service and transparency .
Unfortunately , desperate times have called for desperate measures .
And rather than seek to break their reliance on credit through harsh reductions in spending , many Americans have waded into the snake pit despite the costs .
Among other things , Congress objects to credit card issuers raising interest rates and cutting back on lines of credit for those borrowers deemed at heightened risk of default .
One practice , called universal default ,  in which card issuers take into account a cardholder ’s total liabilities , not just what is owed on a single card , has drawn particular Congressional fire .
In this system , delinquency on one account will often affect rates charged on all accounts , even those where the borrower is still current .
Also under scrutiny is the very concept of lenders raising rates on existing balances to reflect heightened risks , despite the fact that their ability to do so is spelled out in advance .
The concept is similar to adjustable rate mortgages , where borrowers initially get lower rates but face the possibility of higher rates should circumstances change .
Without the ability to raise rates , lenders will have no choice but to charge much higher rates from the start .
The bottom line is that credit card lending is a very risky business .
The debts are unsecured and the probability of default is high , meaning big losses should borrowers choose not to pay .
In addition , should a borrower file bankruptcy , credit card debt is often the first to be discharged .
Given the risks , interest rates need to be very high to keep lenders in business .
One way to keep a lid on rates for those who do pay is for lenders to weed out those most likely to default .
This can be accomplished through higher rates .
Not only does this discourage riskier borrowers from taking on more debt , but it gives lenders a bigger cushion to absorb losses .
However , by interfering with card issuers ’ attempts to better price risk and limit losses , the government will reduce credit availability .
The securitization process , infamously associated with mortgage debt , has also been utilized extensively with credit card debt and has greatly spurred the growth of consumer credit .
As a result of securitization , lenders were able to immediately offload their loans to Wall Street , which repackaged and sold them to investors around the world .
In this way , credit card issuers became more concerned with loan volume and less concerned with loan risk .
However , now that huge losses in credit card - backed bonds have reduced investor demand ( despite recent multi- billion dollar Fed purchases ) , card issuers need to hold loans on their own books .
Greater prudence is resulting .
Ironically , this is the one potential silver lining to this cloud .
By making credit card lending even riskier , this bill will actually make it harder for consumers to get credit .
Since excess consumer credit is part of the problem , restricting that credit is part of the solution .
However , while I approve of the ends , it is certainly not justified by the means .
It would be preferable to simply allow markets to function .
Higher losses among credit card lenders and higher rates for credit card users would greatly diminish both the availability and desirability of consumer credit .
Fear of loss and the absence of a secondary market to unload risk would force lenders to more judiciously extend credit .
Simultaneously , higher rates would reduce the appeal of credit card debt , causing fewer Americans to partake .
These mechanisms would begin the painful process of weaning the nation from its addiction to credit .
Ironically , this is what President Obama has said is necessary .
Of course , there is also a good chance that this silver lining will prove a mirage .
When the banks attempt to restrict credit as a result of their business concerns , the government will most likely funnel more taxpayer bailout money to banks to entice them to keep lending .
In typical government fashion , rather than letting market forces work , our government will force bad decisions on companies and then subsidize resulting losses .
Is n’t this starting to sound familiar ?

Perspectives from Ericas a result of heightened reader inquiry .
And for a greatantidote , click here and here : interviews with , Meredith Whitney and Ian Gordon .
Hat tip Edwin and
I 've been writing Linux guidebooks for some time , and it's fair to say that most people who buy my books are Windows users looking to make the leap to Linux ( or perhaps just wondering what the fuss is about ) .
Because of this , I 've heard a lot of excuses why people quit Linux and return to Windows .
I 'm happy to say that the excuses are getting far less common nowadays , compared to 2003 , when I wrote my first book .
But I still hear 'em .
Here are the top seven reasons I 've come across .
No doubt you 've heard them too .
1. Linux does n't run a program I use .
In this particular argument , people typically point out that Linux does n't run one of the main Adobe products , such as Photoshop or Dreamweaver .
They then point out that there 's no swap - in replacement in the world of open - source .
This is true .
I can't argue .
The problem is that they 're using specialized industrial tools .
Most people neither know nor care what Dreamweaver is .
It might seem otherwise in the circles in which that person moves , but out here in the real world , it just ai n't the case .
Much of the work that 's gone into desktop Linux in recent times has been to make it better for the ordinary individual .
Linux now has a top - notch browser and office suite , for example .
But , so far , nobody has got around to re-creating specialist toolsets such as high - level Web design software .
The solution is simple :
If you need to use a particular industrial tool for your work , then you should keep using it .
That means you 'll have to keep using Windows .
It 's no big deal .
2. I installed Linux , but some element of my hardware did n't work !
That 's incredible because I installed Windows the other day and had the exact same experience !
My graphics card did n't work , and Wi-Fi did n't either .
Might this just be the way PCs are ?
But do you know what I did ?
I fixed everything .
Maybe I 'm lucky to be clever enough to do so , but if I was n't , I could easily ask around for solutions .
I know there are smart people out there who are willing to help .
If you do this , you might have to do some hard work , and step into unfamiliar territory .
But there are lots of instructions out there on the Web , and it only has to be done once .
Plus , as you work through the solution , you 'll be learning stuff about your new operating system .
Treat it as an opportunity , rather than an ordeal .
Some people expand this complaint to point out that Linux can sap their precious time as they work through getting it set up the way they like .
Again , this is as true of Linux as it is of Windows .
It 's just the way PCs are .
3 . I tried Linux , but I had to type commands !
OMG !!!
Really ?
But seriously .
So what ?
Are you scared of the keyboard ?
This is usually related to point # 2 above , and it 's usually a one - time maneuver designed to get something working .
For example , to get DVD playback on Ubuntu , you have to type a certain command after downloading software .
Once done , however , DVDs will play back automatically forever and ever .
If you had to do this every time you wanted to play a DVD , then you might have a point .
But typing a few strange words wo n't kill you .
There are also those who take a haughty position and project their fear onto others : “ I had to type commands !
Ergo Linux just is n't ready for the ordinary person ! ”
Here , the individual concerned seems to be implying that the “ ordinary user ” ( whoever that might be ) suffers from an intelligence deficit and is incapable of typing commands .
It that really true ?
Why do we always assume that other people can't possibly be as smart as we are ?
4. I did * this* , and * this * happened .
That does n't happen with Windows !
Again , so what ?
Nobody said Linux was a clone of Windows .
Things are going to be different now you 're using Linux .
Not necessarily better , not necessarily worse .
Just different .
You 're over the rainbow , Dorothy !
Rather than griping about your troubles , why do n't you get used to it ?
If you 're unable to adapt , it says more about you than it does about Linux .
5 . I posted a message on a forum , but Linux people were mean to me .
It 's true that some community members are n't paragons of virtue and honor .
These kinds of people are found in all walks of life , however , and are best avoided .
You can't blame Linux for their existence .
But in most examples of this complaint , the individual concerned brought wrath on themselves in one of several ways :
a) By being aggressive and / or unfriendly in their posting , or in their replies to other people .
Yeah , you might be frustrated that you can't get Linux to work how you want , but try and keep that temper in check ;
b) By not doing basic homework before asking for help , such as searching the forum for a particular issue that may be extremely common .
There 's only so many times community members can answer the same query before getting annoyed ;
c ) By simply not respecting Linux and its culture .
Switching operating systems is like switching support for a sports team .
When chatting with fellow fans , you can't keep mentioning how good you think the other team is , or how you think their techniques are better .
In fact , even making reference to the other team might stretch your fellow fans ' patience to breaking point .
6 . I just do n't like it .
It would be marvellous if people were honest enough to state this as bluntly as I 've listed it above .
After all , Linux is n't for everybody .
But what people with this complaint always do is make a spurious argument about usability -- that wonderfully nebulous term that means different things to different people .
“ Linux just is n't as usable as Windows or OS X , ” they 'll say .
When asked to back up their complaint with evidence , they do n't bother to reply .
What they 're really saying , of course , is that Linux was unfamiliar and spooked them so much that they ran back to Windows .
Again , this is reasonable .
It 's their choice .
But they should n't pretend they 're making an objective evaluation .
It 's just an opinion .
7 . I installed Linux and things went honey - nut - loops crazy .
Typically the person with this complaint will say something like , “ I installed Linux and the installer program crashed half way through .
I tried to boot but nothing happened and I found myself at a command prompt .
I eventually got the desktop running but none of the programs worked correctly . ”
This might also be known as the “ shaggy - dog story , ” because it 's usually a long and rather pointless tale of things going wrong .
( Ironically , their attempts to fix things usually makes the situation worse .
But I digress . )
Most times
I 've no idea what the cause of the problems are , and the individual concerned has my sympathy .
But I do know that what they describe is probably a one - time event , and definitely not indicative of what most people experience .
As with point # 6 above , it 's not really fair to make an objective argument out of it , because -- effectively - - it 's little more than one person 's bad luck .
If it happens to you , just pick yourself up , dust yourself off , and try again .

SANTA CLARA , Calif . 
Intel has worked hard and spent a lot of money over the years to shape its image :
It is the company that celebrates its quest to make computer chips ever smaller , faster and cheaper with a quick five - note jingle at the end of its commercials .
But as Intel tries to expand beyond the personal computer chip business , it is changing in subtle ways .
For the first time , its long unheralded software developers , more than 3,000 of them , have stolen some of the spotlight from its hardware engineers .
These programmers find themselves at the center of Intel ’s forays into areas like mobile phones and video games .
The most attention - grabbing element of Intel ’s software push is a version of the open - source Linux operating system called Moblin .
It represents a direct assault on the Windows franchise of Microsoft , Intel ’s longtime partner .
“ This is a very determined , risky effort on Intel ’s part , ” said Mark Shuttleworth , the chief executive of Canonical , which makes another version of Linux called Ubuntu .
It seems it 's legal for a EU nation to ban such things :
( German Agriculture Minister )
Aigner is taking advantage of a clause in EU law which allows individual countries to impose such bans .
And , in fact , this same GM Franken - seed has already been banned in Austria , Hungary , Greece , France and Luxembourg .
So how in the world would Germany lose a fight with Monsanto on this subject ?
The ban could prove costly for the German government .
Experts in Aigner 's ministry recently told SPIEGEL that it will be hard to prove conclusively that MON 810 damages the environment , which could enable Monsanto to win a court case opposing the ban and potentially expose the government to € 6 - 7 million ( $ 7.9 - 9.2 million ) in damages .
Monsanto said Tuesday that it would look into the question of whether it would take legal proceedings as quickly as possible .
Andreas Thierfelder , spokesman for Monsanto Germany , said the matter was very urgent as the planting season was just about to start .
Again , let me get this straight .
A nation has to prove to a corporation that its product damages the environment , otherwise it can't ban it ?
Are n't nations supposed to be more powerful than corporations ?
And this is n't just any innocent little company we 're talking about , this is Monsanto .
What I am about to link to is one of the most depressing stories you 'll ever read .
It 's about farmer suicides in India , thousands of them , caused by Monsanto 's marketing of GM seeds to Indian farmers .
The GM genocide : Thousands of Indian farmers are committing suicide after using genetically modified crops
Shankara ( a farmer who committed suicide ) , like millions of other Indian farmers , had been promised previously unheard of harvests and income if he switched from farming with traditional seeds to planting GM seeds instead .
Beguiled by the promise of future riches , he borrowed money in order to buy the GM seeds .
But when the harvests failed , he was left with spiralling debts - and no income .
So Shankara became one of an estimated 125,000 farmers to take their own life as a result of the ruthless drive to use India as a testing ground for genetically modified crops .
The crisis , branded the ' GM Genocide ' by campaigners , was highlighted recently when Prince Charles claimed that the issue of GM had become a ' global moral question ' - and the time had come to end its unstoppable march .
Speaking by video link to a conference in the Indian capital , Delhi , he infuriated bio - tech leaders and some politicians by condemning ' the truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in India , stemming ... from the failure of many GM crop varieties ' .
Gosh , so the truth about this " infuriated " the suits at Monsanto .
Gee , what a shame , we sure would n't want to upset those fat fuckers , now , would we ?
I 've seen Monsanto apologists come out of the woodwork here on Dailykos .
Strange , I know .
But they always say " hey , nobody 's forcing these farmers to plant this stuff . "
Well , not so fast :
Village after village , families told how they had fallen into debt after being persuaded to buy GM seeds instead of traditional cotton seeds .
The price difference is staggering : £ 10 for 100 grams of GM seed , compared with less than £ 10 for 1,000 times more traditional seeds .
But GM salesmen and government officials had promised farmers that these were ' magic seeds ' - with better crops that would be free from parasites and insects .
Indeed , in a bid to promote the uptake of GM seeds , traditional varieties were banned from many government seed banks .
Gee , I wonder how they pulled THAT one off .
A few " campaign contributions " , Indian style , probably greased the skids for that , do n't you think ?
Far from being ' magic seeds ' , GM pest - proof ' breeds ' of cotton have been devastated by bollworms , a voracious parasite .
Nor were the farmers told that these seeds require double the amount of water .
This has proved a matter of life and death .
With rains failing for the past two years , many GM crops have simply withered and died , leaving the farmers with crippling debts and no means of paying them off .
That brings us to the latest story , which is what inspired me to write this tonight , a story that came out today :
1,500 farmers commit mass suicide in India
Over 1,500 farmers in an Indian state committed suicide after being driven to debt by crop failure , it was reported today .
The agricultural state of Chattisgarh was hit by falling water levels .
" The water level has gone down below 250 feet here .
It used to be at 40 feet a few years ago , " Shatrughan Sahu , a villager in one of the districts , told Down To Earth magazine .
I 'm sure there 's no connection between the crops failing due to a water shortage , and GM crops being planted that require twice as much water as the traditional varieties .
This latest tragedy has also been driven by other " positive economic development " in India , such as a lack of planning when building dams :
Bharatendu Prakash , from the Organic Farming Association of India , told the Press Association : " Farmers ' suicides are increasing due to a vicious circle created by money lenders .
They lure farmers to take money but when the crops fail , they are left with no option other than death . "
Mr Prakash added that the government ought to take up the cause of the poor farmers just as they fight for a strong economy .
" Development should be for all .
The government blames us for being against development .
Forest area is depleting and dams are constructed without proper planning .
Oh hell , farmers .
Who needs 'em ?
So what can we do ?
Well considering Monsanto is possibly more powerful than Germany , probably not that much .
But I did find this , at The Organic Consumer 's Association :
Millions Against Monsanto Campaign
This one link has an enormous treasure trove of info on Monsanto 's dirty work , and action items we can take .
They 're really on top of it , and I highly recommend you go there .
And make sure you get on their mailing list , for their regular newsletter .
It 's full of great information that you can actually use .
Somehow , the world has to stand up to Monsanto .
UPDATE : Well , as I predicted , Monsanto apologists are popping up all over here .
So here 's some more information that many people might not be aware of :
After we invaded Iraq , we forced laws upon the Iraqis regarding the use of " patented " seeds from Monsanto .
Ironic considering that the Tigris and Euphrates are considered the cradle of civilization , a place where agriculture got its start ( at least mythically ) .
But no , it 's all been co-opted now by Big American Corporations :
Iraq 's new patent law : A declaration of war against farmers
For generations , small farmers in Iraq operated in an essentially unregulated , informal seed supply system .
Farm - saved seed and the free innovation with and exchange of planting materials among farming communities has long been the basis of agricultural practice .
This is now history .
The CPA has made it illegal for Iraqi farmers to re-use seeds harvested from new varieties registered under the law .
Iraqis may continue to use and save from their traditional seed stocks or what ’s left of them after the years of war and drought , but that is the not the agenda for reconstruction embedded in the ruling .
The purpose of the law is to facilitate the establishment of a new seed market in Iraq , where transnational corporations can sell their seeds – genetically modified or not , which farmers would have to purchase afresh every single cropping season .
While historically the Iraqi constitution prohibited private ownership of biological resources , the new US - imposed patent law introduces a system of monopoly rights over seeds .
Inserted into Iraq 's previous patent law is a whole new chapter on Plant Variety Protection ( PVP ) that provides for the " protection of new varieties of plants . "
PVP is an intellectual property right ( IPR ) or a kind of patent for plant varieties which gives an exclusive monopoly right on planting material to a plant breeder who claims to have discovered or developed a new variety .
So the " protection " in PVP has nothing to do with conservation , but refers to safeguarding of the commercial interests of private breeders ( usually large corporations ) claiming to have created the new plants .
Sure , this is just the " free market " at work .
Not .
And as obiterdictum points out in a comment , Monsanto is heavily entwined with the Obama administration as well :
In deciding to rescue A.I.G. , the government worried that if it did not bail out the company , its collapse could lead to a cascading chain reaction of losses , jeopardizing the stability of the worldwide financial system .
The list released by A.I.G. on Sunday , detailing payments made between September and December of last year , could bolster that justification by illustrating the breadth of losses that might have occurred had A.I.G. been allowed to fail .
Some of the companies , like Goldman Sachs and Société Générale , had exposure mainly through A.I.G. ’s derivatives program .
Others , though , like Barclays and Citigroup , stood to lose mainly because they were customers of A.I.G. ’s securities - lending program , which does not involve derivatives .
But taxpayers may have a hard time accepting that so many marquee financial companies  including some American banks that received separate government help and others based overseas  benefiting from government money .
The outrage that has been aimed at A.I.G. could complicate the Obama administration ’s ability to persuade Congress to authorize future bailouts .
Patience with the company ’s silence began to run out this month after it disclosed the largest loss in United States history and had to get a new round of government support .
Members of Congress demanded in two hearings to know who was benefiting from the bailout and threatened to vote against future bailouts for anybody if they did not get the information .
“ A.I.G. ’s trading partners were not innocent victims here , ” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd , the Connecticut Democrat who presided over one recent hearing .
“ They were sophisticated investors who took enormous , irresponsible risks . ”
The anger peaked over the weekend when correspondence surfaced showing that A.I.G. was on the brink of paying rich bonuses to executives who had dealt in the derivative contracts at the center of A.I.G. ’s troubles .

As expected , the graphics for this game is lame because it ’s on a Wii .
But , Wii is n’t knownfor thier “ cutting edge ” HD graphics .
Hopefully the game play will be fun .
Below is a table of Texas Holdem starting hands , ordered by their Expected Value ( EV ) in a 10 player holdem game .
These statistics were produced by using millions of hand histories to compute the following results .
The below chart is very interesting because you can see the EV change as your position changes along the table .
You ’ll also notice how some hands become profitable once you have a favorable position .

The senior diplomat who withdrew as one of Barack Obama 's top intelligence officials in a row over Israel has stepped up his attack on those he says are stifling debate in the United States , adding that he was " deeply insulted " to be accused of antisemitism for criticising what he described as " the Israel lobby " .
Chas Freeman , a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia , told CNN that organisations representing the right wing of Israeli politics had " a hammer lock on both public discussion and policy " , and that their campaign to force his withdrawal as the chair of Obama 's national intelligence council had been intended to " reinforce the taboo against any critical discussion of Israeli policies " .
Freeman also reiterated his view that American policy on Israel had contributed to the 9/11 terrorist attacks , part of a litany that prompted several members of Congress to speak out against his appointment .
The US was " paying a price " for its Middle Eastern policies , he said , " because our actions have catalysed - perhaps not caused , but catalysed - a radicalisation of Arab and Muslim politics that facilitates the activities of terrorists with global reach , like those who struck us on 9/11 . "
His opponents " should probably be called the Likud lobby " rather than the Israel lobby , he added .
" The atmosphere is such in this country now that , whereas Israelis in Israel routinely criticise Israeli policies that they think may prove to be suicidal for their country , those who criticise the same policies here , for the same reasons , are subject to political reprisal . "
Freeman 's Washington critics , including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Zionist Organisation of America , have pointed to the fact that he served as president of a thinktank part - funded by the Saudi government , and on the advisory board of a Chinese - owned oil firm .
" If you 're going to be an intelligence man , you can't have a financial conflict of interest with countries that are critical to your evaluation of intelligence data , " Morton Klein , president of the ZOA , said .
Klein rejected the notion that American debate on Arab - Israeli policy was artificially narrow .
" Many people are talking about the establishment of a Palestinian state , and Obama just increased aid to the Palestinian Authority from $ 700 m under Bush to $ 900 m now .
What 's narrow is that nobody talks about how the PA obligated themselves at Oslo to get rid of incitement to hatred and murder . "
Freeman has also been attacked for his alleged support of China in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
In his CNN interview , he insisted that a much - quoted email list posting had been edited to obscure the fact that he was characterising " the dominant view of the Chinese leadership " , not his own .
Answering charges of antisemitism , Freeman said : " There 's a very large number of American Jews who have written to me to express their gratitude for me raising the issues I have ...
The last thing on earth I am is antisemitic . "

The Department of Homeland Security is dismantling a next - generation biological attack warning system in New York City subways because of technical problems , U.S. officials said .
Robert Hooks , a deputy assistant secretary , said the department no longer believes it is necessary to expand the pilot program , as he told Congress in July , because of resource and technology limits .
Hooks said a long - planned alternative sensor system , set for initial deployment late next year , also will not be available nationwide until 2012 , to allow for more testing .
Times are tough — apparently so tough that some associates at Office Depot are willing to turn notebook customers away if they are n't spending enough on extras .
According to several LAPTOP readers , including a current Office Depot employee we interviewed , the retailer 's sales staff are under such intense pressure to sell such " attachments " as Product Protection Plans and Tech Depot Services , that many will tell customers who turn down these services that the computer they asked for is not in stock , even when it 's sitting right in the stock room .
We first became aware of this problem a few weeks ago , when we went to our local Office Depot , looking for a Gateway LT1004U netbook .
We were surprised by how aggressively the sales associate tried to convince us not to buy the system and then , when we said we still wanted it , how aggressively he tried to convince us to buy its corresponding tech services .
When we posted about our experience on the LAPTOP blog , some surprising comments starting coming in from several different readers claiming to work for Office Depot .
Readers Raise the Alarm " Not only do [ we ] sales people depend on the extra cash we earn from add - ons , if we do not sell them and make a quota , we get the shaft from our bosses and their bosses and their bosses , " reader Chris H. wrote .
A reader going by the moniker Office Depot Employee was more direct .
This commenter wrote , " At store level , OD puts too much pressure on sales consultants and managers to sell the PPPs ( Product Protection Plans ) & TDS ( Tech Depot Services ) .
I know of several stores in my market that will ' feel out ' the customer to see if they are the type to purchase these services .
If the customer lets on that they only want the computer and no services ... then that store simply claims to be out of stock !
We are required to sell 30 % + on both of these services or we get PIP ’d ( Performance Improvement Process ) ( or Written up ) and get ultimately fired . "
Another reader using the alias OD tech sales Manager wrote , " Unfortunately , what you all have been commenting is very close to the truth of the matter .
But not all Office Depots practice this unethical decision making ...
I do n’t hesitate from selling my laptops even though they deny wanting these services .
Why ?
Because like you said before .
( sic ) the quota is 30 % so I can lose out on 7 laptops but get 3 and be okay still . "
Current Salesperson Spills the Beans
While e-mails sent to these first three commenters went unreplied , we were able to make contact with a fourth reader named Rich ( last name withheld ) , who was willing to talk to us and even provided us with a pay stub to prove that he currently works at an Office Depot .
In an extensive phone and e-mail interview , Rich said that he was always honest with customers but had been instructed to lie about notebook stock both by one of his four store managers and by a district manager .
" I have witnessed lying about the availability of a notebook , and have been told to do so myself , " Rich told us . " Once I was talking to the customer and , while I am actually speaking , my manager comes on the radio and tells me to say it is out of stock if they are n't getting anything with it .
I always ignore him and sell it anyway because lying to the customer is flat - out wrong . "
Sales Quotas for Associates , Percentages for Managers
Rich told us that although lying about notebook stock is not official Office Depot policy , the chain 's tough quotas lead many managers and sales associates to game the system any way they can .
Rich said that store managers are held to a strict minimum " attachment rating , " which is determined through a complex formula that weighs the value of " attachments " — services such as warranties and service plans or accessories like printer cables — against the number of tech products sold .
If a store 's attachment rating falls below 30 percent , the manager could face disciplinary action from higher - ups .
Sales associates like Rich , however , are not held to a percentage , but to a weekly dollar amount .
Rich said his current dollar amount is $ 200 , and if he does n't hit that number , he faces warnings , and then termination in short order .
" Basically they drill it in your head that if you do n't sell PPPs , you 're gonna get fired .
It 's gotten so bad to the point where the managers are starting to find loopholes in the system .
They would rather sell one laptop with a PPP than ten laptops with nothing .
They do n't care , " he said .
Tough Weekly Goals Determine Commissions
In addition to the stick of losing their jobs , Office Depot sales associates have the carrot of commissions for themselves and all of their co-workers if the store reaches or exceeds its attachment sales numbers .
According to Rich , each store has its own daily sales goal for PPPs ( $ 200 for Rich 's store ; as much as $ 450 for others he knows ) .
The daily goals are determined by a number of factors , including that store 's previous performance .
At the end of each week , the commission rate for all of the store 's sales associates is determined based on where the total amount of PPP sales stands in relation to the store 's goals for that week .
If the store achieved more than 120 % or more of its goal , all associates get 15 % commission for the previous week 's sales .
If the store achieved 100 to 120 % , they get 10 % commission .
Eighty to 99 percent nets a 5 % commission for associates , while falling below 80 % of the goal means that associates get no commission at all , no matter how much they sold as individuals .
" One PPP could make or break how the entire store gets paid for commission that week , " he said .
" That 's why they put such an emphasis on it . "
According to Rich , the price of a PPP ranges from $ 100 on the low end to as much as $ 495 for a multiyear plan on an expensive notebook .
Rich told us that Office Depot typically charges $ 125 for extended protection on a $ 300 netbook .
Tech Depot Services vary widely in price .
A local Office Depot associate tried to sell us software installation on an optical - driveless netbook for $ 30 per program , but Rich told us the most common services for notebooks are trialware removal , " optimization , " and a year of McAfee Anti-Virus .
All three services combined cost $ 99 , though trialware removal alone starts at $ 29 .
The Tech Depot Services are an especially vibrant profit center for Office Depot , with little cost and effort involved .
According to Rich , some services are performed by remote workers who do little more than push a few buttons to install software .
" The software installation the associates do .
We will install everything , " Rich said .
" The service where we install McAfee and get rid of all the trialware — the way it works is that we hook it up to our tech bench and a remote person will take over the computer and then they 'll basically run a little uninstall wizard that does everything for them .
They 're basically just clicking a few buttons and it just does it . "
Why Associates Lie Rich also told us that there is no commission at all just for selling a notebook without any attachments .
So there 's no financial incentive for salespeople to help customers who do n't want protection plans or tech services .
Considering that the manager is held to a minimum attachment rating , but the associates are only held to a total dollar amount , we wondered why the associates would lie to customers and tell them a notebook was out of stock when it neither harms nor helps their individual stats .
Rich explained that sales associates are both concerned about the store 's attachment rating and about losing the opportunity to sell each an individual laptop to a PPP or TDS - buying customer .
" Ideally , they want every single laptop to go out with a warranty , so if you sell one , that 's one opportunity that 's gone , " Rich said .
" They figure if they do n't sell it , someone else will come in and get it , especially if it's a laptop that 's in the ad that a lot of people are going to come in . . .
They figure they 're going to sell it eventually .
You might as well do it to someone that 's going to get something with it . "
Rich said that a typical Office Depot has at most one or two of each regular - priced notebook in stock at any given time , with a maximum of 5 units for sale circular items .
He told us that employees are n't too concerned about running out of stock , because a truck comes with new supplies at least three times a week , more frequently during peak sales times such as back - to - school .
The Scope of the Problem Without doing a comprehensive survey of dozens or hundreds of Office Depot employees , it 's difficult to tell just how widespread the problem of lying sales associates has become .
We know from our reader comments that the problem is not limited to Rich 's store alone , but we hear from Rich that not every associate lies and not every manager encourages their sales people to lie .
" As far as not - selling , I 've heard about it from other stores .
The original one [ store ] that I worked at , it was n't really too bad .
They only time they told me not to sell something to someone was a customer who came in once a week and bought a computer and then returned it two days later .
Other than that , that store was pretty good , " Rich recounted .
" This one [ the manager at his current store ] , his thing is to really get the warranty , to get as much as possible .
He 's told me repeatedly to not sell a computer if you 're not getting anything with it . "
According to Rich , the district manager once visited his store and told all the associates to lie .
" We did get told by the district manager one time to talk to the customer , figure out what they want , do your normal sales routine , and figure out what they 're going to get , " he said .
" Offer them the PPP .
Offer them the TDS and then , if they 're going to get it , go check to see if we have it in stock and , if we do , bring it out to them .
If they 're not going to get anything with it , just go check to see if we have it and then come back and say 'oh , we 're out of stock on it .
' "
We tried more than once to investigate this very claim by visiting a local Office Depot branch here in Manhattan , but were told that the laptop we wanted was in stock when we sent a LAPTOP staff writer undercover to purchase a notebook without any PPP or TDS plans .
So either our local Office Depot is an honest branch or we got an honest sales associate .
Office Depot 's Response
We contacted Office Depot corporate and shared some of the things Rich had told us , along with our other reader 's comments .
Their response in its entirety is as follows :
We certainly appreciate your bringing this situation to our attention .
Our objective is to sell merchandise and to offer and recommend solutions to our customers , without regard to whether a customer purchases or does not purchase a service warranty or a software package .
Office Depot has been recognized with numerous awards for our commitment to customer service , so please know that we take this issue very seriously and will take the necessary steps to ensure that we continue to enhance the customer experience and promote quality in our customer - related processes .
With respect to your inquiry , we intend to look into the situation further , as part of our continuing commitment to ensuring customer satisfaction and consistent selling practices .
Update : Office Depot has issued a more detailed response .
How to Get What You Want
So what do you do if you want to buy a notebook at Office Depot , but you do n't want a protection plan or Tech Depot Services ?
You have a few options :
Be honest with the sales associate in telling them you do n't want the services and hope that they are being honest with you about the stock .
There 's a good chance they are .
Lie to the sales associate , tell them you want an extended warranty , and then pretend to change your mind after he brings your notebook out of the back room .
Use the store 's own inventory computer to check stock .
Rich says that there are computers throughout the store that associates use that are also meant for customer use .
If you grab the merchandise ticket for the notebook you want and enter its 6 - digit SKU number into the item lookup box on the inventory computer , a screen will appear that shows whether the notebook is in stock .
If the number of items in stock is either 1 or 0 , it 's out of stock because item # 1 is the floor model .
Of course , it 's always possible a sales associate could still lie to you and tell you the remaining notebooks are on hold for another customer or that the computer is wrong .
Follow Up
We 're continuing to follow this story .
If you have worked at any retail chain ( not just Office Depot ) and witnessed someone lying , lied yourself , or were advised to lie about what 's in stock , please drop us a line at tips@laptopmag.com .
The idea of hardware accelerated physics has been around for a long time and PhysX on NVIDIA GPUs has had some time to mature .
There are more games coming out with support for hardware PhysX and not all of them have completely sucked .
So we want to get a better picture of the impact of PhysX on our readers .
Is this a thing that matters to you ?
Before we get to the questions , last week saw the announcement of several upcoming titles that will support PhysX :
Terminator Salvation
Dark Void
Darkest of Days
U - Wars
Until we actually play the games , we wo n't know whether the PhysX implementation is any good though .
Many of the ideas like debris , fog , smoke , contrails , destructable environments and weapons / fighting effects have seen light in other titles only to fall short of the expectation .
But at least Mirror 's Edge was able to take some of the same things and package them in a professional and appealing way .
There are more games still that will have support for PhysX in the near future , but other titles we 've seen that touted their PhysX support ( like Cryostasis ) have fallen short of expectations .
We certainly see a future in hardware accelerated physics , but , in the eyes of our readers , is physics hardware really " here " with NVIDIA and PhysX , or will OpenCL be the vehicle to usher in a new era in game physics ?
To get a better idea of the landscape , we 'll be asking two questions about PhysX software and hardware .
For the software question , it would be helpful if those who do not have PhysX hardware could answer the question as if they did .
We can't limit respondents to NVIDIA hardware owners , but we would like to keep things as fair as possible .

The rumors were true .
Canon has crammed the $ 1500 50D 's sensor and 5D - Mark - II - like 1080 p video capture into an $ 899 entry - level Rebel .
We ran it through its paces for a few hours , and it 's awesome .

So what we have here is almost the exact sensor from the 50D — a 15.1 megapixel CMOS with sensitivities up to ISO 12,800 at its top - end H2 boost setting .
And almost the exact same HD capture from the 5D Mark II — the only change is that 1080 p video is captured at 20 fps , down from the 5D Mark II 's 30 fps .
You can step down to 720 p video at 30 fps , though , for the same buttery smoothness we 've seen on the 5D Mark II .
Other aspects of the video capture mode have actually been improved over the 5D Mark II , which we 'll get to in a second .

But as far as the specs go , it 's almost a pure hybrid of the 50D and 5D Mark II , two cameras that are decidedly more pro-leaning , positioned into the top-end of their entry - level Rebels ( above the XS and XSi ) .

We had a few hours to shoot photos and video with a pre-production unit of the EOS Rebel T1i in Manhattan , and here 's our impressions :
Image Quality
I 've never shot with the 50D , but from what I 've read , the 50D 's sensor is about as big as Canon can and should push an APS - C sensor , megapixels wise , while still preserving image quality and high - ISO performance .
When it came out just seven months or so ago , it was found to be a good performer but not significantly better than the 10 - megapixel 40 D at high - ISO .

Here , you 're getting effectively the same sensor ( Canon says there are a few minor differences that should n't effect output in any significant way ) for almost half the cost .
So while you still wo n't be on the noise - busting level of the full - frame 5D Mark II , you 're going to come mighty close , especially at 1600 and below .
Here 's a quick unscientific comparision @ ISO 6400 :

And , shots moving through the full ISO range of the T1i , starting at ISO 12,800 ( H2 ) and moving on down to ISO 400 :

Video Capture Mode
And here 's where things get crazy — the T1i's video capture mode is almost exactly the same as the 5D Mark II , short of 10 extra frames per second at 1080 p made possible by the 5D 's beefier processing power .
But still , shooting at 720 p will serve most people just fine ( and it 's as high as you can go on Nikon 's D90 , keep in mind ) .
You do notice the lower framerate at 1080 p , especially if you 're panning a shot , but for slow - moving subjects , it 's not significantly jerky .
Some people may even prefer the ability to switch - up frame rates .

But aside from that , everything else from the 5D Mark II is there : the ability to capture stills while video is rolling , the same slow AF system , etc .
In fact , the T1i actually makes some improvements over the Mark II — a quick menu summoned via the SET button can change resolution and video settings easily while you 're shooting , and the movie capture mode has conveniently been moved to its own spot on the mode dial , rather than only being accessible via live view .
Here 's our test footage so you can see for yourself ( the file below was compressed into a 30 fps Flash movie , but you can still see the slight difference in the 20 fps 1080 p shots ) :
Buying Decision
You can't imagine Canon moving a lot of 50 Ds once this puppy is out — and that camera was just announced at the end of last summer .
So you have to expect Canon is up to something in their mid-range line .
But with the T1i , Canon has taken a big lead in the HD capture arms race over Nikon , whose only video - capable camera is the mid-range D90 which costs a couple hundred bucks more .
The resolution advantage is somewhat moot , as most people will opt for 720 p @ 30 fps over 1080 p @ the jerkier 20 fps .
But here 's how everything stacks up , money - wise :
Rebel T1i : $ 899 MSRP with kit EF - S18 - 55 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS zoom lens , $ 799 MSRP body only
Nikon D90 : $ 1,149 ( street ) with kit lens , $ 889 ( street ) body only
Canon 50D : $ 1,389 ( street ) with kit lens , $ 1,199 ( street ) body only

So with the T1i , you get a sizable chunk of the more expensive 50D 's imaging performance plus an arguably better spec-wise video capture mode than the D90 — a pretty sweet deal here at an entry - level price where even the MSRP beats the street price of the 50D and D90 both .
We do n't want to get too gushy without giving this camera a serious real - world run-through , but as of now , the only major negative we can see is the ridiculous name .
T1i ?
What ?
Why Canon USA does n't use its handy three - digit designation for the entry - level Rebels like it does in Europe ( where the T1i is known as the 500D , matching with two - digits for the mid-range and single - digits for the pros ) I will never know .
I think Andre Agassi is to blame .

Look for more on this puppy when we 've had a chance to really sink our teeth in .

CANON U.S.A. INTRODUCES THE EOS REBEL T1i DIGITAL SLR CAMERA , THE FIRST REBEL DSLR TO FEATURE HD VIDEO CAPTURE Canon Breaks the $ 1,000 Mark Again with the First EOS Rebel Camera to Feature
HD Movie Recording Capabilities , DIGIC 4 Imaging Processor and 15.1 Megapixel Resolution LAKE SUCCESS , N.Y. , March 25 , 2009 – Canon U.S.A. , Inc. , a leader in digital imaging , today introduced a new addition to its Rebel lineup , the EOS Rebel T1i Digital SLR camera , the first in the Rebel line to feature Full HD video capture .
The new Canon Rebel T1i SLR incorporates some of the best technologies from the EOS 50D and EOS 5D Mark II models into an entry - level juggernaut .
With a 15.1 megapixel CMOS sensor and HD video capture , along with the DIGIC 4 Imaging Processor , the Rebel T1i gives aspiring photographers plenty of reason to step - up to the latest and greatest model in the Rebel lineup .
The new Canon EOS Rebel T1i raises the entry - level bar with a host of enhanced Canon technologies now available in an entry - level DSLR .
Along with the boost in megapixels and Canon 's most advanced imaging processor to - date , this latest Rebel camera has also been enhanced with HD video capture , a 3.0 - inch Clear View LCD ( 920,000 dots / VGA ) monitor and user - friendly functions such as Auto Lighting Optimizer , Creative Auto Mode and Canon 's Live View modes , all the right tools to open new doors for imaging enthusiasts .
From high - resolution to high - definition , the new EOS Rebel T1i Digital SLR camera helps to give creative consumers a jumpstart on the next evolution in digital imaging .
" We are witnessing the emergence of a new phase in digital imaging history , as high - resolution still images and HD video can now both be produced in a hand - held device , for under $ 1,000 .
This is truly a great time to be involved in digital imaging as the advent of online communities are helping usher in this next great era in imaging , " stated Yuichi Ishizuka , senior vice president and general manager , Consumer Imaging Group , Canon U.S.A .
The muscle behind Canon 's new EOS Rebel T1i camera is the DIGIC 4 Imaging Processor with 14 - bit analog - to - digital conversion and the ability to process full HD video .
The Canon EOS Rebel T1i Digital SLR offers continuous shooting at 3.4 fps for up to 170 large / fine JPEG images or up to nine RAW images in a single burst when using a class 6 or higher SD or SDHC memory card .
Whether capturing wildlife on the run or a child mid-stride on the soccer field , users will appreciate the fast shooting capabilities of the Rebel T1i Digital SLR camera .
With the combination of its 15.1 - megapixel APS - C size CMOS image sensor and the powerful new DIGIC 4 image processor , the Canon EOS Rebel T1i camera provides ISO speeds from ISO 100 up to ISO 3200 in whole stop increments , along with two additional high - speed ISO settings – H1 : 6400 and H2 : 12800 .
The EOS Rebel T1i Digital SLR utilizes a precise nine - point Autofocus ( AF ) system and AF sensor for enhanced subject detection .
The new EOS Rebel T1i DSLR provides a cross - type AF measurement at the center that is effective with all EF and EF - S lenses , while providing enhanced precision with lenses having maximum apertures of f /2.8 or faster .
The cross - type AF measurement reads a wider variety of subject matter than conventional single - axis AF sensors and thus increases the new camera 's ability to autofocus quickly and accurately when shooting still images .
The EOS Rebel T1i camera is compatible with Canon 's complete line of over 60 Canon EF and EF - S lenses , to help provide an incredible variety of visual effects to both still and video imaging capture , including ultra - wide - angle and fish - eye to macro and super - telephoto .
This includes all of Canon 's large - aperture EF L- series professional lenses .
HD and SD Video Capture
After the introduction of the EOS 5D Mark II in September 2008 , the Company 's first HD video DSLR , Canon has integrated this must - have feature into the new entry - level flagship EOS Rebel T1i camera .
The camera features 16:9 720p HD video capture at 30 fps as well as a Full HD 1080 p video capture at 20 fps , and a third option to record 4:3 standard TV quality ( SD ) video capture at 640 x 480 pixels and 30 fps .
The video capture mode is part of the camera 's Live View function , using the Picture Style that has been set for Live View still image shooting .
The camera allows skilled photographers and enthusiasts to adjust image sharpness , contrast , color saturation and white balance , and have those settings apply to the movie image as well .
When recording video , the camera 's rear LCD screen is letter - boxed by a semi- transparent border to match the aspect ratio of the movie recording size .
Like the EOS 5D Mark II model , the EOS Rebel T1i camera will record video up to 4GB per clip equaling approximately 12 minutes of Full HD video , 18 minutes of 720p HD video , or 24 minutes of SD video depending on the level of detail in the scene .
Video clips are recorded in .MOV format using an MPEG - 4 video compression and sound is recorded using linear PCM without compression .
The camera features a built - in monaural microphone to record sound .
To help show off those fantastic movies as well as still photos , the EOS Rebel T1i camera includes an HDMI ( High - Definition Multimedia Interface ) output to display crisp , clear images on a High - Definition TV .
Live View Shooting
Much like the EOS 5D Mark II , the Canon EOS Rebel T1i camera features Live View for both still images as well as video .
The Rebel T1i features the Company 's three Live View AF modes – Quick , Live and Face Detection Live mode – which can be used to capture still photos or video images .
Quick mode automatically sets One - Shot AF using the camera 's phase detection AF system .
It also allows users to select the AF point , even while the Live View image is displayed .
Although the camera 's reflex mirror must be lowered briefly to take an AF measurement in Quick mode , it is the fastest way to set focus automatically when the Rebel T1i camera is set for Live View .
Live mode uses contrast - detection AF with the image sensor and here , as with Quick mode , users can change the location of the active AF point using the Multi - controller .
Face Detection
Live mode uses contrast AF to recognize human faces .
When multiple faces are detected , the largest face closest to the center of the frame is targeted as the AF point .
While Live View is engaged , users can still change settings including the AF mode ( Quick , Live , Face Detection Live mode ) , drive mode , ISO speed , Picture style , White Balance and more .
Auto Lighting Optimizer
Canon's Auto Lighting Optimizer technology helps ensure that the subject of each picture is clearly visible by analyzing image brightness and automatically adjusting dark areas in images so they appear brighter .
This is ideal when shooting high - contrast situations that include harsh shadow areas , such as landscape images where the foreground is brightly lit and the background detail blanketed in dark shadow .
In a scene such as this , the EOS Rebel T1i camera 's Auto Lighting Optimizer technology maintains exposure of the highlight areas while lightening shadow areas for a more enjoyable and evenly illuminated image .
The EOS Rebel T1i also supports Peripheral Illumination Correction for up to 40 Canon EF and EF - S lenses .
Canon's Creative Auto Mode
Canon's " CA " Creative Full Auto setting available on the EOS Rebel T1i , EOS 50D and EOS 5D Mark II cameras allows users to make image adjustments such as exposure compensation , aperture or shutter speed through a simple navigation screen on the camera 's LCD screen , allowing them to " blur the background " or " lighten or darken the image " with ease .
These easy - to - understand image options allow learning - photographers to experiment with image options while still shooting in an automatic mode .
EOS Integrated Cleaning System
With the introduction of the EOS Rebel T1i camera , the entire Canon EOS system is now equipped with the highly acclaimed EOS Integrated Cleaning System .
The Self - Cleaning Sensor Unit for the Canon EOS Rebel T1i has been upgraded with a fluorine coating on the low - pass filter for better dust resistance .
Pricing and Availability
The Canon EOS Rebel T1i Digital SLR Camera is scheduled for delivery by early May and will be sold in a body - only configuration which includes a rechargeable battery pack and charger , USB and video cables , a neckstrap , an EOS Solutions Disk CD and a 1 - year Canon U.S.A. , Inc. limited warranty at an estimated retail price of $ 799.99 .
It will additionally be offered in a kit version with Canon's EF - S18 - 55 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS zoom lens at an estimated retail price of $ 899.99 .
Google has announced that it will partner with major movie studios to stream a number of full - length films and TV shows for free on YouTube .
The studios involved in the launch of this premium content section will include Sony , CBS , MGM , Lionsgate , Starz , and the BBC .
The movies will be ad - supported , and ad revenue will be shared with the content owners .
Those who love YouTube 's user - generated video offerings should not fret , however , as those will remain on the site separate from the premium offerings .
Google has been growing its collection of full - length movies as of late , with MGM announcing in November of 2008 that it would begin adding some of its films to YouTube , starting with films like The Magnificent Seven and Bulletproof Monk .
Then , earlier this month , rumors spread that Sony was working on a similar deal to add films to YouTube .
Now , with MGM , Sony , and a handful of others on board , YouTube has taken a giant step in the right direction to figuring out how to monetize the site .
The premium - content section comes as some analysts predict that YouTube will lose almost $ 500 million this year due to bandwidth consumption , licensing fees , the difficulty in monetizing content , and other expenses .
" In our view , the issue for YouTube going forward is to increase the percentage of its videos that can be monetized ( likely through more deals with content companies ) and to drive more advertiser demand through standardization of ad formats and improved ad effectiveness , " Credit Suisse analysts Spencer Wang and Kenneth Sena said earlier this month .
So far , it looks like that premonition is coming true .
The launch of the premium content section of YouTube will come with a site redesign to highlight the changes while keeping YouTube 's main focus on user - generated clips .
YouTube says that it plans to sprinkle video ads inside of the movie streams like Hulu ( and unlike the rest of YouTube , which largely relies on ads being placed around the video on the page ) .
Unfortunately , those outside the US will have to wait for the studios to like you again , as the premium content will be limited to US viewers only .
The move marks a more friendly relationship between YouTube and the studios , who have historically been wary of the ease with which users could upload copyrighted clips — indeed , that is the crux of Viacom 's $ 1 billion lawsuit against YouTube .
It will also put YouTube more directly in competition with the NBC - owned Hulu , which already streams a wide variety of full - length movies and TV shows .
Hulu 's carefully sandboxed approach to online video has been very attractive to content owners as of late , but YouTube is still the far more popular site .
Premium content is what will help both YouTube and the studios make money online , and if there 's one thing studios like , it 's making money .

Before we start celebrating , however , we have to ask the obvious question .
Is this gift a Trojan horse ?
After all , several of the organizations that sent that letter have in the past been major villains when it comes to health care policy .
I ’ve already mentioned AHIP .
There ’s also the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) , the lobbying group that helped push through the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003  a bill that both prevented Medicare from bargaining over drug prices and locked in huge overpayments to private insurers .
Indeed , one of the new letter ’s signatories is former Representative Billy Tauzin , who shepherded that bill through Congress then immediately left public office to become PhRMA ’s lavishly paid president .
The point is that there ’s every reason to be cynical about these players ’ motives .
Remember that what the rest of us call health care costs , they call income .
What ’s presumably going on here is that key interest groups have realized that health care reform is going to happen no matter what they do , and that aligning themselves with the Party of No will just deny them a seat at the table .
( Republicans , after all , still denounce research into which medical procedures are effective and which are not as a dastardly plot to deprive Americans of their freedom to choose . )
I would strongly urge the Obama administration to hang tough in the bargaining ahead .
In particular , AHIP will surely try to use the good will created by its stance on cost control to kill an important part of health reform : giving Americans the choice of buying into a public insurance plan as an alternative to private insurers .
The administration should not give in on this point .
But let me not be too negative .
The fact that the medical - industrial complex is trying to shape health care reform rather than block it is a tremendously good omen .
It looks as if America may finally get what every other advanced country already has : a system that guarantees essential health care to all its citizens .
And serious cost control would change everything , not just for health care , but for America ’s fiscal future .
As Mr. Orszag has emphasized , rising health care costs are the main reason long - run budget projections look so grim .
Slow the rate at which those costs rise , and the future will look far brighter .
I still wo n’t count my health care chickens until they ’re hatched .
But this is some of the best policy news I ’ve heard in a long time .
President Obama , walking a fine line between optimism and caution , said Friday that there were “ glimmers of hope ” for the economy but warned that substantial , potentially difficult government action was still necessary to ensure a healthy recovery .
“ We are starting to see progress , ” Obama said after huddling with senior members of his economic team at the White House .
But he warned that the country must not “ flinch ” at the difficult steps to come .
Behind the president ’s words is a growing consensus among economists that , despite signs that the nation ’s financial picture is improving , major new government aid is still needed if the nation is to avoid prolonged economic anemia .
As the rescue effort stretches to include banks , auto companies and insurance companies , it will require many billions of dollars more in bailout funds , especially for the financial system , these experts say -- money that Congress and a recession - weary public may be in no mood to approve .
Advertisement
What ’s more , the government ’s finances are increasingly strained by the recession .
The Treasury Department said Friday that lower tax revenue and rising payouts for jobless benefits had driven the federal deficit close to $ 1 trillion for the first six months of the current fiscal year .
Some analysts say that unless banks and other financial institutions have enough capital to play a robust role in extending credit , the economy could be stuck in neutral for months or years more .
Economist Anil Kashyap , a banking expert at the University of Chicago ’s Booth School of Business , said the government could n’t afford to lapse into half - measures just because the economy and the stock market were showing signs of life .
That means calling on Congress to approve a big new aid infusion .
“ They ’re going to get one more shot ” with Congress , Kashyap said .
“ They need to worry about whether the funding will dry up . ”

In his meeting Friday , Obama got a progress report on the “ stress tests ” being conducted on the nation ’s 19 largest banks , an effort the administration has said is a key first step in determining how much more money the ongoing bailout will require to help banks survive if the economy takes more bad turns .
Officials have not disclosed the results of the tests , but there have been some indications that they believe the capital shortfall may not be quite as large as had once been feared .
That ’s good news , economists say , but maybe not good enough .
The fear is that the government will force the banks to raise only enough capital to stay afloat -- short of what ’s necessary to restore health enough to encourage large - scale lending .
How much money that would take is a matter of debate .
But most experts agree that the $ 100 billion to $ 135 billion left in the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program probably wo n’t come close .
Advertisement
Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody ’s Economy.com , estimates that for the government to live up to its pledge to support the 19 banks undergoing stress tests no matter what , it will need $ 750 billion more from taxpayers .
He acknowledged that Congress might be reluctant to bankroll such a request .
Uncertainty over the unfolding banking rescue also may have unwelcome consequences .
Although the rising stock market is clearly encouraged about the banking industry ’s progress , other elements of the financial world are n’t so sure .
Simon Johnson , a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Sloan School of Management and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund , pointed out that a key gauge of investor confidence -- the market for credit default swaps -- shows that some investors have been making big bets that the risk is growing that struggling banks like Citigroup and Bank of America will collapse .
Those markets can change in an instant , but if that sort of pessimism continues , analysts said , it can spiral into a self - fulfilling prophecy : Widening spreads can negatively influence credit ratings for financial institutions , raising borrowing costs .
Advertisement
Widening spreads can also spook a bank ’s trading partners , making it more difficult to manage portfolios .
That sort of pressure is what undermined Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros.
last year , Johnson said .
Given all the sensitivity , the Obama team will need a strategy for communicating information about the stress tests , experts said .
Officials know they are crucial to determining which banks have too little capital .
But forcing ailing companies to accept new capital without setting off alarm in the markets may be difficult .
Kashyap said the most important action the government could take was to clearly define its strategy and implement it quickly .
Avoiding further erosion of confidence , he said , will require forcing the banks in need to either raise enough capital privately or accept enough public capital to make sure robust lending can resume .
Advertisement
The danger , Kashyap said , is that banks take in just enough capital to survive and then regain strength only slowly , by relying on incoming deposits and the small return they get from investing them .
“ The reason to bail them out is to increase lending , not to buy time so they can rebuild slowly , ” he said .

Following Chu's talk , Professor William Nordhaus of Yale gave a talk entitled Energy and the Macroeconomy .
I got called out during his talk , so I missed most of it .
What I do remember him arguing is that oil embargoes are completely worthless , because oil is fungible .
If Venezuela decided not to sell their oil to the U.S. , they would end up selling it to someone else , which would displace some other seller , which at some point would end up with someone else selling it to the U.S.
I missed the next point , but Gail the Actuary was there and said " a corollary of this is that there is no point in protecting the US oil and gas industry .
We can just buy what we need elsewhere . "
I covered Energy Secretary Steven Chu's comments in the previous post .
Here , I will cover the rest of Day 1 .
This is not so much a comprehensive summary as it is a collection of observations and things I otherwise found to be interesting .
My notes at times are spotty , so if someone was there and feels like this essay contains an error , please let me know .
Next up was John W. Rowe , CEO of Exelon , which has the largest market capitalization in the utility industry .
John speaks very slowly , but he speaks with authority .
I took quite a few notes during his talk .
Rowe supports cap and trade as a way of controlling CO2 emissions .
One thing that I am very interested in is the expected value of a ton of CO2 if a cap and trade law is passed ( Full disclosure :
This potentially impacts my current company as a price on carbon emissions could benefit us ) .
John put up a slide that indicated ( at least to me ) that the price could be $ 125 / metric ton .
I saw other presenters who had values ranging from a few dollars up to $ 500 .
That last number was one that the presenter expected would be needed to make several of the more marginal technologies economical .
Rowe was clearly concerned about CO2 emissions , and pointed out that Exelon had far exceeded their targets for emission reductions by closing down inefficient coal plants .
But he was also concerned about the impact cap and trade might have on electricity costs .
In one example he gave , electricity costs in California could go from $ 0.18 / kWh to $ 0.30 / kWh .
The Future for Transport Demand
Thus ended the plenary , and I next attended The Future for Transport Demand .
Speakers were Lew Fulton from the IEA , David Greene from Oak Ridge National Laboratory , and Lee Schipper from Stanford .
The moderator was Andy S. Kydes from the EIA .
Had the sessions not been concurrent , I would have attended What 's Ahead for Natural Gas Markets .
But there is a pretty good summary of this session by Dave Summers .
Fulton said that the expectation of the IEA is that oil production would reach 105 million bpd by 2030 .
There was quite a bit of consensus that non-OPEC production has pretty well maxed out , and that the new production would come from OPEC .
Fulton also mentioned that there is a lot of skepticism out there on biofuels .
David Greene followed , and gave perhaps the most sobering talk of the conference .
He referred back to Fulton 's comments on OPEC filling the void , and essentially said " With all due respect , that 's not going to happen . "
He also said that cellulosic ethanol " makes no sense " and that the IEA was engaging in wishful thinking .
I was quite impressed with Greene as someone who really understands the seriousness of the problem , and that the future is likely to be quite different than the rosy projections .
Lee Schipper was up next .
Schipper was quite witty , and sounded to me just like Richard Dreyfuss .
( You can see a short video by Schipper here ) .
I have often commented that we do n't seem to understand the scale differences between the energy we use and what biofuels could reasonably be expected to contribute .
Schipper had a similar observation : " Our problem is that we can't count . "
He went on to say that even though China has very low levels of motorized transport , Chinese cities are already becoming frozen by traffic .
Finally , in the category of stating the obvious , he said that " Transport is very politicized . "
Meeting the Growing Demand for Liquid Fuels
The next session featured Eduardo González - Pier from PEMEX , David Knapp from the Energy Intelligence Group and Fareed Mohamedi from PFC Energy .
The moderator was Glen Sweetnam from the EIA .
Dave Summers attended this session as well , and has quite a thorough account on his blog .
This panel engaged in a round - table discussion , and covered different areas of the world with respect to potential for increasing production .
I will just add a couple of observations to Dave 's account .
David Knapp was asked about Venezuela , and said he was very pessimistic .
Brazil , on the other hand , was viewed as a success story , and Petrobras was singled out by Fareed as having a bright outlook .
Of course I feel the same way , which is why I loaded up on Petrobras stock last November .
( As I write this , that investment is up 106 % in about 5 months ) .
Two of the more eyebrow - raising comments came from González - Pier , who predicted : 1 ) PEMEX can stabilize production at 3 million bpd for many years ; 2 ) .
Mexico wo n't become a net oil importer for 2 decades .
Consider me a skeptic .
The last interesting bit in this panel was that a slide was put up that projected production costs for various technologies .
Gas - to - liquids ( GTL ) came in at $ 40 - $ 110 / bbl , coal - to - liquids ( CTL ) came in at $ 60 - $ 110 / bbl , and production from oil shale came in at $ 50 - $ 110 / bbl .
Again , consider me a skeptic , particularly over the lower end of these ranges .
There are a couple of problems with these projections .
First , because all of these technologies are highly dependent on the cost of energy , they will proceed along a sliding scale ( the so - called receding horizon problem ) .
Second , there is really very little data on what the economics of commercial facilities might look like over the long haul , because very few facilities actually exist .
( In the case of oil shale , no facilities exist to my knowledge ) .
So the projections are subject to the same criticisms I have offered up for cellulosic ethanol economics :
They are projections based on precious little scaled - up operating data .
Renewable Energy in the Transportation and Power Sectors
The speakers for this session were Matt Hartwig from the Renewable Fuels Association ( filling in for Bob Dinneen who had been called away ) , Bryan Hannegan from EPRI , Denise Bode , an enthusiastic Okie and CEO of the American Wind Energy Association , and David Humbird , a fellow Aggie now with NREL .
The moderator was Michael Schaal ( who I had lunch with the next day ) , Director of the EIA 's Oil and Gas Division ( which also covers biofuels ) .
While Humbird seemed to have a good understanding of the some of the challenges of commercial cellulosic ethanol production ( he specifically mentioned the logistical issue that I predict will be the death knell for conventional cellulosic ethanol ) , he nevertheless put up a slide that suggested production costs for cellulosic ethanol at $ 2.61 / gal , and for gasification at $ 2.40 / gal .
While I agree with the relative positions of cellulosic versus gasification ( long - term , I think gasification can be commercially viable ) I do n't think there is any chance that a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant can get close to $ 2.61 / gal .
Maybe he was factoring in a tax credit of up to $ 1.01 / gal for cellulosic ethanol ; in that case his numbers would be in the ballpark of production costs that I have seen of around $ 4/gal .
But the thing that is n't usually discussed in these sorts of analyses is " What assumptions are you making ? "
Are you assuming you are getting biomass from the immediate vicinity , and the process steam comes from $ 3 natural gas ( or even cheaper coal ) ?
It is quite easy to make overly optimistic assumptions that grossly underestimate production costs .
I have seen this happen numerous times , and these sorts of assumptions have doomed many plants ( of all sorts ) once they start up and have to start operating in the real world .
Humbird also mentioned that it would be better to find microbes and yeasts that can produce gasoline and diesel instead of ethanol .
Because hydrocarbons phase out of water , have higher energy density , and are compatible with our current pipeline systems , this sort of solution is potentially more practical .
As Humbird mentioned , there is a lot of research project going on , both government and in private industry , in this area .
Companies that Humbird mentioned were LS9 , Amyris , Virent , and Coskata .
I had to take a call during the presentations , and only caught pieces of the rest .
For Denise Bode's , two things stood out .
First , she was by far the most enthusiastic speaker I saw ; a combination cheerleader and firebrand .
Second , she mentioned that the U.S. is now the world 's largest producer of electricity from wind , a story that I had somehow missed when it was announced in February .
I unfortunately missed all of Bryan Hannegan 's talk .
Matt Hartwig 's talk was what one would expect from a non-technical person who works for the ethanol lobby .
We got the standard talking points , a couple of which bear repeating .
When asked if corn ethanol could ever be competitive without the subsidies , he not suprisingly claimed that the ethanol subsidy actually benefits oil companies .
This is of course incredibly misleading .
While the blender 's credit is indeed received by the oil companies ( initially as an incentive to buy ethanol that was otherwise uncompetitive ) , the primary beneficiary is the ethanol industry .
If you disagree , ask yourself which industry - oil or ethanol - is constantly lobbying to keep the credit .
Hint :
It is n't the oil industry .
So one would certainly be puzzled by the notion - if Hartwig 's claim is true - why the ethanol industry lobbies to keep a credit that benefits the oil industry .
If you ever hear an ethanol booster make that claim , tell them " Then let 's get rid of the credit . "
The other notable thing Hartwig did was fire a preemptive complaint over the upcoming EPA ruling on GHG reduction for ethanol .
In 2007 , Congress ruled that ethanol must reduce emissions relative to gasoline by 20 % .
The problem - which I warned about at the time - is that politics are going to play a big role .
While the methodology and results have yet to be announced , ethanol interests are jockeying for position which is exactly what would be expected given the way this was set up .
Imagine that the EPA comes up with the wrong answer - according to the current administration .
What happens then ?
Political pressure to come up with the right answer .
In this case , Hartwig was complaining about inclusion of land use issues ( explained in this article ) which some studies have found cause ethanol to come out worse than gasoline with respect to GHG emissions .
The industry will of course fight that tooth and nail .
However , such a ruling would be a strong incentive for the industry to minimize fossil fuel usage in the production of ethanol .
Thus concluded Day 1 .
In the next installment , I will cover the panel session that I was on , as well as the session Investing in Oil and Natural Gas .
You ’re in an airport waiting for your plane to board and decide to buy a magazine .
The price , with tax , is $ 4.59 .
Then you decide you could really use a frozen yogurt but are n’t sure you have enough time , so you look at your watch and are surprised to see that it ’s 4:59 PM .
Finally , you make it to your gate with a few minutes to spare , and only then notice that your flight number has been changed to — you guessed it — 459 .
Mean anything to you ?
It seems that when events co-occur ( which is to say , conjunct ) some of us are prone to believe that they were ‘ meant ’ to co-occur , or at least were more likely to co-occur than a single event occurring alone .
That ’s the fallacy of conjunction , and according to a new study in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology , it ’s at the core of belief in the paranormal .
The study set out to answer this question : do paranormal believers make more conjunction errors overall–for normal and paranormal events –than non-believers ?
The answer is yes , they do .
And they especially fall prey to the conjunction fallacy when it comes to perceived paranormal events , including dream precognitions , waking precognitions , fortune teller predictions , and the mysterious power of ‘ intuition ’ ( in the most new ageish sense of the word ) .
200 subjects , ages ranging from 18 to 56 , participated in the study , which assessed their level of paranormal belief via questionairres ( tested in previous studies for the same purpose ) .
They were then asked to make “ scenario judgements ” that assessed their reliance on conjunction to explain given scenarios including normal or paranormal events .
At the end of the day , differences in how believers and non-believers responded were large — when two or more events co-occurred , believers were quick to assign significance , while non-believers wrote it up to probability .
And that ’s really the heart of the matter : where some of us see celestial conjunction , others of us see regular old randomness doing its thing .
Where some see meaningful coincidence , others see probability .
Turns out , the less prone you are to relying on probability to explain conjunction , the more prone you are to believing in the paranormal .
Interesting to note that previous studies have shown that a poor grasp of probability , and statistics overall , is a good predictor of paranormal belief .
Ignorance may be bliss , but it can also lead you to believe that you ’re really precoging the future in your dreams , or pay a fortune teller hard - earned cash to caress your palms .
Nevertheless , the conjunction fallacy clearly has its place .
How else can people be expected to pick lottery numbers ?
As you might know , Haskell is a lazy language .
This means that nothing is evaluated until it is actually needed .
This allows you to do nice things like
foo = take 10 [ 0 ..]
without taking infinity to evaluate the list .
Until yesterday , however , I did n’t fully appreciate quite how literally Haskell takes this concept .
I was working on a BMP importer and had the following data structure :
data Image = Image { width :: Int , height :: Int , pixels :: [ [ Pixel ] ] } data Pixel = Pixel { red :: Int , green :: Int , blue :: Int , alpha :: Int } deriving Show
Pretty simple .
Now let ’s make a function that generates a bitmap :
makeImage :: Int ->
Int ->
Image makeImage w h = Image w h .
replicate h .
replicate w $ Pixel 255 0 0 255
Let ’s jump to ghci to test working with a reasonable sized bitmap .
> :set +s
This makes ghci report how long everything takes and how much memory it requires .
> width $ makeImage 800 600 800 ( 0.05 secs , 527520 bytes )
As the more perceptive of you may have noticed , we have 800 * 600 = 480000 pixels .
Each pixel has four ints , which are 4 bytes each , so the full data structure should take 480000 * 16 = 7680000 bytes , or 7 MB at the very least .
Our command only took 527 KB , so obviously it ’s not evaluating the whole thing , which is logical .
It does n’t need the pixels , so it does n’t evaluate them .
So how do we make it evaluate all the pixels ?
Until yesterday i thought getting the last pixel via ( last . last ) would work , figuring it should have to evaluate the whole thing to give me the last element .
Let ’s try that .
> last .
last .
pixels $ makeImage 800 600 Pixel {red = 255 , green = 0 , blue = 0 , alpha = 255} ( 0.00 secs , 522388 bytes )
Well , that was fast .
But if we look at the memory used we see the obvious problem : it ’s still not nearly enough .
GHC is a clever compiler , so it skips doing the work for all the other pixels because it sees it does n’t have to .
Unfortunately it took me a whole lot longer to see this problem since I was testing a bigger section of code , which took a lot more memory , obscuring this problem .
Fortunately the kind people in the #haskell IRC channel pointed out this problem and also provided a way to force the evaluation of an object , namely the rnf function in Control .
Parallel .
Strategies .
So let ’s try that :
import Control .
Parallel .
Strategies
Go to ghci again and type
> rnf .
pixels $ makeImage 800 600 No instance for ( NFData Pixel ) arising from a use of `rnf ' at : 1:0 - 2 Possible fix : add an instance declaration for ( NFData Pixel )
In the first argument of `(. ) ' , namely `rnf '
In the first argument of ` ( $ ) ' , namely `rnf . pixels '
In the expression : rnf . pixels $ makeImage 800 600
Hm .
We ’ll need to make Pixel an instance of NFData .
Had this instead been a [ [ Int ] ] or another common data type it would have worked out of the box .
Now we could just say
instance NFData Image
but this would tell only part of the story .
If we look at the source code for Control .
Parallel .
Strategies we see that rnf does nothing by default .
Using this version we would indeed evaluate the whole list ( because the instance for lists has been correctly defined ) , but leave the pixels themselves unevaluated .
In my test this resulted in a reported time of about 5 seconds instead of the 9 - 10 it actually took to fully load the image .
Another look at the source code reveals that the correct implementation is very simple : just seq everything together .
instance NFData
Pixel where rnf ( Pixel r g b a ) = rnf r ` seq ` rnf g ` seq ` rnf b ` seq ` rnf a
Let ’s also make Image an instance of NFData for good measure .
instance NFData
Image where rnf ( Image w h ps ) = rnf w ` seq ` rnf h ` seq ` rnf ps
Let ’s try evaluating the image again :
> rnf $ makeImage 800 600 ( ) ( 1.78 secs , 92503000 bytes )
Quite a difference .
Now we have a realistic memory use and the actual time it takes to fully evalutate the image .
So if you ’re ever unsure if something has been fully evaluated or if your compiler is just being sneaky , remember the rnf function .
It might save you a few hours of confusion 🙂

Israel has taken a step towards expanding the largest settlement in the West Bank , a move Palestinians warn will leave their future state unviable and further isolate its future capital , East Jerusalem
The Israeli Peace Now group , which monitors settlement growth , said it had obtained plans drawn up by experts that the interior ministry had commissioned which call for expanding the sprawling Maale Adumim settlement near Jerusalem southward by 1200 hectares , placing what is now the separate smaller settlement of Kedar within Maale Adumim 's boundaries .
The expansion is on a highly sensitive piece of real estate that both sides see as holding the key to whether the Palestinians will have a viable state with their own corridor between the north and south parts of the West Bank .

Israeli plans also call for expanding Maale Adumim northward in an area known as E1 , but US opposition has thus far stopped Israel from building residential buildings there , although a police headquarters has been established .
The new plan , if approved by the interior minister , Eli Yishai , will help pave the way for the building of 6000 housing units between Maale Adumim and Kedar and on other lands to be annexed by Maale Adumim , says Peace Now staffer Hagit Ofran .
" What they have in their minds is the expansion of Maale Adumim and this is one step towards that , " Ms. Ofran said of government planners
The Palestinian MP Hanan Ashrawi said the plan was " extremely dangerous " .
She said that the new plan , combined with Israeli plans to build at E1 , plans to demolish 88 houses in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem on grounds they were built without permits , the planned eviction of Palestinian families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood and other steps reflect " a mad rush to expand settlements to complete the isolation and siege of Jerusalem .
Israel is destroying any chances of an agreement . "
Hizki Zisman , a spokesman for the Maale Adumim municipality , said making Kedar part of Maale Adumim is an administrative matter of uniting local authorities and does not involve expropriating more land from Palestinians .
He said the panel recommendation was " professional , not political " and that there was a great need to expand the settlement because of young couples needing bigger apartments .
An aide to Mr Yishai said the plan to make Kedar part of Maale Adumim arrived on the minister 's desk yesterday and he had not yet taken a decision on it .
Mr Yishai , from the ultra- orthodox
Shas party , is supportive of settlement activity but the timing for expanding Maale Adumim may not be propitious given the international scrutiny of the new right - wing Israeli government .
An official in the Prime Minister 's office declined to say what the attitude of the Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , was to the expansion : " Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered a comprehensive review on a host of issues including settlements and the attitude towards peace talks .
This will take a few weeks . "
Ms Ofran said expanding Maale Adumim to include Kedar was also aimed at making the route of the West Bank separation barrier that is still being constructed penetrate deeper into the occupied territory .

Israel says the barrier is aimed at thwarting suicide bombers but the International Court of Justice has ruled it illegal , for being built inside the West Bank .
The Israeli supreme court is deliberating on the route of the barrier in the Maale Adumim area and received a recommendation from the relatively dovish Council for Peace and Security – made up of former senior security officers – that Kedar should not be included within the fence .
" If the fence is supposed to become the border of Israel , than making Kedar part of Maale Adumim expands the border , " Ms Ofran said .
Meanwhile , the Netanyahu government yesterday adopted a rejectionist approach to peace talks .
The Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , ruled out opening negotiations with Syria unless it dropped all its pre-conditions relating to the Golan Heights .
Days earlier , he said that Syria was not a " genuine partner for peace " .
Syria recently said it would be willing to resume indirect talks as long as they focused on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights , which Israel captured in 1967 .
Here ’s the Electronic Frontier Foundation ’s article on the subject .
Here ’s some reporting by Glenn Greenwald , who ’s done a good job of aggressively covering and commenting on the Obama Administration ’s most egregious missteps concerning civil liberties , privacy , et cetera .
Basically , the shorthand version of the story is :
The EFF took the NSA to court over the latter ’s illegal surveillance activities , and the Obama Justice Department has filed a motion calling for this court challenge to be thrown out , citing “ state secrets . ”
Combining this with Obama voting in the Senate to grant the telecoms legal immunity for cooperating with the wiretapping program , and Obama ’s refusal to discard Bush ’s expansion of executive privilege , we get a very depressing picture , indeed .
What the HELL , Mr. Obama !?

NEVER before has America had so many compelling reasons to preserve the homes in its older residential neighborhoods .
We need to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions .
We want to create jobs , and revitalize the neighborhoods where millions of Americans live .
All of this could be accomplished by making older homes more energy - efficient .
Let ’s begin with energy consumption and emissions .
Forty - three percent of America ’s carbon emissions come from heating , cooling , lighting and operating our buildings .
Older homes are particularly wasteful : Homes built in 1939 or before use around 50 percent more energy per square foot than those constructed in 2000 .
But with significant improvements and retrofits , these structures could perform on a par with newer homes .
So how does a homeowner go green ?
The first step is an energy audit by a local utility .
These audits can be obtained in many communities at little or no cost .
They help identify the sources of heat loss , allowing homeowners to make informed decisions about how to reduce energy use in the most cost - effective way .
Homeowners are likely to discover that much of the energy loss comes down to a lack of insulation in attics and basements .
Sealing other air leaks also helps .
This can be done by installing dryer vent seals that open only when the dryer is in use , as well as fireplace draft stoppers and attic door covers .
There had been speculation that many jobs would go at the plant
Computer giant Dell is to cut 1,900 of the 3,000 jobs at its manufacturing site in Limerick in the Irish Republic .
Dell said the move - which will see production moved to a new factory in Poland - was part of a $ 3bn global cost - cutting effort .
The firm has seen global profits slip because consumers are buying fewer computers as they rein in spending .
Local business leaders predicted the decision would put a further 6,000 jobs in related industries at risk .
' Difficult decision '
Vice - president of Dell 's operations in Europe , the Middle East and Africa , Sean Corkery , described the cuts as a " difficult decision but the right one for Dell to become even more competitive , and deliver greater value to customers in the region " .
The remaining 1,100 Dell staff will primarily work in product development , engineering and logistics , focused on supporting overseas manufacturing .
The cuts are not set to affect the 1,300 marketing and sales staff at Dell 's Cherrywood plant in south Dublin .
Dell opened its first operations in the Irish Republic in 1990 , and employed more than 4,500 staff at its peak .
It is the country 's biggest exporter and second - largest company .
Okay , folks : we need your help .
Because honestly , we can't decide if Elon Musk is just another egomaniacal Silicon Valley schmuck , or if he 's crazy -- crazy like a fox -- and playing us media types for chumps .
On Friday , Yahoo posted an interview with the chairman and CEO of Tesla Motors , and in the first 60 seconds , Musk calls a writer for the New York Times " a douchebag ... and an idiot " for suggesting that Tesla does n't deserve any government support in developing its electric automobiles .
Musk 's primary rationale seems to be -- and we 're paraphrasing here :
" We can't raise cash from my venture capitalist buddies ( even though they totally love me ) because they 're in dire straits these days . "
" We 're asking for a loan , not a grant , and it 'll have to be repaid before Tesla investors make money . "
" We 're the little guy , and you can't hurt the little guy !
Who ever heard of hurting the little guy ? "
No matter how well you think these points illustrate the guy 's knowledge of the auto industry , the interview makes one thing abundantly clear : Tesla would have a tough time finding a replacement for Elon Musk .
In fact , we 're beginning to think that he knows exactly what he 's doing .
Heck , all that alleged " crazy talk " keeps him -- and Tesla - - right in the media spotlight .
And we 'd wager that 's at least partially responsible for the remarkable pre-sales stats on the Tesla Model S.
But even worse than feeling chumped out , we at TCC feel ignored .
Seriously , we 've said plenty of snarky things about Musk .
Where 's our " douchebag " moment , Elon ?
Where is it ?

The claims of both sides are impossible to verify
At least 378 people have been killed by fierce shelling from the Sri Lankan army in the past 24 hours , a health official has told the BBC .
The doctor , working in the northern conflict zone , said 1,122 others had been injured - and more bodies were on beaches and by the sides of roads .
The army denies shelling the designated " safe zone " for civilians , and blames any deaths on Tamil Tiger rebels .
The claims are impossible to verify as reporters are banned from the war zone .
But the BBC's Charles Haviland , in Colombo , says a steady stream of information coming from the area suggests that civilians are being killed .
And he says health officials are convinced that the shells are coming from territory held by the Sri Lankan army .
See a map of the conflict region
The pro-rebel Tamilnet website reported that the army began to fire artillery shells late on Saturday .
The site said as many as 2,000 civilians had been killed .
Dr V Shanmugarajah said he could not confirm that figure but said the makeshift hospital he is working in - at a school in east Mullaivaikal in Mullaitivu district - had so far taken in 378 bodies .
He said 106 of those killed were children .
Reporters deported Sri Lanka has deported three British television journalists arrested on charges of tarnishing the image of the Sri Lankan security forces .
The three had compiled a report for the London - based Channel Four news , about allegations of poor treatment and sexual abuse at camps for those fleeing the fighting between Sri Lankan forces and Tamil Tiger rebels .
The journalists were detained in the eastern city of Trincomalee on Saturday .
Lakshman Hulugalle , who heads the government security information centre , said the trio had admitted they had " done something wrong " .
A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office said Sri Lanka 's decision to deport them was disappointing when the case for greater transparency in Sri Lanka was overwhelming .
Claims of duress
In response to claims of civilian deaths , military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said radar had detected Tamil Tigers themselves using artillery and mortar fire on two occasions on Saturday morning , directed against civilians within their zone .
" These doctors are giving statements based on some of the false propaganda given by the LTTE [ Tamil Tigers ] , " he said .
" Maybe there is an LTTE gun pointing at them and asking them to give a statement .
All these stories are exaggerated to tarnish the image of the Sri Lankan troops who are fighting the LTTE terrorists . "
Sri Lankan defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella also told the BBC that reports of government shelling were " propaganda " of the Tigers .
He said the guerrillas were " holding people to ransom " in their area , and accused them of killing nine civilians who were trying to escape their zone on Saturday .
Earlier , doctors said two hospitals were struggling to cope with the casualties , and that people were hiding in bunkers and many makeshift tents had been burnt .
They added that a government nursing officer was among those killed .
The UN estimates that about 50,000 civilians are trapped by the conflict in a three - km - sq strip of land .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war .

Pete Verrando in an audio engineer who has 20 years of experience in Production Sound Recording for film and television .
He works all over the world doing on - location recording .
Pete Verrando has built something that is part innovative , part steampunk and part crazy - geek - inventor - guy .
It ’s something I ’ve often tossed around in my mind , but he has taken things one step further and has actually built one : A CD turntable .
Actually , he ’s built four of them .
They look just like regular turntables , with a rotating disc and a tonearm , but they do n’t play vinyl records , they play CD’s .
CD Turntable
At first I thought to myself “ there is no way could actually work ” .
There are so many problems – how do you keep the tonearm tracking those extremely thin tracks ?
what about the tonearm moving in an arc instead of a line like a regular CD player ?
How would you maintain a proper gap that is small enough to be able to read the laser without riding right on the cd ?
How to deal with ambient light causing errors ?
What if the laser hits me in the eye ?!
I suppose that the pickup mechanism on a cheap CD player could the modified to work if it was held roughly in the right position – the control mechanism will automatically make adjustments for focus and tracking errors .
Software could deal with the math to accommodate for the arc of the tonearm , and proper mechanical precision could deal with the gap issue .
Still , putting it all together and getting it to all work is quite the accomplishment .
He ’s also applied for a patent for the invention .
Very , very cool .
Hey Pete , how about hooking up your buddies here with one of those babies ?
But it ’s the special effects I want to talk about .
Because for the past decade or so , more and more the effects in big films have been utilised as some kind of willy - waving exercise , with the emphasis on putting something impressive in the trailer .
Yet too many times , when you got to the film itself , they stood out like a sore thumb , as integral to the story as a fridge is to the middle of a football field .
The key offender in recent times has , for my money , been Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
What was particularly disappointing about that film was that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were making all the right noises in the build up to the film , that it would n’t be effects driven .
But they were leading us a merry dance .
We had computerised snakes , computerised bugs , we had computerised fridges flying through computerised explosions .
And that ending .
Everywhere you looked in the midst of the latest addition to an action franchise whose best moments were recorded via a camera lens , there was a special effect , often for no clear purpose .
It ’s not alone , either .
Just how many times have we had effects for the sake of effects in past summers ?
I ’m not averse to putting some computerised spectacular on the screen , but numerous times , for instance , during the last Pirates of the Caribbean film I just thought they were showing off ( and I do concede there were some terrific sequences in there , too ) .
Transformers ?
It looked terrific , granted , but the effects were in charge there , and it did n’t help the film .
Also , there ’s the problem that when a film is reliant on a special effect , it has a habit of going badly wrong .
The back end of I Am Legend was significantly diluted by some bizarre computer creations running amok , the arrival of the Scorpion King at the end of The Mummy Returns induced titters when I saw it , and Martin has listed several other candidates that I could happily chunter about right here .
The trick to Star Trek , for me , was that it stayed focused , and chose carefully .
Appreciating that JJ Abrams had a sizeable budget at his disposal , there was still little doubt in my mind that it was all up there on screen as I walked out at the end .
The last time I think I ’d seen such concentrated focus on wringing the most out of an effects budget for the benefit of the film itself was with Danny Boyle ’s underrated Sunshine , and I long now for other blockbuster directors to pick up some of the lessons that Star Trek has clearly demonstrated .
LOS ANGELES , April 24 ( Reuters ) -
The swine flu outbreak is likely to benefit one of the most prolific and successful venture capital firms in the United States : Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , Thomson Reuters Private Equity Week reported on Friday .
Shares of the two public companies in the firm 's portfolio of eight Pandemic and Bio Defense companies -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals BCRX.O and Novavax NVAX.O -- jumped Friday on news that the swine flu killed a reported 60 people in Mexico and has infected people in the United States .
The World Health Organization said the virus appears to be susceptible to Roche's ROG .
VX flu drug Tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , but not to older flu drugs such as amantadine .
Shares of Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG closed up 3.48 percent after falling sharply earlier in the week on a cancer drug disappointment , while shares of U.S. biotechnology company Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O , which gets royalties from Roche on Tamiflu sales , slipped 10 cents to $ 45.80 on Friday .
But BioCryst , a maker of drugs that block key enzymes in viral diseases , jumped more than 26 percent on Friday to $ 2.21 per share .
Viral vaccine maker Novavax rose more than 75 percent to $ 1.42 per share .
BioCryst CEO
John Stonehouse said his company does not anticipate the use of its technology in treating this episode of swine flu .
“ We ’re in clinical trials right now and not on the market , ” Stonehouse said .
Still , the companies will have to go even higher for Kleiner Perkins to make its investment back .
Both BioCryst and Novavax experienced long drops from price peaks in 2006 , when reports of avian flu dominated headlines .
BioCryst is down nearly 90 percent from its 2006 high of $ 20.75 per share and Novavax is down more than 85 percent from a high of $ 7.98 per share .
Kleiner Perkins invested $ 30 million in BioCryst in December 2005 alongside Fort Worth , Texas - based buyout firm TPG .
The two firms invested again in August 2007 , picking up $ 65 million worth of shares and warrants .
The investors bought shares in BioCryst at $ 13.46 and then $ 7.80 .
Kleiner Perkins put $ 20 million in Novavax in February 2006 alongside Palo Alto , Calif . - based Prospect Venture Partners .
The two firms picked up the shares at $ 4.35 .
Novavax can produce a vaccine from an emergent strain of flu virus in 12 weeks , according to CEO Rahul Singhvi .
The company has contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to offer help and is trying to contact the Ministry of Health in Mexico , Singhvi said .
The company uses genetic information and “ recombinant , virus - like particle technology ” to rapidly engineer a vaccine .
Its technology has been proven to work in humans during Phase II trials , Singhvi said , and it might be used in the case of an emergency .
“ There is an emergency authorization avenue that is available that would allow us to use the vaccine in an emergency without further testing , ” said Singhvi .
Kleiner Perkins typically only invests in early stage start - up technologies .
It is best known for its investments in Netscape , Amazon.com AMZN.O , Google GOOG.O and Genentech ROG .VX .
The Menlo Park , California - based VC firm launched a $ 200 million Pandemic Bio Defense fund in 2006 to invest in technology companies working on drugs , diagnostics and inoculations against flu - like diseases .
“ We will invest to accelerate innovation , and we ’re in a hurry , ” Investor John Doerr said at the time .
“ We hope even a mild pandemic never recurs . ”
Investors at Kleiner Perkins were not immediately available for comment .
The firm ’s other Pandemic Bio Defense investments include : * San Francisco - based Anza Therapeutics , which is working on therapeutic vaccines for treating certain types of cancer and hepatitis C. * Fremont , Calif . - based Breathe Technologies , which is working on lightweight respiratory ventilator systems .
* Emeryville , Calif. - based HX Diagnostics , which is working to make diagnostic tools for seasonal and emerging diseases .
* Pleasanton , Calif. - based Juvaris BioTherapeutics Inc. , which is working on vaccines and immunotherapeutics to treat infectious disease and cancer .
* San Diego - based Trius Therapeutics , which is developing drugs to fight resistant - strains of bacteria .
* Marlborough , Mass .- based Xcellerex Inc. , which has developed tools and manufacturing processes to speed the deployment of new vaccines .

Press Release
— — — — — — —— ——
In the year 1910 , Clara Zetkin , a German women ’s rights advocate , proposed that “ every year , in every country , there should be a celebration on the same day – a Women ’s Day – to press for their demands ” .
Ever since , International Women ’s Day is being observed in various countries across the world .
In order to press for our demands that have been ignored and brushed aside by mainstream women ’s organizations , lawmakers and our elected representatives , we , the members of All India Forgotten Women ( AIFW ) and Mothers and Sisters Initiative ( MASI ) , are organizing a Dharna on the occasion of International Women ’s Day , 8 March 2009 , in front of the office of the National Commission of Women between 10:00 am and 1:30 pm .
In India , we not only have a Ministry dedicated to women ’s welfare but also a National Commission for Women and several regional and local organizations representing the cause of women .
The Government of India is constantly doling out pro-women policies in the name of providing equal rights , imparting education , improving health , and encouraging women ’s participation in all walks of life .
It has passed several laws in the name of addressing problems such as dowry harassment , dowry death , marital cruelty , domestic violence , rape , indecent representation of women , to name a few .
Women ’s rights activists have been successful in pressuring the police , judiciary and media to take a lenient approach towards women and grant them special privileges compared to men .
They constantly remind women of their “ hard won ” rights and privileges in the society , and the need to protect and exercise them .
In spite of all the above , we continue to hear that the status of women in the country is only worsening every day .
One is bound to wonder why granting more and more privileges and protections to women would lead to worsening of the status of women in the society ?
Here is why :
The Ministry of Women and Child Development , the National Commission for Women and other powerful women ’s organizations comprise of radical feminists who are anti-men and anti-family .
These radical feminists have become self - appointed authorities who determine what is good for all women in the country , and have assumed proprietary rights on the drafting and implementation of all policies and laws related to women .
In their regime , spread of anti-male sentiments and superficial appeasement of women take precedence over real empowerment of women .
Laws pushed by radical feminists under the guise of empowering women are , in reality , weapons that facilitate abuse by women , violate basic human rights of men , women and children and promote family destruction .
In the last four years , over 123,497 women have been arrested under IPC Section 498A alone , without evidence or investigation , not for committing any crime under law , but only because they were related to a man .
The recently amended Section 41 of CrPC , which redefines police powers of arrest , imposes greater accountability on the law enforcement machinery while carrying out arrests , and ensures that unnecessary arrests are avoided .
While these amendments represent a step in the right direction to uphold basic human rights and constitutional rights of men and women , radical feminists are opposing these amendments .
They parrot exaggerated statistics of crimes and injustices against women , label them as gender - driven discrimination and abuse , and press for draconian legislations that penalize the innocent .
 Does penalizing innocent women under false cases bring justice to genuinely abused women ?
Recent data from the National Crime Records Bureau indicates that nearly twice as many married men , compared to married women , commit suicide every year , unable to withstand verbal , emotional , economic and physical abuse and legal harassment .
While every death of a young married woman is converted into a case of dowry death , leading to immediate arrest of the husband and in - laws , large - scale suicides of men are completely ignored .
While husbands and their relatives are under constant suspicion leading to frequent violation of their basic human rights , wives are rarely ever questioned leave alone prosecuted if a husband dies or ends his life under similar circumstances .
Suicides of men only make for the brief stories we often read in newspapers stating that a certain man “ killed himself due to family issues or financial problems ” .
No Ministry has been set up to support our sons and brothers .
No laws have been passed to protect them from abuse .
 Is the pain of a mother who lost a son to domestic abuse or legal terrorism any less than that of a mother who lost a daughter ?
Radical feminists disparaged the Indian family as oppressive and Indian men as abusive , and portrayed the streets as far safer for women than their own homes .
They have urged women to break free from the slavery of home , family and childrearing , and , instead , become slaves of government and corporate enterprises .
Not surprisingly , radical feminists have neither been able to ensure the security nor the happiness that they had promised to women outside the home .
They now cry foul saying that crimes and abuses against women have only been increasing .
Notwithstanding the fact that men and women are equally vulnerable to violence and crime committed by members of either sex , radical feminists claim that crime against women is gender - driven , thus , pitting women against men in the society .
 Does inciting a gender war solve women ’s problems within and outside the home ?
Radical feminists even went a step further to promote chaos in the society by pitting women against women .
They introduced IPC Section 498A which allows arrests and jailing of innocent mothers and sisters of men based on a mere complaint by a disgruntled daughter - in - law .
They introduced the Domestic Violence ( DV )
Act which allows a daughter - in - law to evict her mother - in - law out of her own property and render her homeless .
If you think this is outrageous , here is the coup de gras : on the one hand radical feminists demanded that adultery be treated as a crime when committed by men .
On the other hand , they demanded that adulterous women be considered as victims and not penalized under criminal law .
They ensured that the DV
Act empowers a wife to violate marital norms with impunity and also claim residence and maintenance rights in spite of being unfaithful to the husband .
Through the DV
Act they also sought to grant live - in partners and concubines the same legal status as a legally wedded wife .
The end result is that the protections and privileges , granted to a live - in - partner or concubine , violate the rights of a legally wedded wife and dependent female members of a man ’s family .
 Does women ’s equality mean empowerment of morally bankrupt women at the expense of responsible , family - loving women ?
The Ministry of Women and Child Development claims that safeguarding the interests of children is paramount in its agenda .
However , the same Ministry has left no stone unturned to ensure that children are mercilessly torn away from fathers in cases of marital separation or divorce .
The Ministry pushed the DV Act which even allows for the passing of ex-parte orders to take away the custody of a child from the father without a just and fair enquiry to assess the suitability of guardianship by either or both parents .
The Act includes provisions for passing of restraining orders that eliminate all contact between a father and child , only based on the self - serving statements of a vindictive wife .
Thus , the DV
Act violates a child ’s right to the love and affection of both parents , and promotes a fatherless society .
 Does women ’s empowerment mean destroying family harmony and creating a fatherless society ?
Radical feminists raise a hue and cry about dowry harassment by husbands and in - laws and portray India as a country where brides are routinely burned for dowry .
They spread paranoia about how unsafe women are in their marital homes because of the “ evil practice ” of dowry .
The same radical feminists do not oppose extravagant marriages or giving of dowry .
Consequently , the ever increasing marriage related expenses in the present consumerist economy are causing mortal fear in the minds of parents about giving birth to a girl .
Radical feminists who turn a blind eye to excessive marriage expenditures and giving of dowry , but indulge in alarmism about dowry harassment are , in fact , promoting female foeticide and discrimination against the female child .
These very feminists turn around and blame all the problems of their own creation on what they call the “ male - dominated society ” in order to garner funds from international agencies , and also to lobby for more stringent anti-male laws that aid legal terrorism and violation of basic human rights .
 Is the cause of women ’s empowerment synonymous with Gobbelian propaganda , legal terrorism and human rights violations ?
Radical feminists , who claim to represent the interests of all women , have been pushing for more and more rights and privileges , disregarding how many existing rights , opportunities and privileges are poorly utilized and even quite often misused by women .
They advocate rights and privileges for women without prescribing any concomitant duties or responsibilities towards the family and society .
Consequently , today , there are more women who are separated or divorced .
There are more women indulging in illicit relationships .
There are more unwanted pregnancies .
There are more women raising fatherless children .
There are more literate but uneducated and morally bankrupt women , who are living parasitic lives by siphoning money away from an estranged husband or partner .
There are more women who abuse laws to destroy families and the society , as they themselves self - destruct .
 Is this the notion of women ’s empowerment that hard - working , self - respecting and individualistic women subscribe to ?
It will not be an exaggeration to state that the Ministry of Women and Child Development and organizations like the National Commission for Women are protecting the interests of unscrupulous women , while the rest of the society pays the price .
The recent Mangalore pub incident and the responses of radical feminists represent another good example of women ’s empowerment gone awry .
In the past , when rural women destroyed liquor shops and beat up men who drank or sold alcohol , they became heroes and their acts were cheered .
Achieving prohibition was seen as a victory of the women ’s movement and a sign of women ’s empowerment .
In the recent times , the Minister of Women and Child Development dealt a death blow to the women ’s movement by championing urban women ’s right to frequent pubs and drink as a token of their empowerment and equality with men .
The National Commission for Women seems to be more passionate about protecting women indulging in the luxury of drinking alcohol in pubs , while 30 % of Indian women still walk up to 10 kilometers everyday to fetch a pot of drinking water , which is a basic necessity .
It has become crystal clear that radical feminists only create more problems in the name of solving existing ones .
They can neither device nor support sustainable solutions , policies and laws which will actually benefit women because if the status of women improves , the gender card will be rendered redundant , and can longer be used to reap any political or financial gains .
The survival of radical feminist outfits and politicians who dance to their tunes depends on stoking anti-male sentiments , destroying the family and creating chaos in the society .
It is high time sensible , responsible and enlightened women take charge of the situation and restore sanity in the society before things go out of hand .
All India Forgotten Women ( AIFW ) and Mothers and Sisters Initiative ( MASI ) comprise of women who work towards promoting family harmony and true gender equality , with the goals of maintaining social stability and nurturing responsible citizens in the country .
On the occasion of International Women ’s Day 2009 , we make the following demands to the Government of India :
• We demand immediate implementation of CrPC Amendments 2008 to protect us and our dear ones from legal terrorism and human rights violations .
• We demand equal protection to men and women under law .
• We demand laws and policies that promote family harmony .
• We demand severe penalty for anyone misusing legal provisions to settle personal scores .
• We demand that balanced , responsible , family - loving women are given charge of the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the National Commission for Women .
• We demand a Ministry for Men to cater to the needs and welfare of our brothers and sons .
We request esteemed members of the print and electronic media to join us and provide unprecedented coverage for our event .

REUTERS / Vivek Prakash
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Google ’s Android operating system is gaining support in the mobile industry , with 8 million Android phones to be sold in 2009 , up 10 - fold from a year ago , research firm Strategy Analytics said on Monday .
With the overall handset market shrinking as economies slow globally , the mobile industry is focusing investment on more advanced smartphones and their software .
Google ’s Android was introduced in the United States in the second half of 2008 , and now all top cell phone vendors except Nokia have said they would use Android .
“ Android is now in a good position to become a top - tier player in smartphones over the next two to three years , ” said Neil Mawston , a director at Strategy Analytics .
Mawston said handset vendors and operators like T - Mobile and Vodafone are attracted to Android ’s relatively low - cost licensing model , its semi-open - source structure and Google ’s support for services .
Despite the 10 - fold growth forecast for 2009 , with 8 million phones sold Android would lag far behind market leader Symbian , and Research in Motion , Microsoft , or Apple .
On average , the smartphone market is expected to grow 10 - 20 percent this year from 152 million phones sold last year .
Roughly half of these used Symbian operating system , while RIM sold 23.5 million , Microsoft 20 million and Apple 13.7 million phones , Strategy Analytics said .
Nokia bought out other shareholders of Symbian last year and gave all its software to an independent foundation , which now develops it on an open - source basis .
Nokia uses only Symbian software in its smartphones , while Symbian is also the key platform for Sony Ericsson , which has said it will also use Windows and Android as complementary offerings .
The early bird may get the worm , but the night owl has more stamina , a new study suggests .
The differences come from the interactions between two regions of the brain , including one that is home to the master circadian clock .
It has long been known that some people have a predilection for the " early to bed , early to rise " sleep schedule , while others prefer to sleep in and stay up until the wee hours .
Researchers at the Université de Liège in Belgium used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to monitor the brains of individuals from both groups to look for changes in how their attention was focused throughout the day .
The participants went to a sleep clinic , where they followed their normal sleep schedule .
At 1.5 hours after waking up and again at 10.5 hours , they had to perform a task that required sustained attention .
The researchers found no difference in the attention levels of the two groups at 1.5 hours after waking , but the night owls were more focused than the early birds after 10.5 hours spent awake .
The difference was a result of the shift in the balance between the two mechanisms that control alertness : the light - triggered circadian signal and the buildup of the pressure to sleep through the day ( called the homeostatic process ) , the researchers said .
As the day wears on and the time since sleep becomes greater , the pressure to sleep mounts ; at the same time , the continued daylight triggers the circadian signal that promotes wakefulness .
While researchers had thought that the two systems operated independently , the study found that " the two are always interacting together , " said study co-author Phillipe Peigneux .
In the night owls , increased activity was seen in two parts of the brain at 10.5 hours — the suprachiasmatic nucleus area and the locus coeruleus — that are involved in regulating the circadian signal .
Essentially , the circadian signal was winning out over the pressure to sleep .
In the early birds , on the other hand , " the sleep pressure prevents the expression of the circadian signal , " so those individuals were less able to keep their attention focused , Peigneux told LiveScience .
Peigneux said this information could be useful in job decisions : " If you have a night job , it 's better to be an evening person , " he said .
However , other research has shown that night shift work could cause symptoms that , if left untreated , could lead to diabetes , obesity and cardiovascular disease .
Peigneux and his colleagues , including Christina Schmidt , who led the new study , hope to see how these differences affect other cognitive tasks , such as learning and memory .
The study , detailed in the April 24 issue of the journal Science , was supported by the Belgian Fond National de la Recherche Scientifique , the Fondation Médicale Reine Elisabeth , and the University of Liège .
One of the things that has kept Moore 's Law rolling along is our ability to fashion chips with ever - smaller features .
The masks that produce the features of a chip are made by a process called photolithography , in which light is used to etch a pattern on a photosensitive surface .
The size of features you can create are proportional to the wavelength of light , so the formula for shrinking chips has been pretty simple : use shorter wavelengths .
Unfortunately , with today 's chips , we 're running into the UV end of the spectrum , and running up against our ability to manipulate light at these wavelengths .
Three papers released to Science Express describe techniques that might get us past this roadblock .
Building features with donut - shaped lasers
For two of the papers , the technique is n't actually new .
Instead , the basic approach is similar to one developed for capturing microscope images of biological samples called STED ( stimulated emission depletion ) microscopy , which our own Chris Lee has written about extensively .
STED produces images using fluorescent molecules by exciting the molecules with a narrow laser beam , and then hitting them with a second , donut - shaped laser that forces the fluorescent molecules back to the ground state .
The net result is that the only molecules left glowing are the ones in the middle of the donut hole , and it 's possible to make that hole smaller than the wavelength of the light involved .
Basically , if you replace " fluorescent molecule " with " photoactivated polymer , " you get the gist of the new technique .
The researchers used a chemical reaction that is catalyzed by light to produce a stable polymer .
Using this technique on its own , it 's possible to create a pattern that 's roughly proportional to the size of the laser you use to start the reaction .
The two research groups simply found ways of using the donut - shaped laser to shut the polymerization reaction down .
For the first paper , the technique is pretty simple .
The authors created a mixture of chemicals similar to one that would work for a standard , light - active polymerization : it included the monomer form of the target polymer , a chemical that can be photoactivated in a way that would trigger polymer formation .
But the mixture also contained a third chemical , activated by a second wavelength of light , that shuts this reaction down .
The reaction was activated by the narrow laser beam as normal , but that light was accompanied by a donut - shaped laser in the wavelength that activated the inhibitor , which severely limited the scope of the polymerization .
The technique allowed them to produce features much smaller than this sort of photo - activated polymerization normally allows .
Because this technique uses two separate lasers and different chemical reactions , it can be used to scan a pattern fairly quickly .
The second paper takes a somewhat different approach , one that trades speed for even better resolution .
Instead of using a chemical reaction that would proceed once a single photon was absorbed , they relied on molecules that had to absorb two photons at the laser 's wavelength before reacting , a technique called multiphoton absorption polymerization , or MAP .
MAP is slower than a single - photon reaction , but confines the reaction to the highest - intensity portion of the laser beam .
The authors then identified a molecule that underwent a slow polymerization reaction after being hit by two photons from the central beam .
This allowed the authors to hit the sample with a short , femtosecond pulse of the central laser , and then insert a delay before hitting them with a donut - shaped laser at the same wavelength .
By this point , any molecules that absorbed a single photon had lost it already , while those that picked up two had n't started polymerizing yet .
As a result , the donut shaped laser could n't start new reactions , but could block those molecules that might polymerize from continuing their reaction .
Although it was slower , the technique produced impressive refinements in spatial terms : the features produced in the tests went down to 1/20th of the wavelength of the laser .
The laser itself produced fairly long wavelength light ( 800 nm ) , so the features were only on par with current cutting - edge processes .
But the authors suggest that , with the right combination of lasers and reactant , they might be able to get it down to 10nm .
Building an optical gate
Paper number three has nothing in common with the first two other than the use of lasers .
In this case , the authors used a combination of an interference pattern and a reversible , light - activated chemical reaction to get features down below anything Intel is currently shipping .
The technique relies on the chemical reaction shown at the top of this page .
When hit with the longer wavelength of light , the molecule would adopt the form on the left , at which point it would absorb light from the shorter wavelength , which is in the UV range ; when it did , the reaction is reversed .
By adjusting the relative intensities of the two lasers , the authors could control the amount of short wavelength light that got through .
The authors then put a layer of this chemical on top of a compound that can be etched away by light at the shorter wavelength .
They then exposed this setup to a set of overlapping interference patterns , one for each of the two wavelengths ( these look a bit like two sine waves , where peaks represent high intensity light ) .
The presence of the chemical acted like a gatekeeper , as the long - wavelength light kept it in a form that prevented the UV light from reaching the substrate it could etch .
The only place that the UV light could get to that substrate was at the troughs of the long - wavelength interference pattern .
Even in those locations , the UV light was n't strong enough unless its peak intensity was located precisely at these troughs .
As a result , there 's only a very narrow space where the UV light can get through the chemical layer and reach the etching substrate , smaller than the wavelength of the light .
With their setup , the authors were able to create features 36nm in size , which is roughly a tenth of the wavelength of the incident light .
It 's important to emphasize that these techniques are both at the initial demonstration phases , so they 're not going to be put into use immediately .
But that also means that there 's the potential for some significant refinement if either of the approaches get commercialized .
In either case , they serve as a clear indication that there may be ways to sneak well below the limits imposed by a light 's wavelength .

Medical marijuana advocates rally for drug ’s expansion Small group says drug could help more Nevadans , seeks reform of laws
Reader poll
Should laws be changed so sick Nevadans have more access to medical marijuana ?
Yes .
No .

Sun coverage Prescription painkiller use in Nevada
Document Full text of Senate Bill 262
About a dozen advocates for medical marijuana rallied Saturday outside the Regional Justice Center -- a symbolic location because the issue is medical and not criminal , said organizer Beth Soloe , chairwoman of Nevada NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
The rally was intended to generate understanding about the facts of medical marijuana -- mainly that it is legal in Nevada .
“ More people need to be more willing to talk about it and stop being scared , ” she said .
Nevada is one of 14 states to allow residents to possess and grow marijuana for the medical treatment of AIDS , cancer , glaucoma , multiple sclerosis and for chronic or debilitating medical conditions .
Proponents of medical marijuana said the negative stigma associated with the plant continues to prevent it from getting to people who would benefit from its medicinal effects .
Sixty - five percent of voters approved a ballot initiative in November 2000 amending the state constitution to recognize the medical use of marijuana .
The law took effect in October 2001 and allows authorized Nevadans to grow up to seven plants -- only three mature -- and possess an ounce for their own use .
The laws are too strict , said Soloe , who favors full legalization of marijuana and a system operated by the government to take the burden off the end users .
“ We ’re talking about people with cancer that are dying and old people , sick people and people with pain and are crippled .
They ca n’t be expected to be botanists and grow plants , ” she said .
“ You have just everyday Joes out there trying to grow pot in their closet for their friend because their friend is too sick to grow it for themselves .
That does n’t work for what we need for patients . ”
After hurting his shoulder playing high school football , Jonathan Parsons sought pain relief from his doctor .
Instead of granting him comfort , the prescription drugs hooked him for more than five years and made him groggy and short - tempered , he said .
He eventually found solace from medical marijuana .
Parsons , 29 , and his brother James started a nonprofit organization called Medical Cannabis Consultants of Nevada that helps people enroll in the state program .
The cost to register in the state program is $ 150 annually , but with doctor charges , fingerprint fees and a charge for producing the identity card the cost is closer to $ 500 .
As of March 30 , there are 564 people enrolled in the Nevada Medical Marijuana program .
James Parsons said the number of Nevadans who need medical marijuana is in the hundreds of thousands based on the number of people who use prescription pain killers .
Nevadans per person use more hydrocodone -- the ingredient in the drugs Vicodin , Lortab and Norco -- than residents of any other state , according to Drug Enforcement Administration data .
Nevadans rank fourth nationally in per-person consumption of methadone , morphine and oxycodone , the main ingredient in OxyContin .
“ We do n’t have a growing problem , it ’s a dead - on epidemic , ” Parsons said .
“ There ’s no reason why responsible adults should n’t be able to at least look into ( medical marijuana ) .
Everybody has the choice of what they can and ca n’t put into their body . ”
Henderson resident Gerald David Hart , 20 , is working with the Parsons brothers on obtaining his medical marijuana identity card .
He said he does n’t like taking medication for his ankle injury and suffers from seizures .
“ Marijuana is the only thing to make me calm and make the pain go away , ” he said .
Although several states have legalized medical marijuana , possession and distribution is still illegal by federal laws .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the federal government will no longer prosecute medical marijuana clinics that operate in compliance with state laws .
There is a form of medical marijuana that the federal government does endorse -- Marinol .
Available by prescription in a pill , Marinol is produced by Solvay Pharmaceuticals and is the synthetic form of THC -- the psychoactive ingredient contained in marijuana .
It ’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration for relieving symptoms associated with chemotherapy for cancer patients and to assist with loss of appetite with AIDS patients .
The FDA does not approve medications that can be smoked , saying it is a poor way to deliver medicine and can contain harmful chemicals and carcinogens that are byproducts of smoking .
Proponents of smoking medical marijuana say Marinol is too expensive .
The Nevada Senate is reviewing a bill ( SB262 ) that would impose stricter penalties on marijuana except on those people in the state medical program .
Several of those rallying in Las Vegas said the laws need to be revamped but harsher penalties are not the answer .
The medical marijuana law is based on flawed logic , James Parsons said .
“ It ’s one thing to have a program but if everything that happens toward the program is more of a deterrent , then how do you expect to get anywhere , ” Parsons said .
“ It ’s almost like a direct defiance to the voters that made and wanted this to happen . ”
Ken Livingstone , the former mayor of London , has launched a scathing attack on Gordon Brown and warned that Labour will lose a growing number of party supporters if he stays on as prime minister .
In a wide - ranging interview with Total Politics magazine , due to be published on Friday , Livingstone also blamed Brown 's leadership for his mayoral defeat to Boris Johnson last May following a " horrendous " election campaign .
Livingstone used the interview to claim that his criticisms of Brown early in his ministerial reign had been vindicated .
" I was very critical of the first two years .
The passage of time has shown me to be right , " said Livingstone , who caused uproar in 1998 while still a Labour MP by calling for Brown to be sacked as chancellor .
Livingstone told Total Politics that the Labour government was failing to do something for " working - class " people at its peril and warned that the far right " do well " when a Labour government does badly .
He said : " The BNP will continue eating into the Labour vote until the government realises it needs to do something for working - class people . "
Livingstone insisted that none of his major decisions in his two terms as mayor were " wrong " , conceding that his only mistakes were in being " rude to journalists " .
" If you could have taken away the national dimension I think I would have won [ last year 's mayoral election ] because Boris 's negatives were more than mine .
We did monthly polling and from the moment Boris announced [ his candidacy ] my ratings went up and up .
" It was only in November they started coming down .
I then realised it was just tracking the national party 's polling .
Immediately after the budget , Labour 's figures and mine just went off a precipice .
The figures slowly came back , and if we had had another two months we might have pulled it back . "
He hinted that he would stand as an independent mayoral candidate again if the party indulged in " ballot rigging " , which he said occurred in Labour 's first mayoral selection process in 2000 .
Labour threw Livingstone out after he failed to win the party 's nomination .
He then ran against the party 's chosen candidate , Frank Dobson .
Livingstone was hit by a controversial system in which votes from sitting Labour MPs and MEPs were weighted more heavily than votes from rank - and - file members .
Livingstone said : " There was a huge amount of ballot stealing going on .
Piara Khabra [ the former Labour MP for Ealing Southall , now deceased ] was going round boasting how he had personally collected 300 ballots .
They have to have one member one vote .
I will be happy to submit myself to one member one vote and abide by the result .
I was happy to do it last time , but they changed it . "
Despite returning to the Labour fold to win a successful second term in 2004 , the former mayor has made himself unpopular with a number of Labour parliamentary insiders by touting himself as the party 's best choice for the 2012 election .
The pool of candidates in four years ' time is expected to be crowded with potential candidates , especially if some London Labour MPs lose their parliamentary seats at the next general election .
Livingstone also used the interview to admit that he had revised his views of Johnson , which he said he had based on the " racist , reactionary , negative neocon piffle " he had written over the course of his journalistic career .
Now he realised that Johnson 's weakness was his lack of " ideology " , he said .
" Boris does n't believe in anything at all , except that Boris should rule the world " .
Livingstone caused more controversy today when he came under fire for setting a " poor example " after escaping a £ 20 fine despite getting on a train at Paddington station without a ticket .
The First Great Western train company denied that the former mayor received preferential treatment .
A spokeswoman said : " When he got to Slough , Mr Livingstone approached a member of our staff , apologised and offered to pay before being asked .
Our approach is to give passengers the benefit of the doubt before issuing a penalty fare .
" He said he was in a massive hurry and had not obtained a ticket .
We took the same approach with 10 other passengers who were on this train .
There was no question of Mr Livingstone being given preferential treatment . "
Norman Baker , the Liberal Democrats ' transport spokesman , told the Daily Mail : " This sends out the wrong message .
It 's a poor example to set . "

Once again , religious leaders are suddenly experts in science !
FAIL .
We just saw how the research that supported the theory that being gay is a choice , which can be changed through therapy , is a giant bungle or horsecrap .
But now New York ’s newly installed Archbishop Timothy Dolan finds himself turning to the very science that ’s responsible for disproving creationism as a legitimate excuse for denying gays and lesbians the right to marry .
“ There ’s an in - built code of right and wrong that ’s embedded in the human DNA , ” Dolan tells the New York Post .
“ Hard - wired into us is a dictionary , and the dictionary defines marriage as between one man , one woman for life , please God , leading to the procreation of human life .
And if we begin to tamper with the very definition of marriage , then we ’re going to be in big trouble .
We ’re not anti-gay — we ’re pro the most basic definition of marriage . ”
Haha .
Dolan is pro-marriage , everyone !
Remember when the dictionary that was hard - wired into us told us to use marriage as a means of property transfer ?
And then later , when that hard - wired dictionary was updated with v3.445 b to make interracial marriage no longer some big ethical dilemma ?
And is it the uber - conservative Muslim world that is operating by a different dictionary — maybe they prefer Merriam - Webster to American Heritage — when they say wives must submit to their husbands sexual advances no matter what ?
Oh , and this we love : “ We ’re not against gays .
The Catholic Church would defend the human dignity of gay people .
If gay people were being persecuted or their basic rights taken away — ”
Well let us stop you there , Timothy .
BECAUSE IT’S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW .
Where ’s your statement about Iraq ’s gays ?
Where is Pope Benedict’s ?
Listen to Dolan ’s entire bungled argument ( around the 3:15 mark ) :
I try to stay out of language wars these days .
I find the whole endeavour incredibly tedious .
I do n’t really feel like arguing whether OCaml is better than Ruby is better than Scala is better than brainfuck is better than C .
I like them all ( ok maybe not brainfuck ) , and there are valid arguments for and against each of them .
But one thing I have a lot of trouble with is bad arguments .
Not “ arguments I disagree with ” , but arguments which are simply outright bad .
Robert Fischer has a post on his blog : Scala is not a functional language .
It ’s not the first time this idea has come up .
It ’s not an idea entirely without merit .
Scala ’s functional features are certainly not as seamless to use as one might hope .
The problem is that while it is not an idea without merit , its presentation is certainly one without content .
As per usual , every time this comes up , no one is actually willing to say what on earth they mean by “ functional programming language ” .
This problem is ubiquitous .
Consider the following wikipedia entry :
In computer science , functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data .
It emphasizes the application of functions , in contrast to the imperative programming style , which emphasizes changes in state .
Functional programming has its roots in the lambda calculus , a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate function definition , function application , and recursion .
Many functional programming languages can be viewed as embellishments to the lambda calculus .
Notice the bait and switch there ?
It defines “ functional programming ” and then talks about “ functional programming languages “ .
Everyone does this .
The only unambiguous definition you find which includes the term “ functional programming language ” is that of Purely functional language .
This is much less ambiguous , but it ’s also the case that the vast majority of people arguing about whether Scala ( or other language of choice ) is functional are comparing it to a decidedly impure language .
Certainly neither Clojure nor OCaml are purely functional .
On the other hand , if you choose “ functional programming language ” to simply mean “ supports functional programming ” then suddenly you have to acknowledge various languages like Ruby as functional and for some reason this makes people uncomfortable .
So instead we end up with all sorts of hand waving and mumbling and no one is able to have a useful discussion because everyone is too busy making assertions which ca n’t be argued with because they do n’t mean anything .
So no one defines the term , but everyone seems to “ know what it means ” .
And what it inevitably means is “ shares features with this language which I use and like and consider to be a functional language ” .
For a particular extreme example , consider the following conversation on reddit from the last time this subject came up :
vagif :
Well , here ’s my understanding of this disagreement .
I think many people ( me included ) do not feel that Scala is functional enough .
It is not because of the mutable variables .
It all boils down to simple syntax .
That ’s why completely imperative and old fashioned language CL ( i use sbcl ) feels to me much more functional than Scala will ever be with its modern functional features like pattern matching , type inference and list comprehensions .
“ Functional ” for me means simple small core of orthogonal features .
“ Functional ” for me means – List processing .
“ Functional ” for me means no premature optimization ( deciding to use arrays instead of lists because they are faster etc . )
Obviously , trying to accommodate java OO model , makes Scala way to complicated , arcane , baroque in its syntax , to feel functional enough .
DRMacIver :
I enjoy the fact that the word “ function ” does not appear in your definition of functional … vagif :
And for a good reason .
Functions are part of any imperative language .
That does not make them more functional .
It is all that infrastructure , that allows for easy juggling those functions , that makes a language functional .
Passing them as parameters and return values , anonymous functions , closures , polymorphic functions ( be it a result of type inference or dynamic nature of language ) .
It is this small core of orthogonal features , all geared up for list processing , that truly creates a functional feeling in a programmer .
This sort of woolly thinking is endemic in these arguments .
Please try to avoid it .
If you ’re not willing to define “ functional programming language ” in a way that is at least moderately unambiguous and does n’t involve arguments about “ feelings ” or simply feature comparisons with some language which you state as an example of functional programming , do n’t bother making arguments about whether a language is functional or not .
Of course , once you start defining the term people will start arguing about the definitions .
This is pretty tedious , I know .
But as tedious as arguing about definitions is , it ca n’t hold a candle to arguing without definitions .

• ' Nothing has changed ' says Khaldoon Al Mubarak • ' Mark has been under pressure from outside the club '
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has confirmed Mark Hughes will remain as the manager next season .
Hughes ' position has been the subject of speculation since the Abu Dhabi United Group , headed by Sheikh Mansour , became the owners in September last year .
Al Mubarak was keen to make a statement about the manager before City 's last match of the season on Sunday against Bolton Wanderers at Eastlands .
" I have been surprised at all the speculation because I have always been consistent with everyone on the subject of the manager , " he said .
" Every time I have spoken I have said we have the highest confidence in Mark and I would like to reiterate that now .
Mark will be our manager next season ; nothing has changed .
" It has been a difficult season with all the rumours about Mark 's future and the number of players we have been linked with .
" There has been incredible and unnecessary pressure put on Mark from outside the club .
From my perspective , I think we have come a long way and I am looking for a big finish to the season .
" We have accomplished things since January and now we can start focusing on next season . "
Al Mubarak is convinced City will improve next season .
" This is a club that has had 10 managers in 15 years and changes of ownership , " said the chairman .
" It is hard to believe we have ever had a real pre-season .
" This time we will have that and will do so with a year 's experiences behind us and that will make us stronger .
Next year is going to be better than this one .
The club has a lot more stability . "

This is the first post of my pre-RailsConf series of blog posts on Rails application performance optimization .
I 'll be presenting at RailsConf about this and many other aspects of performance optimization on May 5th , so you 're welcome to join me at RailsConf and please watch for more performance - related articles in this blog .
Imagine a situation when your Ruby code is slow .
Not so hard to imagine , is n't it ?
Now imagine that your ran a profiler ( like we did ) and figured out that you can do nothing to optimize .
Hard to imagine , you say ?
Not when you heavily use Ruby Date class .
So what to do when there 's nothing to optimize in Ruby ?
Simple answer - use C !
Here is the story how we optimized our application by using Date class partially rewritten in C .
Why Date Class Is Slow in Ruby
Ruby Date implementation is an amazing piece of code handling probably any possible date usecase .
But that flexibility comes not without a cost - the performance of Date class is very poor .
It takes a long time to create Date objects , print them and compare them .
This simple benchmark should give you an idea of how slow Date is :
> puts Benchmark .realtime { 1000.times { Date.civil ( 2008 , 7 , 15 ) } } 0.080 > puts Benchmark .realtime { 1000.times { Time.mktime ( 2008 , 7 , 15 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) } } 0.005
Wtf you say ?
Contructing Date 's is 16 x slower than Time's ?
Yes it is .
To understand the reason we need to dig into Date class internals .
When you create a Date from " civil " Gregorian year , month and day , the constructor converts those into the Astronomical Julian Day number which is a number of days since midday January 1st , 4713BC UTC :
> d = Date.today > d.to_s " 2008-07 - 15 " > d.ajd Rational ( 4909325 , 2 ) # this is a fractional astronomical Julian day number > d.ajd.to_f 2454662.5 # 2454662 days and a half passed since the initial epoch
As you can see , any civil date is assumed to be the " start " of a day hence it always have half of the day subtracted from it .
Note also that Ruby implementation uses Rational class to store the fraction without losing precision .
It 's extremely easy and flexible to work on dates as on numbers but to obtain those numbers you have to do conversion which is roughly 20 arithmetic operations and 3 round - downs .
This conversion takes place every time you construct or print the date .
In addition to that , the constructor has to create an instance of Rational class .
Just because Ruby interpreter is genuinely slow , all those operations take time ... too much time and you can do absolutely nothing to optimize them !
The Impact
Now we know that Date is slow , but will it hurt the real world application ?
The answer really depends on how much you use dates .
If you store large amounts of dates in the database , be prepared for the worst .
As usual my example will be Acunote , our online project management application written in Rails .
One of the things Acunote does is it keeps track of people 's progress .
To do that it records all changes in estimated and remaining times for each task in the system thus storing a lot of < date , number > tuples .
Using the historical data , Acunote draws burndown graphs where horizontal axis represents dates and vertical - total work remainings for each date .
Obviously , to draw such graphs we need to fetch data from database , perform simple additions and output it .
Sounds simple but works slow .
Here 's what profiler says for the burndown drawing request :
Total : 2.490000 % self total self wait child calls name 7.23 0.66 0.18 0.00 0.48 18601 < Class :: Rational >#reduce 6.83 0.27 0.17 0.00 0.10 5782 < Class :: Date>#jd_to_civil 6.43 0.21 0.16 0.00 0.05 31528 Rational#initialize 5.62 0.23 0.14 0.00 0.09 18601 Integer#gcd 4.82 0.12 0.12 0.00 0.00 1 Magick :: Image#to_blob ...
The top 4 method calls have nothing to do with burndown drawing .
As it turns out they are called from Date#civil and Date# <=> methods :
Total : 2.490000 total 1.56 < Class :: Date >#civil 0.11 Date #<=> ...
Great !
We spend 65 % of the request time just constructing and comparing dates .
How to optimize ?
We had no idea because it 's quite hard to optimize 20 additions and multiplications that take place inside Date class without rewriting the whole thing .
The only workable solution was to rewrite slow parts in Date in C and we had been dreaming about that until we found that Ryan Tomayko already did exactly that .
Date :: Performance To The Rescue
Date :: Performance library implements several core methods of Date class in C replacing the slow Ruby ones .
What 's important , Date constructor and conversion methods were rewritten and are now 20 times faster !
> puts Benchmark .realtime { 1000.times { Date.civil ( 2008 , 7 , 15 ) } } 0.004 > puts Benchmark .realtime { 1000.times { Time.mktime ( 2008 , 7 , 15 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) } } 0.005
In Acunote the burndown operation immediately became 2.5 x faster after we used Date : : Performance and all Date / Rational related records were absolutely absent from the profiler output !
Total : 0.950000 % self total self wait child calls name 12.63 0.12 0.12 0.00 0.00 1 Magick :: Image#to_blob 8.42 0.17 0.08 0.00 0.09 602 Array#each_index 5.26 0.07 0.05 0.00 0.02 6992 Class#new !
5.26 0.09 0.05 0.00 0.04 42683 Kernel#=== 5.26 0.05 0.05 0.00 0.00 2 Magick :: GradientFill#fill
Date :: Performance is designed as an addition to the original Date class .
You just install date - performance from source from the GitHub project page and require ' date / performance ' in your code .
Date :: Performance versions 0.4.6 and earlier did n't overwrite Date : :<=> method ( which was also reported by the profiler as a slowdown ) so I went on and implemented it in C as well .
The implementation is in Date :: Performance 0.4.7 or on our company GitHub date - performance fork .
This gives additional 10 % improvement .
There 's one important thing about Date : : Performance - make sure to run tests for your code and check that it works .
Date :: Performance is not a drop - in replacement .
Known regressions are :
month argument to the constructor can not be negative ;
day argument to the constructor can not be negative in date - performance versions < 0.4.6 ( 0.4.6 has my patch applied already ) ;
Date cannot be compared with Float in 0.4.7 and later
There might be other regressions I do n't know about yet .
Conclusions
By using Date class partially reimplemented in C you can speedup your application 2.5 x !
To do that :
install Date :: Performance library from GitHub ;
require ' date / performance ' in your code ;
run the tests and if everything works - enjoy !
PS : many thanks to Ryan Tomayko for his rocket - fast Date implementation .

Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh describes ‘ executive assassination ring ’
By Eric Black
At a “ Great Conversations ” event at the University of Minnesota last night , legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hersh may have made a little more news than he intended by talking about new alleged instances of domestic spying by the CIA , and about an ongoing covert military operation that he called an “ executive assassination ring . ”
Hersh spoke with great confidence about these findings from his current reporting , which he has n’t written about yet .
In an email exchange afterward , Hersh said that his statements were “ an honest response to a question ” from the event ’s moderator , U of M Political Scientist Larry Jacobs and “ not something I wanted to dwell about in public . ”
Hersh did n’t take back the statements , which he said arise from reporting he is doing for a book , but that it might be a year or two before he has what he needs on the topic to be “ effective … that is , empirical , for even the most skeptical . ” 
The evening of great conversation , featuring Walter Mondale and Hersh , moderated by Jacobs and titled “ America ’s Constitutional Crisis , ”  looked to be a mostly historical review of events that have tested our Constitution , by a journalist and a high government officials who had experience with many of the crises .
And it was mostly historical , and a great conversation , in which Hersh and Mondale talked about the patterns by which presidents seem to get intoxicated by executive power , frustrated by the limitations on that power from Congress and the public , drawn into improper covert actions that exceed their constitutional powers , in the belief that they can get results and will never be found out .
Despite a few references to the Founding Fathers , the history was mostly recent , starting with the Viethnam War with much of it arising from the George W. Bush administration , which both men roundly denounced .
At the end of one answer by Hersh about how these things tend to happen , Jacobs asked : “ And do they continue to happen to this day ? ” 
Replied Hersh :
“ Yuh .
After 9/11 , I have n’t written about this yet , but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state .
Without any legal authority for it .
They have n’t been called on it yet .
That does happen .
“ Right now , today , there was a story in the New York Times that if you read it carefully mentioned something known as the Joint Special Operations Command — JSOC it ’s called .
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
They did not report to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff or to Mr. [ Robert ]
Gates , the secretary of defense .
They reported directly to him . …
“ Congress has no oversight of it .
It ’s an executive assassination ring essentially , and it ’s been going on and on and on .
Just today in the Times there was a story that its leaders , a three star admiral named [ William H. ]
McRaven , ordered a stop to it because there were so many collateral deaths .
“ Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That ’s been going on , in the name of all of us .
“ It ’s complicated because the guys doing it are not murderers , and yet they are committing what we would normally call murder .
It ’s a very complicated issue .
Because they are young men that went into the Special Forces .
The Delta Forces you ’ve heard about .
Navy Seal teams .
Highly specialized .
“ In many cases , they were the best and the brightest .
Really , no exaggerations .
Really fine guys that went in to do the kind of necessary jobs that they think you need to do to protect America .
And then they find themselves torturing people .
“ I ’ve had people say to me — five years ago , I had one say : “ ˜ What do you call it when you interrogate somebody and you leave them bleeding and they do n’t get any medical committee and two days later he dies .
Is that murder ?
What happens if I get before a committee ? ’
“ But they ’re not gonna get before a committee . ” 
Hersh , the best - known investigative reporter of his generation , writes about these kinds of issues for The New Yorker .
He has written often about JSOC , including , last July that :
“ Under the Bush Administration ’s interpretation of the law , clandestine military activities , unlike covert C.I.A. operations , do not need to be depicted in a Finding , because the President has a constitutional right to command combat forces in the field without congressional interference . ” 
( “ Finding ”  refers to a special document that a president must issue , although not make public , to authorize covert CIA actions . )
Here is a tape of the full Mondale - Hersh - Jacobs colloquy , a little over an hour , without the audience Q and A .
If you want to look for the Hersh statement quoted above , it ’s about at the 7:30 mark .
The rest of the evening was , as expected , full of worry and wisdom and quite a bit of Bush - bashing .
Jacobs walked the two elder statesmen through their experiences of :
The My Lai massacre , which Hersh first revealed publicly and which he last night called “ the end of innocence about us and war . ” 
The Pentagon Papers case , which Mondale called the best example of the “ government ’s potential for vast public deception . ” 
Henry Kissinger ’s secret dealings , mostly relating to the Vietnam War .
( Hersh , who has written volumes about Kissinger , said that he will always believe that whereas ordinary people count sheep to fall asleep , Kissinger “ has to count burned and maimed Cambodian babies . ” )
The Church Committee investigation of CIA and FBI abuses , in which Mondale played a major role .
( He talked about the fact that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover , not only spied on Martin Luther King but literally tried to drive him to suicide . )
The Iran Contra scandal .
( Hersh said the Reagan administration came to office with a clear goal of finding a way to finance covert actions , such as the funding of the Nicaraguan Contras , without appropriations so that Congress would n’t know about them .
Mondale noted that Reagan had signed a law barring further aid to the Contras , then participated in a scheme to keep the aid flowing .
Hersh said that two key veterans of Iran - Contra , Dick Cheney and national security official Elliot Abrams , were reunited in the George W. Bush White House and decided that the key lesson from Iran - Contra was that too many people in the administration knew about it . )
And the Bush - Cheney years .
( Said Hersh : “ The contempt for Congress in the Bush - Cheney White House was extaordinary . ” 
Said Mondale of his successor , Cheney and his inner circle : “ they ran a government within the government . ” 
Hersh added : “ Eight or nine neoconservatives took over our country . ” 
Mondale said that the precedents of abuse of vice presidential power by Cheney would remain “ like a loaded pistol that you leave on the dining room table . ” )
Jacobs pressed both men on the question of whether the frequent abuses of power show that the Constitution fails , because these things keep happening , or whether it works , because these things keep coming to light .
Mondale stuck with the happy answer .
“ The system has come through again and again , ”  he said .
Presidents always think they will get away with it , but eventually reporters like Hersh bring things to light , the public “ starts smelling this stuff , ”  the courts and the Congress get involved .
Presidents “ always , in the long run , find out that the system is stronger than they are . ” 
Hersh seemed more troubled by the repetitions of the pattern .
The “ beautiful thing about our system ”  is that eventually we get new leaders , he said .
“ The evil twosome , Cheney and Bush , left , ”  Hersh said .
But he also said “ it ’s really amazing to me that we manage to get such bad leadership , so consistently . ” 
And he added that both the press and the public let down their guard in the aftermath of 9/11 .
“ The major newspapers joined the [ Bush ] team , ”  Hersh said .
Top editors passed the message to investigative reporters not to “ pick holes ”  in what Bush was doing .
Violations of the Bill of Rights happened in the plain sight of the public .
It it was not only tolerated , but Bush was re-elected .
And even Mondale admitted that one of his greatest successes , laws reforming the FBI and CIA in the aftermath of the Church Committee , were supposed to fix the problem so that “ we would never have these problems again in the lifetime of anyone alive at the time , but of course we did . ” 

Shoppers have been finding their voice in stores during the recession
How do you deal with people who try to argue down a price ?
According to one charity shop manager : " They try to haggle , so I put the price up ! "
Haggling might not be successful with good causes , but profit - chasing retailers are becoming more accommodating with those consumers who give it a try .
And during the downturn there is increasing evidence that shoppers are looking to create their own bargains by playing salesmen at their own game .
The ancient art of haggling is simply parting with less cash than the original asking price .
It is a key part of the shopping experience , especially in markets , in some parts of the world .
And , as UK consumers develop their own skills , computer programmers are studying how an automated haggling system might evolve online .
They claim that within two years , mobile phones will be able to haggle for us .
Striking a deal Former bank worker Derek Arden is not a fan of round numbers , it seems .
He is the co-author of " 117 Handy Haggling Hints " .
Derek Arden has written extensively about how to negotiate bargains
Touring some stores with me , he explains who might want to engage in a personal price war .
" The people who do it tend to have fairly competitive personalities , " he says , flashing a smile in the direction of a sports shop attendant .
" It can be a drain on your time and energy if you do not enjoy it . "
To the casual observer it seems a fairly easy art .
In each store he attempts to engage the shopkeeper in the most friendly and interesting conversation they 've had that day .
On occasions , it can tilt towards flirtatiousness .
Throughout the chat he builds up enough knowledge to finally offer a deal or ask for a discount , similar to a salesman operating in the opposite direction .
DEREK ARDEN'S HAGGLING HINTS
Do your research before heading out to the shops Haggle for products with a big profit margin Pick someone with authority to do business with Smile , use humour and soft language Consider shopping at the end of the day
Tenants ' haggling ' as rents fall
But for the successful haggler , this is the end of the trading process .
" Information is power .
Everything is negotiable , " he explains , sipping an americano coffee which I bought at full price .
When haggling you need to choose a specific target , in terms of both the seller and the product .
Researching a typical price on the internet is a good start .
Spying who in the store might have the authority to offer a discount is another of Mr Arden 's suggestions .
But picking items that have a big profit margin for the retailer tends to be the best tip of all .
Price is right ?
In Monty Python 's film ' Life of Brian ' , the lead character struggles with the concept of haggling when he buys a false beard which he claims is " for the wife " .
No , no , no .
It 's not worth 10 .
You 're supposed to argue : ' What ?
Ten for that , you must be mad !'
Monty Python 's Life of Brian
It is a scene met with cringing recognition by UK holidaymakers who can find the routine tough work in overseas markets .
But mostly without realising it , the UK shopper has become more comfortable with haggling by asking stores to match the prices they have found online .
Price comparison websites are now part of the armoury for any money - saving consumer .
Most people searching for deals will ask , without embarrassment , for money off a slightly damaged product , or for a discount when paying with cash .
But it is not just consumer goods that have been the targets of hagglers .
In a report on falling rents , property website Globrix claimed that tenants were haggling over their tenancy agreements .
" It is not just a surplus of properties to let that is driving down rents  savvier tenants are also playing a role , " says Zaza Patterson , lettings manager at Carter Jonas estate agents .
" In some areas , where stock is particularly high , tenants , aware that they are spoilt for choice , have become very assertive over rents and are actively haggling .
Tenants hold all the trump cards and , increasingly , they know it .
" To avoid void periods and attract tenants , many landlords are increasingly offering incentives .
Some are offering a free month 's rental , others are including utility bills in the rent .
You also have situations where broadband may be offered within the rent .
Different landlords are doing different things to ensure they stand out . "
Artificial intelligence
Even though more of us are becoming more confident in haggling over what we buy or rent , it remains rare to see day - to - day in the shops .
Nick Jennings is developing a computer - based haggling program Part of this is cultural - the result of the British reserve .
So , would n't it be nice if a computer program could overcome our embarrassment and do it for us ?
Nick Jennings , a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton , is creating a breed of artificial intelligence that can negotiate on our behalf .
" Throughout history negotiation is how we have traded .
The fixed price is a relatively recent phenomenon , " he explains .
He is developing software , with an embedded algorithm , that has the ability to adapt to the various bits of information it is fed by suppliers .
In practical terms , this will mean the consumer can tell a computer what he or she wants to buy and the maximum they are willing to spend .
The program then does the donkey work .
It will consider what offers are being made by different suppliers and use various tricks of negotiation .
" It wo n't just try to knock 10 % off the price .
It will be tough with some and easier with others , as well as taking into account reputation and trust , " he says .
It will require suppliers to sign up , but Professor Jennings argues that those that do n't will be missing from the marketplace and so it is not in their interests .
The software is currently in prototype form , but he believes that in 12 to 18 months it could be an application on mobile phones .
Haggling might become as easy as sending a text message .

What if I told you there was a new movie coming out that featured Gary Coleman , Ron Jeremy , Scottie Pippen , Midgets , and Mascots ?
Sounds like comedic genius right ?
They should just give them the Oscar right now .
Well such a movie has been created , and Gunaxin is hosting a Pre-Party for a screening of it at the Tribeca Film Festival .
It is called Midgets vs. Mascots , and you can be among the first people in the country to see it .
We ’ll have some free tickets to give away next week to some lucky folks in the New York area , but for now , we wanted to introduce you to the movie .
From the site :
In this “ Borat ” meets “ Jackass ” shockumentary , 5 little people and 5 mascots battle for $ 1 million apiece in competitions like “ how few insults does it take to get punched in a bar ” , and “ alligator wrestling ” .
Gary Coleman , leading the littles as himself , is a comedic freight train ( or train wreck ) as he gets into actual fist fights with mascots , coaches and even Scottie Pippen .
Like “ Borat ” , much of the film is shot “ guerilla improv ” as they surprise unsuspecting bystanders when the teams crash restaurants , bars and neighborhoods during outrageous competitions .
Ok , so maybe not Oscar material , but certainly damn funny , especially if you are drunk .
Here is the Trailer to give you a better idea of what to expect :
So I am sure now you are wondering how the hell you ’re going to see this movie , and join Gunaxin and Scottie Pippen for the Pre-Party .

Duke Nukem Forever is the long - awaited follow - up to 1997's Duke Nukem 3D .
While details are slim , longtime Duke voice actor Jon St. John returns , as well as music composed by Jeremy and Julian Soule .
We 're still waiting for an official announcement , but 3DRealms '
George Broussard revealed that it has reached a new milestone this week , with 71 more tasks to complete from the original 800-900 .
Newsday reports that New York City has purchased 40 Nissan Altima Hybrids for its police fleet .
NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg pointed out that the Smyrna , TN - built Altimas enjoy a patriotic advantage over the Canadian - produced Crown Victorias and Chevy Impalas that comprise most of the NYPD ’s fleet of 2,400 patrol vehicles .
“ It is an added benefit that buying these cars helps create jobs in America , ” says Bloomberg .
According to the report , some traffic enforcement agents have been using Toyota Prius hybrids since 2002 , and police duty captains , who respond to major incidents , have already been using GMC Yukon sport utility vehicle hybrids .
“ We ’ve had no downside , ” says Police Commissioner Ray Kelly of his force ’s hybrid use .

Megan McAllister , the NJ woman engaged to suspected Craigslist killer Philip Markoff , is moving on with her life after dumping the jailed medical student .
She was spotted visiting him at his jail yesterday —
We are likely to be listening for a long time , even if there are many worlds Intelligent civilisations are out there and there could be thousands of them , according to an Edinburgh scientist .
The discovery of more than 330 planets outside our solar system in recent years has helped refine the number of life forms that are likely to exist .
The current research estimates that there are at least 361 intelligent civilisations in our Galaxy and possibly as many as 38,000 .
The work is reported in the International Journal of Astrobiology .
Even with the higher of the two estimates , however , it is not very likely that contact could be established with alien worlds .
While researchers often come up with overall estimates of the likelihood of intelligent life in the universe , it is a process fraught with guesswork ; recent guesses put the number anywhere between a million and less than one .
" It 's a process of quantifying our ignorance , " said Duncan Forgan , the University of Edinburgh researcher who carried out the work .
In his new approach , Mr Forgan simulated a galaxy much like our own , allowing it to develop solar systems based on what is now known from the existence of so - called exoplanets in our galactic neighbourhood .
These simulated alien worlds were then subjected to a number of different scenarios .
If alien life forms do exist , we may not necessarily be able to make contact with them , and we have no idea what form they would take
Duncan Forgan
Edinburgh University
The first assumed that it is difficult for life to be formed but easy for it to evolve , and suggested there were 361 intelligent civilisations in the galaxy .
A second scenario assumed life was easily formed but struggled to develop intelligence .
Under these conditions , 31,513 other forms of life were estimated to exist .
The final scenario examined the possibility that life could be passed from one planet to another during asteroid collisions - a popular theory for how life arose here on Earth .
That approach gave a result of some 37,964 intelligent civilisations in existence .
Form and function
While far - flung planets may reduce uncertainty in how many Earth - like planets there are , some variables in the estimate will remain guesses .
For example , the time from a planet 's formation to the first sparks of life , or from there to the first intelligent civilisations , are large variables in the overall estimate .
For those , Mr Forgan says , we will have to continue to assume Earth is an average case .
" It is important to realise that the picture we 've built up is still incomplete , " said Mr Forgan .
" Even if alien life forms do exist , we may not necessarily be able to make contact with them , and we have no idea what form they would take .
" Life on other planets may be as varied as life on Earth and we cannot predict what intelligent life on other planets would look like or how they might behave . "
Do you believe that there is intelligent life out there and what form do you think it may take ?
Do you think there has been or ever will be any form of contact between earth and extra-terrestrial life ?
Here is a selection of just some of the comments you 've made on this story .
Why would an intelligent ( extra terrestrial ) life form want to contact this war , conflict , disease and starvation ridden mess we call planet earth ?
Pete , London
It 's hit and miss .
Like billiards .
But one day they shall find us or we shall find them .

No question of belief .
It 's a fact that aliens have been visiting Earth for last several thousand years .
Many of our technologies are gifts from them .
It is a different matter that our Governments and some our scientists are in constant denial .
Maybe this is their policy or perhaps the aliens have asked them to keep their identity secret in lieu of technical inputs given .
Shailendra Singh , Mumbai
There will be most certainly be vast amounts of intelligent civilizations out there .
The only problem is the vastness of space itself .
Light itself takes hundreds of thousands of years to travel across our own galaxy and travel it does n't get any faster than that , as Einstein taught us .
The idea that extra terrestrial life would be anything like us , like 95 % of the extraterrestrials in science fiction books and films are bipeds , is far flung .
They might just be ' intelligent shades of the colour blue ' for all we can tell at this time .
Or around an inch tall .
Or experiencing time 50 times as slow as us .
Communication could be quite a challenge .
If we recognize them for what they are in the first place .
Dirk Jan , Rotterdam , Netherlands
There is life out there , that 's for sure .
In the same space , if earth can have life why not in other planets in different solar systems ?
I do n't think we 'll ever be able to contact them .
Chas , London
The probability seems high to me given that conditions seem possible for intelligent life in a large number of planets in our own galaxy .
Multiply this by the number of galaxies in the universe(s ) and I guess we are talking about certainties , but communicating with them seems most unlikely given time differences and lack of technology .
Fascinating !
David , Hong Kong I love the rich speculation here .
By the articles own admittance , there is no idea of how many Earth - like planets exist .
And yet , scientists say there could be 361 intelligent civilisations in our Galaxy alone .
Silly math .
Brilliant !
Upon further investigation out of this fairy tale you 'll discover the only planets that have been verified are Jupiter - like planets .
Huge gas planets .
Want to live there , folks ?
Sven , CA , USA
The vastness of space is in itself a question .
Taking the Earth as a standard case in this expieriment is showing of how small our perception truely is .
Intelligent civilization in the universe is a definite .
Whether or not contact can and will be made is only matter of infinite variables .
Perhaps the greatest extra-terrestrial contact will manifest itself in ruins .
Daniel Franco , United States
My friend spoke of a B47 pilot who in 1963 described a disc - shaped object that approached his aircraft , flew in formation , then accelerated at a speed he could not match .
The pilot did not make an official report because he did not want people to think he was crazy and lose security clearance .
The co-pilot independently verified the incident .
Reports like that can be multiplied by the thousands .
They fill the literature and those who follow them up often verify that witnesses are credible and intelligent .
The characteristics of the vehicles have been documented ; they are consistently described from one experience to the next .
In short , yes , and yes there has been contact .

One cell ... one initial set of genetic changes – that ’s all it takes to begin a series of events that lead to metastatic cancer .
Now , Johns Hopkins experts have tracked how the cancer process began in 33 men with prostate cancer who died of the disease .
Culling information from autopsies , their study points to a set of genetic defects in a single cell that are different for each person ’s cancer .
“ These were not your average autopsies , ” says pathologist G. Steven Bova , M.D. , assistant professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins .
“ We dissected every bit of tumor – in the primary and metastatic sites – and recorded exactly where each piece of tissue came from , analyzed it , and databased the findings . ”
In total , Bova estimates that he and his colleagues examined 150,000 slides and 30,000 blocks of tissue .
The study took 14 years to complete , and part of the challenge was in finding men living with prostate cancer who would agree to have their body autopsied immediately after they died .
“ Many of the men were motivated to join the study in hopes of leaving some legacy that might lead to cures for this cancer , ” says Bova , who holds secondary appointments in the departments of pathology , genetic medicine , health sciences informatics , oncology , and urology at Johns Hopkins .
“ Much is unclear and appears chaotic about how cancer spreads , but analyzing genetic markers allows us to trace its roots backward , somewhat like ancestry , ” says Bova .
Findings from the study were published online April 12 in Nature Medicine .
Clues to finding the genetic culprit for cancer spread are hidden in the changes that occur in a cell ’s DNA , the alphabetical code made up of chemicals that guide the everyday life of a cell .
Cancers are caused by alterations in DNA code that occur in a variety of ways : making errors in the nucleotide alphabet through mutations , changing the balance of chemicals attached to the on / off switches of genes , and altering the number of gene copies in a cell .
When the number of gene copies is disrupted in a cell beyond the customary two copies inherited from each parent , a gene ’s function can be damaged .
This process , called copy number variation , can set the stage for unchecked cell growth and spread , a hallmark of cancer .
For this study , the investigators scanned genes spanning the whole genome in the autopsy samples looking for areas of copy number variation .
They did this by attaching the DNA to special silicon chips , and then photographed them with a computer program that produces a report with varying colors representing the amount of DNA in the sample .

The scientists compared the patterns of gains and losses in tissue samples from multiple metastatic sites in 29 of the men .
Unique copy number changes were identified , as well as ones that were shared between multiple metastatic sites in each man and with other men in the study .
For example , in several men , the investigators found cells in different areas of metastasis that contained missing chunks of DNA in one common region of the genome .
The exact location of the DNA loss was different for each man , but all occurred in the same DNA region .
“ Each person has a different set of defects that contributes to the cancer , ” explains Bova .
Metastatic sites develop from cancer cells that break off of the primary cancer .
If cancer cells at more than one metastatic site carry a common set of nonrandom genetic defects , it is likely that these cells are derived from a single parent cell , says Bova .
Tissue samples from 14 of the 33 men were studied at the highest available resolution , and all showed common genetic patterns across metastatic sites , suggesting a single cell source for their cancer .
Bova says that future studies will help determine whether the common set of changes shared by the various metastatic sites arose in a single “ big bang ” in the prostate or if the changes accumulated more slowly over time .
Bova says that such autopsy studies of metastatic cancer can provide a molecular catalogue of cellular defects specific to individuals and general groups .
The findings , he says , could help narrow the focus of research and guide personalized cancer therapy .

In addition to Bova , research participants included Wennuan Liu and Jianfeng Xu at Wake Forest University School of Medicine ; Sari Laitinen , Sofia Khan , Mauno Vihinen , and Tapio Visakorpi at the University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital , Tampere , Finland ; Guoqiang Yu , Li Chen and Yue Wang at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University ; and Jeanne Kowalski , Charles M. Ewing , Mario A. Eisenberger , Michael A. Carducci , William G. Nelson , Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian , Jun Luo , and William B. Isaacs at Johns Hopkins .

Here 's an insane move by Apple : sending a cease and desist to a company who makes an iPhone stand called the Podium for using the word " pod " in its name .
What in the hell ?

An excerpt from the letter says that " the term POD has also been adopted and used extensively in the marketplace by consumers as an abbreviation to refer to Apple 's IPOD player .
The IPOD and POD marks indicate to consumers that a broad range of products , including portable electronic devices , computer software , and related goods and services bearing those marks and marks similar thereto originate from or are sponsored or endorsed by Apple . "
Yeah , OK .
It also states that the design of the stand infringes on Apple 's trademark because it looks like the new iMac designs .
Pivotal , the makers of the stand , obviously are n't pleased with the letter .
This seems like a Monster - Cable - style dick move from a big company to a small out ( a small one that makes accessories for Apple 's products , no less ) , so hopefully it wo n't go anywhere .

Barack Obama , unlike George Bush who wanted to be in bed before 10 pm , likes to work late .
But even by his standards Wednesday was out of the ordinary , sitting up in a largely empty White House until 2.30 am as he edited a speech an adviser later described as one of the most important of his life .
He was still nervous about it when he rose to deliver it eight hours later .
Normally Mr Cool , he fluffed his opening , referring to the defence secretary , Robert Gates , as Bill , the Microsoft founder .
Part of the explanation for the bout of jitters is that Obama is struggling to contain an ever - growing row over the future of Guantánamo Bay and the security apparatus created by the Bush administration as part of its " war on terror " .
But there is another factor : the return of an opponent the Democrats had thought of as politically dead : Dick Cheney .
The sinister , reclusive figure at the heart of the Bush administration , who attracted labels such as Darth Vader and Dr Strangelove , has returned to the heart of Washington and is causing havoc .
Obama and Cheney were billed to speak at roughly the same time , though at different Washington venues .
The US media described it as the political equivalent of Ali v Frazier .
It was all a long way from 20 January when Cheney had left the White House a seeming broken man ready for retirement .
The Republicans were in disarray , still coming to terms with the election losses in November .
The policies with which Cheney had been associated , chiefly the invasion of Iraq , had long been discredited .
And Cheney himself , as Obama prepared to take over the White House , was in a wheelchair , having put his back out lifting a box in preparation for the removal van .
The next day , back home in Wyoming , the state senate passed a resolution wishing him and his wife a happy retirement in which they could " lay their heavy burdens down and fish and write to their hearts ' content " .
That resolution , along with the hopes of all those Democrats who thought that they had seen the last of him , proved premature .
He has forced Obama on the defensive for the first time since becoming president , giving demoralised Republicans something finally to cheer about .
" Cheney is seriously the only person who 's got the White House to change its policy , " Dan Senor , a foreign policy adviser in the Bush administration , told the Washington Post
Cheney has rattled Obama over the proposed closure of Guantánamo and the CIA 's use of waterboarding .
And not only Obama , but the next most prominent Democrat after him , the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , who on Friday refused to answer any more questions about whether she had been briefed by the CIA about torture six years ago .
She denies she was : the CIA says it did .
Obama had been planning to release thousands of pictures showing abuse at US detention centres round the world by the end of the month , but has since decided against .
On the campaign trail , he denounced the Bush administration 's use of military commissions to try Guantánamo detainees , but has now decided to keep them .
He denounced the indefinite detention of people without trial , but is now going to do the same .
Republicans have been applauding .
" I would have originally said that Cheney on torture would have been a net negative for the modern Republican party , which is working to put Bush and Cheney behind us , " said Grover Norquist , an influential figure in shaping US conservatism over the past two decades .
" It has worked out well for the Republicans .
Cheney is looking good . "
The conservative Weekly Standard is also cheering .
Another influential conservative , William Kristol , writing in the current issue , said : " While most senior Bush alumni were in hiding , Dick Cheney - Darth Vader himself , Mr Unpopularity , the last guy you 'd supposedly want out there making the case - stepped on to the field .
He 's made himself the Most Valuable Republican of the first four months of the Obama administration . "
Cheney 's return has enthralled the liberal media .
Maureen Dowd , the acerbic New York Times writer , used her column on Wednesday for a mocking piece under the headline " Cheney grabs a third term " , suggesting that he was manipulating Obama from the sidelines .
In a dig at Cheney 's newfound public face , popping up in television interview after television interview , she described him as " tawny with TV make - up ; there 's no point taking it off .
The gigs are nonstop . "
Obama had been scheduled to deliver his speech at 10.10 am on Thursday at the National Archives , against the backdrop of original copies of the Declaration of Independence and the US constitution .
Cheney was speaking at 10.30 at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , the Washington thinktank that is home to neoconservatives .
Such was the interest generated that Cheney delayed his speech until Obama , who started late , had finished .
Both speeches , each of about 40 minutes , were shown live .
Cheney 's speech had been in the diary before Obama 's and AEI officials suggested that the White House had arranged Obama 's for the same day .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press spokesman , denied this , but acknowledged they had been aware that Cheney 's speech was in the diary .
Gibbs said on Friday : " I think the president - in terms of yesterday 's speeches side by side - I think the president is not going to shy away from the debate on these issues . "
Obama and Cheney provided the debate the US should have had after 9/11 .
Obama argued that US national security is best protected by respect for international law , by closing Guantánamo and being as transparent as possible .
Cheney countered it was not as easy as that to close Guantánamo and that transparency - releasing internal Bush administration memos about interrogation techniques - had demoralised the CIA .
By calling waterboarding torture , Cheney said Obama has criminalised honourable people working in good faith and has made America less safe .
Michael Barone , a conservative and author of The Almanac of American Politics , who was in the audience for Cheney 's speech , said he was impressed by the vice - president : " There was a refreshing lack of ambiguity .
He made his case .
He sees Obama as a danger to the American people . "
The irony of Cheney 's publicity burst is that , throughout his eight years in office , he was a reclusive vice - president , seldom out and about in Washington , even refusing to release details to the press of his daily schedule .
Even as defence secretary in the 1990 - 91 Gulf war , unlike his protégé Donald Rumsfeld during the 2003 invasion , he was rarely in front of the cameras .
Why has he come out now ?
His friends say that he had been settling happily into retirement .
Although Wyoming is his home state , he lives in McLean , Virginia , in part to be close to his grandchildren .
From an office in McLean , he has been working on his memoirs , much of which are devoted to his part in the US response to 9/11 and the subsequent opening of Guantánamo and the invasion of Iraq .
Obama joked earlier this month the memoirs should be called How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People
Mary Matalin , Cheney 's spokeswoman in the early years of his vice - presidency , told the Washington Post last week that he would have remained in retirement , but was incensed by Obama 's criticism of Bush and him for setting up Guantánamo .
" If Barack Obama had come in and done what he said he was going to do and look at the stuff and see what is working , then Cheney would have continued to do what he was doing - working on memoirs , finishing his house , " she said .
" He 's got a good life .
He 's got stuff going on .
He does n't care about being on TV .
There 's no more politics there .
He 's not settling any scores .
He just wants people to understand . "
Aged 68 , Cheney has been in politics most of his adult life , serving six terms in Congress .
He left politics for a five - year tenure as chairman of Halliburton - the oilfield service company that was to be one of the principal beneficiaries of the Iraq war - before returning as vice - president under Bush in 2001 .
He went on to become the most powerful V - P in US history , partly because of Bush 's lack of foreign policy experience .
The attacks on New York and Washington in their first year in office saw Bush , pushed by Cheney , embrace an aggressive , ideologically driven approach to the world .
Cheney , supported by Rumsfeld , the defence secretary , and by neoconservatives including the deputy defence secretary , Paul Wolfowitz , were behind Afghanistan , Guantánamo , the secret CIA camps round the world and the invasion of Iraq .
In his speech on Thursday , Cheney offered the best insight yet as to why he reacted as he did to 9/11 .
" I was in my office in that first hour when radar caught sight of an airliner heading towards the White House at 500 mph .
That was Flight 77 , the one that ended up hitting the Pentagon .
With the plane still inbound , Secret Service agents came into my office and said we had to leave now .
A few moments later , I found myself in a fortified White House command post somewhere down below .
" I 've heard occasional speculation that I 'm a different man after 9/11 .
I would n't say that .
But I 'll freely admit that watching a co-ordinated , devastating attack on our country from an underground bunker at the White House can affect how you view your responsibilities . "
The two had 2,689 days left in office but " on our watch , they never hit this country again " .
In the second term , with Iraq going badly , Bush was less in thrall to Cheney .
Ignoring protests from Cheney , Bush sacked Rumsfeld and replaced him with Gates , who , together with General David Petraeus , came up with a feasible Iraq exit strategy .
Bush and Cheney fell out badly at the very end .
Cheney was incensed that Bush would not use his prerogative in his final days to pardon the vice - president 's former chief of staff , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who was convicted for lying over the outing of a CIA agent .
Cheney viewed Libby as a loyal servant - one who may have been covering up for someone higher up - and said a few days after losing office that Libby had been " hung out to dry " .
Stephen Hayes , author of a 2007 biography of Cheney , said many people wondered why he had not made the public case for Guantánamo and Iraq while in office .
Hayes , who discussed this with him during 30 hours of interviews for the book , thinks he has the answer .
" I asked him : ' Why are you not out there making this case ?
You are making it better than George Bush . '
He said : ' That is simply not my role .
He [ Bush ] asks me for advice .
If I was out there , it would not be the same . "
But free from office , Cheney no longer has any such constraints , especially as Bush appears to have opted for silence , deciding that it would be undignified to criticise his successor .
Thomas Mann , a political scientist at the Brookings Institution , said : " I think Dick Cheney believes Bush will not be a forceful defender of what they did and is damned if he is not going to lead the charge .
At a some time an event or another figure will overtake him , but at present there is a vacuum in the Republican party . "
The party is in disarray , with no serious contender in sight to provide them with the leadership necessary for Congressional elections next year and to take on Obama in 2012 .
Is it possible that Cheney , in spite of poor health and poor popularity ratings , might be planning a shot at the presidency ?
Those who know him rule it out , citing his heart attacks and other health problems .
One of those watching Cheney on Thursday said , in response to the suggestion that he could be a contender : " Are you crazy ?
Have you seen him trying to work a crowd . "
Cheney reinforced the point as he delivered his speech , speaking in a monotone , unsmiling , hunched over , reading his script without the benefit of an autocue .
Two thirds of the way through , a room packed with sympathisers began to look for distractions , mainly their mobiles and Blackberries , with one openly reading the Wall Street Journal
The Democrats , including Obama 's senior adviser , David Axelrod , argue that having Cheney in such a high - profile role is helpful for them , because he is reminding voters of one of the most disliked administrations in US history .
Cheney has high unpopularity ratings , hovering around 60 % .
The Democrats regard his present prominence as a short - term phenomenon .
Obama 's problems , though , are set to last much longer .
He is struggling to find a way out of what he describes as the " legal mess " he inherited from Bush and Cheney .
The left expressed disappointment that he first agreed to release thousands of pictures of abuse at US detention centres round the world and then refused .
Cheney 's supporters credit him with the about - turn .
The left is unhappy , too , that Obama is to stick with tainted Bush - Cheney policies : the use of military commissions to try some Guantánamo detainees and keeping others in prison indefinitely without trial .
Democrats in Congress , too , are at odds with Obama .
They are blocking the transfer of detainees to their states and on Wednesday the Senate voted to refuse Obama the $ 80 m he needs to close the detention centre until he comes up with a detailed plan .
Hayes believes that Cheney , while not enjoying the limelight , is not about to depart the scene any time soon .
As long as he is working on his memoirs , the events surrounding Guantánamo will be fresh on his mind and he will be willing to answer questions about them .
Norquist , though cheered by his unexpected return , is among those Republicans hoping he will not hang around too long .
A conservative who advocates lower taxation but parts company with Cheney over torture , he said : " Cheney has put Obama on the defensive .
He should declare victory and retire from the field . "
Dick Cheney : in his own words

" We know he [ Saddam Hussein ] has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and we believe he has , in fact , reconstituted nuclear weapons . "
" My belief is we will , in fact , be greeted as liberators [ in Iraq ] . "
2004
" Direct threats require decisive action , act with all the urgency that this danger demands .
We must be prepared to face our responsibilities and be willing to use force if necessary .
The days of looking the other way while despotic regimes trample human rights , rob their nations ' wealth , and then excuse their failings by feeding their people a steady diet of anti-western hatred are over . "
" Go f*ck yourself . "
( Overheard while Cheney was speaking to a Democratic senator in a row over his old company , Halliburton . )

" I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation programme .
The interrogations were used on hardened terrorists after other efforts failed .
They were legal , essential , justified and the right thing to do . "
" The [ Obama ] administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in Europe for closing Guantánamo .
But it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and America 's national security . "
Douglas Jenson , 75 , of Canby , Ore. , has taken Gleevec for 10 years for leukemia .
He goes for a blood test once every three months and sees his oncologist every six months , but is healthy enough to go whitewater rafting .
Making it even easier , Mr. Jenson gets his Gleevec free because he participated in an early clinical trial of the drug .
Otherwise it would cost more than $ 40,000 a year .
While Mr. Jenson has been diligent about taking his five capsules every day at lunchtime , research indicates that many patients on the oral drugs do not consistently take the proper dose .
One study , for example , found that Gleevec patients , on average , were taking only 75 percent of their prescribed doses .
Some cancer patients skip pills or stop taking them completely  whether because of costs , forgetfulness , side effects , complicated regimens or other factors .
“ When I first started looking into this , I thought , ‘ People with cancer have too much to lose , how can they not take their drugs ? ’ ” said Dr. Ann Partridge , an oncologist at Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
Some other cancer patients , meanwhile , end up taking too many pills .
Gayne Ek of Allen , Tex. , said he once skipped all of his Gleevec capsules for six weeks .
Then , with the stockpile of capsules he accumulated , he took twice the prescribed dose for six weeks , hoping it would be more effective .
It was not .
For many patients , though , the main challenge is not taking their pills , but paying for them .
Under Medicare , most oral cancer drugs are covered by the Part D prescription drug program , which has a 25 percent co-payment .
It also has the annual “ doughnut hole ”  reached when a patient ’s total drug costs hit $ 2,700 , after which the patient must shoulder the next $ 3,000 or so before coverage resumes .
I cringe at a lot of API 's these days , because I see designers making the same mistakes again and again .
Perhaps the most pervasive mistake is the dreaded NBU design : Namespacing By Underscores .
For example , imagine you have a " Thing " class with a " color " attribute :
t = Thing ( ) t.color = 'red '
One day , you decide to switch from color names to RGB triples .
Why , oh , why is this your first thought ?
t.color_r = 255 t.color_g = 0 t.color_b = 0
That 's your PHP ( or Javascript , or SQL , or other ) experience poking its ugly head in .
Yes , PHP 5.3 finally has namespaces , and you can use objects as namespaces in JS if you 're diligent .
But chances are , you wo n't .
In Python , namespaces are easy .
Use them .
Ask yourself what the clearest syntax is , and you might come up with something like this :
>>> t.color = RGB ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) >>> t.color.red 255
This is not just a matter of clever delegation ( replacing a str attribute with an RGB object ) -- it covers all manner of interface design decisions .
Here 's a recent example from python - dev regarding the email package 's interface for Python 3 :
message.headers [ ' Subject ' ] message.bytes_headers [ ' Subject ']
Please do n't do that -- it makes it seem as if the " message " object has a set of headers and a distinct set of bytes_headers .
At the least , you 've elevated the rare case to be a peer of the common case .
A new user of the email module should n't see anything about bytes in help ( message ) or dir( message ) .
Instead , write this :
message.headers [ ' Subject ' ] = ' A conversation ' message . headers [ ' Subject ' ] . encoding = ' utf - 8 ' message.headers [ ' Subject '].encode ( )
Or , if you really prefer bytes over unicode as the canonical representation :
message.headers [ ' Subject ' ] = b' A conversation ' message . headers [ ' Subject ' ] . encoding = ' utf - 8 ' message.headers [ ' Subject ' ] .decode ( )
If message . headers [ x ]. encoding is given a sane default , and you expect the vast majority of users to only deal in unicode , they may never see the .encoding and .encode attributes .
Good !
We 've made the common case easy and the rare cases possible .
In addition , we 've embellished the Header object with a bytes representation using standard Python conventions : just like Python 3's str object has an encode method , so does our Header object .
It 's far easier to remember that such a convention applies , than to remember a brand - new name like " bytes_headers " or " decoded_headers " .
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let 's do more of those !
But please not faked via underscores .
Behold , the fast - food job application .
One sheet , two sides , filled with questions from top to bottom .
Where did you go to high school ?
Did you graduate ?
What was your GPA ?
Do you have any employment experience ?
Have you ever been convicted of a crime ?
Are you willing to work overtime ?
What are the phone numbers of the last 10 places you worked ?
They do n't need to know all this stuff .
This is a job at a fast food place .
They do n't reject poor students .
They do n't reject potheads .
They are probably just going to hire you based on your looks , although technically , they probably want to check if you can read and write , and if you can will follow directions .
They know you will search your soul to answer every question , so they just ask everything they can think of on there .
And look !
They leave a stack them right out in the open .
Where diners can grab an application off of the pad .
Or leave a new pad .
A fake pad .

He is co-author of " Law in Times of Crisis : Emergency Powers in Theory and Practice " with Fionnuala Ní Aoláin .
Oren Gross says torture is illegal even if a country is fighting terrorist groups that engage in it .
( CNN ) -- Popular clichés notwithstanding , not all is fair in war .
The idea that war is subject to legal rules is an ancient one .
Over time nations have come to accept that their decisions whether to go to war as well as how to conduct warfare once armed conflict has erupted are limited by legal norms .
But do such limitations hold when the enemy is not another nation that itself plays , more or less , by the rules , but rather a nonstate actor such as al Qaeda that flagrantly ignores them ?
Does not following the rules in this context mean that we would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back ?
And if so , should not all be fair at least in war against such an enemy ?
Yes , yes , and an emphatic no .
Al Qaeda does not pose a threat to the United States ' ( or any of its allies ' ) existence .
Its real threat lies in provoking us to employ authoritarian measures that would weaken the fabric of our democracy , discredit the United States internationally , diminish our ability to utilize our soft power and undermine our claim to the moral higher ground in the fight against the terrorists .
In other words , the critical threat is not that the United States would fail to defend itself but that it would do so too well and in the process become less democratic and lose sight of its fundamental values .
" Whoever fights monsters , " warned Friedrich Nietzsche , " should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster .
And if you gaze long enough into an abyss , the abyss will gaze back into you . "
Yes , a democracy fighting terrorists seems to be fighting with one hand tied behind its back , but the fight is not merely about physical survival .
It is also a struggle about our way of life and about our core values .
Aharon Barak , former president of the Supreme Court of Israel ( a country no stranger to the fight against terrorism ) , wrote in a court opinion that ruled certain interrogation methods to be prohibited under Israeli law , that despite being limited in its fight , democracy has the upper hand because " the rule of law and the liberty of an individual constitute important components in its understanding of security .
At the end of the day , they strengthen its spirit and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties . "
When all is said and done , everyone -- even the lawyers who authored the infamous Department of Justice memos on interrogation techniques during the Bush administration -- agrees :
Torture is prohibited , and committing it is a crime , under both the law of the United States and international law .
The prohibition reflects a powerful taboo on practices that are considered moral evil .
" The torturer , " declared the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals almost 30 years ago , " has become like the pirate and slave trader before him hostis humani generis , an enemy of all mankind . "
And as is the case with respect to piracy and slave trade , so to with torture , the law admits of no exceptions to the ban , no matter what the particular circumstances might be .
The prohibition remains absolute even -- indeed particularly -- in wartime and in the face of other grave emergencies .
And for good reason .
Torture is intrinsically wrong .
It violates the physical and mental integrity of the person subjected to it , negates that individual 's autonomy and deprives him or her of human dignity .
A categorical legal prohibition on torture not only reflects what decent people believe , but is also fundamental to the society we wish to live in and belong to .
An absolute prohibition is also designed to prevent us from sliding down the slippery slope that would end in the use of torture in less than truly exceptional cases ( just because interrogators have gotten used to employing it in " exceptional cases " ) or in applying similar methods to " ordinary " criminals .
The Bush administration , euphemistically seeking to employ " coercive " interrogation techniques against al Qaeda detainees , pursued three major strategies of implausible deniability to bypass the uncompromising legal ban :
It denied that certain national and international laws that prohibit torture applied to certain categories of detainees ( a position squarely rejected by the Supreme Court in its 2006 Hamdan decision ) , it denied that the " United States " was engaged in torture ( while , at the same time , outsourcing the business of torture to other countries ) , and it also denied that the United States was engaged in " torture . "
Orwellian legal constructions and definitional wizardry by lawyers demonstrating small - mindedness , technocratic reasoning , ideological motivation , and I - just - followed - orders mentality facilitated this last claim .
Early Justice Department - Office of Legal Counsel memos , later repudiated by subsequent OLC memos , defined torture so narrowly as to make all interrogation practices practically appear legally permissible and approved as legal 10 specific interrogation techniques , including waterboarding .
In doing so these memos not only misrepresented the law of the United States , but also showed utter disregard for , and ignorance of , international law .
Other legal memos were no better .
Their main purpose was to provide immunity for acts that are manifestly illegal and immoral .
They were designed to give the CIA its CYA .
Lawyers are not the only ones to blame .
Doctors and psychologists had been involved in the process of devising and then carrying out torture .
For its part , such inexcusable conduct by professionals was a link in a longer chain of systemic failures in decision - making processes and oversight mechanisms .
Interrogation techniques such as waterboarding were officially imported into the CIA 's arsenal without clear indication that such techniques actually worked and despite the fact that in the past those very techniques had been used in places such as Korea against American troops .
Perhaps most troubling , all this happened with little , if any , meaningful and informed discussion among decision - makers .
As Philip Zelikow noted , " Especially in a time of great stress , walking into this minefield , the president was entitled to get the most thoughtful and searching analysis our government could muster . "
Well , he clearly did not .
And then those officials whose task it was to oversee such matters failed us again .
Rep. Nancy Pelosi who , as the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee in 2002 , was briefed on the interrogation methods , said that " we were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used .
What they did tell us is that they had some [ legal ] opinions that they could be used , but not that they would .
... "
Such excuses ring hollow and , frankly , insult our intelligence .
Americans deserve better than that .
And so the only claim left is the one made by former Vice President Dick Cheney and former CIA Director Michael Hayden -- that waterboarding and similar techniques actually worked .
Let us assume , for the sake of argument , that by " worked " they mean that through the use of such techniques the CIA got information that led to the foiling of future terrorist attacks .
Let us even assume that such information would have been impossible to obtain using less radical methods of interrogation ( both assumptions are controversial , of course ) .
Even so , the use of torture would not become lawful .
In this case , neither necessity nor effectiveness could render legal that which otherwise would have been illegal .
And the absolute prohibition on torture recognizes , as we said earlier , no exceptions .
As far as the law is concerned , it matters little whether torture resulted in useful intelligence leads or none at all .
Consequently , no legal opinion could give advance authorization to use such techniques .
If indeed such techniques had been effective that might , at most , be considered after the fact in the context of deciding whether to bring criminal charges against officials accused of violating the law or impeach them .
It could also be considered in the context of " jury nullification " when a jury acquits a defendant despite its belief that the defendant is , in fact , guilty of the violation charged .
And it might also be considered in the sentencing of officials when they are found liable for violation of the law such as by mitigating the penalties imposed on them , and in executive pardoning or clemency where criminal proceedings result in conviction .
Even if any of the above takes place in the United States , the use of illegal interrogation techniques may still expose those who authorized their use and those who applied them to criminal and civil proceedings in foreign jurisdictions such as Spain and to international criminal prosecution .
President Obama made it clear that he wished to move forward rather than spend energy laying blame for the past .
But in order to move forward we must contend with the past .
We need to deal with those who authorized and carried out crimes " in our name . "
We need to make sure that decision - making processes work as they should and that oversight mechanisms perform their functions .
We need to return to an ethic of responsibility and accountability that is critical if citizens are to have faith in their government and the world is to respect this nation .
This is not just a matter of the rule of law .
It is a matter of national security .

Just minutes ago the verdict in the case of The Pirate Bay Four was announced .
All four defendants were accused of ' assisting in making copyright content available ' .
Peter Sunde : Guilty .
Fredrik Neij : Guilty .
Gottfrid Svartholm : Guilty .
Carl Lundström : Guilty .
The four receive 1 year in jail each and fines totaling $ 3,620,000 .
While only a few weeks ago , it seems like an eternity since the trial of The Pirate Bay Four ended and the court retired to consider its verdict .
The prosecution claimed that the four defendants were ‘ assisting in making copyright content available ’ and demanded millions of dollars in damages .
The defense did not agree , and all pleaded not guilty – backed up by the inimitable King Kong defense .
Today , Friday April 17 , the court issued its decision : article continuously updated
“ The court has found that by using Pirate Bay ’s services there has been file - sharing of music , films and computer games to the extent the prosecutor has stated in his case , ” said the district court .
“ This file - sharing constitutes an unlawful transfer to the public of copyrighted performances . ”
Peter Sunde ( born September 13 , 1978 ) alias ‘ brokep ’ :
Verdict : Guilty – 1 year in prison , damages to pay : $ 905,000
Peter Althin , brokep ’s lawyer said , “ I spoke to Peter and he was n’t very surprised .
A journalist he ’d spoken to knew an hour before it was public that all four would be convicted .
The verdict was leaked from the court .
I have to think about what effects that can have on the sentence .
It is unacceptable that the court is leaking . ”
Fredrik Neij ( born April 27 , 1978 ) alias ‘ TiAMO ’:
Verdict : Guilty – 1 year in prison , damages to pay : $ 905,000
Similar to the other defendants , Fredrik Neij was not present to hear the verdict .
He currently lives in Thailand from where he manages The Pirate Bay ’s servers .
Gottfrid Svartholm ( October 17 , 1984 ) alias ‘ Anakata ’ :
Verdict : Guilty – 1 year in prison , damages to pay : $ 905,000
Anakata ’s lawyer Ola Salomonsson said , “ We ’re appealing .
It ’s very surprising that the court has chosen to treat the accused as a team . ”
Carl Lundström ( born April 13 , 1960 )
Verdict : Guilty – 1 year in prison , damages to pay : $ 905,000
Carl Lundström ’s verdict came as a surprise to most people since he was only remotely related to The Pirate Bay .
His lawyer Per E Samuelsson announced that he has already sent in his appeal and the others are expected to follow soon .
The court said that the four defendants worked as a team , were aware that copyrighted material was being shared using The Pirate Bay and that they made it easy and assisted the infringements .
It categorized the infringements as ‘ severe ’ .
The judge said that the users of The Pirate Bay committed the first offense by sharing files and the four assisted this .
It appears that the court chose to not take any of the technical details into account and only judged based on intent .
They find it clear that the intention of the defendants is to facilitate sharing of copyrighted works and based their verdict on this .
While the court did not agree with the plaintiff ’s exaggerated estimates of losses , it still set the damages at 30 million SEK ( $ 3,620,000 ) .
This a hugely significant amount and the court has ordered that the four should pay this amount between them .
The judge also stated that the usage of BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay is illegal .
Rest assured , other torrent sites hosted in Sweden will be keeping a close eye on developments .
The defense put it to the judge that he had folded under intense political pressure .
The judge denied this stating that the court made its decision based on the case presented .
At one point the judge was asked if he was concerned for his personal safety after handing down this decision .
The judge said he had n’t received any harassment and was quite surprised at the question .
While the judge wo n’t be getting any flowers for this verdict , Roger Wallis who spoke in favor of The Pirate Bay at their trial and received a mountain of floral tributes in return , noted , “ This will cause a flood of court cases .
Against all the ISPs .
Because if these guys assisted in copyright infringements , then the ISPs also did .
This will have huge consequences .
The entire development of broadband may be stalled . ”
Peter Sunde characterized the verdict as ‘ unreal ’ and said that he did n’t expect the jail sentence .
He briefly spoke with Fredrik and Gottfrid and all were surprised with this outcome .
In response to the fines Peter said : “ We ca n’t pay and we would n’t pay if we could .
If I would have money I would rather burn everything I owned . ”
Sunde has already explained that this decision does not mean the end of the line in this case .
There will be an appeal which means we are still far away from the ultimate decision – possibly years away .
Any appeal from either side must be submitted to Sweden ’s higher Court by 9th May 2009 .
Rasmus Fleischer , one of the founders of Piratbyrån commented , “ The sentence has no formal consequence and no juridical value .
We chose to treat the trial as a theater play and as such it ’s been far better than we ever could have believed . ”
As for the fate of the site , Peter has already promised that The Pirate Bay will continue .
The site itself was never on trial , only the four individuals listed above .

Fallout 3 is set in post - nuclear Washington , D.C.
The violent video game has won critical acclaim for its bleak atmospherics .
It is not supposed to make you laugh .
Then came the YouTube game clips : a “ Fallout 3 Baby , ” wandering through the game ’s apocalyptic landscape in nappies , bashing in mutants ’ heads with its tiny fists , disabling a nuclear bomb , cooing “ goo - goo ” and dealing death with a Colt .45 .
“ My response was , ‘ Oops , ' ” says game director Todd Howard .
“ But that ’s pretty funny . ”
Game designers are increasingly creating wide - open worlds with little to limit the action of the characters .
And players are meeting them halfway , hoping to subvert or escape planned narrative lines , however loose , by any means necessary .
It ’s fast becoming a sport of its own .
In games as diverse as Fallout 3 and Mirror ’s Edge , players are pushing to find or create unexpected ways to break past the game horizon , and turn the designers ’ intentions on their heads .
It ’s only a matter of time before someone releases a game where the best version is the one you were never intended to play .
That ’s only to be expected , says David Michicich , CEO and creative director of Robomodo , the developers of Activision ’s new Tony Hawk : Ride , and a 14 - year veteran game designer .
“ Today ’s news gets old quick — we Twitter , blog , pass viral video .
We thrive off the sudden excitement of the latest and most buzzworthy , ” Michicich says .
“ It ’s exciting to still feel like you can discover something new .
It ’s stimulation , plain and simple . ”
Videogame designers have added secret rewards known as Easter eggs as far back as 1980 , when Atari programmer Warren Robinett included a creator ’s credit in a hidden room in his videogame version of Adventure .
Not long after that came the rise of the “ cheat code , ” allowing players to rack up experience points , skip levels or become invincible .
The “ Fallout 3 Baby ” and other similar glitches represent something in between – an unintended hiccup that allows players to see the game in a whole new light , transforming the narrative and mood into something completely different , and in some cases , creating a whole new kind of game .
In Super Mario Bros. , players discovered a secret underwater limbo , dubbed Minus World , and it was n’t long before they began playing the game just to find other such arcane exploits .
Then there ’s Mirror ’s Edge , a game that was hacked to show the runner from a third - person point of view — a feature the game designers had intentionally excluded .
“ It ’s about placing your flag on a previously unsummited mountain .
The gamer has acquired knowledge that no one else has , and being first is always fun , ” says Next Level Games game director Bryce Holliday , whose titles include the recently - released Wii version of Punch - Out .
“ One of the core themes of our latest game is exploration .
There are plenty of unknown tricks hidden throughout it that we ’ll be waiting for players to discover . ”
In Fallout 3 , playing as a baby requires nimble fingers and a willingness to explore the unintended consequences of the game ’s cinematic programming .
In the early moments of the adventure , you interact with your father , who leaves you alone in your crib for a moment .
By following closely behind him as he walks out the door , then sprinting ahead and ducking through the next automated doorway , you ’ll find your character falling through what seems like an infinite void full of misshapen textures and vast nothingness .
After a few moments , the game will deposit you in the next game - play segment , where you play a grade - school version of yourself .
But if you pulled off the trick correctly , you ’ll still be a baby .
Soon , the baby must wander past over - sized cockroaches , armed guards and blaring sirens , but once you ’ve cleared the gigantic door to Vault 101 and escaped into the wilderness , the game essentially plays as normal .
Well , “ normal . ”
Conversations now proceed like this :
“ You lookin ’ to trade , stranger ? ”
“ Da da ! ”
“ Check out Craterside Supply . ”
“ Bye bye ! ”
Wandering into the first town , Megaton , you ’ll be approached by the same characters who would make your acquaintance during normal game play .
Though your point of view is a few feet lower than normal , none of the characters you meet will make any mention of it , although they will look down at you to meet your gaze .
There are certain inconveniences that go along with life as a post - nuclear toddler .
Babies do n’t run very fast , first of all .
And Pip - Boy , the game ’s interactive menu system , does n’t quite render correctly .
“ The slow run and pipboy messup really suck the fun out of it , ” wrote user Fallout3 Girl on GameSpot .
“ But it is still hecka funny . ”
Funny enough that gamers in on the joke began posting Fallout baby clips on YouTube , to wild popularity .
Dozens of sequences have been posted since the baby escape sequence was discovered last fall , drawing hundreds of thousands of views .
Another example is found in Mirror ’s Edge , a game based heavily on free running with a unique first - person viewpoint .
But some players did n’t want to experience the vertigo - inducing action through the eyes of the main character , and found a simple exploit in the PC version that allows them to unlock a third - person camera , created by developers but taken out of the final game .
In Super Mario Bros. , jumping through a certain solid wall lets you take Mario into “ Minus World , ” an endlessly repeating , inescapable underwater level .
Players that had already saved the Princess a dozen times over all turned their attention to finding secret glitches like this , turning Mario ’s quest to get to the final castle into a quest to get himself hopelessly stuck in alternate universes .
In a re-release of the game , Nintendo turned the Minus World into a reward .
In place of the repeating , boring water level were three new ones that the player could actually finish , and when they completed them they unlocked a “ stage select ” feature that let them jump anywhere in the game .
Not every unintended game sequence is embraced so enthusiastically , of course .
The developer ’s response “ depends on your ESRB rating , ” joked Michicich .
“ Your reaction could be anything from delight on the added bonus of replayability , to sudden absolute panic .
I once worked on a fighting game where there was an alpha mask rendering bug that when the buxom leading female character walked behind some heat distortion particles from a fire , her top sorted incorrectly , and rendered completely off . ”
Bug , or bonus ?
You decide .

NAU 's Loretta Mayer is working on research to speed up fertility in rats to decrease the number of rodents munching on crops intended for humans .
Photo by Jerry Foreman , Northern Arizona University
When scientist Loretta Mayer set out to alleviate diseases associated with menopause , she did n't realize her work could lead to addressing world hunger and feeding hundreds of millions of people .
The Northern Arizona University researcher and her colleagues at NAU and the University of Arizona identified a nontoxic chemical technology that when applied to rodents , caused infertility in rats , which feast on crops intended for human consumption .
" This environmentally neutral approach , that has never been available before , will reduce the damage rice - field rats cause in countries that depend on rice as a main food supply , " Mayer said .
A team of NAU researchers is working to increase global food supplies by managing fertility among rice rats .
Credit : Northern Arizona University
Rodents consume or damage up to 50 percent of pre-harvest rice crops .
Due to the large - scale cultivation of rice worldwide , if rice production were to increase by 10 percent , " this would feed about 380 million people a year , " Mayer said .
" We can easily increase rice production by 10 percent by reducing rodent fertility in half . "
She said this noninvasive approach is more humane than poison , which takes several days to kill rodents and seeps into groundwater , harming other animals and possible food sources .
The sterilization technology derived from Mayer 's research , done by Patricia Hoyer and and Glenn Sipes at UofA , investigated potential damage caused to ovarian follicles in women exposed to certain chemicals in industrial settings .
Of particular interest was a chemical compound known as 4 - vinylcyclohexene diepoxide , or VCD , typically used in manufacturing rubber tires , polyesters and plastics .
She found that low , nontoxic doses of VCD in mice sped the menopausal process and rendered them infertile .
She dubbed this new animal model of accelerated menopause " mouseopause . "
Mayer and her colleagues have developed a product called ContraPest that incorporates the chemical sterilization treatment into bait .
The bait is put into strategically placed stations that lure rodents into cages too small to attract or affect other animals .
" No rat or mice I know can resist a little hole , " she said .
ContraPest is being tested in Indonesia -- the largest producer of rice in the world , and is currently being registered for rodent - population control in Australia .
" We are testing it in Indonesia , and then our next target site will be in the Philippines .
From the Philippines we go to Vietnam , " Mayer said .
Scientists adapt the product to different rodent species at SenesTech , the Flagstaff - based company that grew out of Mayer 's work on the NAU campus .
Named after the word senescence , meaning approaching an advanced age , the young company hopes to create a number of beneficial products .
Mayer and her team of researchers also are adapting the technology platform for population management of other animals .
They are formulating a product , ChemSpay , for use in population management of wild animals such as deer , coyotes , foxes , raccoons , horses , buffalo and elk as well as cats and dogs .
" What we are doing right now is we are preparing the translation of this technology to dogs and cats .
We have already completed six months of study in dogs .
This could have a tremendous impact on reducing the number of animals in shelters , " said Mayer noting that not only is the method a cost - effective way to avoid surgical spaying , there 's a global impact to canine management most people do n't realize .
" Dogs are huge vectors of disease throughout the world , " she said .
" In India , every two seconds someone is bitten by a dog .
The tragedy is that every 30 minutes someone dies from rabies .
If you continue to vaccinate against rabies , you wo n't be able to make a dent .
You have to combine rabies vaccinations with fertility control . "
She hopes to address rabies problems on the rise in West Africa , India and China .
Australia hopes to put the technology to use in managing its kangaroo , wallaby and camel populations .
New Zealand , Spain and the United Kingdom also are in line to put ChemSpay to use .
She said luring students to the research team was easy .
" We want them involved with hands - on research and field experience , " she said .
" The first question I ask interested students is if they have empty passport pages they are ready to fill . "

Separately , the Tor Project , a nonprofit group of anticensorship activists , freely offers software that can be used to send messages secretly or to reach blocked Web sites .
Its software , first developed at the United States Naval Research Laboratories , is now used by more than 300,000 people globally , from the police to criminals , as well as diplomats and spies .
Political scientists at the University of Toronto have built yet another system , called Psiphon , that allows anyone to evade national Internet firewalls using only a Web browser .
Sensing a business opportunity , they have created a company to profit by making it possible for media companies to deliver digital content to Web users behind national firewalls .
The danger in this quiet electronic war is driven home by a stark warning on the group ’s Web site : “ Bypassing censorship may violate law .
Serious thought should be given to the risks involved and potential consequences . ”
In this cat - and - mouse game , the cat is fighting back .
The Chinese system , which opponents call the Great Firewall of China , is built in part with Western technologies .
A study published in February by Rebecca MacKinnon , who teaches journalism at the University of Hong Kong , determined that much blog censorship is performed not by the government but by private Internet service providers , including companies like Yahoo China , Microsoft and MySpace .
One - third to more than half of all postings made to three Chinese Internet service providers were not published or were censored , she reported .
When the Falun Gong tried to support its service with advertising several years ago , American companies backed out under pressure from the Chinese government , members said .
In addition , the Chinese government now employs more than 40,000 people as censors at dozens of regional centers , and hundreds of thousands of students are paid to flood the Internet with government messages and crowd out dissenters .
This is not to say that China blocks access to most Internet sites ; most of the material on the global Internet is available to Chinese without censorship .
The government ’s censors mostly censor groups deemed to be state enemies , like the Falun Gong , making it harder for them to reach potential members .
Villarreal To Help Unemployed Fans By Giving Out Free Season Tickets
Some fans of Spanish La Liga side Villarreal are very lucky , at least in one aspect of their lives .
Next season , Villarreal will be helping out fans who are unemployed .
Players will be contributing to a fund to provide season tickets who have lost their jobs , so they can still continue to attend games and follow their team , even though they no longer have income .
With unemployment in Spain at 13.9 percent , and even higher in Castellon at 14.7 percent , there are many fans will want to take advantage of these free tickets .
Villarreal president Fernando Roig said , “ Season - ticket holders who are on the dole will be allowed in free next year .
The idea is to think of the club ’s wider social base and those who have been unlucky to lose their jobs so they can continue to watch football in the Madrigal . ”
Employees from around the club will contribute to a fund to help fans , from star players like Robert Pires , Marcos Senna , and Joseba Llorente to the club ’s board , coaches , and sponsors .
Llorente was eager to support the proposal , saying , “ We are keen to get involved because it seems like a good idea considering the times we are in .
There are many people without work and it ’s a shame if they do n’t come to the stadium because of this . ”
You listening , American sports teams ?
Attendance will certainly be down , and you will surely be looking for ways to get fans to come to games to keep the revenue flowing and maintain a home - field advantage .
Instead of trotting out millionaires to play in empty stadiums and arenas , you can do something to help the unemployed out like Villarreal is . *
Seeing as I am out of work right now , I welcome all ticket donations , even to unimportant sports and tractor pulls .
Especially tractor pulls .
* Note : This suggestion does not apply to the Detroit Lions .
You have inflicted way too much pain already on an already troubled region of the country , those poor people do n’t need to add to the misery by having to go to more Lions games .

This morning , as I hear the distant roar of their convoys traveling up Route 50 toward the nation ’s capital , I am not thinking , as I usually do on Memorial Day , of my uncles and friends who fought in Vietnam .
I am mulling over instead the scars of our present war in the Middle East and Central Asia , and how Rolling Thunder disappointed me so , when a large swath of their riders became so patently pro-war under the thrall of rightwing provocateurs like Michelle Malkin , who fueled unfounded rumors that war protesters planned to urinate on The Wall , and deface other war memorials during a 2007 rally on Washington .
They proceeded to revel in intimidating Americans who came to the Mall that weekend in peaceful resistance , allowing in effect , Bush Apologists and warmongers to interchange today ’s critics of the Iraq and Afghanistan operations with Jane Fonda , Cindy Sheehan and all manner of spitting hippies .
Many became tools , wittingly or not , shedding the vestiges of their rebellious origins , for the sake of propping up the Republican Party at a time when most Americans had turned against the war .
They allowed their honorable name to be dragged through the partisan muck .
I was at that protest , and watched as these burly guys — and gals — and their friends and followers lined up in menacing gauntlets outside of The Wall to intimidate activists , I was there when they waved the middle finger and screamed f–ck you !
at protesters and told me personally , that it was not George W. Bush that got the country into such a mess , but weak - kneed lefties back home , badmouthing the war , not supporting the mission .
Just like Vietnam .
Honestly , these guys always blamed Hanoi Jane , but I liked them better when they blamed Johnson and Nixon and McNamara too .
But I knew then , in 2007 , that while the anger at hippies was n’t forgotten , the mistrust of the government was .
Probably still is — but I have a feeling , any problems with veterans and soldiers and future war policy , will certainly be blamed on President Barack Obama from now on .
That ’s fine , because this weekend is for remembering .
And reminding .
As for this war :
U.S casualties :
Iraq ( since 2003 ) — 4,300 deaths ; 46,132 wounded ( medical air transport only , does n’t include illnesses or minor injuries , that would take the number over 80,000 )
Afghanistan ( since 2002 ) — 686 deaths ; wounded — not available
Number of men and women who have served in either theater since 2002 : over 1.8 million
Number of servicemembers returning with depression or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder : 18.5 percent :
Number of Iraq / Afghanistan veterans seeking care at a VA since 2002 : 350,000 +
Estimated number of soldiers from Iraq / Afghanistan who have suffered a brain injury :Â 360,000
Number of U.S soldiers still in Iraq : approximately 134,000
Number of U.S soldiers in Afghanistan : 38,000 and counting

Sun Microsystems ' soon - to - be ex-chief executive has been painting his company 's acquisition by database giant Oracle in positive tones .
Jonathan Schwartz called the proposed $ 5.6 bn deal a " fantastic day for Sun 's customers , developers , partners and employees across the globe " .
It will also " redefine " important boundaries in IT by eliminating cost and complexity in an industry focused on components .
At least , that 's what he appeared to be saying .
The only thing that 's going to get redefined is everything that Schwartz and Sun have worked towards for five - plus years : platform independence , open systems , and affordability .
but Sun was in no position to implement these grand ideas thanks to its inertia and bureaucracy
Unless there 's a radical shift in strategic direction or management thinking at Oracle , and unless Oracle adopts
Sun 's woolly and academic ways of thinking and operating , what you 're looking at is the death of the philosophy of benevolent big - company sponsorship of Java and open - source , and the death of big - company price competition .
Some have said that Oracle is a better fit than IBM would have been , because of the clash between IBM 's stuffed - shirted East Coast mindset and the free - thinking experimentalism of Sun.
But Oracle is not a dream marriage .
Oracle is a tough place .
It routinely evaluates the performance of staff and chops around 10 per cent .
Acquired staff and products must also justify their place in this Dawnian environment or they 'll get chopped or boxed .
For example , Oracle spiked its own Java application server having bought the rival WebLogic Server from BEA Systems , because WebLogic was the better application server .
It canned development of BEA 's WebLogic Workshop development environment .
Oracle will take the decisions
Sun could not - and that 's what 'll have people at Sun worried .
And while change should be welcomed , there 's no way this should be seen as a bright new dawn for Sun customers or those who 've come to believe in its actions on open source or Java .
The first thing you can expect from a Oracle acquisition is due diligence of the assets and a comparative analysis where Oracle has competing assets .
Oracle will weigh up what 's worth keeping and jettison the rest .
The latter will be marked by end - of - lifing via support and maintenance , or releasing code to the community - where it will fade and die .
Oracle initially had teamed up with Hewlett - Packard to buy just Sun 's software business - or , rather , parts of it : Java , Solaris and MySQL .
That deal was blocked by IBM .
These three software assets remain at the heart of this deal , only this time Oracle is also getting Sun 's server and storage business for an additional $ 3.6bn .
So , why Java ?
Java is strategically critical to Oracle 's middleware , development tools , application server , and database support .
Oracle has been a life - long believer in Java , which - running on Linux - provides the perfect answer to Windows and .NET from Microsoft .
Java also means licensing from all those enterprise ISVs and device manufacturers .
Solaris is important to Oracle , too .
More copies of Oracle 's database run on Solaris than on any another operating system - a fact chief executive Larry Ellison helpfully pointed out on Monday .
Ellison talked of tuning its database to Solaris , which will help keep Oracle in major accounts such as telcos , service providers , and banks and financial services that might otherwise have been flirting with Linux and its database or - worse - Linux and MySQL and Postgres .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - GMAC , the troubled automobile lender , may receive a $ 7.5 billion infusion from the U.S. government as early as next week , the Washington Post reported in its Saturday edition , citing unnamed sources .
The funds for GMAC would come as part of an Obama administration package that aims to revive the nation ’s financial system even after it found that major banks need less financial aid than expected , the Post said .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Reuters Television on Friday that the administration will provide substantial support to GMAC , a vital provider of financing for buyers of U.S. - made cars .
“ It ’s likely , again , that GMAC will need to take additional capital from the government and we ’ll be prepared to provide that , ” Geithner said in the interview .
The Treasury and U.S. banking regulators say GMAC needs to raise $ 11.5 billion to fill a capital hole it could face if the economy were to deteriorate further .
GMAC , the former financing arm of General Motors Corp. , has taken $ 5 billion from the government already .
In addition , the Treasury has lent GM $ 884 million to support GMAC ’s lending activities .
Under the restructuring of Chrysler Corp. , GMAC is assuming the business of Chrysler Financial .
When the Obama administration announced Chrysler ’s bankruptcy filing on April 30 , it said it would offer support to GMAC , including necessary capital , to allow it to finance Chrysler ’s sales .
My name is George C. Joseph .
I am the sole owner of Sunshine Dodge - Isuzu , a family owned and operated business in Melbourne , Florida .
My family bought and paid for this automobile franchise 35 years ago in 1974 .
I am the second generation to manage this business .
We currently employ 50 + people and before the economic slowdown we employed over 70 local people .
We are active in the community and the local chamber of commerce .
We deal with several dozen local vendors on a day to day basis and many more during a month .
All depend on our business for part of their livelihood .
We are financially strong with great respect in the market place and community .
We have strong local presence and stability .
I work every day the store is open , nine to ten hours a day .
I know most of our customers and all our employees .
Sunshine Dodge is my life .
On Thursday , May 14 , 2009 I was notified that my Dodge franchise , that we purchased , will be taken away from my family on June 9 , 2009 without compensation and given to another dealer at no cost to them .
My new vehicle inventory consists of 125 vehicles with a financed balance of 3 million dollars .
This inventory becomes impossible to sell with no factory incentives beyond June 9 , 2009 .
Without the Dodge franchise we can no longer sell a new Dodge as " new , " nor will we be able to do any warranty service work .
Additionally , my Dodge parts inventory , ( approximately $ 300,000 . ) is virtually worthless without the ability to perform warranty service .
There is no offer from Chrysler to buy back the vehicles or parts inventory .
Our facility was recently totally renovated at Chrysler 's insistence , incurring a multi-million dollar debt in the form of a mortgage at Sun Trust Bank .
HOW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CAN THIS HAPPEN ?
THIS IS A PRIVATE BUSINESS NOT A GOVERNMENT ENTITY
This is beyond imagination !
My business is being stolen from me through NO FAULT OF OUR OWN .
We did NOTHING wrong .
This atrocity will most likely force my family into bankruptcy .
This will also cause our 50 + employees to be unemployed .
How will they provide for their families ?
This is a total economic disaster .
HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN A FREE MARKET ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ?
I beseech your help , and look forward to your reply .
Thank you .
Sincerely ,
George C. Joseph
President & Owner
The bodies of dozens , perhaps well over a hundred , women , children and men , their corpses blown into bits of human flesh by iron fragmentation bombs dropped by U.S. warplanes in a village in the western province of Farah , illustrates the futility of the Afghan war .
We are not delivering democracy or liberation or development .
We are delivering massive , sophisticated forms of industrial slaughter .
And because we have employed the blunt and horrible instrument of war in a land we know little about and are incapable of reading , we embody the barbarism we claim to be seeking to defeat .
We are morally no different from the psychopaths within the Taliban , who Afghans remember we empowered , funded and armed during the 10 - year war with the Soviet Union .
Acid thrown into a girl ’s face or beheadings ?
Death delivered from the air or fields of shiny cluster bombs ?
This is the language of war .
It is what we speak .
It is what those we fight speak .
Afghan survivors carted some two dozen corpses from their villages to the provincial capital in trucks this week to publicly denounce the carnage .
Some 2,000 angry Afghans in the streets of the capital chanted “ Death to America ! ”
But the grief , fear and finally rage of the bereaved do not touch those who use high - minded virtues to justify slaughter .
The death of innocents , they assure us , is the tragic cost of war .
It is regrettable , but it happens .
It is the price that must be paid .
And so , guided by a president who once again has no experience of war and defers to the bull - necked generals and militarists whose careers , power and profits depend on expanded war , we are transformed into monsters .
There will soon be 21,000 additional U.S. soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan in time for the expected surge in summer fighting .
There will be more clashes , more airstrikes , more deaths and more despair and anger from those forced to bury their parents , sisters , brothers and children .
The grim report of the killings in the airstrike , issued by the International Committee of the Red Cross , which stated that bombs hit civilian houses and noted that an ICRC counterpart in the Red Crescent was among the dead , will become familiar reading in the weeks and months ahead .
We are the best recruiting weapon the Taliban possesses .
We have enabled it to rise from the ashes seven years ago to openly control over half the country and carry out daylight attacks in the capital Kabul .
And the war we wage is being exported like a virus to Pakistan in the form of drones that bomb Pakistani villages and increased clashes between the inept Pakistani military and a restive internal insurgency .
I spoke in New York City a few days ago with Dr. Juliette Fournot , who lived with her parents in Afghanistan as a teenager , speaks Dari and led teams of French doctors and nurses from Médecins Sans Frontières , or Doctors Without Borders , into Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets .
She participated in the opening of clandestine cross- border medical operations missions between 1980 and 1982 and became head of the French humanitarian mission in Afghanistan in 1983 .
Dr. Fournot established logistical bases in Peshawar and Quetta and organized the dozen cross-border and clandestine permanent missions in the resistance - held areas of Herat , Mazar - i- Sharif , Badakhshan , Paktia , Ghazni and Hazaradjat , through which more than 500 international aid workers rotated .
She is one of the featured characters in a remarkable book called “ The Photographer , ” produced by photojournalist Didier Lefèvre and graphic novelist Emmanuel Guibert .
The book tells the story of a three - month mission in 1986 into Afghanistan led by Dr. Fournot .
It is an unflinching look at the cost of war , what bombs , shells and bullets do to human souls and bodies .
It exposes , in a way the rhetoric of our politicians and generals do not , the blind destructive fury of war .
The French humanitarian group withdrew from Afghanistan in July 2004 after five of its aid workers were assassinated in a clearly marked vehicle .
“ The American ground troops are midterm in a history that started roughly in 1984 and 1985 when the State Department decided to assist the Mujahedeen , the resistance fighters , through various programs and military aid .
USAID , the humanitarian arm serving political and military purposes , was the seed for having a different kind of interaction with the Afghans , ” she told me .
“ The Afghans were very grateful to receive arms and military equipment from the Americans . ”
“ But the way USAID distributed its humanitarian assistance was very debatable , ” she went on .
“ It still puzzles me .
They gave most of it to the Islamic groups such as the Hezb-e Islami of [ Gulbuddin ] Hekmatyar .
And I think it is possibly because they were more interested in the future stability of Pakistan rather than saving Afghanistan .
Afghanistan was probably a good ground to hit and drain the blood from the Soviet Union .
I did not see a plan to rebuild or bring peace to Afghanistan .
It seemed that Afghanistan was a tool to weaken the Soviet Union .
It was mostly left to the Pakistani intelligence services to decide what would be best and how to do it and how by doing so they could strengthen themselves . ”
The Pakistanis , Dr. Fournot said , developed a close relationship with Saudi Arabia .
The Saudis , like the Americans , flooded the country with money and also exported conservative and often radical Wahhabi clerics .
The Americans , aware of the relationship with the Saudis as well as Pakistan ’s secret program to build nuclear weapons , looked the other way .
Washington sowed , unwittingly , the seeds of destruction in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
It trained , armed and empowered the militants who now kill them .
The relationship , she said , bewildered most Afghans , who did not look favorably upon this radical form of Islam .
Most Afghans , she said , wondered why American aid went almost exclusively to the Islamic radicals and not to more moderate and secular resistance movements .
“ The population wondered why they did not have more credibility with the Americans , ” she said .
“ They could not understand why the aid was stopped in Pakistan and distributed to political parties that had limited reach in Afghanistan .
These parties stockpiled arms and started fighting each other .
What the people got in the provinces was miniscule and irrelevant .
And how did the people see all this ?
They had great hopes in the beginning and gradually became disappointed , bitter and then felt betrayed .
This laid the groundwork for the current suspicion , distrust and disappointment with the U.S. and NATO . ”
Dr. Fournot sees the American project in Afghanistan as mirroring that of the doomed Soviet occupation that began in December 1979 .
A beleaguered Afghan population , brutalized by chaos and violence , desperately hoped for stability and peace .
The Soviets , like the Americans , spoke of equality , economic prosperity , development , education , women ’s rights and political freedom .
But within two years , the ugly face of Soviet domination had unmasked the flowery rhetoric .
The Afghans launched their insurgency to drive the Soviets out of the country .
Dr. Fournot fears that years of war have shattered the concept of nationhood .
“ There is so much personal and mental destruction , ” she said .
“ Over 70 percent of the population has never known anything else but war .
Kids do not go to school .
War is normality .
It gives that adrenaline rush that provides a momentary sense of high , and that is what they live on .
And how can you build a nation on that ? ”
The Pashtuns , she noted , have built an alliance with the Taliban to restore Pashtun power that was lost in the 2001 invasion .
The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is , to the Pashtuns , a meaningless demarcation that was drawn by imperial powers through the middle of their tribal lands .
There are 13 million Pashtuns in Afghanistan and another 28 million in Pakistan .
The Pashtuns are fighting forces in Islamabad and Kabul they see as seeking to wrest from them their honor and autonomy .
They see little difference between the Pakistani military , American troops and the Afghan army .
Islamabad , while it may battle Taliban forces in Swat or the provinces , does not regard the Taliban as a mortal enemy .
The enemy is and has always been India .
The balance of power with India requires the Pakistani authorities to ensure that any Afghan government is allied with it .
This means it cannot push the Pashtuns in the Northwest Frontier Province or in Afghanistan too far .
It must keep its channels open .
The cat - and - mouse game between the Pakistani authorities and the Pashtuns , which drives Washington to fury , will never end .
Islamabad needs the Pashtuns in Pakistan and Afghanistan more than the Pashtuns need them .
The U.S. fuels the bonfires of war .
The more troops we send to Afghanistan , the more drones we send on bombing runs over Pakistan , the more airstrikes we carry out , the worse the unraveling will become .
We have killed twice as many civilians as the Taliban this year and that number is sure to rise in the coming months .
“ I find this term ‘ collateral damage ’ dehumanizing , ” Dr. Fournot said , “ as if it is a necessity .
People are sacrificed on the altar of an idea .
Air power is blind .
I know this from having been caught in numerous bombings . ”
We are faced with two stark choices .
We can withdraw and open negotiations with the Taliban or continue to expand the war until we are driven out .
The corrupt and unpopular regimes of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan and Asif Ali Zardari are impotent allies .
The longer they remain tethered to the United States , the weaker they become .
And the weaker they become , the louder become the calls for intervention in Pakistan .
During the war in Vietnam , we invaded Cambodia to bring stability to the region and cut off rebel sanctuaries and supply routes .
This tactic only empowered the Khmer Rouge .
We seem poised , in much the same way , to do the same for radical Islamists in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ If the Americans step up the war in Afghanistan , they will be sucked into Pakistan , ” Dr. Fournot warned .
“ Pakistan is a time bomb waiting to explode .
You have a huge population , 170 million people .
There is nuclear power .
Pakistan is much more dangerous than Afghanistan .
War always has its own logic .
Once you set foot in war , you do not control it .
It sucks you in . ”

NYPD ’s Blue just got a little greener by adding 40 new Nissan Altima Hybrids to their fleet .
Announced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly , the Altimas are the first set of of alternative - fuel patrol cars to help with the goals set by PlaNYC .
Announced back in 2006 , PlaNYC aims to reduce Manhattan ’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % come 2017 .
“ These new patrol cars will help fulfill the PlaNYC goal of reducing City government ’s carbon footprint , ” said Mayor Bloomberg .
The hybrids will be divvied amongst precincts with large coverage areas and smaller precincts prone to heavy stop - n - go traffic : essentially where their fuel efficiency provides the greatest economic and environmental impact .
Of the forty cars , 18 of them are marked and 22 are unmarked .
And while the Altimas are the first alternative - fuel vehicles used for police cars , they account for only 40 out of the 100 or more hybrids the Department plans to deploy this year .
Currently there are 3,300 hybrids among a fleet of 26,000 city - owned vehicles .
But most hybrids are assigned to sanitation , buildings , parks and transportation .
“ The NYPD embraces innovation when it does n’t compromise performance or safety to our personnel and the public , ” said Commissioner Kelly .
“ We want to get the most mileage out of technology where it makes sense – with the addition of these hybrids , we ’re doing that literally . ”
The Alitmas cost $ 25,391 per vehicle .
Where an Impala is $ 23,967 and it ’s $ 24,875 for the Crown Victorias .
But for city driving , the Altima gets double the gas mileage of the others .
Also the Altimas has greater acceleration – zero to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds !
“ Through savings in fuel , these Altimas can quickly cover their additional cost , from then they will save taxpayers money – another example of how going green is good for our environment and our pocketbooks , ” Bloomberg said .
Nissan Altima hybrids are American - made unlike the Canadian - produced Crown Victorias and Chevy Impalas that comprise most of the fleet .
And am I the only person who sees the irony in that ?
“ It is an added benefit that buying these cars helps create jobs in America , ” Bloomberg said .
The Department will monitor their performance over the coming year to determine if they should be further expanded into the fleet .

Car Shopping Made Female Friendly
New resources empower women to take the driver 's seat at the car dealer .
April 21 , 2009  --
For many female shoppers , buying a car can be a terrifying experience .
They might be savvy businesswomen , great negotiators and smart with their money , but for some reason when they walk through those showroom doors a chill runs down their spines .
Duane Overholt , who worked for more than two decades at car dealerships in Pennsylvania and Florida , can attest to the travails that many women face when buying a car .
" Women are preyed upon .
They are easy targets , " said Overholt , who now works as an automobile fraud consultant .
Overholt said predatory dealers use all sorts of scare tactics to squeeze more money out of female customers .
The message generally is : you do n't know anything about cars , trust us .
Women are less likely to be ripped off on price than in the past because of Internet and other resources available to learn the true cost of veheicles , he said .
But too often , he said , women get suckered into buying extras , like an extended warranty or gap insurance , which is meant to pay the difference between the actual cash value your car and the outstanding balance on your loan or lease .
He said dealers will also play games with the value of trade - in vehicles .
Car Dealer Scams
Even long after a sale is made , the dealer will still target women for more cash .
That usually happens in the service department where the message is : " You 've got to get this service done and the best way to get it done is with experienced technicians , when the consumer can actually get those same services probably outside the dealership much cheaper , " Overholt said .
He said some dealers will exploit women 's fears about safety .
There might be a superficial cut on a tire and they will play it like a major safety problem that must be resolved .
" Most men will throw the dice , " he said .
" Most women wo n't . "
The same can be said about brakes -- women are more likely to replace parts that men would take a chance on .
" Dealers right now are making the money on service -- they are n't making it on sales , " Overholt added .
Partly in response to the trouble women have with car dealers , more services have cropped up to help them cope .
One new Web site , women - drivers.com , is aiming to level the playing field , offering reviews of dealerships from the female perspective and certifying some businesses as " women- friendly . "
Anne Fleming founded the site after her own experiences shopping for a car .
The former senior marketing director at a decorative lighting company was used to negotiating every day in business .
But when it came time for her to buy a car , " I wanted no part of it , " Fleming said .
So for $ 200 she hired a car negotiator who helped her save about $ 700 on a used BMW 325xi .
" Professionally I would negotiate the button off your shirt to get that get to the gross margin that I needed for my company , " Fleming said .
" But yet when it came to buying a car , I actually hired someone to do all that for me . "
The absurdity of that really hit her one day when having lunch with her boss .
After telling him about buying the new car , he said : " You manage a $ 30 million account , you travel the world by yourself , why did you give your power away ? "
Then she read the book " Women Don't Ask " by Carnegie Mellon University professor Linda Babcock .
Reading the book , she learned that two out of 10 women negotiate their first year 's compensation compared with seven out of ten men .
Then she read that women typically pay $ 1,300 more for a car than men .
That made her focus on her own car - buying experiences and spawned the Web site .
Fleming is trying to give women a tool to fight back .
The idea behind women - drivers.com is to connect women with the car dealers that have the best customer service experiences .
Women are encouraged to rate dealerships they visit .
They rank -- on a sale of 1 to 5 -- the dealers on the browsing experience , the purchase process and the service department .
Dealer Reviews
" We are up to transforming the dealership experience for consumers , " Fleming said adding that now 70 percent of women go to the dealership with someone and 90 percent of those that they go with are men .
The overwhelming majority of salesman also happen to be men .
Once a dealer has at least three reviews on the site , it gets ranked in the global directory .
There are 19,000 dealerships nationally included on the site , but most of those surveyed now are in the Pittsburgh and Cleveland areas .
Fleming plans to launch a nationwide marketing campaign at the end of the spring .
The site makes money through ad sales and by selling more - details customer survey information back to the dealers reviewed .
Elda Sullivan owns the currently highest - rated dealership , Sullivan Chevrolet in Pittsburgh .
" We 're absolutely delighted , " she said .
" It 's all about taking good care of your customers . "
Her dealership has been in the family since 1949 .
As part of her sales training , all of her staff is reminded to talk to both people – the man and the woman – in front of them .
The other key : not talking down to anybody about service .
" I think we give them the respect they deserve .
We work on treating everybody equally , training the salespeople to do all the right things , " Sullivan said .
Some women , she said , " know as much , if not more , than men about services . "
Sullivan likes the idea of the women - friendly ratings , saying there are a lot of women who have had a lot bad experiences .
" You hear so many horror stories , " she said .
" It makes you very concerned about going to a place . "
Most of her past experiences at car dealers can be summed up this way : " If there 's two of you there , they do n't want to talk to the woman . "
But after her positive experience buying the Chevy one - ton pickup named Big Bertha -- " She pulls a 6 - hourse trailer like there 's no tomorrow … She 's the best " -- Gooderl decided to review the dealer .
" It 's nice , " she said , " to know that there 's a site out there that can direct you to a woman - friendly dealer . "
This undated photo released by pro-Tamil media reportedly shows a government air strike inside a no - fire zone and civilians fleeing
Tamil Tiger rebels fighting government forces in north - east Sri Lanka have declared a unilateral ceasefire .
Rebel spokesman Seevaratnam Puleethevan told the BBC the move was due to an " unprecedented humanitarian crisis " .
Sri Lanka 's defence secretary however dismissed the announcement as " a joke " , insisting the rebels must surrender .
The rebels have been beaten back to a 12 sq km ( 5 sq m ) area .
The UN says some 50,000 civilians remain trapped but the army puts the number at 15,000 .
See a map of the region
The defence ministry reports capturing the village of Valayanmadam , and says 23 rebels surrendered and 200 civilians were " rescued " there on Sunday morning .
The report could not be verified independently .
The Tigers ' announcement came as the United Nations ' top humanitarian official , John Holmes , was meeting Sri Lankan officials to call for access for aid workers to the war zone and government - run camps for thousands of displaced people .
Aid workers have been barred from the area since the fighting escalated last year and the rebels say the government is deliberately blocking food aid - a charge the Sri Lankan authorities deny .
Propaganda war
The rebels said they were responding to calls made by the UN , EU , the governments of India and others .
From Charles Haviland in Colombo
Outlawed as a terrorist group by many countries , the Tigers are trying to show they are clearly aligned with the UN and Western countries at this point , in contrast to the Sri Lankan government which is continually rejecting the chorus of international calls for a halt in its offensive .
This is not the first time the Tigers have declared their readiness for a ceasefire in recent months .
Their past offers have often been sent to key international players with an interest in the Sri Lankan situation .
The government claims the war is nearly at an end and alleges that the Tigers have used past ceasefires to regroup and re-arm .
Analysis : Stark end game
They said the unilateral ceasefire would come into immediate effect .
Spokesman Mr Puleethevan added that the Tigers would maintain their ceasefire only if the government reciprocated .
" It is purely for humanitarian purposes and the duration will depend on the response of the Sri Lankan government , " he told AFP news agency by phone from inside rebel - held territory .
Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the BBC the Tigers were the " the losing side . "
Saying the army was within " walking distance " of rebel - controlled areas , he called for the rebels to surrender immediately and release all civilians within the conflict zone .
Images from surveillance drones showed there were 15,000 civilians left in the war zone , he added .
Denying media reports that he had been stopping food supplies to trapped civilians , he said that he himself had asked the World Food Programme and the Red Cross to deliver relief to them .
A bitter propaganda battle is in progress , the BBC's Charles Haviland reports from the Sri Lankan capital , Colombo .
The Tigers accuse the government of bringing the threat of starvation to civilians inside the war zone .
Troops have ringed off the Tigers
The government and pro-government media accuse the Tigers of keeping Tamil civilians as hostages and murdering people trying to flee their control , including little children .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war , but that figure could now be far higher because of intensified fighting in recent weeks .
Hospitals and government - run camps for displaced people in the north - east have been flooded by people fleeing the shrinking rebel - held zone as the military closes in on the rebels .
' Very dire ' situation Speaking in Thailand on his way to Sri Lanka , Mr Holmes said the civilians caught up in the conflict were suffering not only a high casualty rate from the fighting but from a lack of access to food , clean water and medical supplies .
" The situation of these people is very dire and that 's why we need to somehow find a way to stop the fighting and get them out of there so we can look after them properly , " he said .
A UN document being circulated around diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka estimates that nearly 6,500 civilians have died and 14,000 have been injured since the end of January .
The White House said it was " deeply concerned about the plight of innocent civilians caught up in the conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers and the mounting death toll " .
It called on both sides to adhere to international humanitarian law and to " stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone " .

What are these ?

It ’s memetic warfare out there , folks .
We have large populations empowered to vote , and fewer than five percent have any idea what they ’re doing or do any research .
As a result , every viewpoint has a cheering team that ’s fighting to inject its memes into the collective mind , basically using fond illusions and dire fears to convince the voting herd to sway one way or the next .
If you want to know why our government is schizoid …
I illustrated one of these memes in another blog post , but wanted to show a curious twist of history : how a meme by becoming accepted can manipulate people , but if its manipulation is not carefully planned , can backfire and reverse all gains .
Both of these have this problem , but only one has come true yet .
Postmodernism .
Good liberals quivered in their hip downtown lofts .
The forces of centralization — government , corporations , religion — were gaining power and advancing increasingly absolutist agendas .
How to combat it ?
Create an absolute of non-absolutes , and insist as in the art of Picasso or the writing of Thomas Pynchon , on seeing every situation from multiple angles at once with each angle as a valid viewpoint .
The hope was that this would cause people to reject rigid values systems .
The reality was that people used it as a justification for believing whatever was convenient , rejecting any systematic thought .

Out - freedoming .
The American right has got itself in a load of trouble .
First , our country ’s founding fathers did not agree on a lot of things , but were able compromisers .
So there ’s no tradition except European conservatism , which scares us .
And then there ’s the enduring popularity of liberal — or should we say Revolutionary — thought .
How to compete it ?
Conservatives want the welfare nanny state off their backs , and they want to compete with liberals .
Their response has been to try to compete by offering more freedom than liberal parties ; they insist on dogmatic libertarianism now , where pretty much no one can tell you to do anything if you do n’t want to .
That sounds great when you first read it .
The fond hope is that it will let the strong rise .
The grim reality is that idiots will take advantage of this freedom to be selfish , causing socialized costs and an implosion of infrastructure .
It would n’t be the first time …
What ’s fascinating to me about these observations is that they show how different memology is from sciences that predict outcome .
Memes catch on to hopes , dreams , wish fulfillment , humor , fond illusions … they have no bearing on reality .
That ’s why in the game of memes , to succeed is often to doom yourself .

At this very moment , Fox Broadcasting executives somewhere in a pre-apocalyptic Los Angeles are said to be weighing the future of the best sci- fi show on television — Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
If you 're a fan of the show , this may be your last chance to save it from Judgment Day .
If you 're not a fan , keep reading to find out why you should become one .
There 's no one so zealous as a convert , and this writer was deeply skeptical of Sarah Connor Chronicles in its early weeks , even going off - topic on Threat Level to poke fun at the fledgling franchise early in 2008 .
Today , I 'm haunted by my callous words .
After a shaky start , which might have contributed to the show 's poor ratings , Chronicles has emerged as a deeply felt and artfully imagined drama with so many unexpected gifts that it 's often hard to believe you 're watching broadcast television .
The show came to life in Season 2 , which concluded last month .
A tapestry of heartbreak , dread , looming violence and black humor , it resembled nothing so much as a sci-fi Sopranos .
The familiar conventions of hour - long dramas were routinely shattered , while the writers meticulously enriched the Terminator mythos beyond all expectations .
Unlike the blatant make - it - up - as - you - go - along ethos that powered Battlestar Galactica , the Sarah Connor writers really do have a plan .
Meanwhile , the performers have given life to a host of memorable characters , from Lena Headey 's grim title character to Summer Glau 's terminatrix Cameron , the most inscrutable , yet intriguing , sci - fi character since Spock .
Which brings us to your mission : Save Sarah .
Over at sci - fi enemy - blog io9 , they 've started a Flickr group featuring viewers posing with products advertised on the show , giving sponsors and executives important proof that Chronicles fans — unlike those deadbeats watching Ghost Whisperer — are willing to put their money where their eyeballs are .
You can also show your appreciation by becoming a fan of the show on Facebook , or joining all the Facebook groups dedicated to saving Sarah Connor Chronicles .
And visit the Terminator wiki to learn where to address a supportive e-mail to the executives who 've made the show possible .
Finally , if you 've never seen the show , or gave up on it prematurely , Amazon.com has DVD and download options for catching up .
Needless to say , a boxed set of Sarah Connor is the perfect Mother 's Day gift .

Headshot Extravaganza : Why You Need Fantastic Headshots !
Well , folks , it ’s been quite a day .
A long , exhausting , anxious , finicky , neurotic day .
To be more specific … Headshot Day .
The day I ’ve been putting off for three whole years .
( When I got my last headshots taken . )
I finally got my new headshots taken , and now that Headshot Day has passed , and all I have to do now is narrow down my option and print up my new pictures , I ’m in the mood to share some tidbits I ’ve learned along the way .
First off , I ’m hoping I ’m not the only one in the world who is consumed by an overwhelming desire to run far away to a nice job in insurance sales when I think about getting new headshots taken .
The fact is , getting good pics is a job on its own !
If you ’re new to the business , you might wonder why everyone makes such a big deal about headshots .
“ It ’s just a picture !
It costs how much ? ! ”
“ Why ca n’t I just get my cousin to take a picture of me with his Polaroid camera ? ”
“ What ’s a ‘ look ? ’
And why in God ’s name would I want four of them ?!! ”
All good questions !
In order to answer them all , I ’ve decided to write a three - part posting entitled the Headshot Extravaganza !
We ’ll delve into all those juicy questions about why you need that elusive and mysterious headshot , where you can find that awe - inspiring and fabulous photographer who can give you the best picture possible , and finally , how in the world to take the best pictures of your life .
Are you excited , or what ?!
Firstly , what the heck do you need a headshot for ?
In the most succinct possible answer , a headshot is your business card .
You want people to remember you , and a picture is worth a thousand words , right ?
It ’s the first thing anybody asks to see : agents , casting directors , managers , directors , etc .
( And if your picture is bad , it ’s the last thing anyone will see of you . )
A headshot is your first impression , and we all know how important those are , especially in this industry !
And it ’s true , they can be very expensive , but if you pick the right photographer , you will reap endless rewards from your photographic investment .
( Last spring , I booked an extremely well paying print job purely off of my headshot .
I did n’t even have to audition , they liked my picture so much .
That ’s the kind of job I like , one in which I do n’t have to audition ! )
So , let ’s talk about what you should aim to garner from a great set of headshots :
1. You Want Pictures That Look Like You .
If you send out a sexy headshot that looks like a Kim Kardashian cover shoot , and then you walk in to the big audition and you look more like Anne Hathaway BEFORE she got that killer makeover in “ The Devil Wears Prada , ” you ’re going to waste the director ’s time and they wo n’t cast you ever .
They thought they were calling in Kim !
And they got regular , normal you .
Who is perfect , by the way , for “ The Devil Wears Prada . ”
Do n’t be someone you ’re not .
Get a headshot that looks like you !
2. You Want Pictures That Make You Look Your Best : Again , I did not say “ Pictures That Look Like You If You Looked Like Angelina Jolie . ”
That being said , you also do n’t want a photographer who does n’t have a good enough camera so that you do n’t look blown out and distorted OR hire a makeup person who makes you look like Bette Davis in “ Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? ”
You want to look awesome and beautiful , but if you ca n’t ever look that awesome and beautiful the day you walk into the audition … you ’re going to waste a lot of time and money .
Mostly yours !
3. You Want Pictures That Represent Your Type : Figuring out your type is a whole other discussion , but you should have a pretty good idea where to start anyway .
Do you get cast as mothers a lot ?
Maybe you should n’t get a headshot of you wearing your leather motorcycle outfit .
Do you get cast as teenagers often ?
So then , why get a headshot of you wearing a business suit ?
Play up to your strong suits .
Photograph smart .
4. You Want Pictures That Make You Look Confident and Happy :
This leads us into the discussion about finding a kickass photographer who will help you to look and feel confident and happy while getting those pictures taken .
You want your pictures to help you sell your product : You .
No one wants a sad , depressed , and undependable product .
Unless they ’re crazy .
In which case , you do n’t want to work with them !
5. Know Why You Need Them :
So by now , you know that every actor needs great pictures to sell themselves .
But what kind do you need ?
Are you a musical theater actor ?
Or do you primarily act in films ?
Are you a model as well ?
In the most basic terms , there are commercial headshots and there are theatrical headshots , and they are pretty much exactly what they sound like .
A commercial headshot will generally be high energy and smiley ( as you ’re trying to appeal to a commercial market ) whereas theatrical headshots are more serious , with depth and an intense mood .
Resist the urge to say , “ Well , I ’m a fabulous actor who could play any part .
I can do everything ! ”
Narrow down your options and figure out what kind of headshots you need as you focus on what kind of career you want .
Once you have those gorgeous shots of your fine self , you will then use them at every single audition you go to .
( Do n’t believe people who say no one wants hard copies anymore in auditions .
Just because we live in an electronic age , it does n’t mean you wo n’t need a picture of yourself for every role you go up for . )
You can mail them out to gather interest from agents and managers .
And you can post them on casting websites like The Right Cast !
Your headshot will be your best friend in this business , so you better find one you love .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit by a Pakistani man against a former U.S. attorney general and the FBI director claiming abuse while he was imprisoned in New York after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
By a 5 - 4 vote , the U.S. high court overturned a ruling that Javaid Iqbal , who was held for more than a year after the attacks , could sue former Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller .
The decision by the court ’s conservative majority appeared to be narrow , mainly limited to the facts of the case , although it could be cited as precedent in other lawsuits .
The civil case involved different legal issues than recent demands by human rights groups to hold former officials of the Bush administration accountable for what they describe as torture of terrorism suspects .
Iqbal , a Muslim , said in the lawsuit that he had suffered verbal and physical abuse , including unnecessary strip searches and brutal beatings by guards .
He said he had been singled out because of unlawful ethnic and religious discrimination .
In the court ’s majority opinion , Justice Anthony Kennedy said Iqbal ’s lawsuit failed to contain sufficient facts of purposeful , unlawful discrimination by Ashcroft and Mueller or that they deprived him of clearly established constitutional rights .
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11
In the weeks after the September 11 attacks , U.S. authorities detained 762 noncitizens , almost all Muslims or Arabs .
Many of those held at the federal prison in Brooklyn suffered abuse , the U.S. Justice Department ’s inspector general has found .
Ashcroft and Mueller argued they have qualified legal immunity because any misconduct was done by lower - level officials and they had no personal involvement in or knowledge of the alleged abuse .
Kennedy agreed .
He said each government official generally can be held liable only for his or her own misconduct and rejected holding supervisors liable for misdeeds by subordinates .
Kennedy also ruled the roundup did not prove discriminatory intent .
He said the September 11 attacks were carried out by Arab Muslim hijackers , followers of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda .
“ It should come as no surprise that ” Arab Muslims were arrested and detained , he said .
The issue before the Supreme Court involved only whether Iqbal ’s lawsuit against Ashcroft and Mueller could continue and did not address his claims of mistreatment against other lower - ranking current and former government officials .
Iqbal sued about 30 other officials , including the warden at the detention facility and the director of the federal Bureau of Prisons .
He seeks unspecified damages .
The court ’s four liberal justices dissented .
“ There is no principled basis for the majority ’s disregard of the allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to their subordinates ’ discrimination , ” Justice David Souter wrote in his dissent .
Iqbal was arrested for having false Social Security papers .
He pleaded guilty in 2002 , was released in 2003 and deported to Pakistan .
The lawsuit was filed in 2004 .
The U.S. government paid $ 300,000 to settle with Iqbal ’s co-plaintiff and fellow detainee Ehab Elmaghraby , an Egyptian .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After more than 18 years on the nation 's highest court , Supreme Court Justice David Souter is retiring , a source close to Souter told CNN Thursday .
David Souter has served more than 18 years on the Supreme Court .
Souter will leave after the current court term recesses in June , the source said .
Filling Souter 's seat would be President Barack Obama 's first Supreme Court appointment -- and the first since George W. Bush 's picks of Samuel Alito in 2006 and Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005 .
Souter , 69 , was tapped for the court by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 , but disappointed many conservatives when he turned out to be a typical old - fashioned Yankee Republican -- a moderate , with an independent , even quirky streak .
Souter 's departure will leave the two oldest justices -- and the most liberal -- still on the bench .
Retirements for John Paul Stevens , 89 , and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , 76 , have been rumored for years , with many expecting that one or the other would be the first to give a new Democratic president a Supreme Court vacancy .
Souter 's decision came as something of a surprise , although he has long been known to prefer the quiet of his New Hampshire farmhouse to the bustle of the nation 's capital .
CNN 's Bill Mears contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Supreme Court • David Souter • Barack Obama
The FBI can't figure out the right way to add or remove suspected terrorists from the country 's unified terrorist watch list , subjecting citizens to unjustified scrutiny from government officials and possibly putting the country at risk , the Justice Department 's internal watchdog said Wednesday in a new report .
" We found that the FBI failed to nominate many subjects in the terrorism investigations that we sampled , did not nominate many others in a timely fashion , and did not update or remove watchlist records as required , " the Inspector General report ( . pdf ) said .
" We believe that the FBI ’s failure to consistently nominate subjects of international and domestic terrorism investigations to the terrorist watchlist could pose a risk to national security . "
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) , a longtime civil liberties advocate , took issue with the nation 's premier law enforcement agency letting innocent citizens languish on a secret list .
" Given the very real and negative consequences to which people on the watchlist are subjected , this is unacceptable , " Leahy said .
The FBI is responsible for adding domestic threats to the list , while the intelligence community nominates foreigners .
Inspector General Glenn
Fine 's findings are not surprising , given the Fine 's 2007 audit of the watchlist found that the list full of duplicate entries and bad information .
As of December 31 , 2008 , the centralized terrorist watch list contained more than 1.1 million known or suspected terrorist names , referring to an estimated 400,000 individuals .
The list is used by local police to screen speeding drivers , by the State department to vet visa applicants and by Homeland Security to create the No - Fly list and pick - out travelers for interrogation .
In 15 percent of terrorism cases the office reviewed , FBI agents failed to add the subjects to the list , while in 8 percent of closed cases , people were left on the list , in violation of policy .
In 72 percent of the closed cases people were n't removed in a timely manner , causing people to undergo unjustified screenings by the Secret Service and at the airport .
Neither the FBI or the inspector general knows how many people the FBI has put on the list , but the IG 's best estimate is the FBI has nominated between 68,000 and 130,000 known or suspected terrorist identities since 2003 .
Of the 68,669 known or suspected terrorist identities in the database the IG could attribute to the FBI , 35 percent were outdated or had no known link to terrorism cases .
Additionally the FBI has added tens of thousands of name s of Afghani and Iraqi citizens stopped and fingerprinted by the military with help from crack FBI teams .
These entries have little information attached and no process for removal .
The Terrorist Screening Center , which runs the list , says it is constantly scrubbing unjustified entries from the list .
When the systems record a hit for a rogue speeder , the trooper calls the center to clarify the person stopped is the person on the list and what should be done .
At the TSC , analysts sit in front of giant monitors , checking information called in against the intelligence that put the person on the list .
Along one wall , the center plots encounters on an electronic , color - coded , electronic map of the United States ..

The electric - powered PUMA has a top speed of 35mph
US carmaker General Motors is joining with scooter maker Segway to make a new type of two - seat electric vehicle .
The prototype , which will debut in New York , is aimed at urban driving .
GM aims to start making them by 2012 .
The vehicle , named Puma , has a top speed of 35 mph and can go as far as 35 miles on a single charge .
It will use lithium - ion batteries .
GM , having been bailed out by the US government , is looking to smaller vehicles to secure its future .
Puma stands for personal urban mobility and accessibility .
' Dramatically different '
GM has already received at least $ 13bn in aid from the US government and seems likely to enter bankruptcy .
It is looking to more environmentally - friendly models as consumers have abandoned their expensive trucks and cars .
" We are excited to be working together to demonstrate a dramatically different approach to urban mobility , " said Jim Norrod , chief of Segway .
Segway introduced its personal transporter in 2002 and has sold more than 2,000 in the UK .
They are capable of speeds up to 12 mph and cost £ 4,795 .
The personal scooters came to international prominence when US President George W Bush fell off one while on holiday in 2003 .
Apple Bans " Kama Sutra " from iPhone for Obscenity
As a result of Apple 's constant censorship of sexual content , Apple users are slowly forgetting how to mate , like pandas and Vulcans
Apple has banned an application for the iPhone by developer James Montgomerie called " Eucalyptus " that lets people read every " Project Gutenberg " book for ten dollars , banning it on the grounds that one of the books available -- the 2nd century ancient Hindu story known as the " Kama Sutra " -- contains obscene passages .
We 're not talking about the salacious illustrated sex manual that you giggle at with your pals in Barnes and Noble while sipping a slurpie and wearing a basketball jersey when you are twelve .
We 're talking about the high - art holy text translated by famed British explorer Sir Richard Burton .
Never particularly controversial , the " Kama Sutra " now only comes up as a lame go - to joke that business executives make when people ask them " what position they hold " on a tricky political subject .
No one cares about the " Kama Sutra . "
Generally , it is the ONLY book about sex that tedious religious people have .
After initially learning that his product would not be carried by Apple , Montgomerie sent Apple a letter asking " huzzahhow , " and received this letter in response : " Dear Mr. Montgomerie , " Thank you for submitting Eucalyptus Ã ¢ÂÂ " classic books , to go to the App Store .
We 've reviewed Eucalyptus Ã ¢ÂÂ " classic books , to go and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store at this time because it contains explicit content which is in violation of Section 3.3.12 from the iPhone SDK Agreement which states : " Applications must not contain any obscene , pornographic , offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , etc. ) , or other content or materials that in Apple 's reasonable judgement may be found objectionable by iPhone or iPod touch users . "
" Please view the attached screenshots for examples in regards to the objectionable content .
" Parental Controls have been announced for iPhone OS 3.0 .
It would be appropriate to resubmit your application for review once this feature is available .
" And here were the attached screenshots :
Are you fucking wet right now ?
Is all your spongiform tissue hard as glass ?
Yeah !
Butter my lingam with crushed beetles , elephant woman !
Rub my parts !
Flabbergasted , Montgomerie has petitioned Apple several times for more information about why they have banned his application on these ridiculous grounds .
He is most confused because the work in question is already readable on the iPhone in several other capacities , such as by searching for it on Safari or purchasing it through Stanza , eReader , or Amazon 's new Kindle app .
Apple 's high - pressure censorship tactics are working , however , and Montgomerie intends to cave to Apple 's policy and manually block the " Kama Sutra " so that he will be able to pass inspection , much in the same way that David Carnoy removed all the profanity from his novel " Knife Music " earlier this year in order to get it approved by Apple .
" I 'm afraid I 've currently decided to sell my soul , or at least rent it out for a while , and manually block the Kama Sutra from appearing in Eucalyptus .
It may become accessible again in a later version of Eucalyptus when Parental Controls become available .
If someone at Apple would like to contact me to let me know that this is unnecessary , and that Eucalyptus will now be treated the same way as other iPhone apps , I would be very happy to hear from them .
" So why does Apple find the " Kama Sutra " obscene ?
Is it because it teaches people about clits ?
Is it because the " Kama Sutra " features Hindus fucking ?
Can only white people relentlessly write about fucking and have the book be pure ?
Is everything that white people say bleached by the moral perfection of white skin , and everything that brown people say tainted by animalistic lust and third - world inferiority ?
What is more " defamatory " than not carrying ancient texts from the world 's oldest and richest culture ?
What is more offensive than saying " we at Apple think it is gross when Hindus fuck , and only enjoy the copulating rituals of Semitic cultures , preferably whitewashed by Nordic existential philosophy ?
" While it 's certainly possible that the censors at Apple are bigoted fascists who are trying to start a war with India , it is more likely they are banning " Eucalyptus " for protectionist reasons as a result of their standing deal with Amazon .
Amazon is charging a dollar for every " Project Gutenberg " book , and Montgomerie is trying to give them away for free , only charging people for the reader .
So of course he is going to take a beating until they can figure out a way to deal with him .
Apple is going to stonewall anybody who undercuts the heavily - leveraged partners that are bringing them more money .
Somebody at Apple said : " Send him the ' offensive ' letter and see what he does .
" And right now they are all biting their nails , hoping he does n't tell anyone .
If Montgomerie is smart , he will stop talking to Apple at all and file a lawsuit to get back all the money he is losing right now , seeking triple damages on estimated missed sales .
Any person who gives a dollar to Apple and Amazon for a public - domain book right now ought to be giving ten dollars to Montgomerie .
And this censorship shit has got to stop .
That ’s easy .
The Congressional Financial Services and General Government Appropriations
Act of 2008 indicates that the yearly operating expense of the White House was $ 12,814,000 .
Or , about $ 35,106 a day .
These expenses include : “ maintenance , repair and alteration , refurnishing , improvement , heating , and lighting , including electric power and fixtures , of the Executive Residence at the White House and official entertainment expenses of the President … ”
If only the answer were that simple to procure .
The real answer is exceedingly complicated .
In addition to the annual congressional budget for the operation of the White House , there are over 22 other budget accounts , in 13 different departments , that pay the expenses and salaries of the White House staff .
Defining what constitutes “ The White House ” is also difficult .
In his book , To Serve the President , Bradley H. Patterson argues that there are 23 separate accounts that make up the costs of the White House .
Some of these accounts include the President ’s Salary , the National Archives and Records Administration , the National Security Council , the Department of State , and so on .
As Patterson notes , finding the real cost of the White House is almost impossible .
The funding for these various White House functions are buried within numerous appropriation bills , some of which are classified .
However , Patterson provides a ball park figure by tallying the following expenses .
Total Cost of the Whole White House for Fiscal Year 2008
Compensation of the president ( including an expense allowance of $ 50,000 ) : $ 450,000 The Executive Residence operating expenses : $ 12,814,000 The Executive Residence — repair and restoration : $ 1,600,000

The president ’s unanticipated needs : $ 1,000,000 White House Center Service Delivery Team ( in the GSA budget ) : $ 26,000,000 U.S. Postal Service , White House branch : $ 726,000 National Archives professional archival support of the White House : $ 1,000,000 Value of gifts supplied by the Department of State for presentation to foreign leaders at White House official entertainment functions : $ 50,000 White House Communications Agency ( in the budget of the Defense Information Systems Agency ) : $ 173,900,000 Air Force One ( in U.S. Air Force budget ) ( classified ) ( Estimated cost : $ 200,000,000 )
Helicopter squadron HMX - One ( in the Marine Corps budget ; this is the fiscal year 2008 appropriation segment of a fifteen year - long procurement of twenty - eight new helicopters ) : $ 271,000,000 Camp David ( in the Navy / Seabees budget ) : $ 7,900,0005 Salary costs for 2,300 employees in above units 15 , 16 , 17 , and 18 ( all in the budget of the Department of Defense ) : $ 151,800,000 U.S. Secret Service ( in the budget of the Department of Homeland Security ) ( 21 - 26 )
Protection of persons and facilities : $ 689,535,000
For protective intelligence activities : $ 57,704,000
For handling “ special security events , ” such as the 2009 Inaugural : $ 1,000,000 For screening of White House mail : $ 16,201,000 Operations of the James J. Rowley Training Center : $ 51,954,000 Improvements at the James J. Rowley Training Center : $ 3,725,000 Commission on White House Fellowships ( in the budget of the Office of Personnel Management ) : $ 850,000 National Park Service White House Liaison Office , including the White House Visitor Center ( in the budget of the National Park Service ) : $ 8,700,000 Cost of detailees who work more than six months in a calendar year : $ 227,349 Total Cost of All White House Elements , for fiscal year 2008 : $ 1,592,875,254
( This total does not include classified expenses or donations )
$ 1.5 billion is a lot of money .
$ 4,364,041 / day , to be precise .
But keep in mind , this is for the Executive Office of the United States of America , which is more than just a building .

CNN 's Peter Valdes - Dapena was given the opportunity to test drive one of the Chevy Volt mule vehicles .
Since this is likely to be one of several we will see published I think it would be helpful to cover these individually .
Have no fear faithful readers , I too had a test drive opportunity as well .
GM though has placed an embargo on my experience and will not let me publish it until a certain number of journalists have had the chance .
If they change the rule I will publish it ASAP .
The CNN review broke down into 4 sections :
The vehilce is a mule , about 80 % true Volt .
It is a Chevy Cruze both on the interior and interior , except for a big red Kill Switch .
The reporter took it for some laps around the Milford proving ground but was not allowed to experience the generator going on .
He noted " Under full electric power , which is how most owners will experience it most of the time , the Volt proved surprisingly potent .
"
The reporter was struck by the car 's quietness noting " the silence was still surprising , " and that " the car feels particularly muscular " due to instant torque .
0 to 60 he reported was a little over 8 seconds .
He found the car to be silent and vibration free and that " when Volt owners get in their cars in the morning , the gasoline engine will not rumble to life . "
The absence of a transmission was n't needed to keep the electric motor in the performance " sweet spot . "
He confirmed the car felt like driving a 250 hp V6 .
The reporter thought the front wheel drive car felt surprisingly heavy when he went into turns .
The presence of the 400 pound battery pack was considered to be part of the reason why .
The reporter said " It felt almost like the small Cruze had turned into something more like a Cadillac the moment I turned the steering wheel . "
He said Tony Posawatz assured him this would be refined with suspension tuning by the final cars .
The reporter confirmed as we know GM is already working on 2nd and 3rd generations of the Chevy Volt that will continue to offer 40 miles electric range .
He says the next generation of Voltec cars , from 2015 and beyond will be " lighter , roomier and will cost less than the Volt . "
He concludes " In the end , the Volt wo n't be a huge seller or a big money - maker for GM .
Its value lies in changing perceptions .
A test drive in this early version is one step in the process .
" I personally asked Mr. Valdes - Dapena for his overall impression of the drive just for us here at GM - Volt.com .
He wrote back " Except for the added weight of the battery pack , I found it surprisingly fun to drive , at least at around - town speeds .
" I would keep in mind that these Cruze mules are test cars and the engineers are using them to learn how to refine the final Volt experience .
All the bells and whistles are absent .
But this report and mine and others when they are published confirms the the Volt program is real and far along and GM is ready to start showing off the fruits of their labor .
Within a few weeks the production version Volts will come off the technical center assembly line and shall offer a far more refined experience .

A team led by researchers at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory has now pinpointed the exact gene responsible for a 2007 breakthrough in which mice with symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease regained long - term memories and the ability to learn .
In the latest development , reported in the May 7 issue of Nature , Li-Huei Tsai , Picower Professor of Neuroscience , and colleagues found that drugs that work on the gene HDAC2 reverse the effects of Alzheimer 's and boost cognitive function in mice .
" This gene and its protein are promising targets for treating memory impairment , " Tsai said .
" HDAC2 regulates the expression of a plethora of genes implicated in plasticity — the brain 's ability to change in response to experience — and memory formation .
" It brings about long - lasting changes in how other genes are expressed , which is probably necessary to increase numbers of synapses and restructure neural circuits , thereby enhancing memory , " she said .
The researchers treated mice with Alzheimer 's - like symptoms using histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors .
HDACs are a family of 11 enzymes that seem to act as master regulators of gene expression .
Drugs that inhibit HDACs are in experimental stages and are not available by prescription for use for Alzheimer's .
" Harnessing the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors requires knowledge of the specific HDAC family member or members linked to cognitive enhancement , " Tsai said .
" We have now identified HDAC2 as the most likely target of the HDAC inhibitors that facilitate synaptic plasticity and memory formation .

" This will help elucidate the mechanisms by which chromatin remodeling regulates memory , " she said .
It also will shed light on the role of epigenetic regulation , through which gene expression is indirectly influenced , in physiological and pathological conditions in the central nervous system .
" Furthermore , this finding will lead to the development of more selective HDAC inhibitors for memory enhancement , " she said .
" This is exciting because more potent and safe drugs can be developed to treat Alzheimer 's and other cognition diseases by targeting this HDAC specifically , " said Tsai , who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator .
Several HDAC inhibitors are currently in clinical trials as novel anticancer agents and may enter the pipeline for other diseases in the coming two to four years .
Researchers have had promising results with HDAC inhibitors in mouse models of Huntington 's disease .
Remodeling structures
Proteins called histones act as spools around which DNA winds , forming a structure in the cell nucleus known as chromatin .
Histones are modified in various ways , including through a process called acetylation , which in turn modifies chromatin shape and structure .
( Inhibiting deacetylation with HDAC inhibitors leads to increased acetylation . )
Certain HDAC inhibitors open up chromatin .
This allows transcription and expression of genes in what had been a too tightly packaged chromatin structure in which certain genes do not get transcribed .

There has been exponential growth in HDAC research over the past decade .
HDAC inhibitors are currently being tested in preclinical studies to treat Huntington 's disease .
Some HDAC inhibitors are on the market to treat certain forms of cancer .
They may help chemotherapy drugs better reach their targets by opening up chromatin and exposing DNA .
" To our knowledge , HDAC inhibitors have not been used to treat Alzheimer 's disease or dementia , " Tsai said .
" But now that we know that inhibiting HDAC2 has the potential to boost synaptic plasticity , synapse formation and memory formation , in the next step , we will develop new HDAC2 - selective inhibitors and test their function for human diseases associated with memory impairment to treat neurodegenerative diseases . "
The researchers conducted learning and memory tasks using transgenic mice that were induced to lose a significant number of brain cells .
Following Alzheimer 's - like brain atrophy , the mice acted as though they did not remember tasks they had previously learned .
But after taking HDAC inhibitors , the mice regained their long - term memories and ability to learn new tasks .
In addition , mice genetically engineered to produce no HDAC2 at all exhibited enhanced memory formation .
The fact that long - term memories can be recovered by elevated histone acetylation supports the idea that apparent memory " loss " is really a reflection of inaccessible memories , Tsai said .
" These findings are in line with a phenomenon known as ' fluctuating memories , ' in which demented patients experience temporary periods of apparent clarity , " she said .
In addition to Tsai , co-authors are Picower postdoctoral associate Ji-Song Guan ; and colleagues from Massachusetts General Hospital ; Harvard Medical School ; the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research ; MIT 's Department of Biology ; the Dana Farber Cancer Institute ; and the Netherlands Cancer Institute .

The fight over ancient Babylon is about more than the competing interests of preservation and tourism .
It reflects problems that hinder Iraq ’s new government , including an uncertain division between local and federal authority and political rivalries that consume government ministries .
“ The political situation in our country is not stable , ” Mr. Rashid said .
“ The federal government is weak . ”
Mr. Rashid ’s board , part of the Ministry of Culture , is at odds with the newly created State Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities , its priorities made clear in its name — and the dispute is not their first .

The agencies clashed over the reopening of the National Museum in Baghdad in February , and then as now , the tourism ministry , which favored reopening , prevailed .
Its power stems not from the Constitution , but from proximity to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , who has pressed for reopening historic and cultural sites as symbols of the country ’s stability and progress .
His government made control of ancient sites a provision in the security agreement with the United States that took effect in January .
Next month , the American military will turn over the last of them , Ur , the ancient Sumerian capital in southern Iraq .
“ Our goal is that these sites will be tourist attractions — to convey the real , civilized image of Iraq and to bring as many tourists as possible , ” said the tourism ministry ’s director , Qahtan al - Jibouri .
“ Iraq needs another source of funding in addition to oil . ”
The ruins at Babylon have long suffered .
Mud bricks lack the durability of the marble of Greece or the limestone of Egypt , leaving behind little more than heaps of earth .
“ You need to be kind of a romantic to love the Mesopotamian sites , ” said Elizabeth C. Stone , an archaeologist at Stony Brook University on Long Island .
Nato officials said the expulsions were connected to a spy scandal which led to an Estonian official being jailed for 12 years .
Herman Simm , who was involved in creating EU and Nato information protection systems , has been described as Moscow 's most successful double agent since the Cold War after he handed over thousands of pages of secret documents to his Russian intelligence handlers .
Silvio Berlusconi was tonight under withering fire from opposition leaders in Italy after a court declared that he had bribed his lawyer , David Mills , so that he could avoid conviction on corruption charges and hang on to " huge profits made from the conclusion of illicit corporate and financial operations " .
The judges were giving the reasoning behind their decision in February to sentence Mills , husband of the British Olympics minister , Tessa Jowell , to four and half years in jail for taking a bribe .
Mills was found guilty of accepting a $ 600,000 ( £ 387,000 ) bribe in a case in which he had been indicted alongside his former client , who was alleged to have paid the cash .
But since Berlusconi furnished himself with immunity from prosecution after returning to power last year , the court was unable to reach any conclusion with respect to him .
Today 's judgment made explicit what was only implicit three months ago : that the money for Mills came from Italy 's billionaire prime minister .
In a tacit recognition of the seriousness of the situation , Berlusconi announced he would make a statement to parliament , but did not fix a date .
" It is a simply scandalous judgment , contrary to reality as , I am quite sure , will be established on appeal , " he said , adding that he would go before parliament " as soon as I have the time " and " say at last what I have for some time thought of certain judges " .
The leader of the biggest opposition group , the Democratic party , Dario Franceschini , said : " He should come to say , ' I renounce the privileges [ accorded by the immunity act ] and submit myself to a trial like any normal member of the public . ' "
A statement by the leadership of the smaller Italy of Principles party said Berlusconi's only alternative would be " to resign immediately , because if the prime minister does not have the courage to let himself be tried , he will legitimise in the consciousness of the Italian people the conviction that he is guilty " .
But Mario Valducci , a senior member of the prime minister 's Freedom People movement , said : " It is time the judiciary went back to being credible .
" Episodes like this merely cause distress and confusion to members of the public , in addition to confirming how necessary it was to approve the [ immunity act ] . "
Mills designed for Berlusconi and Fininvest , the firm at the heart of his business empire , a web of offshore companies .
Prosecutors in the 1990s alleged that it was used , among other things , to funnel illegal contributions to the party of Italy 's then prime minister , Bettino Craxi .
They also claimed Berlusconi bribed members of the revenue police for favourable treatment of his group 's tax affairs .
In both trials , Mills was a key witness for the prosecution .
But , said the judges yesterday , he operated as a " false witness , allowing Silvio Berlusconi and Fininvest to go unpunished " .
They upheld the prosecution 's claim that in 1997 , when he was in opposition , the TV and property magnate arranged for Mills to be rewarded for his testimony .
In a statement that he later retracted , the British lawyer endorsed the version of events that he had given to his accountant in London – that he " kept Mr B out of a great deal of trouble he would have been in had I said all I knew " .
The judges said part of the payment was to compensate Mills for the roundabout way he channelled the money into his possession , " all the money - laundering operations that he was going to have to carry out to hide , mask , transform [ and ] hold the sum that was being illegally paid to him " .
The manner in which he guided the money along a chain of offshore trusts and companies over a period of three years represented " one of his most refined and criminal money - laundering activities " , the judges said .
Mills , who has vigorously protested his innocence , has not gone to jail because under Italian law he can remain free until he has exhausted the appeals process .
The offence of which he was convicted is , in any case , expected to be " timed out " by a statute of limitations early next year .
Six projects were presented for the competition of a Grand Hyatt Hotel for Frankfurt , Germany .
The jury ’s chairperson , Johann Eisele , chose UNStudio ’s proposal to proceed with further development .
“ All the proposals were of an exceptionally high standard .
The award - winning design by UNStudio is particularly outstanding as it presents a type of high - rise which does not yet exist in this form in Frankfurt .
The contribution by UNStudio demonstrates how harmony can be created between extensive functional demands and the high requirements of exterior and interior design , ” commented Eisele .
More images and further description after the break .
According to Ben van Berkel , the design for the Grand Hyatt ’s 110 meter tall building celebrates and highlights the cosmopolitan character and diversity of Frankfurt .
“ It has three different elevations that are linked to the different aspects of the city .
The tower takes up the variation and diversity offered by the city of Frankfurt and reflects that multiplicity of experiences back to the city itself , ” van Berkel stated .
These different elevations fuse together to form a sleek façade that will appear to change shape depending on the angle from which it is viewed .
“ It appears needle - thin from one spot , strong and straight from another , and complex with a slight twist from yet another , ” comments van Berkel .
UNStudio ’s simple and yet elegant form will offer a dynamic entrance to the city while also providing 405 rooms and suites , a ballroom , spa , various restaurants , and a public Sky Lounge .
With this winning proposal , UNStudio has created an architectural language that responds to the programmatic needs of a luxury hotel and is also highly integrated into the preexisting cityscape .

Opel in Gefahr : GM - Pleite unvermeidbar
Die Bundesregierung berät über die Treuhandmodell für die GM - Tochter Opel : Sie will das Europageschäft des Autobauers vor dem Insolvenzverfahren in den USA retten .
BOCHUM taz | Der von Insolvenz bedrohte amerikanische Autokonzern General Motors ( GM ) bereitet die Unabhängigkeit seines Europageschäfts vor .
Die Werke und Patente der europäischen GM - Marken Opel und Vauxhall seien an die deutsche Adam Opel GmbH übertragen worden , sagte IG - Metall - Bezirksleiter Armin Schild , der die Gewerkschaft im Opel - Aufsichtsrat vertritt , der taz : " Opel ist damit schuldenfrei . "
Nicht eingeschlossen sei das Vermögen der schwedischen GM - Tochter Saab .
Ein Opel - Sprecher betonte , noch sei die Adam Opel GmbH eine hundertprozentige GM - Tochter .
Daher sei es eine " Fehlinterpretation " , schon von einer " Abspaltung " Opels zu sprechen .
Dabei gilt die Insolvenz von GM als kaum noch vermeidbar .
Am Mittwoch lief die letzte Frist für ein Angebot auf Schuldenverzicht ab - doch tausende Kreditgeber lehnten ab .
GM schuldet ihnen über 27 Milliarden Dollar und bot im Tausch für einen Verzicht zuletzt 10 Prozent der Konzernanteile .
Hinzu kommen Notkredite von über 19 Milliarden Dollar , mit denen US - Präsident Barack Obama den größten amerikanischen Autobauer gerade noch über Wasser hält .
In den USA wird nun über eine weitgehende Verstaatlichung von GM nachgedacht :
Wie die New York Times berichtet , sind weitere Staatskredite von 50 Milliarden Dollar im Gespräch .
Die US - Regierung soll dafür 70 Prozent der GM - Anteile halten .
Weitere 17,5 Prozent sollen an die Gewerkschaft United Auto Workers ( UAW ) gehen - GM schuldet auch dem neu eingerichteten Gesundheitsfonds der Gewerkschaft für Pensionäre 20 Milliarden Dollar .
Die Bundesregierung beriet bei einem Krisentreffen am Abend über eine Überbrückungsfinanzierung für Opel .
Mit einem Treuhandmodell soll das GM - Europageschäft aus dem amerikanischen Insolvenzverfahren herausgehalten und so Zeit für Verhandlungen mit Interessenten für eine Opel - Übernahme gewonnen werden .
Unklar blieb zunächst , ob schon in der Nacht eine definitive Entscheidung zugunsten eines der bisher vier potenziellen Investoren getroffen werden soll : " Ich erwarte nicht eine Festlegung auf nur einen Investor " , sagte Regierungssprecher Ulrich Wilhelm .
Sein SPD - naher Stellvertreter Thomas
Steg betonte , es sei nicht davon auszugehen , dass mehr als ein Investor übrig bleibe .
Im Gespräch sind der italienische Autokonzern Fiat , der kanadische Zulieferer Magna , der in Brüssel notierte Ableger RHJ des US - Finanzinvestors Ripplewood und seit Neuestem auch der chinesische Autobauer Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation .
Gemeinsam mit dem Opel - Gesamtbetriebsrat favorisieren die Sozialdemokraten aber den Einstieg von Magna .
Widerstand gegen den Zulieferer kommt aus Nordrhein - Westfalen : Das Konzept der Kanadier sieht in den Bochumer Opel - Werken den Wegfall von 2.200 der derzeit noch über 5.300 Arbeitsplätze vor - die Fabriken wären damit langfristig nicht überlebensfähig .
NRW - Ministerpräsident Jürgen Rüttgers ( CDU ) sagte deshalb am Mittwoch im Düsseldorfer Landtag , er erwarte kein schnelles Ergebnis bei der Investorensuche .
Sein Sprecher Hans - Dieter
Wichter drohte gegenüber der taz mit dem Entzug bereits fest zugesagter Landeshilfen in Höhe von 150 Millionen Euro : " Da muss nachgebessert werden . "

Infectious disease double standard
Swine flu may escape detection , too
Different strains
( Natural News ) Read just about any news report on swine flu deaths , and you 'll come across a line that claims " 36,000 people die each year from flu - related causes . "
It sounds authoritative .
It 's even a nice , round number .
But where is this number coming from ?
And is it based on any actual science ?
This statistic is being paraded around by almost everybody , as if to say that swine flu is n't so bad because regular flu kills so many people each year anyway .
The truth is that the only standard by which the CDC and WHO are quoting deaths from swine flu is .
To them , if a death has not been confirmed in their labs , it does not count as a death from that flu .
Got that ?
Only " confirmed " deaths count .
And they must be confirmed in a laboratory using a rigorous method of comparing samples taken from the deceased with a known database of viral patterns .
As it turns out , virtuallywhatsoever .
Thus , according to the guidelines of the CDC and WHO , they do n't count .
Based on their own rules , it is technically accurate to say that It's not true , of course , because people do die from the " regular flu " each year , but it is technically accurate according to the CDC and WHO rules for scientific evidence .
Again , that 's because nearly all of these " regular flu " deaths are n't confirmed by a CDC or WHO - recognized lab .
Thus , they have no scientific standing .
I find it interesting that when talking about swine flu , the criteria for inclusion in statistics is positive identification in a rigorous laboratory .
But when talking about regular flu , the criteria for inclusion is -- technically speaking -- The 36,000 number , it turns out , was pulled out of thin air .
It has no scientific validity whatsoever , even according to the CDC 's own standards .
I tracked down the origins of this number on CDC.gov , by the way .
Turns out it was an estimate derived by the CDC in 2003 ( http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r030... ) .
It 's an estimate , mind you , not a " confirmed " number of deaths .
And that estimate has stayed exactly the same through 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 and 2009 .
Not a budge .
Before the number was 36,000 , it was 20,000 for many years .
That tells you right off the bat this is n't some confirmed laboratory number -- it 's a guesstimate !
I 'm not disagreeing with the number .
It 's probably a fairly accurate guess ( the CDC folks are a smart bunch ) .
But it does n't meet the criteria by which these infectious disease organizations report influenza deaths .
As the CDC even says on their own website , " This estimate came from a 2003 study published in the Journal of the American Medication Association ( JAMA ) , which looked at the 1990 - 91 through the 1998 - 99 flu seasons [ 10 ] .
Statistical modeling was used to estimate how many flu - related deaths occurred among people whose underlying cause of death on their death certificate was listed as a respiratory or circulatory disease .
During these years , the number of estimated deaths ranged from 17,000 to 52,000 .
"
In other words , they took a look at how many people died from respiratory or circulatory disease , and from that they extrapolated " flu - related deaths .
" This is all accomplished through " statistical modeling , " which is the equivalent of statisticians waving magic wands to create new numbers where none exist .
Based on the sample size , it can be quite accurate ( plus or minus a few percentage points ) , or it can be way off base depending on the accuracy of the statistical sample .
Notably , if the same methodology were used to calculate swine flu deaths , it might currently show 300 or more deaths ( and such methodologies would be widely criticized , of course , for being " just wild guesses , " which they are ) .
As the CDC admits itself , " CDC does not know exactly how many people die from flu each year .
" And ...
" It has been recognized for many years that influenza is infrequently listed on death certificates [ 12 ] and testing for influenza infections usually not done , particularly among the elderly who are at greatest risk of influenza complications and death .
Some deaths  particularly in the elderly  are associated with secondary complications of influenza ( including bacterial pneumonias ) . " ( http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-...
In other words : Influenza is n't listed on death certificates and Thus , it is not possible for these 36,000 influenza deaths to be confirmed at all .
What else is interesting in all this is when the CDC explains that viral strains are n't even detectable in patients after the first few days of infection : -
The CDCIf this is true , thenI find this quite curious , because according to what the CDC is saying here , it is impossible to ever get an accurate " confirmed " count of swine flu patients because the influenza virus is n't detectable after a " short period of time . "
Thus , by limiting swine flu death reports to only those patients who have been confirmed in a laboratory , the CDC is essentially eliminating the very possibility that many swine flu patients will ever be tested and identified as carrying the strain .
Put another way , the criteria for identifying and reporting swine flu deaths is , itself , limiting the number of swine flu deaths that will ever be counted .
Essentially , by eliminating anyone who was n't tested in time to identify the strain .
This , I believe , is why the swine flu death count remains magically low even as doctors on the ground in Mexico City are reporting much larger numbers of real - world swine flu deaths .
The other important thing to realize here is that the 36,000 figure is not talking about just one strain of influenza :
It 's a cumulative figure " Regular flu , " you see , is n't just one flu .
It 's a collection of potentially hundreds of different flu strains .
So assigning the 36,000 deaths a year figure to " regular flu " is misleading because it makes it sound like a single strain of influenza .
The truth is that nobody really knows how many deaths each year occur from the different strains of flu circulating in the wild .
Some top - notch CDC officials can probably take a pretty good guess at it , but it 's still just that : A guess .
The real numbers are , frankly , unknown .
It 's also unknown how many people die from the viral load vs. how many die from secondary infections ( such as bacterial pneumonia ) that often follow viral infections .
Technically , a lot of those 36,000 people ( or so ) might have been killed by various strains of common bacteria , not by the viruses .
Yesterday morning , Mexico was reporting 159 deaths from swine flu .
According to the WHO , that number is not only 7 .
How does 159 magically become 7 ?
By including the word " confirmed " in front of it .
Fine .
Let 's all go with the " confirmed " modifier .
All infectious disease deaths must now be confirmed in a CDC or WHO laboratory in order to count .
So that means the 36,000 number needs to be revised down to however many have been " confirmed " in that group .
And how many is that ?
Only the CDC knows .
I 'm guessing it 's a two - digit number .
So much for the myth of " 36,000 flu - related deaths a year . "
If you believe that number , I 'm sure there 's a job waiting for you at the U.S. Treasury Dept. , too , where numbers are materialized out of thin air on a daily basis in order to finance the national debt .
I guess I feel like posting more this week .
We ’ll see if I can pull another one out for tomorrow .
I have n’t had too much time to work on future “ Greg ” episodes lately , but I feel like this coming weekend will be a productive one .
Happy Friday Eve , everyone .

Still dazed after being anaesthetised for three hours , a pedigree pet is hauled upright to show off its new tattoo .
The controversial “ body enhancement ” was carried out on Mickey – a rare Canadian Hairless breed also known as a Sphynx cat .
His female owner was said to be delighted with the Tutankhamun design inked on to his chest at a tattoo parlour .
She said : “ I wanted something new and different for the times we live in . ”
But horrified animal rights campaigners last night slammed the sick fad in Moscow as barbaric – and fear it could catch on among wealthy pet owners in the West .
An RSPCA spokesman said : “ We are totally against using animals for purely cosmetic reasons just on the owner ’s whim .
Clearly the animal has no say in the matter .
“ We do not believe in using pets as fashion accessories .
It shows no respect for the animal whatsoever .
So far we have only heard about this practice happening overseas – and we hope it does n’t spread . ”
There is a reason that the Republicans did not want Eric Holder .
There is also a reason why former Vice - President Dick Cheney practically begged former President George W. Bush to give pardons , even pre-pardons because we all knew it was going to come down to this .
What the Bush Administration did was TORTURE .
The methods used that we have condemned across the international community .
No wonder the international community looked at the Bush Administration as hypocrites , as they should have .
Folks , this is not going to be pretty and many twists and turns will be revealed .
We will hate it , be shocked at some that knew about it and will continue to question ourselves about this .
The bottom line is this , we , the American public was blatantly lied to by the Bush Administration .
This administration put us in the peril we are in now , internationally .
This was NEVER ABOUT PROTECTING AMERICA .
This was some sick shit , period .
When you break the law , you must pay the price .
This is the beginning and those of the Bush Administration need to lawyer up , because if you were a part of this , you will be hauled into court and it will all come out .
Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he would " follow the law " as he weighed potential prosecutions of Bush administration officials who authorized controversial harsh interrogation techniques .
In Holder 's first public comments on the issue since President Obama 's statements on the matter Tuesday , the attorney general responded to questions briefly and cautiously .
" We are going to follow the evidence , follow the law and take that where it leads .
No one is above the law , " Holder said at an Earth Day event .
Some human rights groups have demanded that Holder appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the matter , but the attorney general appears to be in no hurry to decide how to proceed .
Obama said Tuesday that the attorney general would ultimately decide whether to proceed with prosecutions of those in the Bush administration who drew up the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques .
Adam Burish Survives Having His Neck Cut By Skate Blade
Total Pro Sports
- This is exactly the reason why all hockey players , young and old should wear neck guards .
Protect yourself from serious injury and possible death .
Do not be a hero .
Have a look to see how close Burish from the Chicago Blackhawks came to a potentially hazardous situation .
In yesterday ’s Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals between the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks , forward Adam Burish of the Blackhawks was against the boards when his teammate Ben Eager ’s skate came up hitting him in the neck causing lacerations that could have ended his career or even worse his life .
Ben Eager fell over a Detroit Red Wings player and accidentally hit Burrish in the neck with his skate .
Thankfully Adam Burrish was able to skate off the ice with only neck scrapes .
If you do n’t believe us all you have to do is listen to the tone of the commentator ’s voice ,
“ This is terrifying , close your eyes if you do n’t like it . ”
This also happened to Richard Zednik of the Florida Panthers back in 2008 and luckily for him he made the quick decision to skate to his trainer on the bench , who then controlled the bleeding , while his neck was gushing .
( Video after the jump ) Hockey is a dangerous sport if you do n’t take the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your body with the equipment approved by government standards .

IBM today announced that it aims to take artificial intelligence to a new level with its supercomputer , codenamed " Watson , " sending the technology to compete in the world of game shows .

The computer has the ability to analyze complex questions and form answers so well that it can compete with humans on the game show Jeopardy , IBM says , and a machine vs. human competition on the show is in the works .
Watson , in its final stages of development , is a question answering system that has been in development for nearly two years .
Underneath Watson 's hood , natural language processing and other technologies analyze meanings behind words .
This gives Watson the ability to identify relevant and irrelevant content , interpret ambiguous expression and puns , decompose questions into sub-questions , and synthesize information to form an answer , IBM says .
Watson considers massive volumes and varieties of natural language , then quickly analyzes and scores supporting or refuting evidence — in a matter of seconds .
Jeopardy is the perfect forum in which to display Watson 's advances in artificial intelligence , according to IBM .
Contestants on the show must quickly and accurately answer the problems posed by host Alex Trebeck by drawing on a wide range of knowledge to quickly analyze irony , riddles , subtle meaning and complexities .
IBM says Watson can do the same -- in other words , do complex human - like thinking that computers have not traditionally done well -- with precision and speed .
Especially important will be Watson 's ability to rate its confidence in the answers it produces .
" The challenge is to build a system that , unlike systems before it , can rival the human mind 's ability to determine precise answers to natural language questions and to compute accurate confidences in the answers , " said Dr. David Ferrucci , leader of the IBM Watson project team , in a press release .
" This confidence processing ability is key .
It greatly distinguishes the IBM approach from conventional search , and is critical to implementing useful business applications of question answering . "
Details are still forthcoming regarding exact timing for Watson 's debut on Jeopardy .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A key Republican leader demanded Sunday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi produce evidence to back up her assertion that she was misled by the CIA on the use of so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Republican leader John Boehner demanded that House Speaker prove her claim that the CIA misled Congress .
Last week , Pelosi reiterated an earlier claim that she was briefed by the CIA on such techniques only once -- in September 2002 -- and that she was told at the time that the techniques were not being used .
A recently released Justice Department memo , however , says the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , a suspected al Qaeda leader imprisoned at U.S. facilities in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Waterboarding , which simulates drowning , has been described by critics as torture .
" Lying to the Congress of the United States is a crime , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said on CNN's " State of the Union . "
" If the speaker is accusing the CIA and other intelligence officials of lying or misleading the Congress , then she should come forward with evidence and turn that over to the Justice Department so they be prosecuted .
And if that 's not the case , I think she ought to apologize to our intelligence professionals around the world . "
Boehner said he has received intelligence briefings from the CIA for three and a half years and has " never felt " misled .
He also claimed that Pelosi " has , at times , objected to activities that were approved by the president .
Those activities were changed as a result of her objection . "
On Thursday , Pelosi said the briefing she received from the CIA was incomplete and inaccurate , and she called on the agency to release a full transcript of the briefing .
She also accused Republicans of jumping on reports of the briefings to cause a distraction .
The speaker 's comments prompted CIA Director Leon Panetta to stand up for the agency on Friday and challenge Pelosi on her assertion that the CIA had misled her .
" There is a long tradition in Washington of making political hay out of our business .
It predates my service with this great institution , and it will be around long after I 'm gone .
But the political debates about interrogation reached a new decibel level yesterday when the CIA was accused of misleading Congress . "
Panetta said in a letter to agency employees .
" Let me be clear :
It is not our policy or practice to mislead Congress .
That is against our laws and our values .
As the agency indicated previously in response to congressional inquiries , our contemporaneous records from September 2002 indicate that CIA officers briefed truthfully on the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , describing ' the enhanced techniques that had been employed . '
Ultimately , it is up to Congress to evaluate all the evidence and reach its own conclusions about what happened . "
Pelosi later Friday issued a response to Panetta in which she shifted her criticism from the CIA to the Bush administration .
" My criticism of the manner in which the Bush administration did not appropriately inform Congress is separate from my respect for those in the intelligence community who work to keep our country safe , " she wrote .
" What is important now is to be united in our commitment to ensuring the security of our country ; that , and how Congress exercises its oversight responsibilities , will continue to be my focus as we move forward . "
Pelosi wants the classified notes of her 2002 briefing on waterboarding declassified because , she has said , they will show that she was n't told that harsh techniques such as waterboarding were being used .
The top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee said he has read the notes from Pelosi 's disputed 2002 briefing and insists to CNN that she 's wrong .
" The record shows Speaker Pelosi was briefed that the techniques were used on Abu Zubaydah , " Sen .
Kit Bond , R - Missouri , said in a written statement .
That appears to back up CIA records declassified last week , which say that on September 4 , 2002 , Pelosi and Republican Rep. Porter Goss of Florida were briefed on enhanced interrogation techniques .
In the Senate , Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama and Democrat Bob Graham of Florida were briefed together in September 2002 but have very different accounts of the briefing .
Through a spokesman , Shelby said CIA officials gave them a full account of harsh techniques .
" To his recollection , not only did the CIA briefers provide what was purported to be a full account of the techniques , they also described the need for these techniques and the value of the information being obtained from terrorists during questioning , " Jonathan Graffeo said in a written statement .
" The Senate briefing also included an explanation of how these techniques were consistent with the law and with the national security interests of the U.S. ...
While there was a great deal of discussion , there were no objections raised during the Senate briefing . "
Graffeo added , " To Senator Shelby 's recollection of the Senate briefing , waterboarding was one of the ( enhanced interrogation techniques ) the CIA said it had used . "
But Graham insists they were told nothing about waterboarding or other harsh tactics .
" The briefing was done at a relatively low level of classification and did not get into these more sensitive areas of torture or the application of techniques to specific detainees , " Graham said . " ...
The briefing , according to the statement in my notebook , was on detainee interrogation , but it did not include waterboarding or any particular person to whom that had been applied . "

Average land temperatures in Australia are rising and extreme weather conditions are occurring .
Some of the health implications of this have been realised and others are yet to play out .
HEATWAVES Glenis Lloyd , of NSW Health , believes heatwaves represent the biggest public health burden from climate change for developed countries .
" This is where the initial energy and resources should be focused right now " says Lloyd , who envisages a targeted public education campaign for heatwave as pervasive as the " Slip , Slop , Slap " campaign for skin cancer .
And there is compelling evidence for decisive action .
In 2003 France endured a prolonged heatwave resulting in almost 15,000 extra deaths .
During this year 's heatwave in Victoria , temperatures were 12 to 15 degrees above normal - exceeding 43 degrees over three consecutive days .
Extreme heat can place immense stress on the body .
Exposure can cause heat exhaustion , cramps , loss of consciousness and heatstroke .
The elderly are particularly vulnerable , due to a reduced thirst response and ability to sweat , and lower cardiovascular fitness necessary for regulating body temperatures .
Lloyd says the elderly often compound their risk by choosing not to drink before leaving their homes for fear of needing to find a public toilet .
Lloyd believes that if a person needs treatment for a heat - related illness , the system has already failed .
Emphasis should be placed on prevention and education .
Solutions include planning events , particularly for the elderly , during cooler months or cooler periods of the day , heatwave plans on buses and public areas ( as simple as carrying supplies of water ) and ensuring public toilets are in working order , clean and accessible , ideally located along bus routes or other high traffic areas for the elderly .
Checking on neighbours during heatwaves should become instinctive - many people died alone in their homes during the heatwaves .
Australia has an ageing population and this will become a problem .
Longer - term strategies involve urban design - creating cities that do not trap and emanate heat by integrating higher ratios of green space and good public transport .
Cutting greenhouse emissions is an obvious and essential strategy .
FOOD AND WATER
In relation to foodborne diseases , mainly gastroenteritis , a NSW Public Health Bulletin says that for the most common pathogens in food , campylobacter and salmonella , " the notification rate is related to monthly temperature , indicating a potential effect of climate change " .
Food shortages are also predicted : already evident in areas like the Murray - Darling basin where food production has diminished , and some marine areas where fish stocks are depleted .
Food shortages alter food affordability and nutrition can be compromised .
Competition for crops and food supply may come from the biofuel industry as it expands and from displaced populations , from within Australia or overseas .
The NSW Public Health Bulletin says heavy rain can flush pathogens from catchment areas into drinking water reservoirs and drought can concentrate pollutants in dams and toxic bloom .
As the uptake of household rainwater tanks and storage increases , individuals need to be vigilant in preserving and analysing water quality .
MENTAL HEALTH
Associate Professor Helen Berry from the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health says global warming will affect mental health in three major ways .
More severe natural disasters will result in more cases of post traumatic stress disorder .
Secondly , compromised health from disease , such as dengue fever in the Australia 's far north , can also influence mental health .
The final effect - an indirect , but possibly the most pervasive one - relates to how people respond when the economic and social wellbeing of their community is damaged .
There is a presumption that farmers and those living in rural areas are more resilient .
But drought has been linked to an increased risk of suicide .
After 12 years of severe drought in some areas , and projections for further drought , underlying depression in these communities needs to be recognised and resilience strategies adopted .
There is evidence of higher levels of hospital admissions related to mental health during extreme heat , particularly for those with existing conditions , and a higher incidence of violence , including domestic violence .
During adverse weather conditions , the homeless will be profoundly affected , their plight possibly compounded by their poor physical or mental health .
MOSQUITO -BORNE DISEASE
The first generation of modelling climate change scenarios and mosquito - borne disease predicted that dengue virus may eventually be found as far south as Sydney .
But Professor Richard Russell , from the University of Sydney Department of Medical Entomology at Westmead Hospital , has urged caution , saying " climate change as currently projected is not likely to provide great cause for public health concern with mosquito - borne disease in Australia " .
Russell says some projections failed to take into account current and historical distribution of the diseases and vectors ( carriers ) , local ecology , societal changes and the capacity for public health intervention in Australia - absent in many other parts of the world .
He says Ross River virus is the most likely mosquito - borne disease to be affected by climate change because it is endemic and annually active in most states and many regions .
But mosquito vectors of the virus rely on macropods ( kangaroos and wallabies ) as hosts , so we first need to understand how climate change will influence macropod populations .
The virus may increase in some parts of Australia , yet decrease in others .
As for exotic pathogens causing malaria and dengue virus , Russell believes there may be an increase attributable to the number of people entering Australia carrying the viruses .
Water hoarding , tree - and sea-change shifts in population and the creation of wetlands and rehabilitation projects are all human responses to climate change , but they influence mosquito populations .
Uncovered rainwater tanks or buckets create new mosquito habitats , and greater populations in coastal areas will naturally increase human exposure to mosquitoes .
Prolonged hot weather may also extend the breeding period and life cycle of mosquitoes .
AIR QUALITY
Air quality is inextricably linked to climate .
Fine particulate matter is generated primarily by burning fossil fuels and ozone is formed in warm , polluted air with sunlight .
Strong sunlight , combined with increasing heat over summer , generates more ozone from car emissions .
The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says ozone causes direct , reversible lung injury ; increases premature mortality ; worsens respiratory diseases such as asthma , and may cause lasting lung damage .
Airborne , fine particulate matter is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular disease and is responsible for increased absences , visits to casualty and hospital admissions .
Higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations can increase plant metabolism and pollen production , and possibly fungal growth and mould spores .
Pollen and mould spores are allergens and can exacerbate allergies and respiratory conditions .
PEOPLE MOST AT RISK
The elderly , infants and young children , and rural communities will be most affected by the human health impact of climate change .
Those with chronic medical conditions , particularly respiratory and cardiovascular , are also vulnerable .
People working outdoors will need to be aware of how their work practices can affect their health - ideally with the support of industry .
Ironically , communities that have contributed little to climate change by way of carbon footprint may suffer the worst effects .
Indigenous populations who have inadequate housing and higher incidences of chronic medical conditions and communicable diseases , combined with limited access to medical services , are more likely to be left vulnerable .
Feeding the carbon monster DURING last century , while the Earth 's health has degraded , the incidence of major chronic diseases - heart disease , cancer , type II diabetes and chronic lung disease - has risen .
They account for 60 per cent of the world 's deaths and it seems the same contributing factors are responsible .
Environmental health and individual health are inextricably linked .
We have changed the way we live .
Our bodies , designed for activity , are increasingly sedentary .
We drive everywhere , do business and errands online , expect optimal temperature everywhere we go and eat what we like , when we like - regardless of local supply or season .
These behaviours are all carbon - intensive .
Automation has polluted the atmosphere and stopped much physical activity .
There are buttons to wind windows , open the garage , draw the curtains , change the channel and start the faux fire .
Professor Michael Kidd , chairman of Doctors for the Environment Australia , says : " The steps everyone can take to reduce the negative impact on our environment are actually good for our health , too . "
So , walking or cycling cut pollution while increasing cardiovascular health .
And eating less meat - which can significantly reduce your carbon footprint - is part of a healthier diet .

Walnuts for diabetics
Eating walnuts can be of benefit to people with type 2 diabetes .
In a University of Wollongong study , 50 overweight adults with non-insulin - treated diabetes followed a well - balanced , low - fat diet .
Those given 30 grams of walnuts a day had more good , unsaturated fats in their diets than those who followed a low - fat diet alone .
" The walnuts also delivered fibre , vitamin E and other components with antioxidant activity .
The walnut group also showed improvements in insulin levels and this may have been due to the presence of good fats in the diet , " the university 's Professor Linda Tapsell said .
Drilling by termite Termites could be a help to Australia 's mining industry by bringing up soil samples from far below the Earth 's surface for analysis without the need for expensive drilling .
This would also help minimise the environmental and cultural effects of mineral exploration , a University of Adelaide geoscience research student , Anna Petts , said .
" By simply taking a sample of a termite mound , geologists can gain a good idea as to what minerals and metals can be found in the ground beneath it . "
In with the old
Products , styles , and practices , like baby names , that gain popularity quickly also are more likely to fall from favour at breakneck speed , a study of 100 years of first names in France and the US has found .
But names that slowly increase in popularity persist longer than faddish names .
This would counter the theory that the decline of the old is driven by the ascendance of the new , Pennsylvania University researchers said .
NYT Pleasant dreams University of Sydney researchers have found the first hard evidence that the special masks doctors prescribe to patients with sleep apnoea actually work .
They analysed the sleep patterns of 113 patients by recording brain signals , heartbeat , muscle and eye movement and found the masks helped improve sleeping patterns in 70 per cent of cases .
" Interestingly , we found that patients with sleep apnoea have a subtle but different brain activity when asleep , " said the University 's Dr Jong - Won Kim .
They toss and turn and wake more frequently than non-sufferers .
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the House Republican leader , used the White House meeting to push for the release of more memorandums documenting the use of the harsh techniques , suggesting they could show that the interrogation methods were effective , as former Vice President Dick Cheney has claimed .
The president did not foreclose the release of more documents , officials briefed on the session said .
But Mr. Obama suggested to Mr. Boehner that the additional information would not be definitive on the value of the information obtained from the detainees , they said .
Although a full - scale independent inquiry now appears unlikely anytime soon , the Bush administration ’s use of waterboarding and other techniques that critics say crossed the line into torture could still be examined by a variety of Congressional panels in addition to the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Mr. Reid , who repeatedly denounced the use of harsh interrogation techniques when George W. Bush was president , suggested that naming a special panel would signal an intent to exact “ retribution , ” and he sought to paper over the disagreement with members of his own caucus , like Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont , who have joined human rights groups in demanding a commission .
Mr. Reid said it was premature to act without the facts that will be provided by the Intelligence Committee .
“ They will make a public report , ” he said .
“ I hope that it will come toward the end of this year . ”
But it is actually unclear how much of the panel ’s findings will ever be made public .
The chairwoman of the committee , Senator Dianne Feinstein of California , has said it is too early to know how much can be reported publicly about an investigation that is dealing largely with classified information .
While the issue is getting less attention , Congress is also showing uncertainty over whether and how to pursue a broad investigation into the causes of the economic crisis .
Some lawmakers have argued for a special Congressional committee to handle the inquiry while others want an outside panel with no Congressional ties to take on the job , to avoid any conflicts of interest .
Barry Eichengreen , an expert on the Great Depression , and Kevin O’Rourke , take issue with the notion that the current downturn is less severe than the Great Depression .
While the slump in the US is not as bad , that mis-states the global picture .
Note that many economists expect the US to suffer less than the big exporters , namely China , Germany , Japan .
The reason is that the economic adjustment required of surplus nations is greater than that of debtors .
Similarly , in the Great Depression , the US , then a major exporter , was harder hit than the overconsuming importers such as Britain , who defaulted on their debts .
The one bit of cheer is that this time around , government action is more aggressive , but it remains to be seen whether it is sufficient .
From VoxEU :
Often cited comparisons – which look only at the US – find that today ’s crisis is milder than the Great Depression .
In this column , two leading economic historians show that the world economy is now plummeting as it did in the Great Depression ; indeed , world industrial production , trade and stock markets are diving faster now than during 1929 - 30 .
Fortunately , the policy response to date is much better .
The parallels between the Great Depression of the 1930s and our current Great Recession have been widely remarked upon .
Paul Krugman has compared the fall in US industrial production from its mid-1929 and late - 2007 peaks , showing that it has been milder this time .
On this basis he refers to the current situation , with characteristic black humour , as only “ half a Great Depression . ”
The “ Four Bad Bears ” graph comparing the Dow in 1929 - 30 and S&P 500 in 2008 - 9 has similarly had wide circulation ( Short 2009 ) .
It shows the US stock market since late 2007 falling just about as fast as in 1929 - 30 .
Comparing the Great Depression to now for the world , not just the US
This and most other commentary contrasting the two episodes compares America then and now .
This , however , is a misleading picture .
The Great Depression was a global phenomenon .
Even if it originated , in some sense , in the US , it was transmitted internationally by trade flows , capital flows and commodity prices .
That said , different countries were affected differently .
The US is not representative of their experiences .
Our Great Recession is every bit as global , earlier hopes for decoupling in Asia and Europe notwithstanding .
Increasingly there is awareness that events have taken an even uglier turn outside the US , with even larger falls in manufacturing production , exports and equity prices .
In fact , when we look globally , as in Figure 1 , the decline in industrial production in the last nine months has been at least as severe as in the nine months following the 1929 peak .
( All graphs in this column track behaviour after the peaks in world industrial production , which occurred in June 1929 and April 2008 . )
Here , then , is a first illustration of how the global picture provides a very different and , indeed , more disturbing perspective than the US case considered by Krugman , which as noted earlier shows a smaller decline in manufacturing production now than then .
Figure 1 . World Industrial Output , Now vs Then
Source : Eichengreen and O’Rourke ( 2009 ) .
Similarly , while the fall in US stock market has tracked 1929 , global stock markets are falling even faster now than in the Great Depression ( Figure 2 ) .
Again this is contrary to the impression left by those who , basing their comparison on the US market alone , suggest that the current crash is no more serious than that of 1929 - 30 .
Figure 2 . World Stock Markets , Now vs Then
Source : Global Financial Database .
Another area where we are “ surpassing ” our forbearers is in destroying trade .
World trade is falling much faster now than in 1929 - 30 ( Figure 3 ) .
This is highly alarming given the prominence attached in the historical literature to trade destruction as a factor compounding the Great Depression .
Figure 3 . The Volume of World Trade , Now vs Then

It ’s a Depression alright
To sum up , globally we are tracking or doing even worse than the Great Depression , whether the metric is industrial production , exports or equity valuations .
Focusing on the US causes one to minimize this alarming fact .
The “ Great Recession ” label may turn out to be too optimistic .
This is a Depression - sized event .
That said , we are only one year into the current crisis , whereas after 1929 the world economy continued to shrink for three successive years .
What matters now is that policy makers arrest the decline .
We therefore turn to the policy response .
Policy responses :
Then and now
Figure 4 shows a GDP - weighted average of central bank discount rates for 7 countries .
As can be seen , in both crises there was a lag of five or six months before discount rates responded to the passing of the peak , although in the present crisis rates have been cut more rapidly and from a lower level .
There is more at work here than simply the difference between George Harrison and Ben Bernanke .
The central bank response has differed globally .

Figure 5 shows money supply for a GDP - weighted average of 19 countries accounting for more than half of world GDP in 2004 .
Clearly , monetary expansion was more rapid in the run-up to the 2008 crisis than during 1925 - 29 , which is a reminder that the stage - setting events were not the same in the two cases .
Moreover , the global money supply continued to grow rapidly in 2008 , unlike in 1929 when it levelled off and then underwent a catastrophic decline .

Figure 6 is the analogous picture for fiscal policy , in this case for 24 countries .
The interwar measure is the fiscal surplus as a percentage of GDP .
The current data include the IMF ’s World Economic Outlook Update forecasts for 2009 and 2010 .
As can be seen , fiscal deficits expanded after 1929 but only modestly .
Clearly , willingness to run deficits today is considerably greater .

Conclusion
To summarize : the world is currently undergoing an economic shock every bit as big as the Great Depression shock of 1929 - 30 .
Looking just at the US leads one to overlook how alarming the current situation is even in comparison with 1929 - 30 .
Palestinian children from the Balosha family , who were all killed in the same Israeli missile strike , are seen in the morgue before their burial at Kamal Edwan hopsital in Beit Lahiya , northern Gaza Strip , Monday , Dec. 29 , 2008 .
May 14 , 2009
new report released today reveals the true extent of child killings by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip during its 23 day offensive on Gaza between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) is publishing War Crimes Against Children in response to the unprecedented number of children killed by Israeli forces in its latest operation ; a total of 313 children under the age of eighteen .
Containing numerous eye witness testimonies , the report brings to light Israel�s widespread targeting of unarmed civilians , including children , throughout the offensive .
' Operation Cast Lead� was the biggest Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip in nearly 42 years of occupation .
1,414 Palestinians were killed , and PCHR investigations have found the overwhelming majority , 83 per cent , were civilians .
One of the cases in the report is that of 18 month old Farah al - Helu , who was killed on 4 January .
The al - Helu family had been told to evacuate their house in Zaytoun , eastern Gaza , but while they were attempting to flee , Israeli soldiers opened fire on them .
Farah was shot in the stomach and bled to death two hours later .
War Crimes Against Children exposes the abject failure of Israeli authorities to uphold international humanitarian law , which provides protection for children in armed conflict and the lack of adequate precautions taken to distinguish between civilians and military targets .
The report also details indiscriminate shelling of homes and schools where internally displaced people were sheltering , the psychological impact of the offensive , and the alarming scale of physical injuries inflicted on young people .
" We are calling for an independent full - scale investigation into all documented attacks on civilians during the offensive , " said Raji Sourani , director of PCHR .
" Israel must be held fully accountable for the crimes it has perpetrated against Gaza�s civilian population , including alleged war crimes against children .
We cannot allow the lives of these children to just be statistics in the history books of the Middle East . "
PCHR is calling on the international community to urge Israel to respect and uphold the human rights of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory .
" Urgent measures are needed in order to prevent further deaths , " added Mr Sourani .
The Centre is also recommending the urgent establishment of an independent committee to investigate the child killings .
The committee must meet international standards of independence and transparency and publish its findings publicly .
Read the report in English .
For more information or to arrange an interview with eye witnesses included in this report , please contact PCHR�s press officer on 00972-5988-27697 or pchr@pchrgaza.org Editor�s notes : War Crimes Against Children is released 14 May 2009 .
PCHR uses the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) definition of a ' child � as a boy or girl under the age of eighteen .
In addition to the 313 children who lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces , seven Palestinian child combatants were also killed .
A list of the names of all 313 children killed is included as an appendix to the report .
PCHR was established in 1995 and is a non-governmental organisation based in Gaza City , dedicated to protecting human rights , promoting the rule of law and upholding democratic principles in the Occupied Palestinian Territory .
It holds Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations , is an affiliate of the International Commission of Jurists - Geneva , the Euro - Mediterranean Human Rights Network and the Arab Organization for Human Rights .
PCHR received the 1996 French Republic Award on Human Rights and the 2002 Bruno Kreisky Award for Outstanding Achievements in the Area of Human Rights .

Demigod started life on the wrong foot .
The game 's street date was broken , the pirates had their way with it , and the multiplayer experience was broken for way too long after launch .
None of this seems to have phased gamers , however , as the game took the # 3 slot in the best - selling PC games for the week .
Even better ?
That does n't even count digital sales , which Stardock CEO Brad Wardell claims make up the majority of the game 's sales .
" But but what about those hundreds of thousands of pirates ? "
Wardell asked in the official forum .
" Yep .
Demigod is heavily pirated .
And make no mistake , piracy pisses me off .
If you ’re playing a pirated copy right now , if you ’re one of those people on Hamachi or GameRanger playing a pirated copy and have been for more than a few days , then you should either buy it or accept that you ’re a thief and quit rationalizing it any other way . "
" The reality that most PC game publishers ignore is that there are people who buy games and people who do n’t buy games .
The focus of a business is to increase its sales .
My job , as CEO of Stardock , is not to fight worldwide piracy no matter how much it aggravates me personally , " he continues .
" My job is to maximize the sales of my product and service and I do that by focusing on the people who pay my salary — our customers . "
Be sure to read the entire post , it 's really something else .
It 's refreshing to see such openness about the experience of launching the game , the reasons for the troubles multiplayer has seen , and now the sales that seem to validate the game 's DRM - less approach .
" When the focus of energy is put on customers rather than fighting pirates , you end up with more sales , " Wardell wrote .
" It seems common sense to me but then again , I ’m just an engineer . "
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is back in action , and that means that it 's once again time to grapple with that perennial nightmare : the Federal Communications Commission 's Universal Service Fund ( USF ) .
The FCC 's telecom subcommittee held a hearing on the program on Thursday , and a mandate that USF funding recipients provide broadband services was a key bullet point .
Congress should " future - proof " the Fund , declared the subcommittee 's Chair Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) , " by requiring that all recipients offer broadband at preset minimum speeds to receive support . "
But the event was about a lot more than that , focusing on how to rescue what is probably the Federal Communications Commission 's most troubled program .
Heart of the economy
You would think that a government agency with the USF 's job description would cause little if any grief .
The USF puts an assessment on interstate telephone bills to subsidize phone service for low - income consumers and to support rural and inner city telcos .
Plus , it kicks in some cash to support telecom / computer services needed by schools , libraries , and rural health care outlets .
In theory , we 're talking the High School Musical of telecom policies , here .
" In this time , when electronic communications are at the heart of the national economy , it is perhaps more essential than ever before that all Americans remain connected , " proclaimed Boucher .
Who can argue with this ?
But in reality , the USF is all Rocky Horror Picture Show — scarily complicated , inefficient , fragmented , and corrupt .
The FCC was supposed to fix many of the problems last year , but ex-Chair Kevin Martin could n't get a majority to go with his proposals .
Now Boucher and his colleague Lee Terry ( R - NE ) are working on a new bill to get USF off the slab .
What needs resuscitation ?
Everything .
The USF is leaking money at an alarming rate .
This is particularly true for the High Cost Fund , which subsidizes telcos in rural areas where it costs more to connect spread - out customers .
The program spent $ 1.7 billion on High Cost in 1999 and blew over $ 4 billion in 2007 .
Some of this spree can be blamed on an auditing system that the Government and Accountability Office has basically called bogus .
The USF office checks to make sure High Cost carriers complete their expense / revenue paperwork , GAO says , but it does n't check their accuracy .
So the FCC estimated that from July 2006 through July 2007 , the Fund overpaid carriers to close to a billion dollars .
Then there 's an episodic corruption issue .
Last year the government finished prosecuting a dozen people for cheating the USF 's E - Rate program — that 's the part of the USF that helps schools with telecommunications costs .
One scofflaw got a 7 - 1/ 2 year prison sentence .
But most of the USF 's problems are structural .
Bottom line : the USF would cost too much even if the auditing and con-artist problems were solved , because the ways it collects revenue and picks and compensates vendors do n't make sense .
USF watchers hope that Boucher and Terry 's upcoming bill will address those issues , and at Thursday 's hearing a gaggle of telecom executives , think tankers , and media reform folk showed up to offer their own thoughts about the whole mess .
There are a lot of proposals being tossed around .
Here 's a sample of them .
Reverse auctions with one winner
One of the biggest questions facing the High Cost fund is how to pick recipients .
Let 's go with reverse auctions , say lots of experts .
The current system " is akin to awarding no - bid contracts that last forever , " charged Scott Wallsten of the Technology Policy Institute at the hearing .
A competitive reverse auction offers the job to the lowest bidder rather than the highest .
Verizon Vice President Thomas
Tauke pushed this concept hard .
" Competitive bidding forces providers to evaluate their own business models and network capabilities , and to make their own judgment about what amount of support is necessary , " Tauke said .
" If that amount is not competitive , the carrier will not win the support . "
Right now , multiple vendors sometimes crowd various High Cost - eligible regions , and critics charge that this allows them to pick and choose where in the area to offer service .
This idea often comes in tandem with another reform : only one High Cost telco to an area .
Right now , multiple vendors sometimes crowd various High Cost - eligible regions , and critics charge that this allows them to pick and choose where in the area to offer service .
Qwest Senior Vice President Robert Steven Davis cited Hattiesburg , Mississippi , population 45,000 , which enjoys 13 carriers , all getting high cost cash .
What 's the point of letting all these people into the game , Davis asked , when it 's often uneconomical for even one provider to offer the service ( as evinced by the need for a High Cost program in the first place ) .
All these mob scenes do is drive up USF bills .
In case you have n't already noticed , the big incumbent local exchange carriers ( ILECs ) tend to favor the one - reverse - winner - takes - all approach ; but smaller , high - cost recipients that connect to those ILECs do n't .
Take , for example , LeRoy T. Carlson , Jr. Chairman of the Board of United States Cellular Corporation , whose company provides wireless service in 200 mostly rural markets .
At the hearing he warned that a single - winner system would create local and regional monopolies .
" The healthy ability of competition to drive improved services and lower prices would be muted and even eliminated , " Carlson warned .
But Qwest and Verizon have a point .
Let 's face it — where 's the " competition " here ?
We 're talking about mostly rural markets where telecommunications service is unprofitable without a subsidy .
S. Derek Turner of Free Press came to the hearing with a compromise idea on this issue : use request for proposals ( RFPs ) , to be decided by the FCC , rather than reverse bidding systems to pick providers .
Turner worries about FCC auctions — between collusion and designated entity mischief , they are not always a pretty picture .
In contrast , RFPs would allow whoever awards the bid " to weigh alternative proposals on more dimensions than just cost , " he argues .
But auctions have become a pretty standard part of FCC operating procedure .
Still , this question is probably one of the reasons why the FCC did n't get USF reform off the ground in 2007 .
Martin and now - interim Chair Michael Copps disagreed about it .
We 'll see what Boucher and Terry do with the issue as they introduce new legislation .
Identical support crisis
Most parties agree that the USF 's " identical support rule " has to go .
Rural telephone cooperative manager Gregory Hale called the regulation " arcane and nonsensical . "
The rule calculates subsidies to smaller wireless carriers that serve rural areas based on the funding that the incumbent carriers that they connect to receive per line , rather than on the actual costs of the smaller telcos .
Hale came to the hearing as spokesperson for the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association .
He argued that identical support , in combination with no requirement that carriers serve an entire market area , functions as an incentive for companies to zone in on regions where incumbents have built out infrastructure .
" Meanwhile the same competitors totally overlook the rural markets of the large carriers where deployment has typically not been widespread , " he noted , " and where for this and other reasons universal service dollars are not flowing and thus would not flow under the identical support rule . "
This is probably the main reason why USF high cost payments have ballooned over the years — and perhaps why Hattiesburg has 13 carriers .
The FCC put a cap on high cost payments last year , but that 's only a temporary measure until the identical support rule gets whacked , as per the recommendation of the USF 's own Federal - State Joint Board .
Pretty much everybody also agrees that the USF has to do something about intercarrier compensation .
Those are the fees that carriers charge other carriers to pass messages across their ends of the public network .
Intercarrier comp access rates rise or fall depending on whether the call is an inter - or intra-state message or local or long distance .
But as a chorus of critics observe , these differences have become meaningless in the age of IP telephony .
" The distinctions underlying the intercarrier - compensation system no longer exist and should no longer drive policy , " Verizon 's Tauke told Boucher 's committee .
Verizon wants the FCC to transition to a " single , low , uniform rate when companies terminate traffic . "
Intercarrier is n't directly part of the USF , however .
The way that the USF collects revenue from mobile and wireline service subscribers is .

Not a blogger per se , trends researcher Gerald Celente publishes his predictions for the future in a quarterly journal .
In December 2007 , he called “ The Panic of ' 08 , ” featuring “ failing banks , busted brokerages , toppled corporate giants , bankrupt cities , states in default ....
When the giant firms fall , they ’ll crush the man on the street . ”
The journal is by paid subscription only , but Celente makes frequent radio appearances , which his many fans record and post online .
Prediction :
The current economic crisis will be worse than the Great Depression , with a rise in alternative living arrangements .

Her goal is to connect the dots between peak oil , global climate change , financial collapse and other ongoing trends and debates .
The common thread :
Our way of life can not be sustained .
And it will all end badly .
Prediction : “ It ’s not going to be like falling off a cliff but a slow descent with tipping points .
There are going to be different kinds of Katrinas , economic crises , natural disasters , and nuclear exchanges — but I really hope I am wrong about that . ”
Generational Dynamics
John Xenakis
Xenakis , a computer consultant , analyzes previous and current generations in American history to predict catastrophe to come .
He believes the exit of the Greatest Generation from the workforce in the 1990s set the stage for disaster as Baby Boomers , who are uncomfortable with authority , fell prey to the amoral Gen Xer ’s right behind them .
The two groups combined to bring us the current financial crisis as the Baby Boomers want money badly enough not to ask many questions about its provenance , while the equally greedy Gen Xer ’s are nihilistic enough to do what it takes to get it .
Prediction :
The misbegotten combination of the Boomers and the Gen Xers will continue to cause trouble for several more decades , leading to complete financial collapse and war before Xers are able to turn things around in their old age .
Says Xenakis , “ I do n’t expect to live through it . ”

Irvine Housing Blog
Larry Roberts
Many bloggers are writing about the housing bust but perhaps Larry Roberts , a.k.a.
IrvineRenter , has found the best way to demonstrate how everyone from the lowliest buyer to the highest paid financier was implicated in the bubble .
Almost daily , he posts a house for sale in Irvine , California , taking readers on a journey through the home ’s recent financial history .
He reveals the price the home was originally purchased for , how much money was taken out of the home during various re-financings , and what the potential loss to the bank is if the house sale goes thru .
Needless to say , sardonic comments abound .
Prediction : Roberts is the cockeyed optimist of our bunch .
He plans to change his handle to IrvineHomeowner in 2011 , when he believes the housing market will bottom out .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Question :
How many years since the Civil War have both U.S. senators from Pennsylvania been Democrats ?
Sen .
Arlen Specter 's breed of fiscally conservative , socially progressive lawmakers is on decline in Northeast .
Answer : two .
The state sent Democrats Francis Myers and Joseph Guffey to the Senate between 1945 and 1947 .
If you knew that , you understand just how far the Republican Party has fallen in its ancestral homeland of the Northeast , a decline that was underscored by Sen.
Arlen Specter 's recent decision to leave the party .
Specter 's decision to join Pennsylvania Sen .
Bob Casey on the Democratic side of the aisle raises a host of questions about a party that , after years in power , suddenly finds itself hemorrhaging voters and ceding vast swaths of electoral terrain .
First and foremost , who killed the Rockefeller Republicans ?
What happened to Specter 's breed of fiscally conservative , socially progressive , temperamentally moderate Northeastern officeholders ?
And if they can be resurrected , should they ?
Liberal to moderate Northeastern Republicans once were as much a part of the political landscape as today 's liberals from Massachusetts .
Now , they live mostly in the history books .
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine may be the last ones standing in today 's Senate .
The Northeast region sealed the deal for Abe Lincoln in 1860 .
It broke the back of William Jennings Bryan 's populist Democrats in 1896 .
It kept the Republicans in power for all but 16 years between the Civil War and the New Deal .
Specter 's home state was the only large industrial state to back Herbert Hoover over Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 .
Even after FDR started tilting the region to the Democrats , it produced a slew of moderate GOP officeholders , postwar leaders like New York 's Nelson Rockefeller and Jacob Javits , Pennsylvania 's Richard Schweiker and John Heinz , Maine 's Margaret Chase Smith and William Cohen , Massachusetts ' Leverett Saltonstall and Ed Brooke , Connecticut 's Prescott Bush and Lowell Weicker , Rhode Island 's John Chafee , New Jersey 's Clifford Case and Maryland 's Mac Mathias .
So what happened ?
In short , notes CNN Polling Director Keating Holland , there has been a slow but steady Northern backlash to the GOP 's four - decade - old " Southern strategy . "
Race and religion brought Southern whites into the Republican Party but also began pushing out a lot of affluent Northern suburbanites .
Those socially moderate voters formed the core of the Rockefeller Republican constituency .
Major political realignments do n't happen overnight , however .
A lot of disaffected Dixiecrats continued voting Democratic in state and local elections for a long time , even after being wooed by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan .
Old habits die hard , and Southern Democratic parties slowed their decline by continuing to nominate candidates more in step with voters in their states .
The same story , only in reverse , held true in the Northeast .
Thirty years ago , after Nixon but before the Reagan Revolution , the 11 Northeastern states stretching from Maryland to Maine still sent 37 Republicans to the House of Representatives and another 10 to the Senate .
Today , those same states have 18 Republican representatives in the House and three in the Senate .
The numbers are more stark in New England and New York .
New England no longer has a single GOP representative in the House .
The 29 - member New York House delegation has only three Republicans .
And what about Specter 's home state ?
Since Nixon implemented the Southern strategy in 1968 , the Republican presidential nominee 's share of the popular vote in Pennsylvania has been smaller than his share of the nationwide vote in every election .
The erosion of the Rockefeller Republican vote is clearly seen in election returns from Specter 's political base , the moderate Philadelphia suburbs .
In 1976 , Gerald Ford lost Pennsylvania to Jimmy Carter while carrying suburban Bucks , Chester , Delaware and Montgomery counties .
In 2008 , John McCain lost Pennsylvania to Barack Obama while getting crushed in those same counties .
McCain lost Delaware and Montgomery counties by more than 20 points .
Those same suburbs are now represented by only one Republican congressman , moderate Rep. Jim Gerlach , who has been elected in each of the past four cycles by the skin of his teeth .
Increasingly precise gerrymandering to create safer districts for incumbents has taken a bad situation for moderate Republicans and made it worse .
Safe Republican districts are conservative districts , and conservative districts do n't nominate moderates .
When Specter announced his defection to the Democrats , he noted that more than 200,000 Pennsylvania Republicans changed their registration to become Democrats in 2008 .
Specter knows that the bulk of those switches came from the moderate suburbs .
After barely beating conservative challenger Pat Toomey for the 2004 GOP nomination , he could read the writing on the wall for the 2010 primary .
Now that Specter 's gone to the other side , should Pennsylvania Republicans nominate a conservative in 2010 ?
Not if they want to have a good chance to win .
A new Quinnipiac poll of Pennsylvania voters suggests that Specter would beat Toomey , a former congressman , by 20 points in a general election contest .
Former Gov. Tom Ridge , a social moderate in the Rockefeller Republican mold , trails Specter by only 3 points , a statistical dead heat .
It 's not impossible for more conservative candidates to win statewide in the Northeast -- former Pennsylvania Sen .
Rick Santorum won two terms before losing in 2006 -- but it is significantly harder and happens much less often .
Conservative candidates in step with today 's Southern - dominated GOP are out of step in the Northeast .
They also represent a distinct ideological minority on the West Coast , much of the Midwest and , increasingly , the Southwest .
Of course , GOP strategists are right when they say the party has been left for dead before , only to spring back to life .
Barry Goldwater 's 1964 blowout loss was followed by major Republican gains in the 1966 midterms and Nixon 's triumphant return in 1968 .
The party 's 1974 Watergate debacle laid the groundwork for Reagan .
And Bill Clinton 's 1992 win paved the way for the GOP 's first House majority in forty years .
But what may make the fallout from 2008 different is the clear regional nature of the GOP 's setback .
The wipeout in the old Republican heartland has been a long time coming .
At the same time , the Republicans have lost some ground in the South and the West because the Democrats have been willing to nominate candidates who differ with national party leaders on hot button social issues like gun control and abortion .
They also have n't been afraid to throw a few fiscal conservatives into the mix .
Winning national coalitions are rarely unified on all of the big issues .
The GOP now has to decide whether it wants to copy the Democrats ' strategy in the Northeast or whether it would rather circle the ideological wagons .
The decision may dictate the shape of American politics for years to come .

Really Random Game Generator Idea
Alright so here it goes , just an idea on a sort of dice - based generator since I have no clue about programming ; constructive critique would be awesome !
I know there are already plenty of generator things for a variety of things .
A lot of them are great looking but I have an idea for one which presents a " skeleton " of a game , and then leaves it up to you to apply the meat ( or use other generators ; such as NPC generators , building generators , etc ) .
The inspiration for this comes from looking at some tables in Spycraft 2.0 and thinking " Hey , its 20 , and therefore can be rolled for " .
I tried to make it usable for as many game types as possible , though do feel free to be like " Eh , I already want so and so , I 'll skip to the stuff lower down " or " I do n't want to have such and such as an option ; I 'll take it off both the option list and from the total amount " , for obviously , it 's hard for a guy to get from Norway to South Africa on horse just to do a single mission , and lvl 40 in some systems are more powerful then DnD 's lvl 40 .

Continuing from previous examples : Somehow , for each mission within the single - season 3 - mission game , the players will be changing region to region .
Season 1 :
- Mission 1 : Takes place in Eastern Asia and comprises of the following objective .
-- Sting ; Grade 5 sting operation .
- Mission 2 : Takes place in Eastern Europe ( Includes Russia ) and comprises of the following objective
 Grade 2 Rescue
 Grade 2 Infiltrate
 Grade 5 Test
 Grade 4 Crucial Skill Check
- Mission 3 : Also takes place in Eastern Europe ( Includes Russia ) and comprises of the following objectives
 Grade 4 Crucial Skill Check
 Grade 4 Repair
 Grade 4 Infiltrate
 Grade 2 Confirm
So in the end I was surprisingly able to make a realistic short game which is tempting for even myself to run~ !
I infact did use the system to create the example .
Note however that game creations using this can get a bit off the track of realism ..
27th century lvl 30 humanitarian aid workers in a world thats opposite of steam punk ( Like , they only have the technology of 1867 ) , but has cybernetics and mutants , dealing with missions that primarily have to due with neutralization , destruction , and capturing .
Pretty long , I know .
It 's due to me not knowing anything about programming software programs and junk .

While last week brought news of DDoS attacks on the main website of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , ifpi.org , which rendered the site sluggish and slow for most of Monday , there was no mention of similar attacks directed at lawyers representing the music , movie and game industries .
It seemed the lawyers on the prosecuting side of the Pirate Bay case had made it away unscathed , but not so .
According to TorrentFreak , this past weekend brought similar troubles for Monique Wadsted , a lawyer who represented several major movie studios and called for a “ very significant ” prison sentence for the defendants during the Pirate Bay Trial .
The movie industry lawyer ’s site , MAQS , was targeted and yesterday the site displayed a notice informing visitors it was under attack .
“ Our website is currently under attack and we have therefore decided to shut it down until the attack ceases .
For further information call Monique Wadsted . ”
While it was never specified that these attacks were launched by Pirate Bay fans , it 's not exactly a huge leap to make and we 're curious to hear what you guys think .
It ’s safe to say the majority of you disagree with the verdict reached in court , but do you think it ’s out of line for people to be taking matters into their own hands in an attempt to get back at the opposition ?
The four men found guilty ( along with their lawyers ) have said they will appeal the verdict and remain adamant that the war is far from over , so are these vigilantes jumping the gun a bit ?
Or are you of the opinion that TPB fans should be causing the judge , jury and lawyers involved ( as well as music , movie and game industries ) as many headaches as possible ?
Leave your thoughts below .

ID cards were first suggested by David Blunkett in 2001 Former Home Secretary David Blunkett says the government should scrap plans to introduce ID cards for all in favour of mandatory biometric passports .
Speaking at InfoSec 2009 , a security conference held in London , the MP for Sheffield Brightside said biometric passports could do the job .
He said he had put the idea to the current Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
He mooted the idea of ID cards when Home Secretary in 2001 , but has changed his position in the last few months .
Asked whether ID cards could be dropped , Mr Blunkett told the BBC : " I think it is possible to mandate biometric passports .
" Most people already have a passport but they might want something more convenient to carry around than the current passport and may be able to have it as a piece of plastic for an extra cost . "
Using existing databases to hold the same information already gathered to issue passports could be a way of allaying fears over a new " database of information " , one of the key criticisms of the ID scheme .
" People do n't worry about the Passport Agency but they do worry about some mythical identity database , " he said .
Last month Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said government plans for introducing ID cards were " on track " but there have been reports that the scheme could be dropped .
The Independent newspaper reports that senior cabinet ministers are privately discussing a plan to scrap ID cards as part of a public spending savings plan .
The Home Office has estimated that universal ID cards could cost £ 1.25 bn over the next 10 years .
Mr Blunkett said mandatory biometric passports would be considerably cheaper .
" Most of the cost is borne by the person purchasing the passport , " he said .
The government began issuing passports containing biometric information in March 2006 .
Conservative leader David Cameron has already signalled that ID cards would be scrapped if his party wins power in next year 's elections .
A spokesman for the Home Office said the government was still committed to ID cards .
He said : " There is no large fund of money to spend if ID cards were cancelled .
" ID cards will provide the public with a single , simple and secure way for individuals to prove their identity and safeguard their personal details - protecting the community against crime , illegal immigration , and terrorism . "
The Home Office added : " The Home Secretary already announced last year that that as the National Identity Service rolls out in 2011 / 12 we will be offering British citizens the choice of having an identity card , a passport or both . "

“ While we ’ve devoted substantial resources to developing these products and learned a lot along the way , we have n’t had the impact we hoped for , ” Susan Wojcicki , a vice president for product management , wrote on a blog announcing the end of Audio Ads .
Ms. Wojcicki said Google would apply some of its radio advertising technologies to selling ads on online audio programs .
She also said that Google would try to find jobs for most of the people involved in the radio ads program but that up to 40 people might be laid off .
A Google spokesman declined to say how many people worked on the radio initiative .
The announcement on Thursday also highlighted Google ’s efforts to cut costs and focus on fewer , more promising projects as its core search advertising business has slowed sharply during the recession .
Three weeks ago , Google ended its Print Ads program , which sold spots in newspapers .
Only one of Google ’s offline advertising initiatives survives  the more ambitious effort to sell TV ads .
Ms. Wojcicki said Google would continue to invest in it .
While Google has had middling success so far in TV advertising , analysts say , the company is not likely to give up on the effort quickly , because the market is so large and the initiative could help YouTube , Google ’s video site .
One thing about the whole torture nightmare that I think everyone needs to bear in mind is the meaning of the phrase “ bad faith ” .
Let ’s use a typical regional manager job as an example to illustrate my point .
Let ’s say that you ’re sitting down at your desk and a new profitability report just came in to your inbox .
While reading it , you happen to notice that one of your region ’s factories came in way under expectations .
In order to figure out what happened to cause the numbers to drop , you call up the plant manager , who tells you that everything is fine because , even though one of the main production lines was down for repairs , the problem is now fixed and everything is humming along smoothly .
Everything ’s fine , right ?
You know the plant manager and consider him to be an honest guy — so you can probably rely on his word that everything is back to normal , right ?
Well — what if you received a call from the night shift supervisor , who told you that last month ’s numbers were down because the plant manager embezzled half the budget for the month ?
What if you got an email from the shop steward that accused the plant manager of firing his top guys without cause , thereby dramatically reducing productivity and output ?
The above situation illustrates the difference between “ good faith ” and “ bad faith ” .
If the only information you had was the explanation of the plant manager , who you knew to be a trustworthy guy and you had not yet received any contrary information , you could probably rely in “ good faith ” on the word of the plant manager .
However , once you start getting contradictory information from people like the night shift supervisor and shop steward , you need to follow up on their concerns and not just sweep them under the rug — otherwise you would be operating in “ bad faith “ .
Bear all that in mind when you read the following .
Exhibit 1 : On October 1 2002 , Major General Michael Dunlavey sent a memo to General James Hill , Commander of US Southern Command , requesting the authority to use “ aggressive interrogations techniques ” like those used in SERE training .
The memo reached Richard Myers , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Joint Staff solicited views of the military services .
Here ’s what came back in November :
Air Force : “ serious concerns regarding the legality of many of the proposed techniques … Some of these techniques could be construed as ‘ torture ‘ . ”
Further , they were concerned that “ implementation of these techniques could preclude the ability to prosecute the individuals interrogated , ” because “ Level III techniques will almost certainly result in any statements obtained being declared as coerced and involuntary , and therefore inadmissible …
Criminal Investigative Task Force ( CITM ) : Chief Legal Advisor to the CITF at Gitmo , Maj Sam W. McCahon , writes “ Both the utility and the legality of applying certain techniques identified in the memorandum listed above are , in my opinion , questionable .
Any policy decision to use the Tier III techniques , or any techniques inconsistent with the analysis herein , will be contrary to my recommendation .
The aggressive techniques should not occur at GTMO where both CITF and the intelligence community are conducting interviews and interrogations . ”
He calls for further review and concludes by saying “ I cannot advocate any action , interrogation or otherwise , that is predicated upon the principal that all is well if the ends justify the means and others are not aware of how we conduct our business . ”
Army : The Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans writes : “ As set forth in the enclosed memoranda , the Army interposes significant legal , policy and practical concerns regarding most of the Category II and all of the Category III techniques proposed . ”
Navy : recommends that “ more detailed interagency legal and political review be conducted on proposed techniques . ”
Marine Corp : expressed strong reservations , since “ several of the Category II and III techniques arguably violate federal law , and would expose our service members to possible prosecution . ”
Called for further review .
Legal adviser to the Joint Chiefs , Jane Dalton , commenced the review that was requested by the military services .
But before it was concluded , Myers put a stop to it — at the request of Jim Haynes , the Department of Defense General Counsel , who was told by Rumsfeld that things were “ taking too long . ”
Over the objections of the Army , the Navy , the Marines , the Air Force and the Criminal Investigation Task Force , Haynes recommended that the “ aggressive technique ” be approved without further investigation .
He testified that Wolfowitz , Feith and Myers concurred .
On December 2 , 2002 Rumsfeld approved Haynes ’ recommendation with the famous comment “ I stand for 8 - 10 hours a day .
Why is standing limited to 4 hours ? ”
Exhibit 2 : As early as 2002 , the FBI refused to take part in so - called “ enhanced interrogation ” and made their strong concerns known :
By June 2002 — again , months before the Department of Justice gave the legal green light for interrogations — an F.B.I. special agent on the scene of the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah refused to participate in what he called “ borderline torture , ” according to a D.O.J. investigation cited in the Levin report .
Soon after , F.B.I. Director Robert Mueller commanded his personnel to stay away from the C.I.A. ’s coercive interrogations .
Exhibit 3 : In 2002 , the Pentagon ’s Office of Legal Counsel requested advice from the top Defense Department office responsible for training our troops to resist torture by foreign governments ( the JPRA ) .
In response , the JPRA informed the Pentagon that the actions they were planning to take were “ torture ” :
The military agency that provided advice on harsh interrogation techniques for use against terrorism suspects referred to the application of extreme duress as “ torture ” in a July 2002 document sent to the Pentagon ’s chief lawyer and warned that it would produce “ unreliable information . ”
“ The unintended consequence of a U.S. policy that provides for the torture of prisoners is that it could be used by our adversaries as justification for the torture of captured U.S. personnel , ” says the document , an unsigned two - page attachment to a memo by the military ’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency .
Parts of the attachment , obtained in full by The Washington Post , were quoted in a Senate report on harsh interrogation released this week .
It remains unclear whether the attachment reached high - ranking officials in the Bush administration .
But the document offers the clearest evidence that has come to light so far that technical advisers on the harsh interrogation methods voiced early concerns about the effectiveness of applying severe physical or psychological pressure .
Exhibit 4 : After reading the notorious Bush Torture Memos written by Yoo , Bradbury and Bybee in 2005 , a top State Department lawyer working under Condoleezza Rice found their legal reasoning to be disturbing and deeply flawed :
[ T ]he former aide to Condoleeza Rice , Philip Zelikow , submitted a memo to the State Department insisting that the abusive interrogation policies under consideration and approved by the OLC lawyers were clearly illegal .
The issue here is n’t that someone disagreed with their policies ; it ’s that , according to Zelikow : “ The White House attempted to collect and destroy all copies of my memo . ”
So think about all of that for a minute .
Some former Bush administration officials would like you to believe that they should n’t be prosecuted for formulating the torture program because they were acting in good faith in reliance on the legal reasoning contained in the Torture Memos .
The part they ’re leaving out , however , is the mountain of evidence in their possession that demonstrated the serious concerns expressed by a wide variety of officials , lawyers and military commanders as early as 2001 .
It is definitionally impossible for someone to be acting in good faith when they only select out the information that supports the program they are intent on implementing and cast aside any information or opinions that contradict their findings or rationale .
The officials in the Bush administration who devised the torture program were acting in extreme bad faith , and for this they must be prosecuted .
For the second time in recent days , a Canadian warship has intervened to protect ships in the Gulf of Aden from pirates .
Canadian sailors seized several weapons , including assault rifles .
( ( CBC ) )
A Sea King helicopter from HMCS Winnipeg chased two suspected pirate boats , which split up and sped away after the men on board spotted the aircraft .
Both the helicopter and warship caught up to one of the boats , about 80 kilometres off the coast of Yemen .
A boarding party seized several weapons from the boat , including AK - 47 assault rifles , ammunition , an M - 16 rifle and a rocket - propelled grenade launcher with two warheads , said Cmdr. Craig Baines , captain of HMCS Winnipeg .
The three - member crew of the skiff had dumped a large aluminum ladder overboard , which was recovered .
" That kind of ladder would typically be placed alongside a merchant vessel in these waters where so many merchant vessels have been hijacked , " the CBC's David Common reported from aboard the Canadian navy patrol frigate .
The ship stopped the second skiff less than an hour later and found several more weapons , many of them tucked under the engine .
In total , six suspected Somalian pirates were questioned , relieved of their weapons and released .
Under international law , the Canadian sailors were not able to hand them over to authorities on shore for prosecution because they were not actually hijacking any vessel .
Last Friday , HMCS Winnipeg , which is part of an international fleet of warships that protect merchant vessels navigating the busy shipping route , intervened to protect two ships threatened by pirates off the coast of Somalia .
New footage obtained by the Guardian today gives an insight into the way police and protesters treated Ian Tomlinson , the man who collapsed and died shortly after being struck and pushed over by the police at last week 's G20 protest .
The video provides further evidence that the initial explanation of Tomlinson 's final moments released by police was misleading .
It also corroborates the version of events given to the Guardian by witnesses to his death , some of whom are pictured in the film .
Moments before the video was shot , around 7.20 pm on 1 April , Tomlinson was struck with a baton and thrown to the floor by a riot officer who had covered half his face with a balaclava and concealed his badge number .
Tomlinson was then seen stumbling down Cornhill , in the City of London , towards the spot , opposite St Michael 's Alley , where he collapsed .
The footage , shot by Nabeela Zahir , a 27 - year - old freelance journalist from London , contains three important elements to note :
• Police move quickly to push away those protesters and bystanders who were aiding Tomlinson , including a man on the phone to the ambulance service .
The ambulance service wanted to be put in contact with the officer , who declined to take the call .
• The reaction of protesters is important .
After the demonstration , police accused them of impeding Tomlinson 's treatment by subjecting the officers and medics to a hail of missiles .
In the video , a missile is seen to be thrown but you can hear someone in the crowd saying : " There 's someone hurt .
Do n't throw anything . "
This indicates something was thrown , but certainly there was no barrage of missiles on film , and nothing reached the police .
A man is also seen , standing with his arms in the air , shouting : " There is someone hurt here .
Back the fuck up . "
• The riot officers have concealed their faces .
Pause at 56 seconds .
There are four officers in shot .
Three have their face masks pulled half - way up their faces .
• This article was amended on Friday 10 April 2009 .
The original version said that no missiles were thrown while the camera was rolling .
This has been corrected .

Facebook launched a new set of APIs on Monday that allow third - party software to interact with the Facebook activity stream .
Developers can use these new APIs to build sophisticated Facebook client applications that give users direct access to the stream from their desktop .
Courtesy of these APIs , rich support for Facebook could soon arrive in your favorite Twitter client and other social networking programs .
In this article , I 'll give you an inside look at how I used the new APIs to add full support for the Facebook stream in Gwibber , my own open source microblogging client for Linux .
The activity stream includes several kinds of content , including status updates , images , links , videos , and content that is imported from other services , such as Delicious bookmarks and Google Reader shared items .
Users can post comments on stream items and can also indicate that they " like " a specific stream item .
Facebook now provides programmatic access to all of this data through several different mechanisms .
Developers can use a conventional REST method , a FQL query , or an Atom - based feed .
Atom Activity Extensions
The Atom - based feed is , perhaps , the most intriguing aspect of the new open streams system .
Atom is a standardized XML - based format for simple syndication that is similar to RSS but is more robust and extensible .
Rather than completely inventing its own dialect , Facebook wisely chose to put its weight behind Atom Activity Extensions , an emerging effort to build a standardized set of activity tags that can be used in Atom feeds .
Atom Activity Extensions is still in the draft stage and is not yet a formal standard .
The draft is authored by David Recordon and Martin Atkins of Six Apart under the aegis of the DiSo project , a collaborative effort to build open standards for data portability and social networking .
Facebook has become one of the first major adopters of Atom Activity Extensions , a move that will significantly boost the visibility of the nascent standard and help it gain traction .
MySpace is also committed to the format and working on an implementation , so it now has the backing of two of the most popular social networking websites .
This is a major win for interoperability and it could eventually facilitate development of universal activity stream clients that function in much the same way that desktop news feed readers work today .
Chris Messina , a leading figure in DiSo who is well - known for his work with OAuth and is closely involved with Atom Activity Streams , is enthusiastic about Facebook 's adoption of the format .
He commented on the implications in a message posted to DiSo 's Activity Streams mailing list on Monday following Facebook 's announcement .
" This is indeed good news for Facebook and for this community effort , " he wrote .
" At the very least , I 'm excited to see how similar we can get the feeds coming out of MySpace and Facebook and I 'm also eager to start looking at how we can replace the current activities API in OpenSocial with the Activity Streams format . "
Facebook makes the stream available to third - party software through a URL .
In order to access the feed , the program will need to be authenticated and will have to provide as parameters a session key and signature checksum .
The following is the URL format :
http://www.facebook.com/activitystreams/feed.php?source_id=<user-id>&app_id=<yourApplicationId>&session_key=<session_key>&sig=<checksum-slash-signatutre>&v=0.7&read&updated_time=<UnixTime>
The significance of each of those attributes is described in greater detail in the official documentation , but those values should all be relatively familiar to developers who have worked with the Facebook API .
Although the Atom - based feed will be very useful for developers who are building generalized stream clients , Facebook 's native APIs are more practical for client applications that will integrate tightly with the service .
In Gwibber , I chose to use the new activity stream REST API methods .
Implementing Facebook activity streams in Gwibber
I originally created Gwibber in 2007 with the goal of building a social networking application for the GNOME desktop environment .
It brings together comprehensive support for several popular microblogging services in a single program with a unified message stream .
It is written in the Python programming language and is distributed under the terms of the General Public License ( GPL ) .
The actual content stream is drawn with an embedded WebKit HTML renderer and the rest of the user interface is built the GTK + toolkit .
Gwibber 's current Facebook functionality is built on top of PyFacebook , a lightweight open source Python library that wraps the Facebook APIs .
PyFacebook mitigates a lot of the pain of Facebook client development because it handles all of the authentication , session , and signature hash stuff .
It hides those idiosyncrasies under a simple object - oriented interface that is easy for developers to use .
PyFacebook is also very easy to extend when new Facebook API methods are introduced .
Each Facebook API method is described in the PyFacebook library using a simple data structure that specifies the method 's name and parameter types .
PyFacebook does not appear to have been updated to work with the new stream API methods yet , but it was trivially easy for me to do it myself .
You can see my simple PyFacebook modifications here .
Note that I did not add all of the new methods , just the ones that I 'm using in Gwibber .
Each service that is supported in Gwibber is implemented in its own module which exposes its functionality through a set of methods and properties that is consistent across all of the service modules .
This makes it possible to wrap the services with a generalized abstraction layer so that the rest of the client application does n't have to understand the differences between the various services .
This abstraction layer is what makes it possible for Gwibber to display a combined stream of the messages from all of the services .
To implement support for the activity stream , I rewrote most of Gwibber 's Facebook service module .
Obtaining stream data
To add the full Facebook stream to Gwibber , I had to process the stream and extract the values into standard Gwibber message classes .
I started by adding support for reading the stream .
With my modified version of PyFacebook , this is very easy .
I call the stream .
get method on a PyFacebook instance .
When called , the stream .
get method will return the contents of the stream in either XML or JSON , depending on what you have requested .
The only parameter that is required by stream.get ( besides the session key and others that are handled automatically by PyFacebook ) is the UID of your application 's user .
There are several optional parameters that you can provide to customize the output .
For example , you can provide start_time and end_time parameters which will display stream content that was published between the specified times .
This is sort of Facebook 's equivalent of Twitter 's since_id and max_id values .
There is also a limit parameter ( similar to Twitter 's count ) which allows you to specify how many messages you would like to download .
The default if no limit value is explicitly specified is 30 posts .
The maximum number that can be retrieved at once is n't documented , so I did some experimentation to see if I could figure it out .
I tried pulling down 400 but only got 312 , with the oldest messages dating back seven days .
This leads me to believe that there is probably not a numerical maximum but that it will only give you access to a week of messages .
Unlike Twitter , Facebook 's stream API does n't support the concept of paging , so you can't go back any further than that or iteratively download your entire history .
Just six warships protect the UK's coastal cities from attack Britain is vulnerable to terrorist attack from the sea because no single body is responsible for protecting the UK 's coast , MPs have warned .
Just nine Royal Navy ships along with a " motley collection " of police and coastguard boats guard a shoreline more than 7,000 miles long .
The Commons defence committee suggests developing a " deterrent capability " to ward off sea - borne attacks .
The Ministry of Defence has insisted clear procedures are in place .
Concerns over the UK's preparations for dealing with a maritime terrorist threat were raised by the committee .
Reactive forces
Its statement said : " We are concerned at the level of action being taken to address threats to aspects of national infrastructure such as ports .
" What assets are available for maritime security tend to be reactive forces . "
The statement continued : " There is a strong case for developing a deterrent capability in relation to threats to civilian maritime targets .
" We are not satisfied that an intelligence - led approach is sufficient . "
At present the Royal Navy has six warships , two patrol vessels and a support tanker protecting UK waters .
They are backed up by 120 police boats , five coastguard patrol boats and five UK Border Agency vessels .
But the Conservatives have called for a full review of the defensive capability .
They say the November 2008 Mumbai attacks - during which gunmen arriving by boat killed more than 170 people - could be replicated in the UK .
Lack of clarity Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said : " It is clear from this report the government has not given sufficient attention to the role of the armed forces in its domestic security policy .
" The lack of clarity about the role of the MoD in terms of maritime security needs to be addressed .
" This is why we need a Strategic Defence Review to identify the roles the armed forces will be needed for . "
The committee also called for the role of the Army during natural emergencies such as floods to be clarified and the Territorial Army to be used more regularly .
But an MoD spokesman said : " There are clear procedures in place for the armed forces to provide military assistance to other government departments both in times of national crises .
" Work is under way to provide other government departments with guidelines on how to request military assistance in areas such as counter terrorism .
" We regularly take part in counter terrorism exercises . "

The wall of separation between church and state has eroded beyond recognition .
A Libertarian Alternative to the EFCA
by Dan Clore
The EFCA ( Employee Freedom of Choice Act ) would allow workers to immediately unionize a workplace where 50 + % of the workers have signed union cards , a process known as “ card check ” .
Employers and their front groups have waged a massive campaign against the EFCA in the mass media , claiming that it would eliminate secret ballots .
This is not true : under the EFCA , while workers would no longer be required to hold a secret election after 50 + % have signed union cards , they can still do so if they want to .
But their employers would not have the power to require that they do so .
They also fail to note that employers frequently abuse the election procedure , using it to buy time in which to fire workers likely to vote in favor of unionization and put other pressure on the workers against unionizing .
More principled critics , free - market advocates , have objected to the EFCA on the grounds that it represents government interference in the marketplace .
While factually accurate , by itself this ignores the great amount of government interference in the market on behalf of employers .
And that suggests a libertarian alternative to the EFCA .
I propose that any company that refuses to allow its workers to unionize be made ineligible to receive any benefits from government interference in the market on its behalf .
But for my purposes here , I 'll ignore the vast majority of such government interference on behalf of employers , such as various forms of corporate welfare , protectionism , regulation that eliminates competitors , etc. etc. etc. , and focus on a form of government interference that ( 1 ) benefits nearly all traditional companies ; and ( 2 ) is directly relevant to the issue at hand , unionization .
The form of government interference in the marketplace on behalf of employers that I speak of is incorporation .
When a government grants a charter of incorporation to companies , it creates by fiat a “ collectivist legal entity ” , or corporation .
Among other things , this allows the many owners and investors in the company to be legally considered a single collective entity for business purposes when this is to their benefit , while at the same time granting them “ limited liability ” that considers them separate from the company when this helps them avoid responsibility for it .
This creates an asymmetrical situation in which employers enjoy the benefits of collective organization and representation , but can deny these benefits to their employees .
Unionization , with its collective organization and representation for employees , makes this situation more symmetrical and thus fairer .
So , my suggestion for a libertarian alternative to the EFCA is simply this :
Any employer ( company ) that refuses to allow its employees to unionize , should be disallowed the charter of incorporation and its consequent benefits .
This would decrease , rather than increase , government interference in the marketplace ( granting corporate charters constitutes such interference , while failing to do so does not ) , and therefore should please advocates of the free market .
It would also most likely lead to a much greater rate of unionization , as most employers would probably choose to recognize their workers ' unions rather than forego the benefits of incorporation , and therefore should please union advocates .
Employers could not complain about being forced to recognize unions if this suggestion were instituted , as they could avoid the requirement by organizing as unincorporated businesses , such as single proprietorships and partnerships .
( Worker - owned - and - controlled businesses , such as workers collectives and workers cooperatives , would also be exempt , as the workers are themselves their own employers . )
I do n't expect this proposal to gain much traction , but it should at least serve to make readers think about the issues in a way more productive than the typical fare .
Additional note : Readers might like to use this column to check out the remarkable job that GoogleAds does matching advertisements to content .
As I view them now , eight of twelve ads are either for sites promoting misinformation about the EFCA or for union - busting companies .

Here is this month ’s Japan Blog Matsuri , with a bumper haul of sixteen entries , including a few new - to - me blogs , so I hope you all can find something new too .
First out of the trap is a fellow Kansai blogger , sleepytako , a name that already suggests slow times !
His relaxation is getting gently boiled in various hot springs around the Kansai area , and the story also serves as a pointer to his rather useful Kansai Onsen Guide .
Next up is another Kansai resident , Harvey , who submitted an older post , but it ’s about a walk I ’ve always wanted to do myself , as I find disused railway lines fascinating .
He walked a portion of the old Takarazuka to Sanda JR line .
Jamie at Frugalista Japan posted on not really a slow time , more a downright boring year in Yokkaichi , which I suspect might be near Tokyo , but it sounds far too dull to even bother looking up !
There three guys above were the quickest to post , so I ’ll give them the space above the fold , and I ’ll cover the remaining entries a bit more quickly !

ROME ( Reuters ) - Italy ’s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has succeeded in blocking publication of photos of his New Year ’s Eve party after reports said guests included a teenage girl whose relationship with him has caused a scandal .

Judicial sources said the 72 - year - old Berlusconi , who denies having an affair with 18 - year - old Noemi Letizia , said publication of the images taken by a photojournalist without his permission would have violated his right to privacy .
A prosecutor in Rome granted the injunction and ordered the seizure of hundreds of photos taken by Antonello Zappadu using a powerful lens from outside Berlusconi ’s villa on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia .
Newspapers have reported that dozens of young women attended the party thrown by the media billionaire - turned - politician , receiving thousands of euros in expenses .
Berlusconi ’s personal life has under scrutiny since he was photographed attending Letizia ’s 18th birthday party in Naples last month , where he gave her an expensive necklace .
He says he has known the family for years .
His wife Veronica Lario demanded a divorce because of his womanizing , accusing him of “ frequenting minors ” and saying he was “ not well . ”
Berlusconi on Thursday denied any improper relationship and said he would resign if caught lying about it .
The case has rattled Berlusconi ’s conservative Roman Catholic support base before European elections in early June .
Church figures have criticized him for setting a bad example to young people with his behavior .
The age of consent for sex in Italy is 16 but people under 18 are considered minors .
The case has become so politically explosive that Berlusconi has promised to clear his name with a formal address to parliament but has not yet set a date .
Nowadays , more and more companies are poor and interested in Linux , according to an IDC study sponsored by Novell .
The industry bean counter 's February poll of 330 IT workers indicates a " surge " of businesses that are either thinking about using Linux or already switching over .
Most said the primary reason was to lower ongoing support costs .
According to the study , more than 72 per cent of respondents said they are either actively evaluating or have decided to increase adoption of Linux server in 2009 .
Where desktops are concerned , 68 per cent polled have a distro of Linux on their mind .
Of course , Microsoft still retains its handsome lead in popularity .
Among the survey participants , 55 per cent already use Linux server while 97 per cent had Windows server in use .
Unix server was found in 39 per cent of the firms .
When asked what tempts them towards Linux , the survey participants identified reducing costs and stronger interoperability with Windows or other OSs as their top two reasons , respectively .
From the Novell - sponsored IDC study :
IDC has found that economic downturns lead to a reduction in spending , but not necessarily an equal - sized reduction in deployments .
In fact , past recessions have helped to accelerate platform shifts that were in progress .
During the 2001 - 2002 recession , the industry saw a shift away from RISC - based Unix servers and toward x86 server architectures .
Linux was a beneficiary of that transition , and that downturn set the stage for the sustained growth of Linux server operating system deployments during much of the current decade .
The current economic crisis is likely to help nudge that adoption forward once again , given the low - cost nature of Linux and the accompanying availability of no -cost Linux solutions .
We believe the current economic crisis will also have a net positive impact on the use of virtualization software , which will end up hosting more guest operating systems , including Linux server operating systems .
Despite the apparent upturn , IDC warns the news is n't necessarily a win for Linux server vendors .
It claims that in a recession , there is more availability and interest in ultra - low - cost servers — which may lead to more businesses going it alone with non-paid Linux solutions .
And rather than eating Windows ' lunch , IDC claims Linux deployments are presently positioned to replace existing Unix installations .
Many customers do n't see Linux as a viable alternative to existing installed Windows solutions , according to IDC .
Novell , which IDC claims was not involved recruiting participants , has a release on the study here .
The IDC whitepaper on the survey results is available yonder . ®
Over the Memorial Day weekend , many college administrators attended a conference about the absence of men on today 's college campuses and expressed concern about the negative experiences and unprecedented challenges facing college men today .
The " 2nd Conference on College Men " at the University of Pennsylvania featured sessions examining the implications of negative comments about men that are prevalent on college campuses and the sexist campus activism of participants in the nation 's 500 college gender studies departments .
The conference program , attended by about 100 professors and student affairs personnel , exposed some unpleasant facts : men are " overrepresented " in drug and alcohol abuse , violations of campus regulations , and acts of violence and sexual assault , and they are " underrepresented " in academic programs and campus leadership activities .
Over the past couple of decades , the male - female ratio on campuses has been changing dramatically .
Women outnumber men by a 4 - 3 ratio on college campuses .
Men currently make up only 43 percent of college graduates .
In short , many today acknowledge that there is a crisis of the disappearing educated male .
Some experts claim that the imbalance begins in the public schools , where recess and physical education are being cut .
More active boys are at a disadvantage , they say , when there is no outlet for their energy and restlessness .
In addition , Title IX programs have hurt men's athletics with the less profitable men's sports being cut ( over 400 men 's collegiate athletic teams have been cut since Title IX went into effect ) in order to fund women 's programs .
According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , " for every new women 's athletic slot created between 1992 and 1997 , 3.6 male athletes were dropped . "
As more and more campuses institute distance education programs , we are learning that men typically are not drawn to such programs and either flunk out or drop out at a higher rate than women .
We are also learning that men are told that it is not " cool " to study , make good grades or even to attend class and buy the textbook for a class .
For many college males , " being manly " means tremendous external pressure to " not really work at anything ; to just be cool and detached . "
Women , on the other hand , are encouraged to " be the best " and to excel in order to " make it " in the workplace .
The end result is a disturbing imbalance in terms of numbers as well as performance of men in the university environment that is already carrying over into the job market where women are increasingly landing the top jobs and earning the big salaries .
According to USA Today , " currently 135 women receive bachelor 's degrees for every 100 men . "
That imbalance , according to figures from the U.S. Department of Education , " is expected to widen in the coming years . "
The negative implications are enormous .
It will be harder for men to succeed , and the loss of educated men in the workplace will be incalculable .
We are already seeing huge social gaps between educated women and the uneducated , immature and / or irresponsible men that constitute the marriage prospects available to them .
That gap is showing up in the declining marriage rates as well as in the divorce rates .
As Christina Hoff Sommers said in her book , The War Against Boys : How Misguided Feminism is Harming our Young Men , the fact that " women are significantly more literate , significantly more educated than their male counterparts " is likely to create a " lot of social problems ; " the lack of well - educated men does not " bode well " for anyone .
Is it any wonder that men are avoiding today 's college campuses ?
Hostility toward men and masculinity begins in daycare and increases each year thereafter .
Sexual harassment training and policies have created an uncertain environment , if not a hostile one , where men have to watch their every word and action lest it be misunderstood or misinterpreted .
Some experts criticize a campus " worldview that sees things only in terms of oppressors and the oppressed . "
Typically , the few campus men's studies programs are designed to push an anti-masculinity agenda .
Researchers have put the problem on their agendas .
Some feminists are claiming that " educated women have always made some people nervous . "
Some even claim the gap is a matter of men realizing that they can make a better living than women even without an education .
In an increasingly more technological society , some experts are calling for a male affirmative action plan .
Already , savvy campuses increase the number of males by instituting majors attractive to men , instituting or reinstating sports teams that were dropped , and highlighting programs that might attract male students .
Almost all campuses feature men in their public relations pictures , being careful to avoid pictures that exclusively feature female students .
Some campuses are shortening the period of accepting women 's applications , while lengthening the time that applications are accepted from men .
Some rumors claim that acceptance standards are lowered for men as well .
Still , some experts think that the trend cannot be reversed .
It 's been a long , long time since Microsoft Research first released its findings on Virtual WiFi , or VWiFi , technology that would allow a single wireless network adapter to act like two , two , two NICs in one .
Now that innovation is finally ready for the big show : inclusion in Windows 7 -- or at least some flavors of it .
The tech lets one piece of WiFi hardware be represented in Windows as two separate adapters , meaning you can connect to two hotspots simultaneously if you like , or turn your virtual device into an access point that others can connect to .
Apparently this functionality is indeed included in the latest release candidate , but as there are no drivers currently supporting this feature it 's not enabled .
Expect the driver situation to change very soon , and expect hotel fee - based wireless internet access companies to start crying foul not long after .
There was a little square and music & coffee house " Kawiaret " before .
" Crooked House " construction started in January 2003 and in December 2003 it was finished .
There are two entries - main at the front of the building from the " Bohaterów Monte Cassino " Street , and second one from the Haffnera Street .
Building architecture is based on Jan Marcin Szancer ( famous Polish drawer and child books illustrator ) and Per Dahlberg ( Swedish painter living in Sopot ) pictures and paintings .
Below , some more description from Allcon ( General Contractor of the building ) :
" The building is situated in Sopot , at Bohaterów Monte Cassino Street .
It is the compact settlement and it is an extension of the already existing shopping and service center which main entrance is at Haffnera 6 Street .
Through booth building leads walking duration connecting service center between Haffnera and Monte Cassino Street .
The building with its character refers to fabulous drawings of Jan Marcin Szancer and Per Dahlberg .
Exterior elevation suits to very popular Monciak ’s promenade style .
The building with its floors refers to cornices and floors of neighbouring buildings .
Colorful stained glass entrances , stone elevation decors and windows framed with sandstone make impression .
There is also unusual roof covered with sheet metal with enamel roof tiles coloured with green shades , see blue and Parishian blue , which in the whole makes illusion of dragon scales .
The building was projected as three - storey object with service attic .
Communication between three storey assure the lift and allowed staircase freely available .
Passage from ground - floor to storey is available thanks to perfectly demonstrated range stairs .
Passage from first - floor to second floor leads through reinforced stairs and from second floor to mezzanine through steel stairs which are covered whole by wood . "
Back in 2002 , the Israeli government started the construction of " The Wall " , a combination of wire fences and concrete walls separating Israeli from Palestinian territories .
In several places , The Wall is formed by 8 meter high concrete blocks .
" The Wall " was constructed to prevent " the uncontrolled entry of Palestinians into Israel " , in a desperate attempt to control the crossing of Palestinian militants and arms .
The Wall has been highly controversial in many ways , not at least because it splits communities into " ghettos " of isolation , while many see cooperation , if not integration , the way to end the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
The Wall brought one opportunity , a lighter message - literally then : A Dutch - Palestinian project brings people together through wall graffiti .
For 30 Euros you can send in your text via SendAMessage .
Young Palestinians will spray your message on the wall and send you three digital pictures of the graffiti .
The benefits go to projects of the Palestinian Peace and Freedom Youth Forum putting youth at work in volunteering projects in their society .

President Sarkozy is responding to public anger over bank bonuses
The French government is to issue a decree banning bonuses and share options for executives of banks that have received government aid .
Presidential official Claude Gueant said the decree would be adopted next week as employers refused to draw up their own code of conduct .
Bonuses to executives of troubled banks have caused anger across the world .
US lawmakers have voted for a 90 % tax on big bonuses to employees of banks that have taken government funds .
" A decree will be issued next week to set conditions under which the distribution of stock options or other advantages like bonuses is forbidden for companies that have benefitted from state aid , " said Mr Gueant .
" Capitalism is there to enrich all the population and not just the bosses , " he added .
Public anger
There was a public outcry earlier this week when it emerged that executives at Societe Generale had been given share options after the bank received state funding .
A number of banks in Europe and the US that have lost billions of dollars on bad loans during the credit crunch have been bailed out by government funds .
Some of these banks have subsequently paid out big bonuses to top executives , arguing that they could not renege on legally binding agreements .
Such arguments have done nothing to assuage public anger that taxpayer money is being used to reward the very people that many argue helped bring about the financial crisis in first place .
In the US , there has been outrage that insurer AIG paid out $ 160 m ( £ 110 m ) in bonuses after taking $ 170 bn dollars in aid from the government .
President Barack Obama expressed his anger and lawmakers voted to claw back 90 % of the bonuses through tax .
But no major economy has gone so far as to impose an outright ban on bonuses .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Monday launched a $ 3.75 billion debt issue , its first foray into the U.S. corporate bond market as it joined a spate of companies taking advantage of good borrowing conditions .

The cash - rich , “ triple - A ” rated Microsoft announced its first debt authorization last September , allowing it to issue up to $ 6 billion in debt .
The bond sale , expected to price later on Monday , has attracted about $ 10 billion in demand , market sources said .
The sale is expected to include $ 2 billion of five - year notes yielding about 95 basis points over U.S. Treasuries , $ 1 billion of 10 - year notes yielding about 105 basis points over Treasuries , and $ 750 million of 30 - year bonds yielding about 105 basis points over Treasuries , according to IFR , a Thomson Reuters service .
Microsoft , the world ’s largest software maker , has already issued about a third of its $ 6 billion debt authorization in the commercial paper market .
It does not need financing but will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes , including working capital and buying back stock , according to a spokesman .
The company decided to take advantage of “ good market conditions and Microsoft ’s great credit rating , ” a spokesman said .
The software giant is rated AAA by Moody ’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor ’s and AA - plus , one notch lower , by Fitch Ratings .
Microsoft had cash and short - term investments worth $ 25.3 billion at the end of March .
Its shares were up 15 cents to $ 19.57 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq .
The deal is being led by JPMorgan JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N , with Banc of America Securities BAC.N and Citigroup C.N as passive managers .
The debt sale had sparked talk that Microsoft could be readying a bid for German business management software firm SAP SAPG.DE , in light of a recent article in Barron 's citing an analyst as saying SAP cannot remain independent forever .
SAP Co-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker , in New York unveiling an acquisition , declined to comment on a possible Microsoft bid but did say he believes his firm should stay independent .
SAP ’s stock was up 2.85 percent in Germany .
His small compromise , however , was to insert small chunks of wood to support the strings that were made of nylon or sheeps ' gut because metal ones " heat up when they move and would melt the ice " , he said .
A new study at the University of Haifa discovered that worldwide , countries with the highest levels of artificial light at night also have the highest rates of prostate cancer .
This discovery joins the findings of a previous study by the same researchers that found a connection between exposure to artificial light at night and the incidence of breast cancer .
Countries in which nighttime artificial lighting is used more intensively tend to have a higher risk of prostate cancer in men , concludes a new study that was carried out at the University of Haifa .
This joins a previous finding that was published in Chronobiology International in 2008 , that exposure to artificial lighting at night increases the incidence of breast cancer in women .
The study , carried out by Prof. Abraham Haim , Prof. Boris A. Portnov , and Itai Kloog of the University of Haifa together with Prof. Richard Stevens of the University of Connecticut , USA , was intended to examine the influence of various factors - including the amount of artificial light at night - on the incidence of three types of cancer : prostate , lung , and of the large intestine , in men around the world .
Data was collected from a database of the International Agency for Research on Cancer , on the incidence of these types of cancer in men in 164 countries .
Data on the levels of lighting at night were gathered from DMSP ( Defense Meteorological Satellite Program ) satellite images .
The nighttime illumination data were adjusted by the geographic distribution of the population of the country , in order to reach an accurate measure of " the amount of artificial light per night per person . "
The researchers also examined additional factors , such as electricity consumption , percentage of urban population , socioeconomic status , and other variables .
At the very first stage of the study , it already became clear that there is a marked link between the incidence of prostate cancer and levels of nighttime artificial illumination and electricity consumption .
Several different methods of statistical analysis were used to arrive at this conclusion .
Next the researchers isolated the " amount of artificial light at night per person " variable in order to examine its particular effect .
The countries were divided into three groups for this stage of the study : those with little exposure to lighting at night ; those with medium exposure ; and those with high exposure .
The results demonstrated that the incidence of prostate cancer in those countries with low exposure was 66.77 prostate cancer patients to 100,000 inhabitants .
An increase of 30 % was found in those countries with medium exposure : 87.11 patients per 100,000 inhabitants .
The countries with the highest level of exposure to artificial light at night demonstrated a jump of 80 % : 157 patients per 100,000 inhabitants .
According to the researchers , there are a number of theories that could explain the increased incidence of prostate cancer due to exposure to lighting at night , such as suppression of melatonin production , suppression of the immune system , and an effect on the body 's biological clock because of confusion between night and day .
Whatever the cause , there is a definite link between the two .
" This does not mean that we have to go back to the Middle Ages and turn the lights out on the country .
What it means is that this link should be taken into account in planning the country 's energy policies , " the researchers pointed out .
The researchers added that an increased use of artificial lighting is considered by the World Health Organization as a source of environmental pollution .
As such , the appeal made by Israel 's Ministry of Environmental Protection to use energy - efficient lighting is problematic , as this type of lighting is also much brighter .
The country ought to encourage energy saving in lighting as well as limiting the pollution level .
Leaks of wiretap transcripts involving a member of Congress and a “ suspected Israeli agent ” have shone a rare light on the scope of suspicion the American intelligence establishment harbors toward Israel and its supporters .
Image by GETTY IMAGES Harman :
Was her talk with an ?
Israeli agent ?
kosher ?
Investigators wiretapping the alleged Israeli agent were so concerned about remarks by Democratic Rep. Jane Harman of California during his conversation with her that the investigators subsequently sought a so - called FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) warrant — reserved for sensitive intelligence cases — to wiretap Harman , as well , according to a detailed story published April 19 by Congressional Quarterly .
But then - attorney general Alberto Gonzales , the article claims , halted the investigation because he thought he would need Harman ’s support in an upcoming clash over the administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program , about to be exposed by The New York Times .
According to the CQ story , Harman promised the alleged Israeli agent she would lobby the administration to back off espionage - related charges against two former officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the Washington pro-Israel lobby .
In exchange , her conversation partner is said to have promised he would lobby congressional leaders for Harman to become chairwoman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence .
Harman has angrily denied that she made any such deal , and requested the administration to fully declassify the wiretapped conversations in question .
Gonzales , meanwhile , has declined to comment so far .
But for close observers of the national security establishment , the real news was the extent of its suspicions of American Jewish supporters of Israel — up to and including its willingness to wiretap a member of Congress .
“ It ’s rooted deep in the system , ” an official with an American Jewish organization said , “ and it comes from the bottom up . ”
Image by GETTY IMAGES Security Concerns : Wiretapped conversation focused on charges against former AIPAC official Steve Rosen .
The leaked transcripts hint , among other things , at the security establishment ’s continued search for an Israeli mole that some reportedly believe remained uncaught after Jonathan Pollard , an American Jewish civilian naval intelligence analyst , was discovered engaged in massive espionage for Israel in 1985 .
More generally , the wiretap reflects the security establishment ’s continuing concern about leaks of classified information to pro-Israel activists and Israeli agents who have shown themselves adept at obtaining nonpublic information from the government .
“ We know that we are closely watched , that people might be listening to our phone calls .
This is our working premise , ” said a former senior Israeli official who was based in Washington in recent years .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue , said he believed that suspicion toward Israel was prevalent in the military and intelligence establishments but was not common at the political and diplomatic levels .
The disclosure of the Harman wiretaps comes at a time when the government ’s most elaborate attempt to crack down on alleged wrongdoings by pro-Israel activists is at a crossroads .
The prosecution of two former AIPAC lobbyists , which began more than four years ago and is scheduled to go to trial June 2 , is under review and , according to press reports , might be dropped altogether .
The conversations involving Harman focused on attempts to put an end to the legal proceedings against the two former AIPAC staffers , Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman .
Although no formal explanation was provided from the National Security Agency for eavesdropping on the Harman conversation , it is widely believed that the wiretap was part of the investigation into the AIPAC case .
According to court records , wiretaps and surveillance in the Rosen - Weissman case began as early as 1999 .
From the indictment , which is now being reviewed by the attorney general ’s office , it is clear that attempts to stop the flow of information to pro-Israel activists led to a wide - ranging counterintelligence operation in which Israeli diplomats and pro-Israel lobbyists were being followed and their conversations monitored .
These conversations involved senior government officials who had been in touch with the subjects of the investigation .
The U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia reviewed transcripts of these wiretaps in lengthy pretrial proceedings , and parts of them are expected to be presented if the case reaches trial .
Stephen Green , a Vermont - based writer who has chronicled the counterintelligence spats between the United States and Israel since the late 1970s , said the mistrust toward Israel stems from agents working on the cases and not from an overall anti-Israel ideology .
“ This has nothing to do with politics or with Israeli foreign policy .
These are people who deal with these issues on a daily basis and become very , very upset , ” Green said .
Green , who , through the Freedom of Information Act , has obtained documents chronicling decades of security investigations of government officials suspected of leaking restricted information to Israel , was questioned by the FBI about his research during the investigation of the Rosen - Weissman case .
Suspicion toward pro-Israel Americans predates the Pollard espionage affair .
In 1979 , the FBI looked into allegations that Stephen Bryen , then a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , passed on information to Israeli officials .
The search for Israeli spies , which at times focused on the notion of an Israeli network led by a master spy code - named “ Mega , ” intensified after the 1985 arrest of Jonathan Pollard .
The investigation , as it turned out , never ended , and as recently as April 2008 it resurfaced with the arrest of Ben - Ami Kadish , a former army engineer from New Jersey who passed on classified information to the same Israeli handler that was in charge of Pollard .
Kadish , now 85 , pleaded guilty last December as part of a plea agreement and is awaiting his May sentencing .
Echoes of the defense establishment ’s concerns over American Jews ’ loyalty to Israel were apparent , too , in a 1996 memo sent out by the Pentagon to defense contractors , warning them that Jewish employees with “ strong ethnic ties ” to Israel could be exploited by the Israelis to gather classified information .
The memo was later retracted after Jewish groups protested its content .
The issue , however , is still being raised when discussing security clearance for American Jews who have ties with Israel .
Arlington , Va. - based attorney Sheldon Cohen , who represents many cases of workers denied security clearances , has found a disproportionate presence of Jews among this group .
The usual reason given is concern about their alleged ties with Israel .
Recently , Cohen authored an article dealing with a question posed to Jews applying for defense clearance : “ Would you bear arms for the United States against Israel ? ”
This hypothetical question is not presented , according to Cohen , to any other ethnic or religious group .
“ The one thing common to all the applicants to whom this question is put is their Jewish heritage , ” he wrote .

Yet the war on weed rages on .
Thirty - seven years after a special commission formed by Congress and President Richard Nixon concluded that punitive marijuana laws cause more social harm than the drug itself , nearly half of the drug arrests in this country are for pot .
The numbers grow annually .
More people were arrested for pot possession in America last year than ever before in our history , more than 800,000 .
In Pennsylvania , possession is a misdemeanor , and the possible prison sentence goes from 30 days to a year , depending on whether the amount is more or less than 30 grams .
Although there are horrific exceptions , most of these offenders , unless they were involved in serious drug trafficking or some other illegal activity when arrested , do not go to jail for simple possession .
Still , what a tremendous waste of money and manpower !
One of the strongest arguments against such misdemeanor drug laws is that they are completely ineffective .

It 's no secret that daughters have a special relationship with their dads .
But their influence may be even more profound .
Two new studies suggest that daughters - who are more likely to favour higher taxes and public spending - cause fathers to become more compassionate and move to the left
Long before he had a tribe of children to call his own , Brad Pitt broke down in tears on primetime television when talking about how much he wanted to have a daughter .
" Little girls , they just crush me - they break my heart , " he said .
Now with three daughters - and three sons - Pitt has more than achieved his dream .
He will also have had ample opportunity to experience the powerful influence that little girls have on their fathers : the most masculine man will learn to love pink , take part in endless games of dressing up , and even bake fairy cakes if that 's what his little princess desires .
According to new research , however , daughters have an even more profound effect on their daddies : fathers , say Professor Andrew Oswald , from Warwick University , and Dr Nattavudh Powdthavee , of York University , will shift their political allegiance for their daughters .
Using research from the British Household Panel Survey , the two economists found that the more daughters there are in a household , the more likely their father is to vote Labour or Liberal Democrat .
In an unpublished article that has been submitted to an economics journal , the pair state : " This paper provides evidence that daughters make people more leftwing , while having sons , by contrast , makes them more rightwing . "
The academics go on to speculate that leftwing families become so through a predominance of females down successive generations , as anecdotally evidenced by Tony Booth and his many daughters , or the late John Smith and his three .
Compared with males , females tend to be more in favour of higher taxes to fund provision such as the NHS .
Higher taxation also affects them less since they tend to be in a lower income bracket .
" As men acquire female children , " said Oswald , " those men gradually shift their political stance and become more sympathetic to the ' female ' desire for a ... larger amount for the public good .
They become more leftwing .
Similarly , a mother with sons becomes sympathetic to the ' male ' case for lower taxes and a smaller supply of public goods .
Political feelings are much less independently chosen than people realise , " he added .
" Children mould their parents .
It 's so scientifically attractive because it's out of the parents ' control - whether they have a boy or a girl . "
The researchers have been accused of propagating gender stereotypes and of perpetuating the idea that women go in for softer politics than men .
But their work mirrors recent findings by American researchers , who looked at the voting records of US congressmen before and after having children .
In a joint paper , sociologist Rebecca Warner from Oregon State University and the economist Ebonya Washington from Yale University found that support for policies designed to address gender equity is greater among parents with daughters .
The result , they say , is particularly strong for fathers .
Because parents invest a significant amount of themselves in their children , the authors argue , the anticipated and actual struggles that offspring face , and the public policies that tackle those , begin to matter more to those parents .
They add that people who parent only daughters are more likely to hold feminist views , with congressmen who have female children tending to vote liberally on issues from reproductive rights and teenage access to contraceptives to flexibility for working families and education .
Oswald said : " I argue that these results generalise to voting for entire political parties .
We document evidence that having daughters leads people to be more sympathetic to leftwing parties .
Giving birth to sons , by contrast , seems to make people more likely to vote for a rightwing party . "
Oswald found that , among parents with two children who voted for the left ( Labour or Lib Dem ) , the mean number of daughters was higher than the mean number of sons .
The same applied to parents with three or four children .
Of those parents with three sons and no daughters , 67 % voted for the left .
In households with three daughters and no sons , the figure was 77 % .
There are those who dispute the interpretation of the findings , but evidence nonetheless abounds of daughters who have tamed the most manly of men .
When rapper Sean ( P Diddy ) Combs and his girlfriend Kim Porter had identical twin daughters two years ago , the New York musician admitted that " having girls changes you for the better " .
Sylvester Stallone , star of the Rambo and Rocky films , altered his career path after the birth of his daughter , Sophia , in 1996 .
" The birth of my daughter was a subtle indication of which way I should go .
I want to get back to more emotional , character - driven films , " he said .
While not claiming to have shared the testosterone - defined personalities of Combs or Stallone , Colin Brazier , a presenter for Sky News , also admits his five daughters have softened him .
" I am definitely a softer man because of my daughters , " he said .
" I think being the father of girls has made me more empathetic and more skilled in certain forms of negotiation that are particular to bringing up girls .
There is something about watching my daughters interact with each other .
Girls are so co-operative with each other whereas boys have more kinetic energy .
Because of this , I think it 's possible to enjoy daughters in ways you do n't enjoy boys , who need so much more intervention .
Because of this , having daughters has made me more reflective . "
Margaret McAllister , a psychologist who has spent the past 25 years specialising in child development and family functioning , said the studies revealed the importance of home environment over work and social influences , in forming an individual 's personal and political views .
" It makes perfect sense that , if a parent has children of one gender , they are more likely to be aware , alert and sensitive to issues that affect that gender . "
But Arthur Mayne , a biologist who has three sons aged from 18 to 12 years , disagrees .
" This is a simplistic scientific that could be accused of gender stereotyping , especially the idea that women are more likely to be softer politically than men , " he said .
" While it is true that men biologically determine the sex of their children , recent studies seem to prove that women with higher levels of testosterone - who are more likely to display dominant , positive behaviours - seem to produce more sons than daughters .
" Women with lower levels of testosterone , who are more likely to be empathetic and better listeners , tend to produce more daughters .
It could be that the women who are most likely to produce daughters pick a partner who is closer to her more empathetic attitude to life .
Hence people who are already more liberal may produce more daughters and those who are already conservative may produce more sons . "
An ancient script that 's defied generations of archaeologists has yielded some of its secrets to artificially intelligent computers .
Computational analysis of symbols used 4,000 years ago by a long - lost Indus Valley civilization suggests they represent a spoken language .
Some frustrated linguists thought the symbols were merely pretty pictures .
" The underlying grammatical structure seems similar to what 's found in many languages , " said University of Washington computer scientist Rajesh Rao .
The Indus script , used between 2,600 and 1,900 B.C. in what is now eastern Pakistan and northwest India , belonged to a civilization as sophisticated as its Mesopotamian and Egyptian contemporaries .
However , it left fewer linguistic remains .
Archaeologists have uncovered about 1,500 unique inscriptions from fragments of pottery , tablets and seals .
The longest inscription is just 27 signs long .
In 1877 , British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham hypothesized that the Indus script was a forerunner of modern - day Brahmic scripts , used from Central to Southeast Asia .
Other researchers disagreed .
Fueled by scores of competing and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to decipher the script , that contentious state of affairs has persisted to the present .
Among the languages linked to the mysterious script are Chinese Lolo , Sumerian , Egyptian , Dravidian , Indo - Aryan , Old Slavic , even Easter Island — and , finally , no language at all .
In 2004 , linguist Steve Farmer published a paper asserting that the Indus script was nothing more than political and religious symbols .
It was a controversial notion , but not an unpopular one .
Rao , a machine learning specialist who read about the Indus script in high school and decided to apply his expertise to the script while on sabbatical in Inda , may have solved the language - versus - symbol question , if not the script itself .
" One of the main questions in machine learning is how to generalize rules from a limited amount of data , " said Rao .
" Even though we can't read it , we can look at the patterns and get the underlying grammatical structure . "
Rao's team used pattern - analyzing software running what 's known as a
Markov model , a computational tool used to map system dynamics .
They fed the program sequences of four spoken languages : ancient
Sumerian , Sanskrit and Old Tamil , as well as modern English .
Then they gave it samples of four non-spoken communication systems : human DNA ,
Fortran , bacterial protein sequences and an artificial language .
The program calculated the level of order present in each language .
Non-spoken languages were either highly ordered , with symbols and structures following each other in unvarying ways , or utterly chaotic .
Spoken languages fell in the middle .
When they seeded the program with fragments of Indus script , it returned with grammatical rules based on patterns of symbol arrangement .
These proved to be moderately ordered , just like spoken languages .
As for the meaning of the script , the program remained silent .
" It 's a useful paper , " said University of Helsinki archaeologist
Asko Parpola , an authority on Indus scripts , " but it does n't really further our understanding of the script . "
Parpola said the primary obstacle confronting decipherers of fragmentary Indus scripts — the difficulty of testing their hypotheses
— remains unchanged .
But according to Rao , this early analysis provides a foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of Indus script grammar , and ultimately its meaning .
" The next step is to create a grammar from the data that we have , "
he said .
" Then we can ask , is this grammar similar to those of the
Sanskrit or Indo-European or Dravidian languages ?
This will give us a language to compare it to . "
" It 's only recently that archaeologists have started to apply computational approaches in a rigid manner , " said Rao .
" The time is ripe . "

What was that ?
Youâ€ ™re not quite sure if you want to own that or not ?
Forgive me , thatâ€™s my Word for the Day , as my fellow Toastmasters would say .
Let me explain .
In Toastmasters , we have a Word Master .
At the beginning of each club meeting the Word Master picks a word , defines it and gives a few examples of how to use it in context , then every member is supposed to fit it in his or her prepared and impromptu speeches given during the meeting .
At the end of the meeting , the member who used the word correctly the greatest number of times received an award of some type .
Actually , itâ€™s a great way to learn new words and a great way to learn how to use them in context .
Anyway , an autodidact is someone who is self - taught .
It comes from the Greek autodidaktos and entered the English language in 1748 .
Many of our most prolific inventors and scientist , men like Thomas Alvin Edison , Alexander Graham Bell , Samuel Morse , Wilbur and Orville Wright , etc were autodidactists .
Today most lifelong learners are autodidactists because they are self - directed learners who master many subjects without the benefits of a formal classroom and instructor .
My wife , the schoolteacher , loves to tell people that I 'm the exemplary autodidactist .
I quit school to enlist in the United States Air Force at seventeen where I mastered the art of jet engine mechanic .
My excuse was that the only classes that interest me were math , science and shop classes and I was already doing 12th grade work when I was in the 7thgrade .
I later received my GED and took some junior college courses .
In later years I enrolled in some online college courses but never sought a degree .
Over the years I mastered many things as a self directed learner , believe - it - or - not ; I actually taught myself electronics and had a successful radio and TV repair business when I was sixteen years old .
My only reason for telling you all this personal stuff is to show you that anyone can become an autodactist if they have the desire to learn as a self - directed learner .
Back in those pre World Wide Web days when I undertook the task of educating myself , I was limited to books that I borrowed from the library or purchased from a local bookstore or from some book catalog .
Today the self - directed learner has the knowledge of the whole world available at his or her fingertips .
The great thing about the Internet is that so many great sources of information and even online courses are entirely free of charge to the lifelong learner .

There are millions of other pages available to you and you can use the links that I gave you here as a starting point in your search for others .
I was having some trouble with Google this morning , but it 's kind of reassuring to know that several million people were having some trouble too .
And yet this explanation from Google is not altogether reassuring :
Imagine if you were trying to fly from New York to San Francisco , but your plane was routed through an airport in Asia .
And a bunch of other planes were sent that way too , so your flight was backed up and your journey took much longer than expected .
That 's basically what happened to some of our users today for about an hour , starting at 7:48 am Pacific time .
An error in one of our systems caused us to direct some of our web traffic through Asia , which created a traffic jam .
As a result , about 14 % of our users experienced slow services or even interruptions .
We 've been working hard to make our services ultrafast and " always on , " so it 's especially embarrassing when a glitch like this one happens .
We 're very sorry that it happened , and you can be sure that we 'll be working even harder to make sure that a similar problem wo n't happen again .
All planes are back on schedule now .
The speculation that this was caused by a hacker will no doubt completely vanish now that we know it was just a vague system error or something .
Update , 7.10 pm : I see that Wired has a cool graffic on what this looked like :

AUGUSTA .- Angel Cabrera volvió a hacer historia .
Escribió otra página llena de gloria para el golf argentino .
El cordobés se coronó campeón del Masters de Augusta , y puede sentir ese orgullo de saberse el primer argentino que se prueba el saco verde , un logro que el mismísimo Roberto De Vicenzo no pudo conseguir pese a haber estado a un paso hacerlo .
También , es el único argentino que logró dos títulos Majors .
El Pato , quien en 2007 ganó el US Open , se impuso frente a los norteamericanos Kenny Perry y Chad Campbell en el segundo hoyo de desempate , tras haber terminado con un score de 276 golpes ( - 12 ) .
" Es una victoria muy importante para mí ; este y el US Open son los momentos más felices de mi vida en el golf " , señaló Cabrera tras el gran triunfo en Augusta .
La jornada de hoy fue muy dura para el cordobés , quien no tuvo un buen comienzo , y vio cómo crecían quienes jugaban a su alrededor , entre ellos Tiger Woods , Phil Mickelson , Kenny Perry y Chad Campbell .
Sin embargo el cordobés aprovechó los errores de sus rivales , y tuvo unos muy buenos nueve hoyos finales , que le permitieron llegar al desempate .
Cabrera marcó su primer birdie de la jornada en el hoyo tres .
Sin embargo , al hoyo siguiente terminó con un bogey , en un par tres .
Los nervios parecieron invadir al cordobés , quien en el hoyo 5 marcó otro bogey , que lo sacaba de la punta .
En el resto de los nueve primeros hoyos , terminó con cuatro pares .
" Cuando Tiger ( Woods ) y Mickelson se acercaron , sabía que dependía de mí para ganar "
Mientras tanto , Cabrera veía cómo Kenny Perry , quien estaba jugando con él mejoraba .
También lo hacían Tiger Woods y Phil Mickelson , quienes comenzaban a acercarse a los líderes .
En la segunda ronda Cabrera terminó con un bogey en el hoyo 10 , sin embargo a partir de allí comenzó a mejorar y terminó llegando al desempate .
Cabrera marcó tres birdies ( en los hoyos 13 , 15 y 16 ) .
En la salida del último hoyo , el Pato estaba un golpe por debajo de Perry .
Sin embargo , el norteamericano tuvo una mala salida , y terminó con un bogey .
Cabrera hizo par y llegaron al desempate junto con Campbell , quien había terminado con el mismo score antes .
En el hoyo decisivo el cordobés comenzó con una mala salida , al medio de los árboles .
Sin embargo se repuso y logró hacer cuatro golpes .
Por su parte
Perry tuvo un mal segundo tiro pero lo resolvió con un gran approach y putt , para terminar con cuatro golpes y llegar al segundo hoyo de desempate con el Pato .
Campbell falló su segundo tiro , terminó en el bunker y terminó con cinco golpes .
Ya en el último hoyo de desempate , Cabrera quedó definiendo solamente con Perry .
El norteamericano tuvo un mal segundo tiro , y abrió las esperanzas del Pato , que llegó al green en dos tiros .
El cordobés falló el tercer tiro y terminó cerrando en cuatro golpes ante la mirada de Perry , quien una vez más quedó al borde de consagrarse en un Major ( en 1996 perdió en el desempate del US Open ) .
El mensaje a De Vicenzo .
" Cuando gané el US Open él ( De Vicenzo ) me regaló un cuadro con un saco verde y me dijo que me lo quede porque algún día lo iba a ganar , así que esto se lo dedico " , remarcó el Pato en referencia a Roberto De Vicenzo , el mejor golfista argentinos de todos los tiempos .
El peor cierre para Romero .
El tucumano Andrés Romero terminó hoy con una tarjeta de 76 golpes ( +4 ) , que lo dejó en el puesto 49° del Masters .
El Pigu marcó un doble bogey en el hoyo 4 , tres bogeys ( 10 , 15 y 17 ) y dos birdies , en los hoyos 8 y 11 .
" Jugué muy mal .
El triple bogey del ( hoyo ) 4 me sacó de juego y todavía me quedaba un montón para terminar .
La verdad que anduve muy mal en la cancha .
El primer día hice 69 con 23 putts , metí dos de afuera , pero fallé mucho el campo y lo pagué caro " , declaró el tucumano al finalizar su última ronda en el masters , donde juega por segunda vez en su carrera .
Respecto a sus próximos pasos , Romero dijo : " Ahora vuelvo a Argentina para jugar el Abierto del Centro y luego retorno a Estados Unidos para participar en tres torneos , el primero de ellos en Nueva Orleáns , donde defenderé el título .
Espero haber recobrado parte de mi juego para entonces " .
For Immediate Release
Obama Court nominee ruled government should discriminate based on race
WASHINGTON — America ’s third largest party Tuesday criticized President Barack Obama ’s nomination of federal appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court , citing past rulings that public employers should discriminate in hiring based on race .
‘ While Judge Sotomayor deserves a fair and impartial hearing , Supreme Court justices should be nominated for their thorough knowledge of and adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law , ’ said William Redpath , Libertarian National Committee Chairman .
‘ By nominating Sonia Sotomayor , Barack Obama has made it clear he prefers an activist for his personal causes over a rational interpreter of law , ’ said Redpath .
Sotomayor is best known for the Ricci v. DeStafano case , in which the New Haven , Conn .
fire department decided it did n’t like the results of an officers promotion exam in which whites and Hispanic firefighters outperformed black firefighters .
The city threw out the results of the exam , denying several firefighters promotions solely because of their race .
The firefighters sued the city , claiming racial discrimination under Title VVI of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .
Sotomayor disagreed , ruling the city has a right to discriminate against white and Hispanic public employees to construct a politically correct racial mix in hiring , even if it goes against the results of a racially - neutral competency exam .
The case is now before the Supreme Court .
Sotomayor has had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times .
In three of those cases , the Court ruled Sotomayor had incorrectly interpreted the law .
‘ It is troubling that Obama , who won the highest elected office in the world without racial preferences , would nominate someone who openly admits the government should racially discriminate against its own citizens to serve the needs of political correctness , ’ said Redpath .
‘ Libertarians believe that , while the First Amendment ’s guarantee of freedom of association allows private parties to hire whomever they please , government has no right to discriminate .
Public employers should treat all citizens of all colors , races and ethnicities with equal respect and value and Sotomayor ’s radical rulings are a jarring departure from that principle . ’
For more information on this issue , or to arrange an interview with the Libertarian Party , please call Director of Communications Donny Ferguson at 703-200-3669 or 202-333-0008 , x. 225 , or email Donny.Ferguson@lp.org .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third - largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .
You can find more information on the Libertarian Party by visiting http://www.LP.org .
The Libertarian Party proudly stands for smaller government , lower taxes and more freedom .

Much has been made about the claim issued in November by the U.S. Joint Forces Command that Mexico , along with Pakistan , is at risk of becoming a failed state .
Yet in a ranking of the Western Hemisphere 's most at - risk countries , where criminal networks threaten to overwhelm the authority of the state , Mexico might not even make the top 10 .
Central America and parts of South America are in far worse shape .
Take Guatemala .
With a murder rate of 47 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2008 , it has become one of the most dangerous and lawless countries in the region .
This was highlighted by the May 10 murder of attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg , who alleged in a videotape released after his death that state corruption extends all the way to the president 's office .
Is there anything that can be done to reverse this slide into full - blown chaos ?
A group of civic activists thinks there is , and you may be surprised to hear their project does n't involve asking for foreign aid .
Rather , a key component of the ProReforma project would seem to be aimed at keeping U.S. " advisers " at the State Department and like - minded international do - gooders at bay .
ProReforma is a made - in - Guatemala solution to what it calls the country 's " chronic crisis . "
The project seeks to amend the constitution so that individual rights trump " interests , " be they general or special .
Says ProReforma President Manuel Ayau : " A system based on equal rights for every individual will bring about a state of affairs where people can pursue their own happiness in a peaceful environment . "
PETER BRIETBART reviews Losing My Religion by WILLIAM LOBDELL ( pictured above )
PACING across the bright , flood - lit stage , a faith - healer screeches Alleluiahs into the microphone , his voice echoing around the packed auditorium .
As the offering buckets fill , an elderly man in a wheelchair empties what little money he has , catching the eye of the rock - star priest on stage .
The healer bellows :
Brother before this night is over , you ’re going to walk out of here !
As the buckets overflow with desperate donations , the healer proclaims that the gathered faithful are healed of their ailments ; cancers cured , diseases remedied , disabilities overcome .
And yet , as the fanfares fade and the crowd clears , William Lobdell ca n’t help thinking about the old man in the wheelchair : poorer , still disabled , and with anguish in his eyes .
This sad encounter – one of many in his role of the LA Times ’ Religious Correspondent – instilled deep doubts in Lobdell .
The once “ full - faith Christian ” was left with no choice but to acknowledge the corruption , ugliness and dishonesty that marked out the Lord ’s workers here on Earth .
Lobdell ’s faith begins where faith grows best : in a time of dire need , and when any help , even imagined help , will do .
His life in ruins , he finds a crutch in scripture , and embraces Christianity with relief and enthusiasm .
The journalist beautifully describes a new world seen through the eyes of religious faith .
God ’s work is suddenly everywhere .
And the Divine has a plan for him .
He believes that he must use his “ God - given ” journalistic talents to report on religion , bringing stories of glory and hope to his readers .
He works hard for years , and then , miraculously , lands a job at the Los Angeles Times – a clear sign of heavenly favour .
With or without religion , you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things .
But for good people to do evil things , that takes religion .
Unfortunately for his faith , the glossy veneer of religious organisations appear increasingly tarnished as he begins reporting on the more disturbing side of the godly .
He meets charismatic man of God , Monsignor Michael Harris ( the first of many such men ) .
In 2001 , Harris was accused of molesting a boy in his care and , as the evidence started to pile up , the Roman Catholic Church paid out $ 5.2 million , whilst Harris was quietly permitted to resign his positions of authority due to “ stress ” .
At the time of the meeting , Lobdell did not realise that the Church had knowingly hid and protected Harris .
He ’d been accused of a similar offence 30 years earlier and had received “ treatment ” .
Those who “ treated ” him concluded that Harris was attracted to adolescent boys and , in all likelihood , had probably molested children on several occasions .
The Church knew all this and yet they did nothing .
But the scandal did not stop there ; it was only the beginning .
Lobdell takes us through his time reporting on the Church ’s escalating paedophilia scandal , with one revolting revelation folowing another .
His statistics on the number of paedophile priests left me feeling uncomfortable and angry .
The Church would bully and manipulate the victims into silence to prevent a scandal .
Organised religion can be vulgar , but to see the Roman Catholic Church aiding , abetting , and facilitating paedophiles in staying undercover and unnoticed whilst they continued to rape children in their care , is enough to make one detest them .
If such an organisation existed without a claim to the divine , the fury of all moral people would erase them from the face of the earth .
Priests – the ones appointed to hearing confessions of sin – were the ones that should have been confessing .
The hypocrisy and silence of the Church was bewildering – enough for Lobdell to abandon long - standing plans to join it .
To do so , he felt , would have felt like a betrayal of the Church ’s victims .
Lobdell simply had met too many victims and heard too many stories .
And the stories continued to come out .
He tells of a priest standing in front of his congregation with the air of an oppressed victim .
He ’s been hit with the Church ’s new zero - tolerance policy on molesting children , or “ boundary violations ” as he puts it , and has been forced to resign because of an “ incident ” many years earlier .
The gathered women and men of God give him a standing ovation as a sign of solidarity , and sympathy with his plight .
Lobdell , a proud father of four sons , is horrified by the reaction of the faithful as they applaud , cheer and cry for the frocked offender .
Stephen Weinburg once wrote in the New York Times :
In what circumstances other than in a religious setting , where critical thinking is gradually – and often instantly – destroyed by faith , is it possible to conceive of a group of good , ordinary people applauding a child molester ?
Lobdell had no answer , and left his job with his faith in tatters .
What he now knows to be true destroyed what he so deeply wished to be true : that God was looking out for him , that his life was in His hands , that he had a divine purpose .
The corrupt godly , the swindling faith - healers , the rapist priests , the contradictory scripture , and the cold and silent voice of God led him to one conclusion .
God was not silent , but imaginary .
This is a story of revelation and rebirth , but not as the Christians would like it .
Lobdell damns himself to hell as he realises that there is n’t a hell to be afraid of .
His belief in an afterlife evaporates as his temporary , mortal , real life takes on new clarity .
He needed a crutch whilst he was crippled , and Christianity sufficed , but he mistook the crutch for the cure .
We all need purpose , but wishing something does not make it so .
William ’s intelligence allowed him a lucky escape – and he was cured of a delusion no faith - healer could ever fix .
Today , Lobdell is a “ reluctant ” atheist , running an excellent blog on which he elaborates :
I know one thing , I do n’t believe in a God who intervenes in our lives .
That seems to me to be the real dividing line : do you believe in a personal God or not ?
Deitism and atheism are on the other side of belief in a personal God .
That ’s where I am .
Though it varies by the day , I estimate that I ’m 70 percent sure I ’m a reluctant atheist and 30 percent positive that I ’m deist ( deist meaning that a creator kicked off this whole world but has a hands - off approach ) .
The larger point being : I ’m 99.99 percent sure that there ’s not a god who intervenes in the lives of humankind .

Los Angeles — Tesla Motors '
Model S is a stunningly beautiful car that that builds upon the cachet of the Roadster and proves the company is serious about pushing electric vehicles into the mainstream .
Company CEO
Elon Musk compared the luxury and practicality of his car to the BMW 5 series and Mercedes Benz CLS sedans and said history will place it alongside the Ford Model T .
His car , he said , is that important and will play a similar role in reshaping the auto industry .
" This is one of the most historic cars , " Musk said moments before pulling a black sheet off a silver prototype of the Model S , which the company all but swears will be in driveways by the third quarter of 2011 .
" We are trying to accelerate the EV revolution and get us off oil . "
Musk 's hyperbole aside , the Model S is as important to the company as it is gorgeous to behold .
Getting it built will prove Tesla is more than a niche player , help push EVs into the mainstream and give Tesla a strong position in the emerging electric - car market .
But perhaps more than that , a seven - passenger sedan with a range of up to 300 miles will prove EVs can be sexy and practical .
" It 's fantastic .
Fantastic , " said Chris Paine , director of the film Who Killed the Electric Car .
" A lot of people ask if electric cars can be practical .
This car is definitely practical .
It 's a remarkably important car .
This car shows that it can be done and it will be done . "
The Model S will have a list price of $ 57,400 , but the $ 7,500 federal tax credit for EVs and plug - in hybrids will bring that down to $ 49,900 .
But bringing the car to market by 2011 wo n't be easy , and Tesla has no time to lose .
General Motors , Ford and Nissan are among the major automakers promising to have EVs on the road by then , and Tesla also is facing competition from a growing number of startups , including Fisker
Automotive .
Musk is n't worried .
" I hope the Volt is out , " he said .
" I hope Nissan has its car .
I hope everyone has an electric car .
The most we can do as a company is serve as an example to the auto industry .
We want to accelerate the adoption of electric cars . "
The sleek car is clearly influenced by European aesthetics .
It 's long and low , with an aggressive stance and a muscular look .
The styling , by Franz von Holzhausen — who designed the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky , and then worked for Mazda before joining Tesla — drew widespread praise .
There were few in the room who did n't want to drive it .
Only prospective customers were taken for a short spin down the street .
" Oh my god , " said Paul Scott , a founder and board member of the EV advocacy group Plug In America .
" I went in with high expectations , and my expectations were exceeded .
The car 's gorgeous .
I love it .
I picture myself in this car and I really want one . "
The car has drawn comparisons to the Jaguar XF and the Maserati Quattroporte , and although von Holzhausen did n't cite those vehicles as influences , he welcomed the association .
" I hear Jaguar , Aston Martin , Alfa Romeo , and I think that 's positive , " he said .
" People have positive associations with those brands , and I think that 's a good reflection on Tesla .
If they said it reminds them of the ( Ford ) Pinto or the ( Pontiac ) Aztek , we 'd have problems . "
Von Holzhausen said it was important to make the car athletic but not brawny and give the car a sense of lightness and efficiency .
" The inspiration is more Lance Armstrong than Lou Ferrigno , " he said .
That 's not to say the car lacks muscle .
Tesla is going head - to - head with the likes of BMW , Mercedes , Audi and Jaguar with the Model S , which means the car 's gotta perform as well as it looks .
To that end , Tesla is developing a drivetrain that builds upon the technology underpinning the Roadster .
The Model S will use a liquid - cooled motor with a peak output of 300 kilowatts , or about 402 horsepower .
Thats a significant hike over the Roadster , which puts out 248 horsepower .
Of course , the Model S is a significantly bigger car — it 's expected to weigh about 4,000 in production trim — and it will be a family car , which means it needs to be able to haul all the stuff a family hauls .
" We wanted to make sure that when you load the car up , you can still get over the Grapevine , " J.B. Straubel , chief technology officer , said , referring to the mountain pass that separates Los Angeles from points north .
" It increases real - world usability . "
Power comes from a lithium - ion battery pack with either 5,500 or 7,800 cells .
It weights " about 500 kilos , " or roughly 1,100 pounds .
Customers can choose from three packs that will deliver 160 to 300 miles per charge — with the cost of the pack rising with the range it provides .
Scott , the EV advocate , called it a brilliant move .
" While it 's great to have 250 or 300 mile range , it 's completely unnecessary for most people , and you 're paying for that , " he said .
Giving people the option of a 160 - mile version , a 230 - mile version or a 300 - mile version is a great idea . "
Musk said the 300 - mile version of the battery will have a " quick charge " feature that will allow it to be recharged in 45 minutes , although he did n't offer any details .
He said advances in the battery chemistry and construction increased volumetric efficiency over the Roadster 's pack by 50 percent .
The battery pack is laid out along the floorboard of the car , and the motor and electronics module sit between the rear wheels , creating a large , open interior .
Musk made maximizing practicality a prime directive in designing the car , and he made a point of noting how much space the interior — which is luxuriously decked out in a few acres of leather and wool — provides .
He would n't let us try it , but Musk insists you can fit a mountain bike in the back without removing the wheels , provided you put the back seats down , and he said the car will carry a 50 - inch TV .
There 's also a flip - up rear - facing seat at the back of the car that 's big enough to carry two small kids — hence the seven - passenger designation .
" It 's just like the old station wagons from the '70s with the seat in the back , " Musk said .
" It 's there for the occasional trip . "
Tesla will have its work cut out for it meeting the 2011 deadline , and just about everything will have to go Tesla 's way .
Aside from lining up suppliers and navigating the government regulatory maze , Tesla still has to build a factory to assemble the car .
Musk says the company is close to finalizing a deal for a factory in Southern California , but he would n't offer specifics .
He 's also confident the Department of Energy will come through with a $ 350 million loan to get the factory up and running ; the agency has set aside $ 25 billion to help automakers develop alt - fuel vehicles .
Telsa also is counting on $ 250 million from a separate federal loan program that Congress authorized in 2005 to finance green tech projects .
And if Tesla does n't get the loan ?
Musk says he 'll figure something out .
" There should be no question that we 'll make this car , " he said emphatically .
" This is the beginning of a new era in transportation . "
More hyperbole to be sure , but you can't discount it entirely because Tesla has an advantage over the big automakers — it already knows how to build an electric car that works .
There are more than 250 Roadsters in driveways right now .
" You have to give Tesla the benefit of the doubt , " said Aaron Bragman , an auto industry analyst with I.H.S. Global Insight .
" It 's the only company actually producing an electric vehicle right now .
At the moment , Tesla has the halo . "
UPDATE - Friday , March 27 : Answers to a couple of things raised by commenters :
Yes , that is a trunk at the front , just like an original Volkswagen Beetle .
The car has a grille because the electric motor is liquid cooled .
Musk said he expects the battery to have a 7 to 10 - year lifespan .
He would not say what it might cost to replace , arguing an accurate prediction is impossible because battery tech is evolving .
Yes , a lot of the nation 's electricity comes from coal .
But according to the Electric Power Research Institute , plug-ins and EVs could cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 450 million metric tons annually by 2050 .
That 's the equivalent of eliminating 82.5 million gasoline vehicles – about a third of the number currently on the road in America .
The Institute says that will only improve as we draw more electricity from nuclear and renewable sources .

At 8:30 PM local time on Saturday night , people around the globe celebrated Earth Hour by turning out the lights at home and on such landmarks as Beijing ’s Bird ’s Nest Stadium and Water Cube , the Empire State Building in New York City , Rio de Janeiro ’s Christ the Redeemer statue , and San Francisco ’s Golden Gate Bridge , to name a few .
But as the hour - long public display of unity cascaded through the timezones , not everyone was buying - in and Fox News was determined to give facetime to anyone who was n’t .
Instead of focusing on the millions of people who turned their lights off and lit candles at home , or , those who went outside to public places to watch city lights dim with their neighbors , coverage of the event from the right - of - center Fox keyed in on the far - right - of - center punditry , featuring “ experts ” from the Freedom Alliance , a nonprofit organization founded by Oliver North and the Foundation for the Protection of Democracies .
Two reports at Fox News — one article , and one televised piece — honed in on some of the right ’s favorite targets , namely : celebrities and the United Nations .
>> Watch the Fox News piece on Earth Hour 2009
To provide even more “ balance ” Fox gave the “ Skeptical Environmentalist , ” Bjorn Lomborg , more undeserved attention .
Lastly , former U.S. representative to the United Nations during the Bush administration , John Bolton also spoke out against the effort .
‘ Earth Hour a vehicle for UN ’s agenda of wealth redistribution ’
“ It ’s an attention - grabbing gesture that they expect to pay off for them big time , ” Claudia Rosett of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , told FOX News .
“ For the U.N. , climate change is the biggest cash cow of all time .
They expect it to pay off for them big - time at the enormous and unaffordable expense of this and future generations , ” said Rosett .
“ It ’s like a lot of what the U.N. does — it ’s a gimmick , it ’s empty , it ’s shallow and it ’s not going to lead to anything , ” said Thomas Kilgannon , president of Freedom Alliance .
According to Fox , “ Critics like Rosett say the U.N. ’s role in Earth Hour is merely the public face of its much larger push to reorder the world ’s economy with new taxes , tariffs and subsidies for greenhouse gas abatement . ”

( or click here and disable ads ) Edward R Murrow 's Dissertation on Fallout 3 Review - posted by DarkUnderlord on Fri 21 November 2008 , 01:58:52 Tags : Fallout 3
About eleven years ago , the first Fallout game was released , pretty much revolutionizing the RPG genre , taking them out of the fantasy ( Wasteland and Buck Rogers aside ) , out of the dungeons , and out of the tedium of endless combat .
When I found it a few years after release , hearing about it from playing another Interplay - published game , Baldur 's Gate , and gave it a try , I was hooked .
When I first played , it pushed all the right buttons .
My character felt unique , and actually played close to how I envisioned they would .
In most games , you 'd start out , and make your character with all sorts of ideas about how they could be a gambling rogue , or a dashing mercenary with a lot of finesse and charm , but ultimately have all your ideas dashed by dungeon - minded design , or the fact that most RPGs pretty much only cared about killing things and getting around the world to kill said things .
Fallout was different , it 's gameplay helped to make my character concept " work " by actually making use of the skills and stats I had picked to change the experience and make it feel like my own .
It made the player feel like they were in control of the story , that it was theirs to interact with and be the main character of .
And above all , it did n't waste my time ; it brought the good stuff like quests with choices , character interaction , and exploration right up front and avoided the RPG trope of killing lots of monsters in countless dull dungeons .
Not only that , but it brought with it interesting writing , a nifty setting , some great aesthetic design , and an overall better feel than your typical RPG back then which usually boiled down to some quest to kill a big foozle in the name of some goofy fantasy crap .
It still stands as one of the scant few games I 've ever been so impressed with , that after completing it once , I just had to give it another go immediately .
Later , I decided to give the sequel Fallout 2 a go , as I figured it should be pretty good .
In the end , I was satisfied , but in the beginning I was pretty doubtful , seeing as the first few locations are terribly done , and your character has little to no freedom in how to do things ( at least compared to the first ) until you hit the Den .
Fallout 2 was definitely rushed , and lost a lot of Fallout 's polish and care .
It was still fun as can be , just not as great .
Later I found out it was an entirely different group leading the team , and it definitely showed .
Tactics .... was okay , and PoS ( the name Fallout fans have for the console spinoff ) does n't need to be mentioned .
Neither of them were the Fallout 3 I wanted , nor what most of the fans wanted .
I was anticipating the real Fallout 3 by Black Isle , and was kind of sick of the spin - offs instead of it .
Unfortunately , that just was not fated to be , as Interplay went under and brought Black Isle with it [ Editor 's Note : Interplay is still around doing it 's best
When I first heard the news , I was n't sure what to think .
Bethesda to me were the people that made Daggerfall , that really empty game with the amazing character system , and Morrowind , the game that butchered the really amazing character system but made the world a lot better .
It could have gone anywhere in my mind .... at least at this point .
Then they released Oblivion , which pretty much was a terrible RPG , and started releasing some really ... bad information about their take on Fallout 3 .
Suffice to say , I never had much confidence in the game from this point on , and in fact , had doubts I 'd ever play it .
However , after release , along with all the sycophantic mainstream reviews , some trustworthy , credible sources actually complemented it on a lot of things .
It then got relegated to the " play when bargain bin " list .
Opportunity knocked , and I was able to get a copy for the 360 without having to fork over $ 60 , so I decided to give it a go and see if I can have some fun with it [ Editor 's Note : Edward assures us that nothing was physically removed from an inventory ] .
Generally , it was pretty much what I suspected it would be , with a few pleasant surprises , and a few " How could they be that thick ? " moments .
It 's a Bethesda game through and through , with all of their trademark flaws and few of Fallout 's strengths preserved .
Fallout 3 basically plays much like a post - apocalyptic Oblivion with guns and a few tweaks , despite what some might say .
Bethesda did not stray far from their formula , for better or for worse .
It does some things right , and it does a whole heap - load of things wrong .
I was n't exactly pleased with it , but it could have been a lot worse .
Seeing as it's a sequel to one of the best role - playing games ever made , the RPG elements are probably a decent place to start off .
They are definitely an improvement on Oblivion , or anything Bethesda has done for that matter .
Skill and stat checks exist in dialogue and come out in force .
Generally any quest - related dialogue will have a skill check involved .
By this , it sounds like Fallout 3 is definitely off to a good start , but skill checks being all over the place does not a good RPG make .
KOTOR had oodles of skill checks , it 's just none of them ever really did anything special , or opened up any real doors .
Fallout 3 is like this with most of the skill checks .
A majority of the checks are merely speech checks to milk more money out of people as a reward , a la KOTOR , and hardly add anything .
And by majority , I mean the majority .
Most skill checks are " gimme more money " speech checks , there were scant few other checks .
I ran across maybe three science checks , one repair check , and a medicine check or two and that was it .
And most stat checks are intelligence checks that sound anything but intelligent , and that would be much more fitting with a [ Captain Obvious ] tag beside them .
I suppose this is a marked improvement for Bethesda , but they 're still 10 years behind the curve on this , and I do n't rightly see any point in going easy on them .
And outside of dialogue , skills are rather poorly handled .
One of the most glaring flaws is how they handled lockpicking and hacking .
First off , to hack or pick something , skills only count for sort of an " entrance fee " .
What determines your success is a minigame .
The lockpicking minigame is rather painless , which is a wonderful change from Oblivion , but the hacking is often frustrating and is overall not very fun .
Even worse is how they handled the minimum skill requirements for both skills , in that only multiples of 25 matter as they are where all the baseline requirements lie .
It kind of makes points in the skill feel rather worthless individually , whereas other skills get immediate marginal benefits upon increases , an additional investment in science or lockpicking very often confers no marginal benefit , even if you blow all your skill points for the level on it .
I feel like that is n't a good way to design things , especially when pretty much every other skill confers some sort of immediate benefit on increase .
And lockpicking and hacking hardly add anything to gameplay .
Lockpicking rarely allows one to avoid fights or get to interesting places , it just gets you more loot , which is already far too abundant that more rarely matters ( more on this later ) .
Hacking lets you avoid some lockpicking checks , disable / reprogram a few turrets , and get worthless robots to possibly fight for you , but more than likely not due to the miracles of radiant AI screwups making it walk into a wall instead of fight enemies .
And it's also the skill most related to getting background information from terminals in dungeons .
Other skills have little use outside of the combat sphere .
Repair is all about weapon and armor maintenance and building the radically useless schematic weaponry .
To be fair however , weapon degradation is completely ridiculous , so it does see a lot of use .
But the secondary ability , schematic weaponry is pretty useless .
Schematics come into play mid-way through the game due to their nature as mid-level quest rewards , and by the time you can make them , they 're mostly obsolete being underpowered , and made useless by the abundance of ammunition for conventional weaponry .
I do n't know about the shishkebob however , it could be the premier melee weapon , or at least a good holdover until you can get a super mace .... I mean sledge .
Medicine makes stims and rad- away more effective .
Problem is , you 're swimming in both of them even in the higher difficulties , if you have any idea what you 're doing , making this skill useless in the face of a rather bountiful wasteland .
Same problem with barter .
My barter skill never passed 30 , yet I found everything , sans house upgrades , cheap as can be .
You get way too many caps and too much loot for the skill to have any meaning .
Sneaking is handled poorly , there are very few stealth opportunities , and most quest NPCs seemed to have some sort of magic anti-pickpocketing field about them .
Not to mention , the new Stealth Boys basically make points in this skill mostly obsolete unless you really want to sneak all the time , because you get quite a few Stealth Boy consumables that give you +100 to the sneak skill temporarily , and a bonus stealth field , allowing you essentially " sneak in a bottle " .
The ultimate problem about stealth however is that it is n't very fun , nor very reliable .
When I tried to sneak through one of the myriad Metro tunnels in downtown DC I would often be at the mercy of enemy placement , as one narrow part with an enemy smack - dab in the middle would sink my dreams of being Sam Fischer / Solid Snake in a post apocalyptic wasteland as there was little to nothing I could do , even with the addition of a Stealth Boy .
Plus , stealth is tedious and does n't bring any rewards of fun .
Bethesda could have gone a long way to making stealth more fun by implementing some sort of stealth kill system ( outside of one high level perk to disable robots ) like Bloodlines did .
It makes things much more interactive , differentiates gameplay between characters , and gives the player a reward for sneaking beyond just a free critical hit or avoiding Bethesda 's mounds of enemies .
I thought Emil being a lead on one of the Thief games would make stealth worthwhile , but apparently not .
Explosives is an odd one .
The skill involves disarming traps , throwing grenades , and the damage your explosives do .
Disarming traps works well enough , however it 's totally dependent on the player seeing the traps .
There 's nothing given to characters with high perception , or high explosives to aid them in seeing these traps , and my 35 in explosives was sufficient to disarm any trap I came across .
Mines never worked for me though .
They always seemed to not detonate on the enemies , possibly due to Bethesda 's poor implementation of physics , and were generally not needed in any situation because combat was already a breeze .
Weapon skills function well enough , though I still do n't like that they determine damage output instead of just accuracy , but it comes with the first - person / real - time territory I suppose .
I mean , games like Deus Ex and Vampire : Bloodlines , where skills determined accuracy must not exist in Bethesda 's dream world .
Sure , it 's jarring when you shoot at someone 's center mass at point blank and miss in real time , but that does n't mean a foolish system like the one in Fallout 3 should exist .
Stuff like a nuclear catapult that fires mini - nukes dealing double damage because your big guns skill doubled is silly as can be .
And emptying tons of hot plasma into something 's head with a plasma rifle , but not fazing it because your energy weapons skill is crap is perfectly justified to Bethesda under the same “ it 's gameplay ; do n't think too much about it ” that would justify the other way around .
It 's just Bethesda thinks , like a lot of game developers , that missing with weapons due to a lack of skill is some gaming sin .
Oh , by the way , melee and unarmed are taken straight out of Oblivion , meaning they inherit all the clunky mechanics , and as icing on the cake , they can't target body parts in VATS because Bethesda was too lazy to animate it , making them pretty much play with the same block , strike , strike ad nauseum gameplay as Oblivion .
Stats are essentially gutted , providing very little to differentiate characters from one another .
No longer are there crippling side effects of lowering a stat below 4 , and no longer do you feel any real benefit to raising most stats to high numbers like 9 or 10 .
Basically , stats matter very little except for intelligence .
See , intelligence stands head and shoulders above the other stats in the benefits each point gives you .
Lets break it down , shall we ?
Strength : 10 points of additional carrying capacity per point on top of the base 150 plus some melee damage .
Perception : Better radar and minor skill ups
Endurance : More HP and more rad resistance , plus minor skill ups
Charisma : A scant few checks and minor skill ups ( the dump stat )
Intelligence : 40 additional skill points , plus minor skill ups and the most dialogue checks
Agility : minor increase in action points ( 65 plus 2 times agility ) plus minor skill ups
Luck : critical chance goes up and minor skill ups
Obviously Intelligence is leaps and bounds the best here , because it gives you a massive pool of skill points to work with , and skill points are what matter in Fallout 3 .
And this is where the character system really breaks down .
Maxing intelligence allows you to gain a huge amount of skill points easily .
Throw in bobbleheads , perks , abundant skill books , and you can easily max 5 - 7 skills with ease .
And seeing as 5 of the 13 skills are combat related , and two of them are arguably useless , it 's very possible to become a jack of all trades character straight out of the Elder Scrolls style .
My character had science , speech , small guns , and lockpicking maxed by level 14 , and thanks to the mounds of experience you gain ( at least on very hard ) it was relatively early in my journey .
Thus my character had no restrictions .
You do n't get that Fallout feeling of a defined role that you are playing .
It goes a long way in making a lot of the skill checks feel pretty empty and hollow and the broken character system tears down many of the advancements Bethesda made in the role - playing department .
Quests are a very mixed bag .
They run the gamut from peaks of almost brilliance to nadirs of idiocy but often end up in the state of great idea , horrible execution .
Take for instance " The Replicated Man " .
It 's an amazing quest .
It 's dialogue and exploration , there 's no " dungeon " per-se , and you never have somebody actively drop the quest on you .
It 's very open - ended and presents a lot of choices in going about it .
It even has good enough writing to boot , the only problem being how much android ethics a la Blade Runner seems silly in what is supposedly a gritty wasteland .
The only thing it 's missing is a set of good consequences beyond what shiny piece of loot you get or what perk you get .
" You Gotta Shoot Em In The Head " is another example of a great quest .
It starts as someone asking you to kill some people , but if you use your dialogue skills to do some snooping , it turns out to be a hunt for something very valuable crossed with an old vendetta .
You can either do the assassinations and get some caps , or dig a little deeper and find out what the " special things " are for and maybe get the " treasure " for yourself , one that 's sure to put a smile on any Fallout fan 's face .
Every assassination target brought you to an interesting place and had at least two additional ways of " handling " instead of killing .
These were pretty much the best quests in the game .
" Tenpenny Tower " was okay .
It offered three ways to complete the quest , but two of them were killfests , and the speech option was ... lacking .
They attempt some sort of “ consequence ” for this quest if you use the speech option , but I never would have known about it because there never was a reason for me to ever travel back to Tenpenny Tower .
Some quests are in - between , like the “ Oasis ” quest .
It has an interesting premise , sets up a moral dilemma , and has multiple solutions .
Unfortunately , the moral dilemma is killed by awful writing , and all solutions but one involve going through a dungeon filled with radcrabs .
And all but that one non-dungeon solution have very little difference , only the loot gained differs .
Everyone just kind of nonchalantly agrees to disagree or flat out agrees with what you did including the people who saw their life and home gravely threatened , people who saw an opportunity for the wastes perhaps dashed , and the “ person ” who wanted you to kill itself to avoid an eternity of pain will just shrug and essentially say “ Well , guess I was being selfish .
You did the right thing I suppose ” .
It 's that sort of lack of payoff and flawed execution that plagues most quests in Fallout 3 .
From here though , it just got worse .
Most other quests devolved into dungeon crawls .
Take the " Stealing Independence " quest .
Go into the National Archives and grab the Declaration of Independence .
Seems like it should be fun enough , and offer some cool science and stealth options .
Nope .
Go through a bunch of DC metro tunnels while killing raiders and ghouls , then fight through 2 floors of mutants , and a floor of robots to be able to use a speech check to get out of a fight with a low level robot with a little personality .
Wonderful .
And the idiocy keeps going like this , where quests devolve into boring monster hacks with a usually useless speech check at the end .
They have all this potential , and then throw it away on dungeon crawling nonsense .
They even brought back an Oblivion fan favorite quest , except instead of collecting X amounts of Magic Wine you collect X amount of Nuka Cola Quantum .
Obviously this quest is not an artificial time lengthener that exists just to drop you in more dungeons .
Even worse , quests have almost no consequences .
Even blowing up Megaton does n't close out the big quests there , as the quest giver conveniently becomes a ghoul and still offers the quest to you from a different location .
Working with Paradise Falls did n't seem to stop me from helping some escaped slaves in another quest , and I bet it would likely be the same vice versa , even though Three Dog is blasting everything you do across the Wasteland .
Karma is the only consequence of quests and is pretty much useless except for the companions who cast Detect Good / Evil on you .
Both good and evil characters get mercenaries on their tail , and I found trying to play a neutral character near impossible , as contrary to what Todd said , there are no rewards for neutral characters .
Plus karma is pretty broken seeing as your robot butler can essentially give you infinite pure water to give to beggars for Karma ++ and you can always donate caps to churches for Karma ++ because it 's not like Fallout ever had some sort of key anti-establishment tone in it or this is some tired RPG cliche that needs to be put to bed .
And evil unspeakable is only stealing a whole house full of crap away , or perhaps killing some generic Megaton citizens who will respawn in the two days it takes to forget your crimes .
So essentially , they neutered the only real consequences in their game .
The main quest is rubbish , pure and simple .
Most every quest devolves into killing , and the only virtue of it is that you can skip most of it .
It suffers also from another flaw of Oblivion , the player character is not the main character .
Just like in Oblivion , how Martin was the true " protagonist " and you were more a glorified errand boy , you basically play this same role to daddy Liam and his pet project .
Now , it 's not being a “ Chosen One ” who must stop the ancient evil , which could be seen as a progress of sorts .
Unfortunately , it 's a case of being thrown out of the frying pan into the fire as you are the Chosen One 's sidekick , who fights the mildly venerable evil .
Also like Oblivion , it ends with you watching a big thing fight other big things instead of doing some ass kicking yourself .
If I 'm going to play a game riddled with combat , at least let me feel badass about it instead of cock - blocking me .
Even in Bloodlines , when it devolved into a hackfest , my character was killing tons of stuff and wrecking house .
I get to demolish the big players who had previously pushed me around , if I so chose to , not watch Smiling Jack fight them in his Mecha Battle Sarcophagus .
But to make the climax something the player watches rather than participates in ?
What the hell , this is n't a jRPG you twats .
Oh , and the ending is pure idiocy and to add insult to injury , they did n't even bring back the ending slides .
Over 200 permutations my ass .
It 's more like one based on karma , one based on one choice at the very end , and one based on another choice at the very end .
And thus quests are basically where Fallout 3 again falls flat as an RPG .
There are too few good ones , and the rest are buried in mounds of Bethesda 's awful dungeon - crawling and terrible combat .
Exploration outside of quests is mostly pointless in my view , because the majority of locales are simple dungeon - crawls with maybe a log or a diary to put a little bit of backstory into what is likely a boring dungeon - hack with only loot and monsters .
Any place with potential typically falls flat on it's face .
Vault 106 was lauded for being an exercise in great scripting and immersion .
It turns out it 's a dungeon hack where you hallucinate a couple of times , and one of which you solve by walking forward and the other by shooting the hallucinations .
Real clever Bethesda .
Nice job throwing away a perfectly good opportunity .
Why could n't they really mess with the player ?
Like perhaps by making the Pip - Boy not function properly , make the map change , make a lot of hallucinations the player can talk with and creative stuff like this .
The Dunwich Building is just a dark office loaded with feral ghouls and Lovecraft references delivered through audio logs and terminals .
Whoop - dee - doo .
I even found the base of the Outcast faction of the Brotherhood .
I was excited about this , maybe I could get a quest to assassinate Lyons and let them take over , maybe be a diplomat between the two and negotiate a truce .
Nope .
I get a " quest " to bring any power armor or energy weapons to them for caps , ammo , or stims .
Great job blowing some serious potential Bethesda .
I even came across a huge raider settlement .
I was really excited here , so I donned some raider armor and went in , expecting to blend in , and maybe get some quests , dialogue , and lore .
Guess what happened though ?
They still went hostile .
So Bethesda makes an entire settlement , unique art assets for a lot of it , and all for what ?
A glorified kill - fest .
This type of half - assed work plagues pretty much every non-quest exploration locale .
I remember one review I had read prior to release comparing the locations you could find in a favorable way to some of the better ones in Vampire : Bloodlines and all I can say is what were they thinking ?
Nothing like the haunted hotel , the hospital ruins , or the Escher - inspired manor exists to be found in this game .
If anything , Bethesda 's locales remind me more of the bad parts of Bloodlines , like the sewers , the Palace of Infinite Ninja Vampires , and the Hallowbrook Hotel ; boring hackfests .
Sure , places like Andale and the ComSat towers are well done , as they have some real interactivity , stuff to explore , or something unique to offer , but they are islands of good awash in a sea of mediocre , time - wasting drivel .
You 've probably heard me drone on and on about " dungeon - crawling " this and that , and may be thinking to yourself " What a minute ; dungeon crawling can be fun " .
And yes , a good dungeon crawl can be fun .
But it needs two things ; good dungeons , which Bethesda does not make , and good combat .
And Fallout 3 does not do well in the combat department .
What most detracts from the combat is the awful animations , making enemies , allies , and everything else move in jerky , erratic patterns .
Now these jerky , erratic patterns make things hard to shoot , and take away from the flow of the action , fundamentally weakening the game .
VATS , essentially the aimed shot mode to placate turn - based fans , is screwy as well .
I do n't quite understand the allure of taking all the action out of an action game by letting the computer shoot for you .
It does n't even add that much of a tactical edge either .
It just seems like a cheap compromise .
Enemy design is weak as well , with little interesting ideas .
As much as I may have hated the idea of ghouls with " curative fluids " , stuff like that would have gone a long way in spicing up Fallout 3's boring cast of enemy chumps .
Because essentially , all enemies do is either follow the suicidal melee charge AI routine , or shoot stuff at you and attempt ( and usually fail ) to take cover of some sort .
There are no group tactics , there are no advanced maneuvers .
Bethesda has n't picked up any of the tricks shooters have been doing with their enemies for the past six or so years .
And essentially , these two routines only require two responses .
If it 's a melee enemy , go into VATS and unload on the legs , run back shooting while VATS recharges , and repeat as necessary .
For ranged enemies , shoot the weapon or the arm , in VATS , to disable them and go in for the kill .
You do n't really need tactics though , because Bethesda has stuffed the Wasteland with enough loot that any character who has n't been purposely gimped should have no fear , even on higher difficulties , as they can just item spam right on through .
Throw in hilariously bad AI goofs , like enemies getting stuck on cover , or cowering in front of you at low damage , and combat becomes more of a tedious joke .
Bethesda could have made combat a lot better .
Get enemies with interesting abilities .
This is a 50's SCIENCE !
setting , use some creativity .
They already butchered the canon ; they might as well add in quirky and interesting enemies even if they do n't quite fit .
Get some enemy diversity through any means .
Besides models and damage , most enemies are incredibly similar .
Molerats , mirelurks , yao guai , deathclaws , and feral ghouls all have the same mode of operation ; charge forward and lunge at you .
And those take care of almost half the encounters you end up in .
It 's just boring to fight one track enemies over and over again .
No enemies have depth , and there are n't enough variations to make up for that .
Or maybe they could also tone back on the hand - holding .
Make ammo actually have weight , so conserving shots is important and you can't merely carry one weapon for each ammo type and never have to worry about running out or having a weapon break .
System Shock 2 made combat a tense affair by giving you a very small amount of resources , making those 5 bullets you blew on a monkey something to possibly think about .
And I think it 's still kind of funny that I was more well supplied in a game about surviving in a wasteland after a nuclear holocaust , than in one where I was on a new space - ship , full of technology and supplies .
They could possibly work on updating AI , and not making this play like a 90's FPS with a goofy super - shot gimmick .
Back on that canon thing ; I do n't really want to get into this that much .
Basically , I could go on and on if I wanted to , but then it would just be a glorified fanboy rant , and nobody wants that .
Suffice to say , anyone who played the past Fallout games may have a few “ How did they get here ? ” , “ Why are they like that now ? ” and “ Godamnit I killed every last one of them in Fallout 2 and now they 're back , and even stronger ? ! ” in regards to matters of setting consistency .
What really bugs me however , and what should at least register as a bad thing in the eyes of most , is how inconsistent the game is with itself .
One moment you 're talking to a ghoul who is upset people think they 're “ zombies ” and how he explains it 's untrue and people need to understand things beyond myth , ignorance , and superstition , and the next moment you 're talking to actual vampire people who actually need bloodpacks to survive .
One moment you 're being told ( or in the main quest ; shown ) the constant danger and serious of radiation , then the next moment the Sarah Palin of the wastes is telling you to go get severely irradiated for her , and that everything will be okay .
One moment you 're told how valuable pre-war energy weapons are .
The next moment , you find one in a mailbox , or buy one for 7 caps , or find one in a shoebox , or have some ammo fall from the sky on you .
I 'm serious .
Any atmosphere Bethesda builds up is torn down by idiocy that they could n't cut out .
Oh , and lots of things are left completely unexplained ... and not little things , like why a light is on , or a computer terminal working , or why every grocery store is filled with drugs and mini-nukes , but big things , like why someone wants to blow up an entire settlement , or where the Behemoths came from .
Aesthetics are n't even that impressive , making you wonder what exactly it is this game does well .
Sure , the wasteland looks very pretty from a technical point of view , but the logic behind it does n't make sense .
Some buildings will be destroyed outright , with others in near pristine condition right next to them .
There 's also the cut and paste wooden houses with identical decay and destruction in the same areas breaking any sense of immersion .
It just does n't look like a nuclear war happened 200 years ago and it does n't seem like Bethesda put any thought into things .
Characters look better than Oblivion , but there 's a new problem in town ; many characters are markedly similar to one another .
It seems Bethesda made a few good faces , and then used them as much as possible .
I distinctly remember seeing a good deal of Amata clones , and generally felt a lot of deja vu .
Nobody had any distinctive feel , though that is a symptom of FaceGen I suppose .
Voice over work is pretty terrible , most of the casting again following the Oblivion approach and having a small group of people voice many characters , with star power playing a few big roles .
To top it off , animations for voice over are poor and unexpressive , with characters saying something with a lot of emotion accompanied by a very passive set of gestures .
Both Mass Effect , a game released a year ago , and Vampire Bloodlines , a game released four years ago destroy Bethesda 's feeble attempts in terms of making convincing digital actors with solid animations and voicework .
I guess Bethesda delivers the same thing aesthetically they always do , some nice environments that you need to turn your brain off to enjoy hiking around .
Fallout 3 also happens to be one of the buggiest , most broken games I 've seen .
It 's crashed more than Arcanum or Bloodlines ever did , I encountered a few quest - breaking bugs that made me reload from a much earlier save , and physics glitches killed two of my companions when entering a new cell .
Worst of all , I 'm playing on a 360 .... a console , and according to Todd Howard , the primary development platform .
This is inexcusable , that a multi-million dollar game , from a huge development studio , on a console , is this buggy .
Bugs come from two sources primarily ; shoddy code and testing , and the programmer 's inability to be able to predict everyone 's system specs .
Except , on a console , everyone has pretty much the same specs .
Good one Bethesda .
You made a game as buggy as Arcanum and Bloodlines ( maybe buggier ) that still is n't as good an RPG , and on a console to boot .
That 's worth an Xbox Achievement methinks .
Outside of gameplay , Bethesda butchers the Fallout canon , delivers a terrible story where your character is pushed around , writes mediocre dialogue , and generally just does n't deliver much of anything but a sandbox game full of mildly amusing timesinks to explore and a lot of wasted potential .
What it is to you depends mostly on how much mental blocks you can set up , or where your priorities lie .
You need to block out that it abandons Fallout 's setting , and much of it 's core gameplay .
You have to block out the horrendous writing and dialogue .
You have to block out all the bugs and design flaws .
And most of all , you have to pretend that calling something a “ sandbox RPG ” magically throws standards of quality out the window , and makes a game good if it just has lots of dull dungeons .
That 's what this game needs to be good , and it seems a little too much for my tastes .
I 'm left wondering what happened with this game .
They had an existing engine , an existing IP , a multi-million dollar budget , and a large pool of human resources , but nothing , save a few nuggets of greatness in the quest department , in Fallout 3 stands out as anything higher than passable .
Ultimately , Fallout 3 is more Bethesda mediocrity in the vein of Morrowind or Oblivion .
If those games tickled your fancy , you 're bound to love this game , it 's everything they do , but better .
Or maybe you can look past the flaws and have a blast with it .
I can't say I did n't enjoy parts of it , but I also can't say I was n't almost always disappointed by Bethesda 's general half - assedness .
It 's a mildly amusing timesink ; but that 's not saying much .
Ultimately , it just does n't work for me .
It flies in the face of most everything I felt Fallout 1 did so well .
Closing things off , Fallout 3 is a lot like a wasteland ; you 're searching through it looking for a little something good , something to keep you going , but to do that you have to go through a whole lot of bad and it just might not be worth it and you might not want to go on .

About eleven years ago , the first Fallout game was released , pretty much revolutionizing the RPG genre , taking them out of the fantasy ( Wasteland and Buck Rogers aside ) , out of the dungeons , and out of the tedium of endless combat .
When I found it a few years after release , hearing about it from playing another Interplay - published game , Baldur 's Gate , and gave it a try , I was hooked .
When I first played , it pushed all the right buttons .
My character felt unique , and actually played close to how I envisioned they would .
In most games , you 'd start out , and make your character with all sorts of ideas about how they could be a gambling rogue , or a dashing mercenary with a lot of finesse and charm , but ultimately have all your ideas dashed by dungeon - minded design , or the fact that most RPGs pretty much only cared about killing things and getting around the world to kill said things .
Fallout was different , it 's gameplay helped to make my character concept " work " by actually making use of the skills and stats I had picked to change the experience and make it feel like my own .
It made the player feel like they were in control of the story , that it was theirs to interact with and be the main character of .
And above all , it did n't waste my time ; it brought the good stuff like quests with choices , character interaction , and exploration right up front and avoided the RPG trope of killing lots of monsters in countless dull dungeons .
Not only that , but it brought with it interesting writing , a nifty setting , some great aesthetic design , and an overall better feel than your typical RPG back then which usually boiled down to some quest to kill a big foozle in the name of some goofy fantasy crap .
It still stands as one of the scant few games I 've ever been so impressed with , that after completing it once , I just had to give it another go immediately .
Later , I decided to give the sequel Fallout 2 a go , as I figured it should be pretty good .
In the end , I was satisfied , but in the beginning I was pretty doubtful , seeing as the first few locations are terribly done , and your character has little to no freedom in how to do things ( at least compared to the first ) until you hit the Den .
Fallout 2 was definitely rushed , and lost a lot of Fallout 's polish and care .
It was still fun as can be , just not as great .
Later I found out it was an entirely different group leading the team , and it definitely showed .
Tactics .... was okay , and PoS ( the name Fallout fans have for the console spinoff ) does n't need to be mentioned .
Neither of them were the Fallout 3 I wanted , nor what most of the fans wanted .
I was anticipating the real Fallout 3 by Black Isle , and was kind of sick of the spin - offs instead of it .
Unfortunately , that just was not fated to be , as Interplay went under and brought Black Isle with it [ Editor 's Note : Interplay is still around doing it 's best Night of the Living Dead zombie impersonation ] .
The license was sold off to Bethesda and here our story gets a little closer to the point .
When I first heard the news , I was n't sure what to think .
Bethesda to me were the people that made Daggerfall , that really empty game with the amazing character system , and Morrowind , the game that butchered the really amazing character system but made the world a lot better .
It could have gone anywhere in my mind .... at least at this point .
Then they released Oblivion , which pretty much was a terrible RPG , and started releasing some really ... bad information about their take on Fallout 3 .
Suffice to say , I never had much confidence in the game from this point on , and in fact , had doubts I 'd ever play it .
However , after release , along with all the sycophantic mainstream reviews , some trustworthy , credible sources actually complemented it on a lot of things .
It then got relegated to the " play when bargain bin " list .
Opportunity knocked , and I was able to get a copy for the 360 without having to fork over $ 60 , so I decided to give it a go and see if I can have some fun with it [ Editor 's Note : Edward assures us that nothing was physically removed from an inventory ] .
Generally , it was pretty much what I suspected it would be , with a few pleasant surprises , and a few " How could they be that thick ? " moments .
It 's a Bethesda game through and through , with all of their trademark flaws and few of Fallout 's strengths preserved .
Fallout 3 basically plays much like a post - apocalyptic Oblivion with guns and a few tweaks , despite what some might say .
Bethesda did not stray far from their formula , for better or for worse .
It does some things right , and it does a whole heap - load of things wrong .
I was n't exactly pleased with it , but it could have been a lot worse .
Seeing as it's a sequel to one of the best role - playing games ever made , the RPG elements are probably a decent place to start off .
They are definitely an improvement on Oblivion , or anything Bethesda has done for that matter .
Skill and stat checks exist in dialogue and come out in force .
Generally any quest - related dialogue will have a skill check involved .
By this , it sounds like Fallout 3 is definitely off to a good start , but skill checks being all over the place does not a good RPG make .
KOTOR had oodles of skill checks , it 's just none of them ever really did anything special , or opened up any real doors .
Fallout 3 is like this with most of the skill checks .
A majority of the checks are merely speech checks to milk more money out of people as a reward , a la KOTOR , and hardly add anything .
And by majority , I mean the majority .
Most skill checks are " gimme more money " speech checks , there were scant few other checks .
I ran across maybe three science checks , one repair check , and a medicine check or two and that was it .
And most stat checks are intelligence checks that sound anything but intelligent , and that would be much more fitting with a [ Captain Obvious ] tag beside them .
I suppose this is a marked improvement for Bethesda , but they 're still 10 years behind the curve on this , and I do n't rightly see any point in going easy on them .
And outside of dialogue , skills are rather poorly handled .
One of the most glaring flaws is how they handled lockpicking and hacking .
First off , to hack or pick something , skills only count for sort of an " entrance fee " .
What determines your success is a minigame .
The lockpicking minigame is rather painless , which is a wonderful change from Oblivion , but the hacking is often frustrating and is overall not very fun .
Even worse is how they handled the minimum skill requirements for both skills , in that only multiples of 25 matter as they are where all the baseline requirements lie .
It kind of makes points in the skill feel rather worthless individually , whereas other skills get immediate marginal benefits upon increases , an additional investment in science or lockpicking very often confers no marginal benefit , even if you blow all your skill points for the level on it .
I feel like that is n't a good way to design things , especially when pretty much every other skill confers some sort of immediate benefit on increase .
And lockpicking and hacking hardly add anything to gameplay .
Lockpicking rarely allows one to avoid fights or get to interesting places , it just gets you more loot , which is already far too abundant that more rarely matters ( more on this later ) .
Hacking lets you avoid some lockpicking checks , disable / reprogram a few turrets , and get worthless robots to possibly fight for you , but more than likely not due to the miracles of radiant AI screwups making it walk into a wall instead of fight enemies .
And it's also the skill most related to getting background information from terminals in dungeons .
Other skills have little use outside of the combat sphere .
Repair is all about weapon and armor maintenance and building the radically useless schematic weaponry .
To be fair however , weapon degradation is completely ridiculous , so it does see a lot of use .
But the secondary ability , schematic weaponry is pretty useless .
Schematics come into play mid-way through the game due to their nature as mid-level quest rewards , and by the time you can make them , they 're mostly obsolete being underpowered , and made useless by the abundance of ammunition for conventional weaponry .
I do n't know about the shishkebob however , it could be the premier melee weapon , or at least a good holdover until you can get a super mace .... I mean sledge .
Medicine makes stims and rad- away more effective .
Problem is , you 're swimming in both of them even in the higher difficulties , if you have any idea what you 're doing , making this skill useless in the face of a rather bountiful wasteland .
Same problem with barter .
My barter skill never passed 30 , yet I found everything , sans house upgrades , cheap as can be .
You get way too many caps and too much loot for the skill to have any meaning .
Sneaking is handled poorly , there are very few stealth opportunities , and most quest NPCs seemed to have some sort of magic anti-pickpocketing field about them .
Not to mention , the new Stealth Boys basically make points in this skill mostly obsolete unless you really want to sneak all the time , because you get quite a few Stealth Boy consumables that give you +100 to the sneak skill temporarily , and a bonus stealth field , allowing you essentially " sneak in a bottle " .
The ultimate problem about stealth however is that it is n't very fun , nor very reliable .
When I tried to sneak through one of the myriad Metro tunnels in downtown DC I would often be at the mercy of enemy placement , as one narrow part with an enemy smack - dab in the middle would sink my dreams of being Sam Fischer / Solid Snake in a post apocalyptic wasteland as there was little to nothing I could do , even with the addition of a Stealth Boy .
Plus , stealth is tedious and does n't bring any rewards of fun .
Bethesda could have gone a long way to making stealth more fun by implementing some sort of stealth kill system ( outside of one high level perk to disable robots ) like Bloodlines did .
It makes things much more interactive , differentiates gameplay between characters , and gives the player a reward for sneaking beyond just a free critical hit or avoiding Bethesda 's mounds of enemies .
I thought Emil being a lead on one of the Thief games would make stealth worthwhile , but apparently not .
Explosives is an odd one .
The skill involves disarming traps , throwing grenades , and the damage your explosives do .
Disarming traps works well enough , however it 's totally dependent on the player seeing the traps .
There 's nothing given to characters with high perception , or high explosives to aid them in seeing these traps , and my 35 in explosives was sufficient to disarm any trap I came across .
Mines never worked for me though .
They always seemed to not detonate on the enemies , possibly due to Bethesda 's poor implementation of physics , and were generally not needed in any situation because combat was already a breeze .
Weapon skills function well enough , though I still do n't like that they determine damage output instead of just accuracy , but it comes with the first - person / real - time territory I suppose .
I mean , games like Deus Ex and Vampire : Bloodlines , where skills determined accuracy must not exist in Bethesda 's dream world .
Sure , it 's jarring when you shoot at someone 's center mass at point blank and miss in real time , but that does n't mean a foolish system like the one in Fallout 3 should exist .
Stuff like a nuclear catapult that fires mini - nukes dealing double damage because your big guns skill doubled is silly as can be .
And emptying tons of hot plasma into something 's head with a plasma rifle , but not fazing it because your energy weapons skill is crap is perfectly justified to Bethesda under the same “ it 's gameplay ; do n't think too much about it ” that would justify the other way around .
It 's just Bethesda thinks , like a lot of game developers , that missing with weapons due to a lack of skill is some gaming sin .
Oh , by the way , melee and unarmed are taken straight out of Oblivion , meaning they inherit all the clunky mechanics , and as icing on the cake , they can't target body parts in VATS because Bethesda was too lazy to animate it , making them pretty much play with the same block , strike , strike ad nauseum gameplay as Oblivion .
Stats are essentially gutted , providing very little to differentiate characters from one another .
No longer are there crippling side effects of lowering a stat below 4 , and no longer do you feel any real benefit to raising most stats to high numbers like 9 or 10 .
Basically , stats matter very little except for intelligence .
See , intelligence stands head and shoulders above the other stats in the benefits each point gives you .
Lets break it down , shall we ?
Strength : 10 points of additional carrying capacity per point on top of the base 150 plus some melee damage .
Perception : Better radar and minor skill upsEndurance : More HP and more rad resistance , plus minor skill upsCharisma : A scant few checks and minor skill ups ( the dump stat ) Intelligence : 40 additional skill points , plus minor skill ups and the most dialogue checksAgility : minor increase in action points ( 65 plus 2 times agility ) plus minor skill upsLuck : critical chance goes up and minor skill upsObviously Intelligence is leaps and bounds the best here , because it gives you a massive pool of skill points to work with , and skill points are what matter in Fallout 3 .
And this is where the character system really breaks down .
Maxing intelligence allows you to gain a huge amount of skill points easily .
Throw in bobbleheads , perks , abundant skill books , and you can easily max 5 - 7 skills with ease .
And seeing as 5 of the 13 skills are combat related , and two of them are arguably useless , it 's very possible to become a jack of all trades character straight out of the Elder Scrolls style .
My character had science , speech , small guns , and lockpicking maxed by level 14 , and thanks to the mounds of experience you gain ( at least on very hard ) it was relatively early in my journey .
Thus my character had no restrictions .
You do n't get that Fallout feeling of a defined role that you are playing .
It goes a long way in making a lot of the skill checks feel pretty empty and hollow and the broken character system tears down many of the advancements Bethesda made in the role - playing department .
Quests are a very mixed bag .
They run the gamut from peaks of almost brilliance to nadirs of idiocy but often end up in the state of great idea , horrible execution .
Take for instance " The Replicated Man " .
It 's an amazing quest .
It 's dialogue and exploration , there 's no " dungeon " per-se , and you never have somebody actively drop the quest on you .
It 's very open - ended and presents a lot of choices in going about it .
It even has good enough writing to boot , the only problem being how much android ethics a la Blade Runner seems silly in what is supposedly a gritty wasteland .
The only thing it 's missing is a set of good consequences beyond what shiny piece of loot you get or what perk you get .
" You Gotta Shoot Em In The Head " is another example of a great quest .
It starts as someone asking you to kill some people , but if you use your dialogue skills to do some snooping , it turns out to be a hunt for something very valuable crossed with an old vendetta .
You can either do the assassinations and get some caps , or dig a little deeper and find out what the " special things " are for and maybe get the " treasure " for yourself , one that 's sure to put a smile on any Fallout fan 's face .
Every assassination target brought you to an interesting place and had at least two additional ways of " handling " instead of killing .
These were pretty much the best quests in the game .
" Tenpenny Tower " was okay .
It offered three ways to complete the quest , but two of them were killfests , and the speech option was ... lacking .
They attempt some sort of “ consequence ” for this quest if you use the speech option , but I never would have known about it because there never was a reason for me to ever travel back to Tenpenny Tower .
Some quests are in - between , like the “ Oasis ” quest .
It has an interesting premise , sets up a moral dilemma , and has multiple solutions .
Unfortunately , the moral dilemma is killed by awful writing , and all solutions but one involve going through a dungeon filled with radcrabs .
And all but that one non-dungeon solution have very little difference , only the loot gained differs .
Everyone just kind of nonchalantly agrees to disagree or flat out agrees with what you did including the people who saw their life and home gravely threatened , people who saw an opportunity for the wastes perhaps dashed , and the “ person ” who wanted you to kill itself to avoid an eternity of pain will just shrug and essentially say “ Well , guess I was being selfish .
You did the right thing I suppose ” .
It 's that sort of lack of payoff and flawed execution that plagues most quests in Fallout 3 .
From here though , it just got worse .
Most other quests devolved into dungeon crawls .
Take the " Stealing Independence " quest .
Go into the National Archives and grab the Declaration of Independence .
Seems like it should be fun enough , and offer some cool science and stealth options .
Nope .
Go through a bunch of DC metro tunnels while killing raiders and ghouls , then fight through 2 floors of mutants , and a floor of robots to be able to use a speech check to get out of a fight with a low level robot with a little personality .
Wonderful .
And the idiocy keeps going like this , where quests devolve into boring monster hacks with a usually useless speech check at the end .
They have all this potential , and then throw it away on dungeon crawling nonsense .
They even brought back an Oblivion fan favorite quest , except instead of collecting X amounts of Magic Wine you collect X amount of Nuka Cola Quantum .
Obviously this quest is not an artificial time lengthener that exists just to drop you in more dungeons .
Even worse , quests have almost no consequences .
Even blowing up Megaton does n't close out the big quests there , as the quest giver conveniently becomes a ghoul and still offers the quest to you from a different location .
Working with Paradise Falls did n't seem to stop me from helping some escaped slaves in another quest , and I bet it would likely be the same vice versa , even though Three Dog is blasting everything you do across the Wasteland .
Karma is the only consequence of quests and is pretty much useless except for the companions who cast Detect Good / Evil on you .
Both good and evil characters get mercenaries on their tail , and I found trying to play a neutral character near impossible , as contrary to what Todd said , there are no rewards for neutral characters .
Plus karma is pretty broken seeing as your robot butler can essentially give you infinite pure water to give to beggars for Karma ++ and you can always donate caps to churches for Karma ++ because it 's not like Fallout ever had some sort of key anti-establishment tone in it or this is some tired RPG cliche that needs to be put to bed .
And evil unspeakable is only stealing a whole house full of crap away , or perhaps killing some generic Megaton citizens who will respawn in the two days it takes to forget your crimes .
So essentially , they neutered the only real consequences in their game .
The main quest is rubbish , pure and simple .
Most every quest devolves into killing , and the only virtue of it is that you can skip most of it .
It suffers also from another flaw of Oblivion , the player character is not the main character .
Just like in Oblivion , how Martin was the true " protagonist " and you were more a glorified errand boy , you basically play this same role to daddy Liam and his pet project .
Now , it 's not being a “ Chosen One ” who must stop the ancient evil , which could be seen as a progress of sorts .
Unfortunately , it 's a case of being thrown out of the frying pan into the fire as you are the Chosen One 's sidekick , who fights the mildly venerable evil .
Also like Oblivion , it ends with you watching a big thing fight other big things instead of doing some ass kicking yourself .
If I 'm going to play a game riddled with combat , at least let me feel badass about it instead of cock - blocking me .
Even in Bloodlines , when it devolved into a hackfest , my character was killing tons of stuff and wrecking house .
I get to demolish the big players who had previously pushed me around , if I so chose to , not watch Smiling Jack fight them in his Mecha Battle Sarcophagus .
But to make the climax something the player watches rather than participates in ?
What the hell , this is n't a jRPG you twats .
Oh , and the ending is pure idiocy and to add insult to injury , they did n't even bring back the ending slides .
Over 200 permutations my ass .
It 's more like one based on karma , one based on one choice at the very end , and one based on another choice at the very end .
And thus quests are basically where Fallout 3 again falls flat as an RPG .
There are too few good ones , and the rest are buried in mounds of Bethesda 's awful dungeon - crawling and terrible combat .
Exploration outside of quests is mostly pointless in my view , because the majority of locales are simple dungeon - crawls with maybe a log or a diary to put a little bit of backstory into what is likely a boring dungeon - hack with only loot and monsters .
Any place with potential typically falls flat on it's face .
Vault 106 was lauded for being an exercise in great scripting and immersion .
It turns out it 's a dungeon hack where you hallucinate a couple of times , and one of which you solve by walking forward and the other by shooting the hallucinations .
Real clever Bethesda .
Nice job throwing away a perfectly good opportunity .
Why could n't they really mess with the player ?
Like perhaps by making the Pip - Boy not function properly , make the map change , make a lot of hallucinations the player can talk with and creative stuff like this .
The Dunwich Building is just a dark office loaded with feral ghouls and Lovecraft references delivered through audio logs and terminals .
Whoop - dee - doo .
I even found the base of the Outcast faction of the Brotherhood .
I was excited about this , maybe I could get a quest to assassinate Lyons and let them take over , maybe be a diplomat between the two and negotiate a truce .
Nope .
I get a " quest " to bring any power armor or energy weapons to them for caps , ammo , or stims .
Great job blowing some serious potential Bethesda .
I even came across a huge raider settlement .
I was really excited here , so I donned some raider armor and went in , expecting to blend in , and maybe get some quests , dialogue , and lore .
Guess what happened though ?
They still went hostile .
So Bethesda makes an entire settlement , unique art assets for a lot of it , and all for what ?
A glorified kill - fest .
This type of half - assed work plagues pretty much every non-quest exploration locale .
I remember one review I had read prior to release comparing the locations you could find in a favorable way to some of the better ones in Vampire : Bloodlines and all I can say is what were they thinking ?
Nothing like the haunted hotel , the hospital ruins , or the Escher - inspired manor exists to be found in this game .
If anything , Bethesda 's locales remind me more of the bad parts of Bloodlines , like the sewers , the Palace of Infinite Ninja Vampires , and the Hallowbrook Hotel ; boring hackfests .
Sure , places like Andale and the ComSat towers are well done , as they have some real interactivity , stuff to explore , or something unique to offer , but they are islands of good awash in a sea of mediocre , time - wasting drivel .
You 've probably heard me drone on and on about " dungeon - crawling " this and that , and may be thinking to yourself " What a minute ; dungeon crawling can be fun " .
And yes , a good dungeon crawl can be fun .
But it needs two things ; good dungeons , which Bethesda does not make , and good combat .
And Fallout 3 does not do well in the combat department .
What most detracts from the combat is the awful animations , making enemies , allies , and everything else move in jerky , erratic patterns .
Now these jerky , erratic patterns make things hard to shoot , and take away from the flow of the action , fundamentally weakening the game .
VATS , essentially the aimed shot mode to placate turn - based fans , is screwy as well .
I do n't quite understand the allure of taking all the action out of an action game by letting the computer shoot for you .
It does n't even add that much of a tactical edge either .
It just seems like a cheap compromise .
Enemy design is weak as well , with little interesting ideas .
As much as I may have hated the idea of ghouls with " curative fluids " , stuff like that would have gone a long way in spicing up Fallout 3's boring cast of enemy chumps .
Because essentially , all enemies do is either follow the suicidal melee charge AI routine , or shoot stuff at you and attempt ( and usually fail ) to take cover of some sort .
There are no group tactics , there are no advanced maneuvers .
Bethesda has n't picked up any of the tricks shooters have been doing with their enemies for the past six or so years .
And essentially , these two routines only require two responses .
If it 's a melee enemy , go into VATS and unload on the legs , run back shooting while VATS recharges , and repeat as necessary .
For ranged enemies , shoot the weapon or the arm , in VATS , to disable them and go in for the kill .
You do n't really need tactics though , because Bethesda has stuffed the Wasteland with enough loot that any character who has n't been purposely gimped should have no fear , even on higher difficulties , as they can just item spam right on through .
Throw in hilariously bad AI goofs , like enemies getting stuck on cover , or cowering in front of you at low damage , and combat becomes more of a tedious joke .
Bethesda could have made combat a lot better .
Get enemies with interesting abilities .
This is a 50's SCIENCE !
setting , use some creativity .
They already butchered the canon ; they might as well add in quirky and interesting enemies even if they do n't quite fit .
Get some enemy diversity through any means .
Besides models and damage , most enemies are incredibly similar .
Molerats , mirelurks , yao guai , deathclaws , and feral ghouls all have the same mode of operation ; charge forward and lunge at you .
And those take care of almost half the encounters you end up in .
It 's just boring to fight one track enemies over and over again .
No enemies have depth , and there are n't enough variations to make up for that .
Or maybe they could also tone back on the hand - holding .
Make ammo actually have weight , so conserving shots is important and you can't merely carry one weapon for each ammo type and never have to worry about running out or having a weapon break .
System Shock 2 made combat a tense affair by giving you a very small amount of resources , making those 5 bullets you blew on a monkey something to possibly think about .
And I think it 's still kind of funny that I was more well supplied in a game about surviving in a wasteland after a nuclear holocaust , than in one where I was on a new space - ship , full of technology and supplies .
They could possibly work on updating AI , and not making this play like a 90's FPS with a goofy super - shot gimmick .
Back on that canon thing ; I do n't really want to get into this that much .
Basically , I could go on and on if I wanted to , but then it would just be a glorified fanboy rant , and nobody wants that .
Suffice to say , anyone who played the past Fallout games may have a few “ How did they get here ? ” , “ Why are they like that now ? ” and “ Godamnit I killed every last one of them in Fallout 2 and now they 're back , and even stronger ? ! ” in regards to matters of setting consistency .
What really bugs me however , and what should at least register as a bad thing in the eyes of most , is how inconsistent the game is with itself .
One moment you 're talking to a ghoul who is upset people think they 're “ zombies ” and how he explains it 's untrue and people need to understand things beyond myth , ignorance , and superstition , and the next moment you 're talking to actual vampire people who actually need bloodpacks to survive .
One moment you 're being told ( or in the main quest ; shown ) the constant danger and serious of radiation , then the next moment the Sarah Palin of the wastes is telling you to go get severely irradiated for her , and that everything will be okay .
One moment you 're told how valuable pre-war energy weapons are .
The next moment , you find one in a mailbox , or buy one for 7 caps , or find one in a shoebox , or have some ammo fall from the sky on you .
I 'm serious .
Any atmosphere Bethesda builds up is torn down by idiocy that they could n't cut out .
Oh , and lots of things are left completely unexplained ... and not little things , like why a light is on , or a computer terminal working , or why every grocery store is filled with drugs and mini-nukes , but big things , like why someone wants to blow up an entire settlement , or where the Behemoths came from .
Aesthetics are n't even that impressive , making you wonder what exactly it is this game does well .
Sure , the wasteland looks very pretty from a technical point of view , but the logic behind it does n't make sense .
Some buildings will be destroyed outright , with others in near pristine condition right next to them .
There 's also the cut and paste wooden houses with identical decay and destruction in the same areas breaking any sense of immersion .
It just does n't look like a nuclear war happened 200 years ago and it does n't seem like Bethesda put any thought into things .
Characters look better than Oblivion , but there 's a new problem in town ; many characters are markedly similar to one another .
It seems Bethesda made a few good faces , and then used them as much as possible .
I distinctly remember seeing a good deal of Amata clones , and generally felt a lot of deja vu .
Nobody had any distinctive feel , though that is a symptom of FaceGen I suppose .
Voice over work is pretty terrible , most of the casting again following the Oblivion approach and having a small group of people voice many characters , with star power playing a few big roles .
To top it off , animations for voice over are poor and unexpressive , with characters saying something with a lot of emotion accompanied by a very passive set of gestures .
Both Mass Effect , a game released a year ago , and Vampire Bloodlines , a game released four years ago destroy Bethesda 's feeble attempts in terms of making convincing digital actors with solid animations and voicework .
I guess Bethesda delivers the same thing aesthetically they always do , some nice environments that you need to turn your brain off to enjoy hiking around .
Fallout 3 also happens to be one of the buggiest , most broken games I 've seen .
It 's crashed more than Arcanum or Bloodlines ever did , I encountered a few quest - breaking bugs that made me reload from a much earlier save , and physics glitches killed two of my companions when entering a new cell .
Worst of all , I 'm playing on a 360 .... a console , and according to Todd Howard , the primary development platform .
This is inexcusable , that a multi-million dollar game , from a huge development studio , on a console , is this buggy .
Bugs come from two sources primarily ; shoddy code and testing , and the programmer 's inability to be able to predict everyone 's system specs .
Except , on a console , everyone has pretty much the same specs .
Good one Bethesda .
You made a game as buggy as Arcanum and Bloodlines ( maybe buggier ) that still is n't as good an RPG , and on a console to boot .
That 's worth an Xbox Achievement methinks .
Outside of gameplay , Bethesda butchers the Fallout canon , delivers a terrible story where your character is pushed around , writes mediocre dialogue , and generally just does n't deliver much of anything but a sandbox game full of mildly amusing timesinks to explore and a lot of wasted potential .
What it is to you depends mostly on how much mental blocks you can set up , or where your priorities lie .
You need to block out that it abandons Fallout 's setting , and much of it 's core gameplay .
You have to block out the horrendous writing and dialogue .
You have to block out all the bugs and design flaws .
And most of all , you have to pretend that calling something a “ sandbox RPG ” magically throws standards of quality out the window , and makes a game good if it just has lots of dull dungeons .
That 's what this game needs to be good , and it seems a little too much for my tastes .
I 'm left wondering what happened with this game .
They had an existing engine , an existing IP , a multi-million dollar budget , and a large pool of human resources , but nothing , save a few nuggets of greatness in the quest department , in Fallout 3 stands out as anything higher than passable .
Ultimately , Fallout 3 is more Bethesda mediocrity in the vein of Morrowind or Oblivion .
If those games tickled your fancy , you 're bound to love this game , it 's everything they do , but better .
Or maybe you can look past the flaws and have a blast with it .
I can't say I did n't enjoy parts of it , but I also can't say I was n't almost always disappointed by Bethesda 's general half - assedness .
It 's a mildly amusing timesink ; but that 's not saying much .
Ultimately , it just does n't work for me .
It flies in the face of most everything I felt Fallout 1 did so well .
Closing things off , Fallout 3 is a lot like a wasteland ; you 're searching through it looking for a little something good , something to keep you going , but to do that you have to go through a whole lot of bad and it just might not be worth it and you might not want to go on .

Miss California to Protect Traditional Marriage ; Pageant Paid for Her Breast Implants Carrie Prejean goes to Washington as pageant says it funded her breast implants .
April 30 , 2009  --
Though she missed out on the Miss USA crown , Miss California Carrie Prejean is embracing a new title : protector of " traditional marriages . "
She told NBC's " Today " show Thursday that she 's going to Washington to work with the National Organization for Marriage , saying the union between a man and a woman is " something that is very dear to my heart . "
While Carrie Prejean 's preaching her values , others are dropping bombshells about her body .
Shanna Moakler , co-executive director of the Miss California Organization , confirmed to " Access Hollywood " Wednesday that the group paid for Prejean 's breast implants weeks before she competed in the 2009 Miss USA pageant .
" It was something that we all spoke about together , " Moakler said referring to herself , Carrie Prejean and Keith Lewis , who also serves as co-executive director for the organization .
" It was an option and she wanted it .
And we supported that decision . "
The beauty queen 's family is also voicing their support for her .
More than a week after Carrie Prejean spoke out against " opposite marriage " at the Miss USA pageant , her " gay activist " sister came to her defense and lashed out at Perez Hilton , judge who questioned Prejean about gay marriage during the competition and subsequently bashed her on his blog .
" Considering what she was going through , the circumstances of being put on the spot , given such a short amount of time to think and respond … she said what she felt in her heart would be the best answer , " Christina Prejean told ABCNews.com .
" She and I have talked about this subject ; we both respect each other 's views .
I support civil unions that would give same sex couples equal , legal rights and privileges . "
At the pageant , Prejean seemed initially tongue - tied answering to Hilton 's question before saying that marriage should be between a man and a woman , drawing a mixed reaction from the audience and a look of thinly veiled disgust from Hilton .
In the days afterward , Prejean attempted to quell criticism of her conservative marriage views by saying that her sister is a gay activist .
" My sister is a second lieutenant in the Air Force and she is a gay rights activist , " Prejean told " Access Hollywood " last week , adding that Christina is not gay .
" She supports gay people , she supports gay marriage .
My beliefs have nothing to do with my sister or my mom , or whatever . "
Christina Prejean , 22 , admitted she was surprised to hear the beauty queen , 21 , call her a gay activist .
" I have never even given myself that title .
I was kind of surprised that she mentioned it , but I think she wanted to get the point across that our family is tolerant , " Christina Prejean said , adding that she only recently got involved in gay rights activism .
" A couple weeks back , I attended a public forum in Idaho about protecting the LGBT community against discrimination , " she continued .
" That was the very first thing I attended , and I told her about it on the night of the pageant , after she said she felt bad that people might be offended by her response . …
But that 's obviously such a hot topic that either way , someone was going to be offended . "
Miss California 's Sister ' Appalled ' by Perez Hilton
Christina Prejean said she is offended by Hilton 's ( real name : Mario Lavandeira ) treatment of her sister after the pageant , whom he called a dumb b**** in a video posted on his blog .
( Hilton later apologized on his blog , offering to take Prejean out for coffee and a " talk . " )
" I was disappointed and appalled by his unprofessional behavior .
He used language that 's offensive not only to my sister but to all women , " she said .
" It showed his own hypocrisy because he speaks out about how people should be more tolerant , but at the same time he puts down people who do n't share his own opinion . "
Asked to respond , Hilton said simply , " I am praying for both her and her sister . "
Since the fallout from the Miss USA pageant , Carrie Prejean , who finished as first runner - up , has defended her stance on gay marriage through the media and in church appearances , notably at San Diego 's The Rock Church , which was active in the campaign to pass a constitutional ban on gay marriages in California last year .
She was the guest of honor at morning services Sunday , where she recounted her side of the story to the congregation .
She said pageant officials counseled her to apologize , saying " ' You need to apologize to the gay community .
You need to not talk about your faith .
This has everything to do with you representing California and saving the brand , ' " she recalled .
" I was representing California .
I was representing the majority of people in California . "
Lewis , co-executive director of the Miss California Organization , responded with the following statement :
" Given the fact that Carrie Prejean 's first act upon returning to California was to headline five services at a church that promotes homosexuality as both unnatural and abnormal , we stand by our concern for her individual image and look forward to a time in the near future when she can put down her personal agenda and assume the responsibilities associated with being Miss California USA . "
Some , including " The View 's " Elisabeth Hasselbeck , have suggested Carrie Prejean might make the prefect poster child for conservative values .
Prejean 's sister agrees .
" She wants to be a role model , " Christina Prejean said .
" Before the pageant , she said she wanted to explore modeling or be a teacher for children with special needs , but she is open to political opportunities .
I know she does n't want to close the door to anything . "
And with her new role with the National Organization for Marriage , it looks like Carrie Prejean wo n't shy away from Washington .
Those of you - you poor , poor people - who read the Fedora development mailing list - were treated this week to a flamefest ( or , as it is classically referred to in the British press , ' full and frank exchange of views ' ) regarding the change to the official GNOME audio volume control applications which will appear in Fedora 11 .
The debate was expertly summarized in the latest Fedora Weekly News by Oisin Feeley .
However , I 'm going to take advantage of my little soapbox to go over it again , myself , in what will obviously be a way more biased towards the truth ( otherwise known as ' my point of view ' ) .
Here 's the central point of contention .
In GNOME 2.26 , the two programs which deal with setting the audio volume - gnome - volume - control and gnome - volume - control - applet - have been more or less rewritten .
The old gnome - volume - control looked like this :
( screenshot stolen , with apologies , from Piraja in this thread , since I do n't have a copy of the old app to hand ) .
The new gnome - volume - control looks like this :
As you can see , they 're really rather different .
The old one was more or less a classic ' big list o' sliders ' mixer , which exposed the raw mixer elements as provided by ALSA , and let you tweak them all directly .
The new application is nothing like this at all .
It 's really an interface to PulseAudio 's volume control system , which does not expose the raw ALSA mixer elements to you at all .
What you get is a single volume slider .
Slide it up , things get louder .
Slide it down , things get quieter .
You do n't have to look at twenty different sliders and wonder what the hell they all do any more .
In many cases , this is great .
The basic idea - that the default volume control application should not expose every little element of control available on your sound card , but make it easy to turn the sound up and down - is a good one .
The Pulse - based system also enables some other neat stuff , like letting you pick which sound ' card ' ( including things like USB headsets and webcams ) you want to use to play which sounds , like pavucontrol has let you do for a few releases now .
However , this extremely simplified system comes with a couple of drawbacks .
The biggest one - and it's something of a whopper - is this : you can't pick an input channel .
If you 've got multiple sound devices in your system - say , an onboard sound card , an expansion card , a webcam , and a USB headset - you can pick which device you want input to come from .
Which is nice .
But you can't pick which channel on that device you want the input to come from .
In practical terms - if you want to record ( or monitor ) from line - in , but the default is mic - in , you 're in trouble .
Ditto if you want to record or monitor from the front mic , but the default 's the rear mic .
Or vice versa .
If the ALSA default input channel is n't the one you actually use , gnome - volume - control no longer provides any way for you to switch .
This is n't some kind of braindead interface design or excessive simplification on the part of the designers .
It 's just a feature that did n't get implemented yet .
Lennart wants to do it in a reasonably smart way - only expose elements which are really ' genuine ' input channels you might actually want to select - and that 's somewhat tricky .
He 'd also like to implement jack sensing , for compatible hardware , so that when you plugged in a mic it 'd automatically get activated .
So , in future - we 're expecting around the Fedora 12 timeframe - this will get fixed .
For now , though , it is n't , and that 's a rather giant hole in the new system .
The second drawback is that Pulse 's abstraction of volume control is not yet perfect .
At present , it more or less just turns the primary mixer element - the one that shows up further to the left in a traditional mixer application - up and down .
On most cards , this is enough to give you a proper range of volume control without any other elements getting twiddled .
If you turn it up to 100 % , everything gets nice and loud ; turn it down to 0 % , and everything goes quiet .
Great .
So for most cards , the Pulse system works fine already .
However , on some cards it does n't .
On some cards , even if the ' primary ' element is at 100 % , if another element is n't raised , everything 's still really quiet .
Or even totally inaudible .
In the past , most people would notice this , fairly quickly discover that moving one of the other mixer elements sorted the problem out , and then probably forget about it .
With the new design , you can't do this .
You turn it up to 100 % , everything 's still really quiet , and you 're pooped .
The counterpart to this case exists , too - cards where , even if you set the ' primary ' element to 0 % , you can still hear sound unless another element 's turned down to 0 .
There 's even more advanced cases , like a card that has a separate channel for the rear speakers and another for the subwoofer - if you turn down the ' primary ' element , the front speakers go silent , but you still get sound coming out of the rear speakers and the subwoofer .
Which is a bit disconcerting .
This kind of bug can be fixed .
In some cases we just have to add an entry to the ALSA database of default mixer settings , so the secondary element that messes things up is set to a level so that adjusting the primary element does what we want .
In others , Pulse can be tweaked to actually control multiple ALSA elements when you drag the single Pulse slider - so , on the card with separate elements for the surround speakers and the subwoofer , moving the new " Volume " slider adjusts all three ALSA elements , and everything just gets quieter or louder as you 'd expect .
However , we have n't yet fixed all the cases we know about , and the fact that several have come to light already through Fedora 11 pre-release testing is a pretty strong indicator that there 'll be more bugs of this kind that only show up once Fedora 11 is released .
The final drawback to the new system is it simply does n't cover some less common use cases .
Some people want to play back music from a line - in or aux - in , for instance .
Aside from the input switching problem , the new gnome - volume - control also does n't let you set the monitor volume for input channels .
So , we have a radical new design which is genuinely simpler and more user - friendly than the old one , but causes some regressions due to features not yet being implemented , and bugs that have always existed becoming more important due to the simplification removing the ability to easily tweak the settings .
Sound familiar ?
Yep , it 's a situation that happens often enough in software development .
What I pushed for is , simply , a fallback mixer for Fedora 11 .
The new mixer is great , it 'll do the job for most users in Fedora 11 , and they 'll appreciate the simplicity .
However , there are going to be a significant number of users who fall foul of either the input switching problem or one of the manifestations of the ' slider does n't control the volume properly ' bug .
Until the input switching feature is implemented in Pulse and g-v-c , and most of the volume control bugs are fixed , we really need to keep providing a graphical mixer in all default Fedora 11 installations , so those who are stuck with one of these problems can fix it without recourse to the console .
This is what the flamefest was about , and - I 'm happy to say - that position pretty much carried the day .
Fedora 11 should ship with either gnome - alsamixer , or the old gnome - volume - control ( under a different name ) , installed by default alongside the new gnome - volume - control .
If the new mixer does n't do the job for you , you 'll still have a traditional graphical mixer with full access to all the ALSA elements available so you can get what you need .
If you find yourself in the position where the shiny new gnome - volume - control does n't give you a decent range of adjustment of your output volume - it's too quiet at maximum , too loud at minimum , does n't have a wide enough range , or your card has separate mixer controls for separate speakers - please file a bug in Red Hat Bugzilla ( component ' pulseaudio ' ) , and mark it as blocking the bug ' AlsaVolume ' .
This bug has a procedure to follow to provide the information necessary for the bug to be fixed .
What does this mean for users of other distributions ?
Well , I looked at Ubuntu .
I did n't actually check a Jaunty ( 9.04 ) install , but according to this bug report , it shipped with the old gnome - volume - control installed by default .
Apparently they do n't consider the new one ready for prime time yet .
The new one is available , but not installed by default , in the package gnome - volume - control - pulse .
Mandriva 2009
Spring , as far as I can tell , is shipping with the new mixer , and no fallback installed by default .
Of course , Mandriva defaults to KDE in the DVD edition and the KDE Live CD is above the GNOME Live CD in the download list , and most Mandriva users use KDE , so most MDV users wo n't notice this issue ( it really only affects GNOME , as KDE 's kmix has not been changed at all to the new simplifed Pulse interface ) .
But if you 're using GNOME on Mandriva , you might want to be aware of this issue , and be ready to install gnome - alsamixer if you need it .
For any other distribution - if your distro ships GNOME 2.26 from upstream , you 'll likely get the new mixer .
So be aware of the changes and the background , as discussed above .
If you need access to the raw ALSA mixer elements , use gnome - alsamixer or alsamixer from the command line ( you may need to use the -c and - V parameters to specify the card number you want to work on , and the ' capture ' instead of the ' playback ' view if you want to switch inputs : e.g. ' alsamixer - c0 - Vcapture ' ) .
I suspect that many professional philosophers , including ones such as myself who have no religious beliefs at all , are slightly embarrassed , or even annoyed , by the voluble disputes between militant atheists and religious apologists .
As Michael Frayn points out in his delightful book The Human Touch , the polite English are embarrassed when the subject of religion crops up at all .
But we have more cause to be uncomfortable .
The annoyance comes partly because of the strong sense of deja vu .
But it is not just that old tunes are being replayed , but that they are being replayed badly .
The classic performance was given by David Hume in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , written in the middle of the 18th century .
Hume himself said that nothing could be more artful than the Dialogues , and it is the failure to appreciate that art that is annoying .
In the Dialogues , there are three principal characters .
The first is Philo , a religious sceptic , whose voice is clearly that of Hume himself .
Cleanthes is an apologist whose stock in trade is the argument that design is evidence of the existence of a deity : the familiar argument that the delicate and wonderful adjustments of nature irresistibly point to the existence of a divine architect - all nature declares the Creator 's glory .
Finally , there is Demea , who wants the God of the philosophers : infinite , perfect , immutable , eternal or transcending space and time , incomprehensible and mysterious .
Hume 's art consists first in setting Cleanthes and Demea at each other 's throats .
Each represents an element in monotheistic religious belief , yet they can not fit together .
In some of the most humorous passages - and it is a very amusing work - Philo sides with Demea in trashing the conception of the deity available to Cleanthes , and indeed calls him little better than an atheist .
But then he sides with Cleanthes , who trashes the conception of the deity available to Demea , and in turn calls him little better than an atheist , too .
On each front , Philo wins , by two votes to one .
The two wings of theology , one making God immanent , something to be understood as analogous to ourselves , and one making Him transcendent , beyond spatio - temporal physical understanding , cannot be reconciled .
The believer has to oscillate incoherently from one to the other .
The problems with the divine architect , creating a cosmos in a manner analogous to the way humans design artefacts , are manifold and familiar .
Our own creative activities are highly dependent on the delicate adjustments of the physical world .
Our ideas are ideas of the things we come across in that world .
Human designers are dependent on parents , not self - caused or self - explaining .
Finally our aims and passions are adapted to the animal and social lives we lead .
None of this is supposed true of the divine architect .
But suppose we waive those difficulties , we still have it that human designers work in groups , refine the designs of others , sometimes lose interest in their designs , go on to make improved versions , and so on .
Cleanthes ' theology leaves it open that the world , " for aught he knows , is very faulty and imperfect , compared to a superior standard ; and was only the first rude essay of some infant deity , who afterwards abandoned it , ashamed of his lame performance : it is the work only of some dependent , inferior deity ; and is the object of derision to his superiors : it is the production of old age and dotage in some superannuated deity ; and ever since his death , has run on at adventures , from the first impulse and active force which it received from him . "
Philo rightly concludes : " I cannot , for my part , think that so wild and unsettled a theology is , in any respect , preferable to none at all . "
Demea agrees : Cleanthes is little better than an atheist .
Later in the Dialogues , Cleanthes gets another bout in the ring , when the moral attributes of the deity come into play .
But this only bruises him further , for it is obviously absurd to advance a perfectly benevolent , all - powerful and all - knowing architect as the best explanation of the spotty and often appalling course of human and animal lives .
We cannot infer from the way of the world a deity that has any preference for good over evil , any more than for heat over cold or day over night .
So then we turn to Demea 's transcendental conception of the deity .
But this outruns any analogy to those things of which we have experience , and which therefore provide the origins of our ideas .
We cannot understand how anything could be necessarily existent , beyond time , immutable yet active .
Since we have no idea of what the property of being necessarily existent in this way might be , then for all we can understand it might as well belong to the whole given cosmos as anything else .
Some might suggest that the world of abstract mathematical objects provides an example of the kind of existence needed , but most philosophers hold on to Gottlob Frege 's insight that numerals are adjectives rather than nouns .
They deny there is a " world " of mathematical objects in any relevant sense .
And even if we were to talk that way , it would give us no usable concept of a deity .
The number 4 is not on the face of it a source of moral and political authority , or an actor in the world 's affairs , or the target of prayers or the source of consolation , although it has as much claim to be the sustaining ground for the ongoing order of nature as anything else we can try to imagine .
Cleanthes agrees : Demea can say nothing intelligible about his deity , and this makes him little better than an atheist .
So is Hume himself an atheist ?
The word does not fit , and he never described himself as such .
He is much too subtle .
Philo the sceptic says that we cannot understand or know anything about a transcendent reality that explains or sustains the ongoing order of nature , while theists such as Demea say that we cannot understand or know anything about the transcendent reality , which is God , that explains or sustains the ongoing order of nature .
Since the inserted clause does not help us in the least , the difference between them is merely verbal .
And this is Hume 's conclusion .
At the end of the Dialogues , the little boy , Pamphilius , who is present as an auditor , says that Cleanthes ' arguments appealed to him most , and even Philo , surprisingly , makes some apparently complimentary remarks about the design argument , provided it has a completely undefined conclusion .
Some commentators have rather flat - footedly thought that this was some kind of recantation on Hume 's part .
But of course it was n't .
It was a supreme piece of his habitual irony .
Since by the end neither Cleanthes nor Demea can defend any usable conception of a deity , it matters not in the least whether you are drawn to say that " it " exists or to deny it .
There is no inference to be drawn about anything - moral , political , empirical or theoretical - from either the assertion that " it " does or " it " does not .
Joining in on either side equally implies that we know what we are talking about , and the right philosophical attitude is just to laugh at persons who suppose that .
Hume elegantly sidesteps the common charge that dogmatic atheism is just as much a " matter of faith " as faith itself .
You cannot make that claim against someone whose mocking irony is careful to issue no " ism " at all .
He also escapes the debating point that atheism is " parasitic " on religious belief .
A contented absence of belief is no more parasitic on what is absent than the absence of crocodiles in England is parasitic on them being there , although it is also true that you could not laugh at faiths without them being there to laugh at .
But it is also wrong to call Hume an agnostic .
That would imply a definite question about which we do not know the answer .
But since there is no definite question at stake , that too lapses .
Hume knew that he was unlikely to be understood .
He also knew that the interesting questions now shift to the study that he pioneered in The Natural History of Religion : the comparative study of religious practices and the psychological and social mechanisms that give rise to them , and that they articulate .
The interesting questions surround the anthropology of activities such as drama , dance , music , rituals and ceremonies .
Here the question of belief subsides , and the focus turns to what Ludwig Wittgenstein called the " stream of life " that issues in these doings .
There is no doubt that these doings and sayings have a function , for good or ill .
They may express hope or fear , safety in the universe or unease at its harshness ; tribal solidarity and hostility to others ; or universal benevolence and brotherly love .
Since religious practices are those of ordinary people , they inherit both the best and the worst sides of human nature .
According to Hume , all human beings have " some particle of the dove kneaded into our frame , along with the elements of the wolf and the serpent " , and even Christians are human .
Some of their music , architecture and poetry is rather good , some parts less so .
Bad things happen when people decorate their bare , inchoate , unstable and inconsistent imaginings with the baser trappings of their culture .
They come out of the fog bearing ludicrous beliefs about cosmology or biology , or carrying their envies and fears , their embarrassments about sex in general or certain varieties in particular , their desire to steal some land or make war on their neighbours .
Deities then become dangerous , megaphones through which emotions are whipped up and particular moral demands are given a spurious authority .
People need prophets and priests to carry the megaphones , and they are often supposed to signal their rapport with the deity by making remarkable things happen .
Hume also completely destroyed the reasons for believing in any such revelation and signal of revelation in the other prong of his scepticism : the devastating argument against belief in the testimony of miracles .
This strips away any pretension to special authority , and then we can go on to test the moral injunctions in their own terms , standing on our own feet .
The scandal is when the forum for debate , such as the House of Lords , is stacked with one set of devotees , with the kind of result witnessed in its defeat of Lord Joffe 's Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill .
The upshot ought to be not dogmatic atheism , but sceptical irony .
Of course , the latter is just as infuriating to those making special claims to authority , perhaps more so .
Men and women of God may find it invigorating and bracing to meet disagreement , but even benevolent mockery is mockery .
They would find that it is much harder to bear the Olympian gaze of the greatest of British philosophers .
Scammers
Suddenly a sense of panic overtook him when he realized :
You still have to pay for internet connections in 2027 .
Alt - Text : Apparently there 's a lack of interest in Sci-Fi novels in 2027 , which causes writers to turn to internet scams .
As everyone is now aware , defeat in the Spectrial did not lead to the closure of The Pirate Bay .
Now , after being able to download hundreds of their own albums via the site , the record company plaintiffs from the case want action , and have applied to the court to issue fines to the defendants for every day they continue to infringe copyright .
Despite a resounding court defeat against the combined might of the music and movie industries , The Pirate Bay continues to operate – at any given moment there are in excess of 20 million peers connected to the tracker .
In any event , the verdict is subject to appeal and could drag on for years yet .
The music industry plaintiffs from the case , Universal , EMI , Sony and Warner , have had enough of this situation and through their lawyer Peter Danowsky , have applied to the court requesting it starts imposing additional fines on three of the defendants for as long as they continue to infringe their copyrights .
According to DN.se , the application to the district court describes The Pirate Bay as an “ infringing service ” .
The plaintiffs claim that they have been able to download 467 music albums to which they own the copyright , via The Pirate Bay .
Because of this , the record companies have demanded that the operators of The Pirate Bay – Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi – take steps to ensure that it is impossible for Internet users to download any of the works to which they own the copyright , using The Pirate Bay .
Additionally , in what appears to be an attack on The Pirate Bay ’s bandwidth supplier , the plaintiffs are demanding that the ISP ‘ Black Internet ’ stops providing services to The Pirate Bay .
Worryingly , the application also asks the court to start applying the requested financial penalties before the District Court actually rules on it and that the four defendants should n’t be allowed to comment .
IT security expert André Rickardsson told DN.se that he was surprised the record companies have asked for The Pirate Bay operators to be fined ;
“ Swedish law applies in Sweden and their Internet service is n’t even in Sweden , ” he said .
“ I do n’t understand why the district court has anything to do with this .
The Pirate Bay operates in countries where the activity is permitted . ”
“ They are acting like a bull in a china shop and this is n’t going to generate any sympathy for them in the matter . ”

For 15 minutes around sunset on two days this summer , the sun will set in exactalignment with the cross streets of Manhattan ?s street grid , making the city ?
stowering buildings function something like a modern - day Stonehenge .
They callit Manhattanhenge .
The firstManhattanhenge opportunity comes this weekend : On Saturday ( May 30 ) at 8:17 p.m.EDT
the ball of the sun will be half above the horizon , half below if you lookwest down a major cross-street ( 34th Street and 42nd Street are good viewing locations ) .
On Sunday , May 31 , the entire solarsphere will be visible just above the horizon at 8:17 p.m. EDT .
The secondopportunity comes later in the summer , with another half - sphere sunset on Sunday , July 12 , at 8:25 p.m. EDT and a whole - sphere viewing on Saturday , July 11 , at 8:25 p.m. EDT .
These timesare calculated every year by the astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson , director ofthe Hayden Planetarium in New York , who coined the term " Manhattanhenge . "
The " henge " comes of course from Stonehenge , the prehistoric monument in the Salisbury plains of England .
The largestructure of stones and earthen mounds is thought to be a burial ground that wasoriented to face the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset .
Manhattan 's street grid does n't rungeographically north to south , but instead aligns itself with the direction ofthe island .
If the grid did run north - south , Manhattanhenge would fall on the springand autumn equinoxes , the only two days during the year when the Sun risesdue - east and sets due - west .
( The equinoxes occur when the sun sits directlyover the Earth 's equator and the length of day and night are roughly equal . )
Because Manhattan ' sgrid is rotated 28.9 degrees east from geographic north , the days ofalignment with the cross streets are also shifted .
Manhattan 's street grid was laid down by the Commissioners ' Plan of 1811 , which was adopted by the New York State Legislature .
New York is n't the only city that can haveits own " henge " events :
Any city crossed by a rectangular grid hasdays where the setting Sun aligns with the streets .
But a clear view of thehorizon and straight streets are needed , and New York might be the only citythat fits the bill .
In a press conference held today during the IRTA tests at Jerez , Vito Ippolito , the president of the FIM , and Carmelo Ezpeleta , CEO of Dorna , announced a series of measures aimed at cutting costs in MotoGP .
More details to follow , but here are the rule changes :
At the end of the 2009 season , teams will only be allowed to use 5 engines for the last 7 races .
This leaves the previous rule unchanged , answering speculation that the number of engines could be reduced after the Hungarian MotoGP round was dropped from the calendar , which would have meant 5 engines having to last for 8 races .
For 2010 , each rider will have 6 engines to last the entire 18 race season .
The engines will be sealed , and Dorna will be able to monitor remotely which engines are being used as the riders exit the pit lane .
The penalty for any infraction of this rule is that the rider will be docked 10 points from his championship points total .
The manufacturer will also have 10 points deducted in the manufacturer standings , regardless of whether the rider was on a factory bike or a private bike .
Testing will be limited to 8 days in total next year , with just 2 tests during the season after the races at Catalunya and Brno .
As of 2010 , only one bike per rider will be permitted .
Teams will be allowed to scrutineer one machine for each rider .
If a rider damages a chassis , a replacement chassis will have to be offered for technical inspection .
Friday is under discussion .
Talks are still ongoing about whether the Friday afternoon practice session will be dropped .
Wheel rim widths are to be limited to two different sizes for front wheels , and one different size on the rear .
Only 5 technicians will be allowed to touch the bike during practice sessions .
Once practice sessions are over , more people will be allowed to work on the bike , but this number will be limited to 5 during practice .
The minimum weight will be increased by 2 kg for all engine configurations .
In 2010 , no rider eligible for Rookie of the Year will be allowed to go straight to a factory team .
Instead , they will have to go to a private or satellite team for at least one year , after which they will be eligible to join a factory team .
On the Moto2 series , the MSMA had put forward a proposal to turn the series into a spec engine series .
The MSMA felt this would be the best way of preventing costs spiralling out of control , by basically removing the pressure of competition , leaving the teams free to focus on chassis development .
~ UPDATE ~
Mike Webb , technical director for MotoGP , clarified the rules on wheel rim width for us .
" It was a spot of poor translation , " he told us , when we asked about the wheel rim widths .
The information published earlier that the rim width would be limited to two inches on the front and three on the rear was incorrect .
It is the quantity of permitted widths which has been limited , not the width itself .
I ’d like to start by apologizing to the fine people of Minnesota … but really how could you send this woman to Washington ?

Just what is chiropractic , and do the claims of chiropractors stand up to scrutiny ?
( Image : Aslaug Snorradottir / Rex Features )
FOR many people , chiropractic appears almost mainstream .
Some chiropractors even call themselves “ doctor ” .
In the UK , chiropractors are regulated by statute , and in the US they like to be seen as primary care physicians .
It is therefore understandable if people hardly ever question the evidential basis on which this profession rests .
The origins of chiropractic are surprising and rather spectacular .
On 18 September 1895 Daniel Palmer , a “ magnetic healer ” practising in the American Midwest , manipulated the spine of Harvey Lillard , …
Well this is the wrap up !
By Ganesha ’s prehensile trunk and gorgeous plump belleh , this shit is EPIC .
Thanks for reading along , and thank you Andrea Plaid for her remarkably open mind and thoughtful questions .
If you are just jumping in , STOP .
STOP RIGHT NOW !
I fuckin’ mean it and go back and read the first three parts of this interview .
If you do not read ’em in order , may the fleas of a thousand dromedaries nest in your pubes .
For , like a month .
Andrea Plaid : Last of my questions ( again , we touched on it , but for the record ) :
How can we move the conversation within our communities so we can talk about BDSM and race play as sexual / erotic possibilities ?
Mo : Yeah .
there is the rub
Mo : First off : people who do play this way have to come out of the closet .
Mo : Until players stand up , there will be a continued marginalization .
Mo : and that there is the easy part .
Mo : the harder part is having people within the community put down the “ Us vs. Them ” thing .
Mo : it ca n’t be all about being apart from our desires because they are scary .
Mo : there has to be room in the dungeon for everyone ’s emotional play .
Mo : every person who is ashamed of their desires is anther person we damage indirectly with our scathing commentary and harsh judgments
Andrea Plaid : or the desires may make “ those folks ” think you ’re fulfilling stereotypes .
Mo :
Whether or not you are fulfilling stereotypes , this is beside the question .
I know this is nuanced , but it is critical .
All stereotypes are based on facts and observations that have been bred and fed to damage and wound and kill .
Mo :
If you take that snarling dog , that offensive beast , and tame it to your own ends , you win .
Andrea Plaid : dig it .
Mo : the hardest part is taking yourself out of your comfort zone .
Mo : thinking differently .
Andrea Plaid : to talk about kink and BDSM and race play if not do it .
Mo : Yes .
and to listen to those who are dumb enough to expose themselves to threats and ostracization and loss of friends and ridicule and psychological dissection . ;-)
Mo : who is more racially sound ?
the person who melts down and freaks out and blows up because someone calls them a nigger ?
Mo : or the person who , on hearing that epithet , knows that they have been given the gift of information ?
Mo : Knowing that an ugliness has been revealed , and now you can act accordingly ?
Mo :
Those words do n’t control me anymore .
Mo : I am not immune to racism .
But I ’ve been inoculated , ad my soul can fight off that spiritual infection
Mo : dig it ?
Mo : I think THAT is overcoming .
Andrea Plaid : I think i can get to that .
Mo : roll credits .
Mo : heh
Andrea Plaid : I ’m just bummed that my analysis on Ciara as a sub was off .
Andrea Plaid : dang it !
Mo :
It is n’t off .
Mo :
That is the thing
Mo : it can be so many things
Mo : people paint onto it what they want .
Mo : Listen , seriously .
Mo : I had a woman come up to me after one of my race play classes and tell me a scene I was in years ago was one of the first scenes she ever saw
Andrea Plaid : really ?
Mo : and of course , being me and one of my Favourite Soulless Sadists , it was very intense
Mo : she said to me she had n’t been “ prepared to see that . ”
Mo : and after so many years s an activist , etc , she was shocked and dismayed to see a white man tying up and beating down a black woman .
Mo : that this is a “ difficult thing to see , ” yadda .
Like she felt she should have been warned or something .
Mo : ( mind , I DO talk about alerting bystanders , via the dungeon monitors , if you are planning extreme play . )
Mo : the thing is this
Mo :
That dominant DOESN ’T DO RACE PLAY .
Andrea Plaid : Really ?
Mo :
It was a straightforward fuckin’ rope scene with whips and shit
Mo : she SAW a race play scene .
Mo : I have NO control over that .
Andrea Plaid : got it !
Mo : I do race play BY DEFAULT in the eyes of most people
Mo : * shrug *
Mo : this was very illustrative of the level of complexity
Mo : David tying and suspending a black woman became a transgressive act in and of itself .
Mo : bring in the whip and boy howdy , it is over
Mo : which is hilarious , frankly .
Andrea Plaid : much in the same way , I read Ciara as a sub just because she was ostensibly in the leash .
Mo : Dommes can wear collars too .
Mo : Again , choice .
Andrea Plaid : even though she had control of the video and she and JT negotiated the whats –including the kinky scenes –beforehand .
Mo :
If you want to get really subtle , watch the video and see if she is ever in a subordinate position and NOT looking in the camera .
Mo : the show is n’t for him .
it is for the viewer .
Andrea Plaid : he ’s just a prop , as my bro Arturo said .
Mo : yes , he is .
Andrea Plaid : you ’re right–when Ciara ’s in a sub position , she ’s looking at the camera .
Mo :
My but he is excellent at drawing down controversy on his pointy little head , is n’t he .
Andrea Plaid : LOL
Mo : I ai n’t been in the biz 35 years for nothing !!!
Mo : I see that shit !!!!
Andrea Plaid : so , Ciara ’s a sub for the camera and a domme for Justin … .hmmmm .
Mo :
We are the voyeur in their fantasy .
Andrea Plaid : I hear it from several sides : you ’re not “ Black enough , ” you ’re not “ feminist enough … ” blah blah blah .
Mo : yeah .
Andrea Plaid : I mean people assume , by my handle , that i’m soooo domme .
but I ’m like , no .
I ’m not .
I like getting spanked and tied up , not spanking and tying .
Mo : because doing the toughest fucking thing you can possibly do , which is swim against the tide , is n’t “ enough ”
Mo : People make assumptions .
I try to ask .
Andrea Plaid : exactly .
Mo : I have been skirting posting about race play
Mo : because I was all “ Ugh I do n’t wanna be the goddamned poster child ”
Mo : but hey , look !
Mo : I ’m becoming the goddamned poster child !
Mo :
It also helps that I have 3 different people I feel comfortable doing these scenes with .
Mo : it had been feeling very much like a vacuum for a few years now
Andrea Plaid : I bet .
Mo : so now a bit better
Andrea Plaid : and I ’ve discovered and come to grips with my wee kink for a while now .
and I ’m slooooowly incorporating it into my life .
I had to admit that I was a sub .
Mo : that is a tough one , huh ?
Mo : I read “ Screw The Roses ” and the fact that there was ONE black female sub interviewed in there gave me hope .
Andrea Plaid : I ’ll check it out .
Mo : Strangely the most recent addition to my stable went ahead and bent one of my cardinal rules about doing those scenes .
Mo : Slippery fucker .
Andrea Plaid : oh ? what happened ?
Mo : Oh !
* lol * he asked me if I needed a demo top for my class .
Mo : and I was all “ Uh .
You know this is my race play class , right ? ”
Mo : and of course he did .
Andrea Plaid : errrrmmm …..
Mo : and inside I was like “ OMG hell yeah . ” because I wanted to play with this guy .
Mo : and we ’d had one of those “ Oh , yeah , instant soul family ” deep level connections .
Mo : but it took me by surprise because I WASN ’T offended upset or shocked .
Mo :
It was like “ Oh , of course .
Thank you . ”
Andrea Plaid : and any other time you ’d be like , “ WTF ? ”
Mo : EXACTLY
Mo : but he ’s tuned in enough to know it was OK for him to ask .
Mo : I hate / love it when they get in your head like that .
Mo :
It took balls on his part .
Andrea Plaid : now let me get this right : it ’s wrong to ask because … .
Andrea Plaid : ( I know : totally naive question )
Mo : FOR ME , I feel it is wrong to ask because I now know you want this specific thing , and I have to trust that you do n’t have creepy ass motives .
Andrea Plaid : got it .
Mo : and for me , it is important for me to suss the person out without this in their head or my head
Mo : I need to just feel them emotionally .
Mo : straight neutral .
Mo : THEN if the thought occurs to me “ Hey … they might be kinda good with that … ”
Mo : then I drop the hankie , as it were .
Andrea Plaid : instead of just assuming you ’d be down with they ’re playing with you .
Mo : I do n’t like that assumption .
Mo : …. except when I do .
Mo : * sigh *
Andrea Plaid : so …what happened ?
Mo :
What happened was it was off the fucking HOOK .
Andrea Plaid : I think I ’m getting it …it ’s an assumption about you ’re not being indiscriminate about how who you ’d play with .
Mo : right .
Mo :
If you assume that I ’ll do THAT with you , I kind of use that as a litmus test
Andrea Plaid :
It ’s like , “ I ’d know you ’re into it , and I ’m into it , so I know you want me ( strange person off the streets ) to play with you . ”
Andrea Plaid : and your reaction is , “ Ummmm … do I know you like that ? ”
Andrea Plaid : “ just because I ’m into race play does n’t mean i wanna play with * you * . ”
Andrea Plaid : got it .
Mo : EXACTY .
Mo : and I stress that really really hard when I teach .
Andrea Plaid : you need to .
Mo : for the fact is most POC do n’t wanna go there .
Andrea Plaid : yep .
Mo : so to my critics I say “ Look , this is the alpha and omega when I present . ”
Andrea Plaid : you mean the POC that race play ?
Mo : No. to POC who do NOT think it is OK .
Their position is well diagrammed in my presentations .
Mo : so their position is well represented .
Really .
Mo :
Now excuse me while this white guy ties me up and slices my clothes off .
Andrea Plaid : no you did n’t !
Mo : Oh yes
Mo : yes , he did .
Mo : rotflmbbao
Andrea Plaid : got it .
it ’s the same argument folks on the racialicious threads tried to present : “ Ciara and JT have declared open season on interracial kink !
those bastards ! ”
Mo : good for them .
Mo : sex is sexy .
Mo : is is sometimes fucked up .
Mo : and that is also sexy .
One of the many mysteries during the week of Katrina was the absence of military help .
I picked up on this in the column I wrote during that time :
Even military resources in the right place were n’t ordered into action .
“ On Wednesday , ” said an editorial in The Sun Herald in Biloxi , Miss. , “ reporters listening to horrific stories of death and survival at the Biloxi Junior High School shelter looked north across Irish Hill Road and saw Air Force personnel playing basketball and performing calisthenics .
Playing basketball and performing calisthenics ! ”
One thing I remember about that time was the smear campaign carried out against anyone who suggested that the federal effort was inadequate .
In particular , any suggestion that the military was n’t doing its part was — you guessed it — denounced as an unpatriotic attack on the honor of our troops .
And now we know the truth .
The military was n’t doing its part , because Donald Rumsfeld refused to deploy troops until almost a week after Katrina hit .
Sorry , this one was moved !

Lego .
Concentration Camp , 1996
Set of 7 boxes of LEGO bricks , different sizes Each box contains a set of bricks , that can be used to build the element of a concentration camp as shown on the box .
All elements in the sets as well as those depicted on the boxes have either been taken from the mass - produced sets of LEGO bricks , or have been slightly altered by the artist .
The prisoners are played by smiling skeletons from the " Pirate " set , while slightly modified figurines from the " Police Station " set appear as tormenters .
We also encounter the captain of the camp and the psychopathic doctor , conducting experiments on prisoners .
Libera says : " Initially , I was considering building a Soviet gulag , but that did n't work - it failed to refer to the images I 've had in my head and did not communicate my ideas .
My intention was to reflect on rationalism and education . "

Christus ist Mein Leben , 1990
The piece was first exhibited at the exhibition " Bakunin in Dresden " , Kunstpalast Duesseldorf ( 1990 ) .
Made on the basis of an earlier drawing , the work provides a reflection on the new , in the polish reality of that time , mixture of religion and capitalism .
Nut , 1985
series of 5 photographs , silver gelatin print , total dimensions : 40 x 150 cm
One of series of photographs taken by the artist in 1980s in Lodz , but exhibited for the first time 20 years later , at a show in Raster ( 2006 ) .
Libera says : " During the martial law the city services and the police would clean the streets erasing all writings and posters , particularly those distributed by underground organizations .
I have noticed however , that small papers , covered in handwriting and usually hung at bus stops , electricity poles , etc. were ignored .
I do n't know who wrote them , but I 'm sure it was the work of one man - " some crazy person " .
The papers interested me as an example of activity so marginal , that it did n't even disturb the authorities or attract the attention of other services . "
Body Master , 1994 - 1997
two devices , size 115 x 46 x 71 cm each , two advertising posters
One of the first " Correcting Devices " by Libera .
Two body - building devices and an advertising poster , adjusted to the body size of 7 - 9 years old boys .
Fully functional , modeled on authentic devices , the only difference being very light weights here made from paper .
This toy replicates an actual body - building machine , but the only thing that can be trained here is the child 's psyche .
The work was conceived in two versions , the first , prototype , is currently in the collection of the Center for Contemporary Art , Warsaw .
Girl , 1994
pencil on paper , 40 x 62 cm
Delivery Bed. Play Kit for Girls , 1996
Three delivery beds for girls adjusted to the body size of 7 - 9 year old girls .
Libera speaks about this as well as other works from the " correcting devices " series : " Those were supposed to be objects using the aesthetics of persuasion .
Not only aesthetic , that is meant to be looked at , but truly functional in the sense of having the same potential as they have in reality .
I was interested by the way objects affect us and mould us .
What influence do toys have on children ?
I was considering the fact how a functional aspect of well - known objects could possibly be discredited ?
It came to me this could be achieved by disruption .
By building an almost identical , persuasive object and using the same aesthetics and technology .
It should work in a similar way , yet somewhat differently , as if it was genetically engineered .
I wanted to inject an internal " virus " which would disjoin the object and the domain in which it operates . "
Ken's Aunt , 1994

You Can Shave The Baby , 1995
10 dolls in cardboard boxes , [ 10 x ] 55,9 x 20,3 x 25,4 cm
Hermafrodyta , 1986
series of 24 photographs , silver gelatin print , total dimensions : 120 x 240 cmm Series of video stills from a film destroyed by the artist in fear of the Polish special police ( UB ) : " Then came the time , it was two years after I was released from prison , when I started having those visits again .
I was afraid of being charged with pedophilia or sexual harassment .
This is why I have destroyed the film .
But since I felt so sorry for doing it , as I thought it was very good - I took some photos .
The film itself was created accidentally .
Children of my friends would often visit my mom's flat .
Since I had a video camera I often plugged in closed circuit , so that the TV would be connected directly with the camera , and the children played with it .
" Hermaphrodite " was a result of one of those spontaneous actions - an extraordinary children 's dance to the music by Nina Hagen " .
Somebody Else , 1988
3 photographs , silver gelatin print , 30 x 40 cm each Series of Libera 's self - portraits employing the - unknown in Polish art at the time - queer genre , and at the same time , referring to the classical photographs of Claude Cahun .
Positives , 2002 - 2003
Series of staged photographs , printed and reproduced photographically Series of photographs restaging the famous historical press photos in a " positive version " - repeating the original in terms of composition , but changing the characters and the general meaning of the captured events .
" The series is another attempt at playing with trauma " Libera comments , " we are always dealing with memorized objects , not the objects themselves .
I wanted to employ this mechanism of seeing and remembering and touch upon the phenomenon of memory 's afterimages .
This is how we actually perceive those photographs [ " Positives " ] - the harmless scenes trigger flashbacks of the brutal originals .
I have picked the " negatives " from my own memory , from among the images I remembered from the childhood . "

The book consists of 63 chapters - this is the number of days the Warsaw Uprising lasted - while each chapter consists of one - page photograph and one page of text .
Libera has prepared a series of illustrations to the text by Darek Foks - collages combining the war scenery and faces of woman film stars from the 1930's to 1970 's appearing as liaison officers .
" The non-camera technique I have employed " says Libera , " seems to match the technique Darek used for writing .
The proper text appeared after I have presented him with sixty - three pictures of liaison officers . "
La Vue , 2004 - 2006
series of 9 color photographs , 100 x 150 cm eacha Series of photographs taken with a traditional , analogue camera with macro lens .
It depicts images , almost like abstract landscapes , created between the pages of glossy magazines or photo albums .
The title of the series " La Vue " has been taken from the novels of the french experimental writer Raymond Roussel ( 1877 -1933 ) whose exceptional literary method became an inspiration for Libera .
Just like in the case of Roussel " the language writes itself " , in the case of Libera we see the process of seeing itself , however both here and there we are offered a surprising journey into the world of which we were not aware so far

Judging from the number of blog posts that have been generated in response to the New York Times article titled In Finland , Nuclear Renaissance Runs Into Trouble , some people have never heard of the concept of learning curves or been involved in a project where everyone is inexperienced at the specific task they are assigned .
People who have been involved in the development of any new product or construction project have different attitudes , but most of them do not write anti-nuclear blogs or produce slanted articles in major news media outlets .
For people who have been through the pain of a first of a kind ( FOAK ) and seen it through to work out the bugs and move into steady state production , is is never surprising that the first one takes at least 2 times as long as initially guessed and that the final cost is 20 - 200 % larger than initially budgeted .
There are always lessons to be learned , mistakes to be made , and people to be either trained or fired .
The reward comes once the learning has been accomplished and implemented ; costs come down , schedules get shorter and more predictable , and people sometimes forget just how hard it was to get started .
For those of you who have never been involved in a large construction project , you can still understand the concept of learning curves if you simply think about ever time that you have developed a new skill or become proficient at a new task that applies already existing skills .
If you make furniture in your garage , you will understand the value of refining your facility layout can affect your ability to produce quality work in a reasonable period of time .
If you bake and decorate cakes , you will understand how important it is to practice your flowers and to learn the best order for filling your icing bags and keeping the tips clean and ready .
Now take those small examples and think about a construction project that requires the labor inputs from as many as 4,000 site workers speaking a variety of languages and building a reactor design that has never before been completed .
Lay on top of that challenge a regulatory agency that has never inspected a project of similar magnitude and stir in a cadre of engineers who need to keep interrupting progress in order to tweak their new design .
There is no surprise and no news here ; the Olkiluoto cost and schedule challenges have been known for at least a year .
In fact , if the first EPR project had gone smoothly and kept to its schedule , that would have been the man bites dog news story .
I am not blindly defending Areva nor making excuses .
Not all FOAK projects get the opportunity to progress down a learning curve because the project backers either lose patience , run out of money or do a post project analysis that tells them there is just not enough margin for improvement to ever make that particular design a success .
( I do not think that is the case here , by the way .
It looks to me like Areva is well managed , has patient and experienced decision makers , and is taking good notes at its EPR construction sites so they can avoid making the same errors on the next plants that are built . )
There are reactions that are more interesting and telling than those of the anti-nuclear bloggers like Wasserman and Romm , two people whose resumes indicate more experience in spinning words than in laying concrete , welding pipes or producing any physical product .
For example , there are a number of consortia in Finland who are actively seeking permission to build the country 's sixth reactor ; the technically educated and experienced people running those organizations are apparently not fazed at all by the cost and schedule challenges at Olkiluoto .
The success that Areva has had in continuing to line up partners and customers even after the problems at Olkiluoto surfaced are also evidence that the technical community is viewing the lessons learned as a way to improve , not as evidence that the chosen path is incorrect .
My buddies who serve in the Marine Corps have a saying that is an appropriate mantra for repetition by decision makers associated with an FOAK project - " That which does not kill you makes you stronger . "
Translating that for project managers , the mantra becomes - " That which does not bankrupt you makes you better the next time . "
One more thing - the concept of learning curves is one reason why I am a big proponent of smaller projects .
They offer the opportunity for quicker learning and application of those lessons to the next project .
They also offer the opportunity to scale the system so that the work force that does the learning can remain intact and supply a world wide market from fixed factory locations ; that is much more difficult for site built facilities with a mobile work force .

When Gary was first hired at an aircraft component repair company , one of his first duties was to add functionality to their Oracle 11i based application that would " automatically add mods " to the system .
As Gary soon learned , a " mod " referred to the work that needed to be performed on particular piece of equipment for maintenance or repair .
Because the company specialized in a fairly specific type of components ( multimedia ) , the steps to perform the work were fairly consistent :
1 ) Remove any certifications or other affixed notices ; 2 ) Remove field - serviceable access panels 3 ) Remove factory - serviceable panels ; ... ; 18 ) Replace joints with new silicone glue ; etc .
This worked out well as , due to federal regulations , all modification steps taken needed to be recorded in the equipment 's recertification file .
To represent this in their application , a user would enter a comma-separated list of numbers in the " Related Modification Steps " field .
However , since a piece of equipment could have anywhere from a handful to several dozen mods done to it , the field accepted " shorthand " input to represent a range of numbers .
For example , entering " 1 - 6,8 " would represent the same steps as " 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 " .
Upon saving the repair order , the " mods " string would then be used to add data to a linking table associating the repair order with the pre-defined repair steps .
What a great first assignment !
Gary thought as he went searching for the value set responsible for validating the user 's input .
He figured that the developer must have written a spiffy little PL / SQL function that would parse the string of numbers , detecting one or more ranges of numbers and take into account the occasional " one off " digit that would not be included in any range .
However , one question lingered for Gary .
Why was he assigned to write functionality to " auto - add " mod sequences when they would be auto - converted from what the user inputted in the first place ?
" Well , " Gary 's supervisor explained , " every now and then you come across a mod level that has n't been entered .
This of course means emailing one of three designated employees to add it , which means the process of logging equipment out has to be put on hold .
This can be a problem if one these employees are out of the office , or they just simply skip over the email . "
" Okaaaay , " Gary said , quizzically raised an eyebrow .
He still was n't sure exactly what his boss was referring to .
" You 'll win friends for this one ! " cheered his supervisor .
When Gary had a chance to dig in to the code , he found a clue that answered exactly he was supposed to do .
It was the monster - sized table named ALL_MODS :
Instead of parsing the " mods " string , the original developers created a table that would validate and then convert the user 's input in to the appropriate string of values .
If the user 's input was n't in the table , he'd have to ask one of the " specialists " to add the row .
The good news was that Gary would have an opportunity to write a spiffy little PL / SQL function that would parse the string of numbers .
And of course , the bad news was that this was just the tip of the iceberg .

A Guide to the Memos on Torture By THE NEW YORK TIMES
he New York Times , Newsweek , The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal have disclosed memorandums that show a pattern in which Bush administration lawyers set about devising arguments to avoid constraints against mistreatment and torture of detainees .
Administration officials responded by releasing hundreds of pages of previously classified documents related to the development of a policy on detainees .
Additional documents were released in December and January by the American Civil Liberties Union , which filed a civil lawsuit seeking to discover the extent of abuse of prisoners by the military .
Those papers are posted at aclu.org .
2002 JANUARY
A series of memorandums from the Justice Department , many of them written by John C. Yoo , a University of California law professor who was serving in the department , provided arguments to keep United States officials from being charged with war crimes for the way prisoners were detained and interrogated .
The memorandums , principally one written on Jan. 9 , provided legal arguments to support administration officials ' assertions that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to detainees from the war in Afghanistan .

25 Alberto R. Gonzales , the White House counsel , in a memorandum to President Bush , said that the Justice Department 's advice in the Jan. 9 memorandum was sound and that Mr. Bush should declare the Taliban and Al Qaeda outside the coverage of the Geneva Conventions .
That would keep American officials from being exposed to the federal War Crimes Act , a 1996 law that carries the death penalty .

26 In a memorandum to the White House , Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the advantages of applying the Geneva Conventions far outweighed their rejection .
He said that declaring the conventions inapplicable would " reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the laws of war for our troops . "
He also said it would " undermine public support among critical allies . "
RELATED SITES
 Powell 's Memo to White House ( PDF document ) FEB . 2 A memorandum from William H. Taft IV , the State Department 's legal adviser , to Mr. Gonzales warned that the broad rejection of the Geneva Conventions posed several problems .
" A decision that the conventions do not apply to the conflict in Afghanistan in which our armed forces are engaged deprives our troops there of any claim to the protection of the conventions in the event they are captured . "
An attachment to this memorandum , written by a State Department lawyer , showed that most of the administration 's senior lawyers agreed that the Geneva Conventions were inapplicable .
The attachment noted that C.I.A. lawyers asked for an explicit understanding that the administration 's public pledge to abide by the spirit of the conventions did not apply to its operatives .

In a directive that set new rules for handling prisoners captured in Afghanistan , President Bush broadly cited the need for " new thinking in the law of war . "
He ordered that all people detained as part of the fight against terrorism should be treated humanely even if the United States considered them not to be protected by the Geneva Conventions , the White House said .

A memorandum prepared by a Defense Department legal task force drew on the January and August memorandums to declare that President Bush was not bound by either an international treaty prohibiting torture or by a federal anti-torture law because he had the authority as commander in chief to approve any technique needed to protect the nation 's security .
The memorandum also said that executive branch officials , including those in the military , could be immune from domestic and international prohibitions against torture for a variety of reasons , including a belief by interrogators that they were acting on orders from superiors " except where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful . '
APRIL A memorandum from Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld to Gen. James T. Hill outlined 24 permitted interrogation techniques , 4 of which were considered stressful enough to require Mr. Rumsfeld 's explicit approval .
Defense Department officials say it did not refer to the legal analysis of the month before .

24 A letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross over the signature of Brig .
Gen. Janis Karpinski was prepared by military lawyers .
The letter , a response to the Red Cross 's concern about conditions at Abu Ghraib , contended that isolating some inmates at the prison for interrogation because of their significant intelligence value was a " military necessity , " and said prisoners held as security risks could legally be treated differently from prisoners of war or ordinary criminals .
Other Memorandums
Some have been described in reports in The Times and elsewhere , but their exact contents have not been disclosed .
These include a memorandum that provided advice to interrogators to shield them from liability from the Convention Against Torture , an international treaty and the Anti-Torture Act , a federal law .
This memorandum provided what has been described as a script in which officials were advised that they could avoid responsibility if they were able to plausibly contend that the prisoner was in the custody of another government and that the United States officials were just getting the information from the other country 's interrogation .
The memorandum advised that for this to work , the United States officials must be able to contend that the prisoner was always in the other country 's custody and had not been transferred there .
International law prohibits the " rendition " of prisoners to countries if the possibility of mistreatment can be anticipated .

Last week , after three Somali pirates holding the American captain of the Maersk Alabama were killed by US Navy SEAL snipers , Senator Dianne Feinstein of California sent a letter to President Obama .
In it she noted the danger to US - flagged commercial ships transiting the Gulf of Aden and urged Obama to “ place armed security teams on board these vessels to protect the ship and crew from pirate attacks . ”
In a press release Monday , her office quoted Feinstein as saying , “ I have listened to a lot of rhetoric and reasons for not doing this and how there must be a political solution to the ongoing crisis within Somalia .
But in the meantime , the number of hijackings continues to go up …
This is unacceptable . ”
Rhetoric indeed .
I called Feinstein ’s office several days ago for a clarification : is she suggesting that US - flagged ships carry gun-toting private security contractors ?
Today came the answer .
According to an aide , Feinstein “ is still looking at it … still learning about the issue and what our options are . ”
Translation : she has no idea .
It ’s not a response that indicates a great deal of consideration for the pros and cons of arming American merchant ships .
More likely , Feinstein was just playing the Washington game , taking advantage of low - hanging political fruit .
After all , who does n’t want to protect American crews ?
Libertarian hero Ron Paul has gone so far as to recommend the US government hire bounty hunters to chase after Somali pirates .
Piracy itself ( at least against American ships ) is a throwback to the early 19th century , so why not utilize some of the antiquated legal structures from the same period ?
Paul is calling for the US to resuscitate the principle of “ marque and reprisal , ” a provision in the Constitution that permits the federal government to hire private citizens to patrol international waters .
The fact that politicans are now breathlessly demanding armed security for commercial ships creates an irresistible opportunity for firms like Blackwater ( excuse me , “ Xe ” ) and others , who are aggressively pursuing new markets for their services .
As Dan Schulman and I reported for Mother Jones , Blackwater recently established a small office in Nairobi for the express purpose of courting new business in Africa .
Somali pirates are an obvious target .
Likewise , British firm Aegis Defence Services–mercenary Tim Spicer ’s latest project and one that has raked in big bucks in Iraq and Afghanistan–is reportedly in talks with several regional players , including Yemen and Djibouti , about establishing a “ command and control center ” to counter pirate attacks .
Spicer told the Financial Times that his firm would also be willing to place guards on ships and have them “ carry firearms with certain control measures on them . ”
What exactly those would be was not explained .
So it seems Feinstein has a decision to make : with the capacity of the US Navy already stretched , will she suggest that commercial ships take Blackwater on board ?
The takeaway line from the Gallup poll ( pdf ) on Muslims and integration in western Europe is very simple : there is no correlation between religious observance and feeling alienated from the society around you ; but this is what the society around Muslims believes .
Dalia Mogahed , executive director of the Gallup Centre for Muslim Studies , said at the report 's launch that :
If the integration debate defines people as people looking the same or thinking the same in terms of morality , then it 's natural for general public to assume Muslims are not loyal , but if the focus is widened and takes into account how people actually identify with their country and how much they identify with institutions , then it would draw a different picture .
The data would suggest that the public is getting a narrow picture of integration and thereby drawing a false conclusion .
The figures that Gallup has produced are quite startling , and apply both to beliefs and symbols .
In England , Germany and France , the three countries surveyed , Muslims are twice as likely as the general public to suppose that Muslims are loyal citizens .
In Germany and the UK , they have higher confidence in the police and the judiciary than the general public ( in France , where they are also over - represented in the prison system , they also mistrust the authorities more ) .
They are also , in all the countries surveyed , much less likely to want to live in communities made up predominantly of their own ethnic and religious population than the general public , though British Muslims are those most favourable towards the idea in Europe .
The second , startling fact , is that while almost everyone agrees that having a job is very important if you are to integrate into wider society , British Muslims place less value on both jobs and education as necessary for integration than any other group .
Even so , 70 % of them agree that finding a job is necessary to integrate , and 76 % that education is ( compared to the 95 % of German Muslims , for instance , who hold these views . )
In this light , it is frightening that the actual employment for British Muslims is only 38 % – again , a huge outlier from all the other populations surveyed .
These polls are not ideal .
The sample size , though large in absolute terms ( with 500 Muslims and 1000 non-Muslims surveyed in each country ) is not large enough to eliminate a large margin of error ( 5 % for the Muslim figures , 3 % for the general public ) so only the broadest pictures are trustworthy and some results , such as the 0 % of British Muslims apparently tolerant of homosexual acts are not to be taken literally .
The full report is available here as a pdf for anyone who wants to poke at the figures .
Within this broad and blurry picture , it is possible to see the outlines of a clear argument between the British , or multicultural , model of integration and the French , secularising one .
On some measures , the British come out worse , or at least more boorish : only half of British Muslims strongly agree that they always treat of other faiths with respect , compared to two - thirds of French Muslims ; in both cases , the figure for the general population is about 10 % higher .
Similarly , and this is surely part of the legacy of the Rushdie affair , five times as many non-Muslim as Muslim Britons feel that integration demands that people accept public comments they perceive as offensive about their faith or ethnicity .
In both France and Germany , Muslims are less sensitive and non-Muslims less keen on their right to offend .
In practice , however , 90 % of all the groups surveyed agree that they had been treated with respect all day the day before .
The French , however , are much more divided about issues of religious symbolism , and much less likely to tolerate headscarves as legitimate symbols of loyal diversity .
More than half the British public thinks that removing the veil is necessary to integrate minorities , compared to only an eights of Muslims .
But that was the only item of religiously identifying clothing which a majority of the British rejected , whereas clear majorities of the French rejected headscarves , yarmulkes , turbans and " visible large crosses " as well .
About a quarter of French Muslims also thought these were obstacles to immigration .
BEIJING — “ Ma , ” a Chinese character for horse , is the 13th most common family name in China , shared by nearly 17 million people .
That can cause no end of confusion when Mas get together , especially if those Mas also share the same given name , as many Chinese do .
Ma Cheng ’s book - loving grandfather came up with an elegant solution to this common problem .
Twenty - six years ago , when his granddaughter was born , he combed through his library of Chinese dictionaries and lighted upon a character pronounced “ cheng . ”
Cheng , which means galloping steeds , looks just like the character for horse , except that it is condensed and written three times in a row .
The character is so rare that once people see it , Miss Ma said , they tend to remember both her and her name .
That is one reason she likes it so much .
That is also why the government wants her to change it .
For Ma Cheng and millions of others , Chinese parents ’ desire to give their children a spark of individuality is colliding head - on with the Chinese bureaucracy ’s desire for order .
Seeking to modernize its vast database on China ’s 1.3 billion citizens , the government ’s Public Security Bureau has been replacing the handwritten identity card that every Chinese must carry with a computer - readable one , complete with color photos and embedded microchips .
The new cards are harder to forge and can be scanned at places like airports where security is a priority .
Karl Rove was on Greta Van Susteren 's Fox News show yesterday and complained about the Obama White House 's decision to target Rush Limbaugh , which he decried as an evil " plot " cooked up by Carville and Co. :
ROVE : Well , first of all , yes , they are making a target .
Think about this .
They have assigned a senior aide to President Obama is heading this up inside the White House , an unnamed aide .
This has clearly got Carville , Begala and Rahm Emanuel , who talk literally every day -- they have an early morning phone call .
This is clearly something that they 've concocted .
And the question that we -- there are two questions we ought to ask .
First of all , is this appropriate ?
The idea that the White House is devoting all this time and energy and effort when we 've got all this myriad problems facing the country , that they 've got senior aides in the White House gaming out how they can make Rush Limbaugh the headline in the evening news seems to me to be a little petty , small , and really inappropriate .
Bigger question is why are they doing this .
And I think the answer is , is that they decided they do n't want to have a debate about the budget .
They do n't want to have a debate about the stimulus bill .
They do n't want to have a debate about the omnibus spending bill , the $ 410 billion bill with 8,500 earmarks and it .
They do n't want to have those kind of conversations with the country or with the Republicans in the Congress , so they want to go out and phony up a fight with somebody and devote the time and energy and effort to that .
This is misdirection .
They 're trying to draw attention away from the things that the country wants to talk about and that they know they 've got a vulnerability on in order to have a conversation about Rush Limbaugh , and hopefully , delay or postpone or maybe even kick off some of the discussion that they would otherwise have on these three big issues .
VAN SUSTEREN : But you know , it 's possible that this could backfire big - time against them because the American people are focused on the economy .
I mean , you know , it 's , like , every poll that people are looking at the economy , the Dow is going down -- went up , of course , today .
But everybody 's worried about that and -- and you know , at some point , they -- I would think tactically , they 'd worry that everyone would sort of turn on them and say , you know , Forget Rush Limbaugh , whether you 're a fan or not a fan .
How about -- how about the economy ?
ROVE : Yes .
It 's petty and it's small on the part of the White House .
I mean , did n't President Obama come to Washington saying , I 'm going to change the tone ?
And here he has unleashed his attack dog in Rahm Emanuel , and he 's got Carville and Begala out there beating up on Rush Limbaugh , and for what purpose ?
I mean , you know , what 's to be served by that ?
And it 's clear that this is -- that this is the same old style politics that we grew to really dislike in the 1990s , when the White House thought everything through from a political perspective , road - tested it by running polls and focus groups and did everything with a very keen eye towards the politics of the matter , not what was in the best interests of the country .
How does this serve the country for us at this point when we 're discussing these big , vital things like the budget and health care and the stimulus bill and the omnibus spending bill -- how does it well serve the country for this little sideshow concocted in the chief of staff 's office in the West Wing ?
Not very -- not very useful .
There really is no hypocrisy like Republican hypocrisy .
There have been many discussions about the level of Machiavellian politics in the Bush White House under Rove , of course .
Some of my favorite examples :
John Dean discusses
Rove 's position :
Rove 's unique role is that he is a political guy making policy decisions for political reasons .
Decisions in the Bush White House are made not based on what is best for the public interest , rather what will get the president the most mileage with his base , and best political advantage .
Not since Nixon 's so - called responsiveness program -- which was uncovered during the Watergate investigation -- have we had such overt political decision - making .
... Both Haldeman and Ehrlichman saw the world through a political lens , and what was most likely to help Richard Nixon get reelected .
So does Rove .
Haldeman was involved with procedure ( broadly speaking , I mean who was doing what at the White House , arranging the presidential travel and appearances for maximum political benefit , and constantly mindful of the president 's image and making him look good ) , and Ehrlichman was the substance guy ( who developed domestic policies , but accounting for the political impact ) .
Rove controls both .
Nicolas Lemann 's profile of Rove :
Every White House has a political operative , but Rove has a much bigger charter than his predecessors .
He appears to have supervisory authority over the Republican National Committee .
Inside the White House , after Karen Hughes , the primary keeper of the Bush image , left , last year , her role was taken over by a protégé and former employee of Rove ’s , Dan Bartlett .
The head of the White House domestic - policy operation , Margaret Spellings , is another Rove associate from Texas .
She sees him almost every day , and Rove plays a much heavier role in domestic policy than any previous occupant of his position .
( This is not a White House in which the “ policy shop ” constantly tussles with the “ politics shop , ” as has usually been the case . )
He functions as a national personnel director for the Republican Party , hand - selecting candidates for governorships and seats in the Senate and House .
His people are widely scattered around the executive departments .
He closely supervises political fund - raising .
And , of course , the President is someone whose entire political career Rove has masterminded , beginning , if not at that memorable first meeting , then certainly years before Bush ’s first successful race for office .
...
Rove is both a fox and a hedgehog .
He is the detail man of all detail men , but he also makes a point of doing more long - term strategic planning than other political consultants .
For especially important campaigns , he produces written plans far in advance , mapping out the race in its entirety , and he ’s famous for sticking precisely to the plan no matter what .
Rove ’s main goal over the next year and a half is making George W. Bush what his father was n’t , a reëlected President — when I asked if he had mapped out the campaign , he said , “ Do n’t expect me to answer this question ” — but he is too ambitious to want only that .
The real prize is creating a Republican majority that would be as solid as , say , the Democratic coalition that Franklin Roosevelt created — a majority that would last for a generation and that , as it played itself out over time , would wind up profoundly changing the relationship between citizen and state in this country .
“ I think we ’re at a point where the two major parties have sort of exhausted their governing agendas , ” Rove told me .
“ We had agendas that were originally formed , for the Democrats , in the New Deal , and , for the Republicans , in opposition to the New Deal — modified by the Cold War and further modified by the changes in the sixties , the Great Society and societal and cultural changes .
It ’s sort of like the exhaustion of two boxers fighting it out in the middle of the ring .
This periodically happens .
This happened in 1896 , where the Civil War party system was in decline and the parties were in rough parity and somebody came along and figured it out and helped create a governing coalition that really lasted for the next some - odd years .
Similarly , somebody will come along and figure out a new governing scheme through which people could view things and could , conceivably , enjoy a similar period of dominance . ”
Karl Rove clearly wants to be that somebody , and his relentless pressing for every possible specific advantage is in service of the larger goal .
...
Every time I interviewed someone close to Rove , that person first checked with him to make sure it was O.K. to talk to me , and then , in the interview , made a point of offering a testimonial to Rove ’s deep and sincere interest in public policy .
It ’s true that Rove is far more knowledgeable about the details of government than most other political consultants .
But the idea that he performs Brookings Institution - style policy evaluations , never sullying himself with considerations of the politics of an issue , is probably a stretch ; it would perhaps be better to say that Rove is unusually adept at using government policy as a political tool — in the same way that he is unusually adept at using books as a political tool .
And last but not least , the entire U.S. Attorneys firing scandal , at which he is the epicenter -- possibly the apotheosis of the Bush / Rove White House 's politicization of every aspect of policy .
The epley maneuver is for something different ( problems with balance ) as an audiologist I should tell you to not bother with this exercise , unless prescribed by a professional .
It generally wo n't improve hearing .
Her hearing problem could have a number of causes .
She brings it up during sex , so it must be bothering her a lot ...
Although as a guy , I would have picked a better time to tell her my problems !
Best to have her go and see a doctor or an audiologist to sort it out .
Connect with old classmates , chat with friends ... now book flights on Facebook .
Delta Airlines added an application to its Facebook page today that allows customers to search for flights , book them and share them with friends without navigating away from the Facebook page .
For the first time , it seems an airline has taken customers '
Facebook interaction with air travel to a new level .
Delta and other airlines have fan pages on the social networking site , but the new Delta Facebook app is just the beginning of the airline 's expanded marketing plan that intends to be more user - friendly and interactive .
“ Our customers are spending more time online and are looking for new ways to connect with us , ” said Bob Kupbens , Delta ’s vice president of eCommerce , according to the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
“ We ’re now delivering technology where our customers are . ”
The airline posted a message on its Facebook wall earlier Thursday announcing the new Delta Ticket Window , which can be found in a new " Book a Trip " tab .
According to the AJC , Delta also redesigned delta.com and will be introducing an iPhone check - in app , as well as other methods for purchasing tickets on sites other than delta.com .
“ Unlocking the full power of social media and mobile apps is the next step for Delta , ” Kupbens told the AJC .
Ericsson and TeliaSonera have unveiled the world ’s first commercial Long - Term Evolution ( LTE ) site in Stockholm , Sweden .
According to Ericsson it is an important milestone in making the mobile digital highway a reality .
“ LTE will transform the mobile - broadband user experience , providing the ultra - high data speeds needed for services such as internet TV , mobile video blogging , on - line video games and the mobile office environment , ” said Ericsson .
The site will be part of a commercial network scheduled to go live in 2010 , bringing data rates far above what is possible in today ’s mobile broadband networks .
Ulf Ewaldsson , Vice President and Head of Product Area Radio at Ericsson , says : “ The unveiling of this site shows that LTE is no longer the story of the future ; it is the story of today .
Ericsson , as a leader in LTE development , is proud to work with TeliaSonera to bring a commercial LTE network to life . ”
Erik Hallberg , Senior Vice President and Head of TeliaSonera Mobility Services in Sweden , says : “ Being at the forefront of broadband evolution means our customers will be the first to benefit from this groundbreaking technology .
This first LTE site is a key step towards further enhancing Sweden ’s fastest mobile broadband network . ”
LTE enables high performance in terms of peak data rates , spectrum efficiency and delay , and Ericsson has already demonstrated peak rates of up to 160 Mbps .
According to the company LTE can be deployed both in new and existing frequency bands and is designed to minimize the cost of network operation and maintenance .

It is customary for Thai men to enter the monkhood for training at least once A Buddhist preacher in Thailand has announced plans for new guidelines aimed at curbing the flamboyant behaviour of gay and transgender monks .
The " good manners " curriculum - the country 's first - is being introduced in the northern province of Chiang Rai .
The senior monk told the BBC he was particularly concerned by effeminate activities among novices such as the wearing of make - up and tight robes .
More than 90 % of the Thai population are followers of Buddhism .
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says tales of monks behaving badly are nothing new in Thailand .
In recent years , they have been accused of abuses of their exalted position in society that range from amassing dozens of luxury cars , to running fake amulet scams , to violating their vows of celibacy , our correspondent says .
Senior monk Phra Maha Wudhijaya Vajiramedhi told the BBC he would address issues like smoking , drinking alcohol , walking and going to the toilet properly , which are all detailed in the traditional 75 Dharma principles of Buddhism , and the 227 precepts for monks .
He was especially concerned , he said , by the flamboyant behaviour of gay and transgender monks , who can often be seen wearing revealingly tight robes , carrying pink purses and having effeminately - shaped eyebrows .
Thailand has a very large and visible population of transgender men , and Phra Vajiramedhi acknowledged that it was difficult to exclude them from the monkhood but he hoped his course could at least persuade them to curb their more extrovert habits .
If successful , the " good manners " course , at the Novice Demonstration School , would be replicated at other Buddhist monasteries and seminaries , he said .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Among the thousands of pages of documents filed in connection with Chrysler 's Chapter 11 bankruptcy are affidavits from Chrysler executives that open up a window on the auto business previously closed to outsiders in this intensely competitive business .
They reveal an almost unimaginable complexity in the design , manufacturing , and distribution of new cars .
But what 's more revealing is that the affidavits expose Chrysler 's inability to successfully compete and the dangers facing the company in a prolonged bankruptcy .
Consider :
Chrysler pays its suppliers 45 days after delivery .
So if it suspends production - as it has now - for more than 45 days , the suppliers would have to resume manufacturing without their regular source of revenue .
According to Scott Garberding , Chrysler 's chief procurement officer , this imbalance of expenditures and revenues would be " catastrophic " to these marginally profitable companies .
As long as Chrysler remains in bankruptcy , it will suspend development of new models .
But it can't simply restart development months from now and expect to pick up where it left off because , in the words of Frank Ewasyshyn , a top engineer , " we lose some of the learning and expertise " about the new model .
In the affidavit , he figures that work done after a restart will take one - and - a - half times longer than work done before .
The longer Chrysler suspends production , the more it will cost to start back up , according to Ewasyshyn .
The fluids that flow through the lines and equipment are perishable and must continue to flow , even when cars are n't being built .
Paint is a particular problem .
" Paint should be removed and stored after 21 days at a cost of $ 2 million , " he said .
" After 69 days , paint would need to be replaced at a cost of $ 15 million . "
Chrysler can't start making 2010 models until it finishes building the 2009 models presently sitting on the assembly line .
So the longer Chrysler is shut down , the later its 2010 models will be to reach showrooms .
Chrysler vehicles are such slugs on the market that 20 % to 25 % of the wholesale cost goes to dealer incentives , according to Peter Grady , director of dealer operations .
Yet not only were there 286,687 2009 models - more than three months supply - sitting on dealer lots at the time of the filing but there were 36,370 2008 models left .
In other words , they had been sitting around unsold for more than a year .
Dealers depend on cash flow to support their operations , but as Chrysler neared its financing deadline , the checks stopped coming .
A West Palm Beach dealer named James Arrigo reported that Chrysler owed him $ 639,000 in consumer rebates , $ 426,000 in warranty and parts receivables , $ 13,000 in new vehicle receivables - in total $ 1.7 million .
The dealer reduced his monthly expenses from $ 2.1 million to under $ 1.3 million in an effort to stay afloat .
Chrysler 's dire condition explains why vice - chairman Tom LaSorda has been so busy trying to sell the company - and why he has been so unsuccessful .
LaSorda revealed in his affidavit that he had spent two - and - a - half years trying to find a partner for Chrysler .
He approached most of the world 's top auto companies : GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Volkswagen , Toyota ( TM ) , Honda ( HMC ) , Nissan , and Hyundai - as well as India 's Tata Motors , Russia 's GAZ , parts maker Magna , and a number of Chinese companies .
" No party except Fiat emerged as a viable and winning alliance partner for us , " LaSorda reported .
After reading the affidavits , you begin to understand why .
You also begin to understand why the chances of Chrysler emerging from bankruptcy in any shape that resembles intact looks increasingly unlikely .

CNN 's Kiran Chetry speaks to Rep. Ron Paul about Texas ' governor 's secession suggestion .
For ten years , Texas was a sovereign territory before joining the United States in 1845 .
It ’s the stuff of legends that the “ Lone Star State ” could end the ties with the U.S. if its constituents want it that way .
Texas Governor Rick Perry , who 's been highly critical of President Obama 's stimulus package , raised the possibility that his state may one day secede from the union .
“ We ’ve got a great union .
There ’s absolutely no reason to dissolve it .
But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people - who knows what might come out of that , ” Perry told reporters last week .
The governor is n't the only one suggesting secession is not out of the realm .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , a former presidential candidate , spoke with Kiran Chetry on CNN ’s American Morning Tuesday .
Kiran Chetry : How serious is this secession talk ?
Ron Paul : I do n't think it 's very serious .
I do n't think anybody called for secession , and I do n't think the governor called for it .
But he brings up an important issue .
The biggest surprise to me was the outrage expressed over an individual who thinks along these lines , because I heard people say , well , this is treasonous and this was un-American .
But do n't they remember how we came in to our being ?
We used secession , we seceded from England .
So it ’s a very good principle .
It ’s a principle of a free society .
It ’s a shame we do n’t have it anymore .
I argue that if you had the principle of secession , our federal government would n't be as intrusive into state affairs and to me that would be very good .
We as a nation have endorsed secession all along .
Think of all of the secession of the countries and the republics from the Soviet system .
We were delighted .
We love it .
And yet we get hysterical over this just because people want to debate and defend the principle of secession , that does n't mean they ’re calling for secession .
I think it's that restraining element of secession that would keep the federal government from doing so much .
In our early history , they accepted the principles of secession all along .
Chetry :
You said it 's very American to talk about secession .
It ’s how we came into being .
13 colonies seceeded from the British .
Are you likening the current situation to life under King George ?
Paul : I think a lot of people are thinking that way .
And I think that 's what 's important .
People are angry .
If we do n't sense that , we do n't know what 's actually going on there .
People are angry .
I 'm anticipating it will get a lot worse .
When the dollar collapses and the federal government can't fulfill any of its promises , what if they send you dollars and they do n't work .
People are n’t going to have a violent secession ; they ’re just going to ignore the federal government because they will be inept .
We 'll be bringing our troops home and our empire will end .
That 's a different story .
I think it 's something we should talk about but we should institutionalize this principle .
New England wanted to secede .
No one challenged New England that it was unconstitutional in our early history .
Chetry : I want to move on to the bank bailouts .
This is a source of a lot of contention .
You 've been opposed to them .
Lately there have been some signs that perhaps it 's working .
Bank of America is turning a profit .
Wells
Fargo now saying they ’re able to pay back the federal government and return some of that bailout money .
In the end , could this have turned out to be the right move ?
Paul :
If a gangster steals money and he ’s successful , you do n't celebrate .
Yeah they might be .
This is just going to make the people angrier .
They ripped us off , took all of this money , and now they ’re making bundles ?
It 's just an unfair system to penalize average people , inflate the currency and bring on another crisis and undermine the whole system .
So I would say a bank 's success here and there is not necessarily something to celebrate .
It 's still pretty early .
I do n't think we 're out of the woods yet to celebrate banks ’ successes .
What we have to realize is a lot of people stashed away a lot of money and took care of their bonuses and what not .
You 're not going to erase the anger that 's come from that just because the bank made a profit .
Like I say , it might make things worse .
Every year , biologists brave the world 's deserts , jungles and industrial ecosystems looking for new species .
And what wonderful things they find .
It turns out that the real world is totally like the internet :
If you look hard enough , you can find just about anything .
This year , scientists found caffeine - less coffee plants , tiny seahorses and a 23 - inch long bug that looks like a branch , not to mention a strange white slug no one had ever described that was found in a Welsh garden .
Below , you 'll find the top 10 species found and described in 2008 , according to The International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University .
At the top of the page you see the world 's tiniest seahorse , Satomi's Pygmy Seahorse , aka Hippocampus satomiae .
Found in Indonesian waters , it 's the reigning champ of lilliputian seahorses , floating around at half an inch tall .
( In Wired Science 's informal Cutest Thing Ever rankings , it came in right behind the slow loris . )
Deep Blue Chromis aka Chromis abyssus
The deep reefs of the Pacific Ocean are home to a variety of strange creatures that are just beginning to be described .
Named in honor of the BBC program that funded the trip on which it was discovered , this small blue fish was found in Palau , which is hundreds of miles from anywhere .
Ghost Slug aka Selenochlamys ysbryda
This member of the family Trigonochlamydidae was found in a " domestic garden in Canton , " a town in Wales .
It 's nocturnal and creepy looking .
Phobaeticus chani
That 's not a stick , it 's the world 's longest insect , measuring in at 22.3 inches total and with a body length of 14 inches .
You can find it in Borneo , although we 'd rather not .
Charrier Coffee aka Coffea charrieriana
If there 's one thing we 've been waiting for from the plant community , it 's a caffeine - less coffee plant .
Oh , wait , no we have n't !
Caffeine is the coffee plant 's raison d'etre in our book .
Biologists say , however , that this Cameroonian freak could be useful in coffee breeding programs to develop a naturally decaf bean .
Which is good news , if you 're into that weak stuff .
Tahina spectabilis
Looking for a new metaphor for your new magical realist novel set in Madagascar ?
The Tahina palm is the answer to your dreams :
The plant literally flowers itself to death , going out in a blaze of flowers and fruit .
It lives only in one tiny corner of Madagascar and is unrelated to any of the 170 other palm varieties on the island .
Barbados Threadsnake aka Leptotyphlops carlae
The world 's tiniest , quarter - wrapping snake made the rounds of the internet last year and made the ASU 's species list this year .
It 's only found in Barbados .
Mother Fish aka Materpiscis attenboroughi
The mother fish is only known from the fossil above , which shows the animal giving birth 370 million years ago .
It 's the oldest - known vertebrate to have birthed offspring live .
Opisthostoma vermiculum
This strange Malaysian gastropod has a shell that defies the standard laws of shell twisting .
It coils along four separate axes , not three like most of its relatives .
It 's no tiny seahorse , but you can't hold that against it .
Microbacterium hatanonis
Bacteria really can live just about anywhere on else from hot volcanic vents to Antarctic ice .
But they are also adapting to the new environments that humans create .
Case in point , Japanese scientists found that this bacterial species lives inside hairspray .
It still does n't have a common name , but seeing as most bacteria live in communities , we suggest AquaNet .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have created a strain of the human AIDS virus able to infect and multiply in monkeys in a step toward testing future vaccines in monkeys before trying them in people , according to a new study .
A laboratory technician examines blood samples for HIV / AIDS in a public hospital in Valparaiso city , about 75 miles ( 120 km ) northwest of Santiago , November 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Eliseo Fernandez
This strain of HIV , the human immunodeficiency virus , was developed by altering a single gene in the human version to allow it to infect a type of monkey called a pig - tailed macaque , the researchers said on Monday .
The genetically engineered virus , once injected into this monkey , proliferates almost as much as it does in people , but the animal ultimately suppresses it and the virus does not make it sick , they said .
The strain is called simian - tropic HIV - 1 , or stHIV - 1 .
Researchers hope to be able to test possible new AIDS drugs and vaccines in monkeys before trying them in people .
There is a “ cousin ” virus to HIV called SIV , or simian immunodeficiency virus , that causes a disease similar to AIDS in certain types of monkeys .
But this monkey AIDS virus is not identical to the one that infects people and is not a perfect substitute for testing drugs and vaccines against HIV .
“ If our research is taken further , we hope that one day perhaps in the not - too - distant future , we ’ll be able to make vaccines that are intended for use in humans and the very same product will be able to be tested in animals before human trials , ” Paul Bieniasz of the Rockefeller University in New York , one of the researchers , said in a telephone interview .
Scientists have struggled to create an AIDS vaccine .
“ If you make a drug that ’s effective against HIV , sometimes it works against SIV and sometimes it does n’t .
So that basically devalues SIV as an animal model for doing experiments involved with developing drugs , ” Bieniasz said .
“ Now if you want to develop a vaccine , essentially what you have to do is to make a parallel vaccine for HIV and for SIV .
You can test the SIV vaccine in animals and then have to make the leap of faith that the same approach would work equivalently in humans . ”
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the scientists said in making the genetically engineered virus they removed the HIV version of a gene , known as vif , and inserted the SIV version .
This gene acts to thwart proteins made by the monkey that that kill viruses .
Bieniasz said the scientists may need to make additional changes in the stHIV - 1 to make it better for testing vaccines .
The genetically engineered virus infects the monkeys and during the early course of infection is a reasonably good mimic of what happens in HIV - infected people , Bieniasz said .
But after initially spreading in the monkey ’s body , the animal succeeds in suppressing the virus -- not completely clearing the virus but driving it to very low levels .
“ The slight problem is the monkeys do n’t go on to develop AIDS , they do n’t get sick , ” Bieniasz said .
It has become the mission of Capers Funnye to start that dialogue .
“ I believe in building bridges , ” he told me as we sat in his office at the Beth Shalom synagogue in Chicago , a week and a half after his Martin Luther King Day speech in New York .
“ That ’s why speaking at the synagogue was so important to me . ”
“ Has Mary forgiven you ? ” I asked .
Funnye nodded .
“ We drove down to D.C. and made one of the balls the next day , ” he said .
“ And she got to snap a picture of Denzel Washington , so everything is more or less cool . ”
At the King Day celebration in New York , the musician Joshua Nelson proved a hard act to follow ; Funnye came across as stiff and cautious , expressing measured thoughts about Jewish solidarity , the brotherhood of man and the need for peace in the Holy Land .
But here in his study , surrounded by books and family pictures , he seemed far more at ease .
The Sabbath was only an hour away , and people kept busting into the room — kids who wanted to show off their grades ; an assistant rabbi who wanted a word about the youth group ; ladies of the Nashe Or ( “ Women of Light ” )
Sisterhood who wanted to know what time exactly the communal meal should be served .
Funnye handled it all in good spirits .
He is not only the chief rabbi of the congregation , which , in various permutations , has been around 90 years ; he is also its C.E.O. , spiritual leader , head social director , senior teacher and unofficial cantor .
Beth Shalom , which he joined as an assistant rabbi in 1985 , has about 200 members , making it the largest of the six American synagogues affiliated with the International Israelite Board of Rabbis ( the organization that serves the Hebrew Israelites ) , and Funnye is the Israelites ’ only full - time rabbi .
A majority of his congregation are converts to Judaism , although a large number are second - or third - generation Black Jews .
( People often confuse Funnye ’s congregation with that of Ben Ammi Carter , a fellow black Chicagoan , who established a community of followers in Israel in 1969 .
Funnye , who says there is no similarity between their theologies , is at pains to differentiate the two . )
Early in his rabbinical career , Funnye says , he realized that his Jewish credentials were too limited and exotic for the kind of outreach efforts that he wanted to do .
So he enrolled at the mainstream Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies in Chicago , where he received a bachelor ’s degree in Judaic Studies .
And in 1985 he underwent a second conversion , this one certified by a Conservative rabbinical court .
Before he took this step , he consulted with his earlier mentor , Rabbi Levy ; Funnye feared insulting other Black Jews .
“ I did n’t want anyone to interpret my conversion as meaning I thought they were n’t Jewish enough , ” he told me .
But he received Levy ’s blessing .
“ I explained that if I was going to do the kind of outreach I wanted , European Jews had to feel that I was their brother , ” Funnye said .
“ But I ’m still a Black Israelite .
A halakhic conversion ” — one in accordance with traditional Jewish law — “ was n’t going to take away any of my blackness . ”
After his second conversion , Funnye taught Hebrew and Jewish subjects at Chicago - area congregations and worked for the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs , a group dedicated to fighting poverty , racism and anti-Semitism in the city .
He sent his four children to Jewish day schools , quietly built his congregation and got to know the leaders of the white Jewish community .
In 1997 , he did what his mentors had all failed to do ( and no Hebrew Israelite rabbi has since done ) : he became a member of the local Board of Rabbis .
Rabbi Michael
Balinsky , the executive vice president of the Chicago Board , says Funnye makes a conscientious effort “ to play an active role in the mainstream Jewish community without losing his Black Hebrew tradition .
He ’s taken a leadership role for the Jewish community on civil rights issues and outreach to Hispanics and Muslims . ”
In January , Beth Shalom organized a community celebration with members of the Inner - City Muslim Action Network , a social - justice organization in Chicago headed by a Palestinian - American activist named Rami Nashashibi .
Funnye has also worked to improve Chicago ’s historically strained relations between its black and Jewish communities .
In conversations with white Jews , he has defended the Rev. Jesse Jackson , whom he admires , and he encourages dialogue with Louis Farrakhan , the head of the Nation of Islam , whom he counts as a friend .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke responded to ongoing criticism of the government 's efforts to keep alive institutions it has deemed " too big to fail , " saying that this is an " enormous problem " that needs to be addressed .
Speaking before a group of community bankers in Phoenix , the central bank chief argued that actions taken thus far to prop up the nation 's largest banks have been extremely unpleasant , but necessary to preventing further harm across financial markets and the broader economy .
" I do not think we have had a realistic alternative to preventing such failures , " he said .
Many smaller community banks avoided making too many subprime mortgages and also did not own the types of toxic securities backed by these loans that have plagued big banks .
These smaller banks , along with taxpayers , have become increasingly frustrated by the government 's stance that major financial institutions like Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) continue to require billions of dollars in government support because they have been viewed as too big and important to the broader economy to fail .
Those remarks were echoed by Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , who addressed the same industry group Friday .
In her prepared comments , Bair reiterated comments she made before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday , adding that ending the " too to big to fail " issue required a number of new tools including a systemic risk regulator and a program that would help resolve problems at a large financial institution , similar to how the FDIC handles other banks that fail .
" I hope Congress acts soon , " she said .
" Nobody wants to go through another banking crisis like this one . "
Bair also reiterated previously made remarks that she expected bank failures to cost about $ 65 billion over the next five years .
The FDIC recently moved to raise assessments fees charged to banks to fund the industry 's deposit insurance fund , which is used to cover deposits when a bank fails .
She also repeated an earlier assertion that without " additional revenue beyond the regular assessments , current projections indicate that the fund balance will approach zero . "
With that in mind , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd , D - Conn . and Sen. Mike Crapo , R - Idaho have already proposed a bill that would allow the FDIC to borrow up to $ 500 billion from the government to shore up the fund .
But even though many big banks face significant challenges , Bernanke and Bair urged the community bankers in attendance Friday to keep lending .
Local lenders have become a key source of credit at a time when large banks and other finance firms outside the reach of regulatory agencies have withdrawn massive amounts of credit from the nation 's financial system .
Community banks , which typically have $ 1 billion in assets or less , logged a 1.5 % increase in outstanding loans as of the end of the fourth quarter .
The largest institutions , with assets of more than $ 100 billion , suffered a 3.4 % decline .
By continuing to make prudent loans , not only will community banks help the U.S. economy recover , but they also stand to benefit from the new business , according to the two regulatory chiefs .
" Community bankers are vitally important to our country and our economy , " said Bair .
Hectic week in Washington
Friday 's comments by Bernanke and Bair cap what has been a particularly busy week for the Fed chief and other regulators .
On Wednesday , Bernanke and fellow members of the Fed 's Federal Open Market Committee , which sets interest rates , unveiled plans to purchase massive amounts of government debt over the next six months to help keep long - term rates low and get credit flowing again .
In a televised interview with 60 Minutes last Sunday , Bernanke said that a " depression " can be avoided , but he acknowledged that a full economic recovery will take time and that the financial system must be fixed in order for the recession to end .
Next week , Bernanke is slated to testify before Congress about the government 's extensive efforts to rescue AIG and the controversy over the insurer 's decision to pay $ 165 million in bonuses .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will also appear at that hearing .
Da schau an : In weniger als 12 Stunden konnte der Arbeitskreis Zensur die Löschung von 60 kinderpornografischen Webseiten erreichen .
Per Mail !
Auch sonst überraschen die Ergebnisse der digitalen Versuchsanordnung :
Löschen statt verstecken : Es funktioniert !
Innerhalb von 12 Stunden wurden 60 kinderpornographische Internet - Angebote gelöscht
Im Streit um geeignete Maßnahmen gegen im Internet dokumentierten Kindesmissbrauch ( „ Kinderpornographie “ ) wird von Befürwortern bloßer Sperren angeführt , dass es oftmals nicht oder nur mit erheblichem Aufwand möglich sei , die Inhalte zu entfernen oder der Urheber habhaft zu werden .
Jetzt machte Alvar Freude vom Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren und Zensur ( AK Zensur ) die Probe aufs Exempel , analysierte mit automatischen Verfahren die diversen europäischen Sperrlisten und schrieb die Provider an , auf deren Servern sich laut der Listen kinderpornographisches Material befinden soll .
Mit beeindruckender Resonanz : Innerhalb der ersten 12 Stunden nach Aussenden der Mails wurden bereits 60 Webauftritte gelöscht .
Weitere Resultate und Erkenntnisse :
Die ersten Reaktionen folgten bereits nach wenigen Minuten , unter anderem aus den USA , Holland , Dänemark , Russland sowie Deutschland .
Drei der jetzt vom Netz genommenen Webauftritte befanden sich auf Servern in Deutschland .
Insgesamt wurden 348 verschiedene Provider in 46 Ländern angeschrieben und über rund 1943 gesperrte illegale Webseiten informiert .
250 Provider haben auf die Anfrage geantwortet , haben aber nur selten illegale Inhalte gefunden : zehn Provider gaben an , ingesamt 61 illegale Inhalte entfernt zu haben .
Mit einer einfachen E - Mail kann man also schon viel erreichen .
Bei der überwiegenden Mehrheit der Webseiten , darunter einigen aus Deutschland , zeigte sich bei der Überprüfung durch den Provider , dass die Webseiten kein kinderpornographisches , teils überhaupt kein irgendwie beanstandbares Material enthielten – die Webauftritte waren folglich zu Unrecht gesperrt .
In Finnland werden zudem auch mehrere inländische Webseiten blockiert , die sich kritisch mit den dortigen Internet - Sperren auseinandersetzen .
Die Provider wurden bislang nicht darüber informiert , dass die bei ihnen gehosteten Webauftritte auf einschlägigen Sperrlisten geführt wurden .
Wenn sie darauf hingewiesen werden , sind die Provider zur Kooperation bereit und entfernen illegale Inhalte umgehend .
Teilweise handelte es sich bei dem gesperrten Material um „ gecrackte “ Webauftritte , also solche , die durch Ausnutzen von Sicherheitslücken zur Verbreitung fremden Materials missbraucht wurden .
Auch hier zeigten sich die Provider sehr dankbar für die Hinweise .
Die Abschaltung von Webauftritten mit kinderpornographischen Inhalten dauert nicht länger als die Übermittlung einer Sperrliste .
Dies führt die Argumentation der Befürworter des bloßen Sperrens ad absurdum – es gibt keinen sachlichen Grund , strafbare Inhalte im Netz zu belassen und sie für alle einschlägig Interessierten mit minimalem Aufwand weiterhin zugänglich zu halten .
Was für eine Bürgerinitiative wie den Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren und Zensur möglich ist , sollte für die deutsche Regierung und Strafverfolgungsbehörden ein Leichtes sein und die hier erzielten Ergebnisse deutlich übertreffen können .
Löschen statt Sperren – von Beginn an die Forderung des AK Zensur – ist möglich
Über den Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren ( AK Zensur ) :
Der Arbeitskreis gegen Internetsperren und Zensur ( AK Zensur ) spricht sich gegen die von der Bundesregierung geplanten Internetsperren aus und fordert eine effektive Bekämpfung von Kindesmissbrauch anstatt einer Symbolpolitik , die nur das Wegschauen fördert , den Opfern nicht hilft und dafür eine Infrastruktur einrichtet , die Grundrechte der Allgemeinheit einschränkt .
Er koordiniert die Arbeit der Sperrgegner , freut sich aber gleichzeitig über die vielen Aktivitäten , die dezentral on - und offline stattfinden .
Dem AK Zensur gehören unter anderem an : der Chaos Computer Club , der FoeBuD e.V , der Förderverein Informationstechnik und Gesellschaft e.V. ( FITUG ) , das Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung e.V. ( FIfF ) , die Missbrauchs Opfer gegen InternetSperren ( MOGIS ) , netzpolitik.org , die Online - Plattform ODEM.org , der Trotz Allem e.V. und viele Einzelpersonen .
PS : Der – fragwürdige – Verein Carechild kam im März bei einer vergleichbaren Aktion zu einem ähnlichen Ergebnis .

Intergenerational Justice in the United States Constitution ,
The Stewardship Doctrine :
II .
The Intergenerational Philosophy of the Founders and Their Contemporaries
A. A Pervasive concern for future generations - Recognition of Intergenerational Obligations
French and American constitution - makers exercised strong , mutual influences upon one another during this time .
f108 Like their American counterparts , the French were preparing to abandon an ancient feudal system in favor of a newer , republican one , and they were faced with similar issues of intergenerational equity .
Jefferson 's friend ( and America 's ally ) the Marquis de LaFayette , submitted a proposed Declaration of Rights to the French National Assembly on July 11 , 1789 which would have recognized " le droit des générations qui se succèdent " , including the right to periodic constitutional reform .
f109
The view that property rights - especially rights in land -- must be limited to some extent in favor of future generations was explored at great length in the French National Assembly 's committee report on feudal rights .
f110
Closer to home , the American founders could find an example of institutionalized intergenerational concern in the constitution of the Iroquois Nation .
The Iroquois philosophy and political model profoundly influenced such American founders as Benjamin Franklin . f111
Their constitution provided ( and still provides ) that :
" In our every deliberation , we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations . "
f112
To review : there was a pervasive sense of intergenerational obligation in late 18th century America and Europe .
Like Plato and the Old Testament prophets before them , the founders believed strongly in the intergenerational community .
While their sense of obligation often expressed itself , as in most of the examples above , as a mere generalized interest in posterity 's well - being , at other times intergenerational philosophy took the form of careful political analysis .
We now turn our attention to some of the more methodical analyses and applications .

Interview with Peace Negotiator Erik Solheim Sri Lanka 's Government ' Must Show It Can Also Win the Peace '
For many years , Erik Solheim was the chief negotiator between the Tamil Tigers ( LTTE ) and the Sri Lankan government .
In an interview with SPIEGEL , the Norwegian diplomat speaks about the end of more than 30 years of civil war and the uncertain fate of the war 's victims and losers .
Lysiane Gagnon cites a 2000 report by the World Health Organization to perpetuate the myth that the Canadian health - care system ranks 30th in the world ( That French Remedy Still Works - March 2 ) .
The dubious methodology used in this report has since been discontinued .
The rankings in the 2000 report did not directly measure actual health out -
comes , but rather how well these outcomes compared with what might be expected after discounting for the effects of a country 's non-medical determinants .
It was also assumed that the impact of these other determinants could be deduced by looking at the statistical influence of just one variable - a country 's average years of schooling .
Canada 's relatively good health results were therefore heavily discounted because of Canadians ' high average levels of education .

In WHO 's Global Health Statistics 2008 , which uses real , not estimated , data from 2005 , Canada equalled or outperformed France and other front - runners from the 2000 report in almost all categories , including mortality and life expectancy .
It 's also worth noting that France spent 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product on health care , while Canada spent 9.7 per cent .
It ’s consistently been part of the anti-choice strategy to treat unborn fetuses as separate , autonomous people , even well before the point of viability .
For instance , the anti-abortion website Abort73.com says :
It is illegal to execute a pregnant woman on death row because the fetus living inside her is a distinct human being who cannot be executed for the crimes of the mother .
( source )
In fact , such niceties did not occur to the authors of the Bible .
They did not value the unborn nearly so highly , as we can see from a little - known Bible verse .
In Genesis chapter 38 , the Israelite patriarch Judah marries off his firstborn son , Er , to a woman named Tamar .
Unfortunately , Er “ was wicked in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord slew him ” ( 38:7 ) .
Judah , who was nothing if not practical , instructs his secondborn son Onan to marry his dead brother ’s wife and impregnate her , to perpetuate his brother ’s family line .
Onan , who is n’t feeling the brotherly love , consents to have sex with Tamar , but pulls out at the last moment and spills his “ seed ” on the ground .
“ And the thing which he did displeased the Lord : wherefore he slew him also ” ( 38:10 ) .
( In case you were keeping track , this primitive , ridiculous little bloodbath of a myth is recorded in a book which is believed by billions of people to be the word of God . )
Judah was running low on sons by this point , but bravely soldiers on , instructing Tamar to “ remain a widow at thy father ’s house , till Shelah my son be grown ” ( 38:11 ) .
However , Tamar – who seems understandably fed up by this point – disobeys , puts off her widow ’s garb and goes out and sits in the open , wearing a veil .
Judah comes across her , does n’t realize she ’s his daughter - in - law , and , well , you can probably guess what happens next : Judah “ thought her to be an harlot ; because she had covered her face ” ( 38:15 ) and agrees to pay her one goat from his flock in exchange for sex .
No , I ’m not making this up .
Tamar conceives a child .
When Judah sees her again , he still does n’t realize she ’s the woman he slept with – but he does see that she ’s pregnant , and has n’t married his son yet , and is therefore enraged .
“ And it came to pass about three months after , that it was told Judah , saying , Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom .
And Judah said , Bring her forth , and let her be burnt . ” ( 38:24 )
Judah was fully aware that Tamar was pregnant from her act of infidelity – and yet he still orders her to be put to death straightaway !
The life of that “ distinct human being ” inside her seemed not to concern him at all .
Certainly there ’s no mention made in the text of him intending to wait until she had given birth before having her burned alive .
In the end Tamar escapes her fate , so the issue never comes to a head , but there is no indication that it was a consideration before her reprieve .
There are plenty of other verses in the Old Testament which strongly suggest that its authors did not view unborn fetuses as equivalent to born children .
Exodus 21:22 says that if men fight and injure a pregnant woman , causing her to miscarry , the guilty party is merely fined , but if the woman dies , the responsible person is also put to death .
( Some apologists claim that this text merely means the man is fined if the woman ’s injury causes her to give birth prematurely without doing any other harm .
Readers are invited to imagine a physically plausible scenario under which this could occur . )
The Book of Numbers , starting in verse 3:15 , tells of a census God ordered Moses to carry out among the Israelites .
Pregnant women are not counted as two people .
In fact , this verse specifically says that even children less than a month old were n’t counted !
This should n’t be surprising ; a tribal society with a high rate of infant mortality could scarcely afford to invest large amounts of resources into newborns , until they had passed a point where they were more likely to survive .
But this brutal necessity hardly fits with the “ pro-family ” mindset that the modern religious right claims to derive from the Bible .
Numbers 5 also contains the infamous “ law of jealousy ” , where a man who suspects his wife of being unfaithful can take her to the priests and force her to drink “ bitter water ” .
This potion appears to be some form of abortifacient , because if the woman has been unfaithful , the text says that it will cause her to have a “ miscarrying womb ” ( according to the NIV translation ) .
Many modern anti-choice advocates argue that even a pregnancy conceived from rape should not be grounds for an abortion , but the biblical authors had no compunction in describing it as the appropriate response to spousal infidelity .
Following the theme from Genesis 38 , Hosea 13:16 thunders that “ Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up . ”
Again , the innocent lives incubating inside these sinful women do not stay the hand of the divine executioner .

The Oath Keepers say they 're highest allegiance is to the Constitution , not to the whims of corrupt politicians .
They refuse to take our guns .
They refuse to conduct searches without warrants .
They say they wo n't be party to any military tribunal carried out against American citizens on our soil .
With FEMA and DOD operating in clear defiance of the Posse Comitatus Act , these are the kinds of patriots who , hopefully , will enshrine and preserve freedom for centuries to come .
It 's ironic but fitting that executive bonuses , a subject that 's ignited popular anger against the very companies in Sun Microsystems ' core customer base on Wall St , helped kill Sun 's future .
It 's been reported that a disagreement between IBM and Sun over post - acquisition packages for both chief executive officer Jonathan Schwartz and chairman and co-founder Scott McNealy helped sink a deal that sources last week told The Reg was imminent .
Schwartz and McNealy would have received a package of combined salary and - yes , incredibly for a company that 's missed numerous boats and trod water for the past nine years - bonuses worth three times their annual pay .
Schwartz , whose been leading the failed crusade of first giving away Sun 's software and then somehow monetizing it later , was last year paid a basic salary of $ 1 m .
So far , Sun 's refused to comment on what it 's called rumors and speculation about a deal , while IBM 's been unavailable for comment .
If the IBM deal did sink because of haggling over packages , it would be a sad comment either on the failure of the egos hanging on to their Ts and Cs or the overzealous lawyers arguing for their clients to see the bigger picture of giving Sun and its customers a decent future .
The talks - publicly at least , are off .
This could , of course , be the continuation of negotiations by other means : both sides playing hardball , meaning a deal 's still in the air .
There can , though , be no question that Sun entered this courtship as the weaker party so it 's hard to see why IBM should be tempted to bite .
Sun remains overstaffed , becalmed and still recovering from the last recession .
Forbes has produced handy recap of six mistakes made by Sun under McNealy and new broom of Schwartz .
I 'd add one more , as most people tend to overlook this : middleware and applications .
Software was ignored under McNealy for all his fightin ' talk of taking on Microsoft .
It only came into vogue under Schwartz , who had a passion for open sourcing Sun 's assets and allowing the revolving door or talking heads to continue turning instead of tackling some root - cause problems by installing talent and devoting resources to the subject at hand .
The result has been that , when it comes to working out how to make money off open source , Sun is still rubbing two sticks together while IBM 's walking around with a Zippo .
Even Microsoft is managing to cash in on open - source , not by throwing open the gates and figuring out the details afterwards , but through a deliberate strategy of making Windows work better with open - source like PHP and Sun 's MySQL database .
In measure of how far Sun 's open - source strategy has failed not one of three organizations in Sun 's core Wall St constituency attending lat month 's Open - Source Business Conference said they were running Sun 's touted Fedora clone OpenSolaris .
Those companies were Bank of America , futures and options house the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Wall St IT services specialist Fidelity Information Services .
At the best , OpenSolaris is penned up in the labs where it's used to benchmark hardware performance by the Mercantile Exchange .
And if you think that bodes well for sales of more Sun-only servers in the long run , think again .
BoA said while Solaris is its third - largest install base : " It 's going to follow the migratory path to x86 that the industry is following . "
Despite this ,
Sun 's senior management still thinks projects like OpenSolaris are actually worth something .
Bloomberg reported Sun 's board : " Contended IBM wanted too much control over Sun 's projects and employees before the deal closed , without providing guarantees that the transaction would be completed if it faced delays such as antitrust review . "
If this is true , it sounded like Sun wanted to graft itself onto IBM and drag it down too .
However , IBM operates in the real world of profit and loss , and sources told The Reg categorically that IBM failed to get a satisfactory answer on which , if any , of Sun 's software makes money .
The result was IBM staffers going through Sun 's books and its portfolio could n't recommend keeping any of Sun 's software assets beyond what we reported last week - MySQL for systems , Java for licensing and continuity , and Solaris for the services business .
It looked like projects such as OpenSolaris and others were heading to a community graveyard .
If Sun is playing hardball with IBM in the hopes of getting a better price and firm guarantees , then it 'll be a long time waiting .
There 's no reason for IBM to buy any of the software projects
Sun 's attached so much importance to .
And that will mean staff cuts .
Even
Sun knows the reality - it 's just in denial about the scale .
In recent months Sun has had to cut staff involved in marketing and engineering on OpenSolaris and desktop Java as part of planned redundancies .
Only if Sun accepts the full facts , and quits playing the kind of Silicon Valley game that has given Web 2.0 services like Digg ridiculous assumed valuations based on nothing more than number or users and potential future revenues can Sun 's own future resume in earnest , with IBM . ®
Are the Bears now the favorites in the NFC North ?
In one day , the Bears seemingly addressed their 20 - year old quarterback problem and also added a significant piece to their offensive line .
In one day , the Bears might have gone from a .500 team to the perennial favorites in the NFC North .
It ’s way too early to be getting into predictions for the 2009 NFL Season .
Voluntary workouts have begun , but the draft is still weeks away and teams are still trying to reshape their rosters .
But with the trade acquisition of Jay Cutler and the signing of left tackle Orlando Pace , the Bears significantly upgraded their offense and hopefully made current players like Matt Forte , Devin Hester , Frank Omiyale and Chris Williams better .
Make no mistake – Chicago is far from a Super Bowl contender .
They still need to upgrade their wide receiver position , could use another defensive end to throw in the mix with Alex Brown , Adewale Ogunleye and Mark Anderson , and even though they signed Josh Bullocks this offseason , they could still use an upgrade at safety as well .
But while every team in the division has arguably gotten weaker , the Bears have upgraded .
The Vikings are still pretty strong , but they lost long - time center Matt Birk and still have questions to be answered at quarterback .
The Packers are planning to run a 3 - 4 defense next season , but have done next to nothing to add true 3 - 4 personnel and the Lions will continue to take a sandblaster to their entire roster .
Perhaps the biggest thing holding the Bears back is offensive coordinator Ron Turner , who can be less than innovative at times .
Maybe that ’s only because he has n’t had the personnel to run his offense at full tilt , but the bottom line is that Cutler is the type of quarterback that Turner will have to unleash .
It would have been foolish for the Bears to acquire a big - armed quarterback if they ’re not going to push the ball up the field through the air .
I ’m not saying they should go Run n’
Shoot because after all , that ’s never been the Bears ’ style .
But now that Turner has weapon in Cutler , he needs to use him .
Again , it ’s early .
The draft will give us a better indication of how the Vikings and Packers will look next season and the Lions could even improve if GM Martin Mayhew uses all of his picks intelligently ( i.e. not like Matt Millen ) .
But anyone who thinks Chicago was fleeced in the Cutler deal has n’t been paying attention .
GM Jerry Angelo makes his money in rounds 2 through 7 and now that he does n’t have to worry about squandering yet another first round pick , he can do what he does best – find gems in the middle rounds .
Assuming Cutler can put down the Kleenex for two seconds and stop crying about his situation and just play ball , the Bears are going to be tough to beat in the North next year .
Vast sums of money are being lavished by Western aid agencies on their own officials in Afghanistan at a time when extreme poverty is driving young Afghans to fight for the Taliban .
The going rate paid by the Taliban for an attack on a police checkpoint in the west of the country is $ 4 , but foreign consultants in Kabul , who are paid out of overseas aids budgets , can command salaries of $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 a year .
The high expenditure on paying , protecting and accommodating Western aid officials in palatial style helps to explain why Afghanistan ranks 174th out of 178th on a UN ranking of countries ' wealth .
This is despite a vigorous international aid effort with the US alone spending $ 31bn since 2002 up to the end of last year .
The high degree of wastage of aid money in Afghanistan has long been an open secret .
In 2006 , Jean Mazurelle , the then country director of the World Bank , calculated that between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of aid was " badly spent " .
" The wastage of aid is sky - high , " he said .
" There is real looting going on , mainly by private enterprises .
It is a scandal . "

The dysfunctional reputation of the US aid effort in Afghanistan is politically crucial because Barack Obama , with strong support from Gordon Brown , has promised that a " civilian surge " of non-military experts will be sent to Afghanistan to strengthen its government and turn the tide against the Taliban .
These would number up to 600 , including agronomists , economists and legal experts , though Washington admitted this week that it was having difficulty recruiting enough people of the right calibre .
Whole districts of Kabul have already been taken over or rebuilt to accommodate Westerners working for aid agencies or embassies .
" I have just rented out this building for $ 30,000 a month to an aid organisation , " said Torialai Bahadery , the director of Property Consulting Afghanistan , which specialises in renting to foreigners .
" It was so expensive because it has 24 rooms with en-suite bathrooms as well as armoured doors and bullet - proof windows , " he explained , pointing to a picture of a cavernous mansion .
Though 77 per cent of Afghans lack access to clean water , Mr Bahadery said that aid agencies and the foreign contractors who work for them insist that every bedroom should have an en-suite bathroom and this often doubles the cost of accommodation .
In addition to the expensive housing the expatriates in Kabul are invariably protected by high - priced security companies and each house is converted into a fortress .
The freedom of movement of foreigners is very limited .
" I am not even allowed to go into Kabul 's best hotel , " complained one woman working for a foreign government aid organisation .
She added that to travel to a part of Afghanistan deemed wholly free of Taliban by Afghans , she had to go by helicopter and then be taken to where she wanted to go in an armoured vehicle .
There have been numerous attacks on foreigners in Kabul and suicide bombings have been effective from the Taliban 's point of view in driving almost all expatriates into well - defended compounds where living conditions may be luxurious but which are as confining as any prison .
This means that many foreigners sent to Afghanistan to help rebuild the country and the state machinery seldom meet Afghans aside from their drivers and a few Afghans with whom they work .
" Risk avoidance is crippling the international aid effort , " said one aid expert in Kabul .
" If governments are so worried about risk then they really should not be sending people here and having them work under such restricted conditions . "
The effectiveness of foreign advisers and experts in Iraq is often further reduced by the very short time they stay in the country .
" Many people move on after six months , " said one expatriate who did not want to be named .
" In addition some embassy employees receive two weeks off work for every six weeks they are in the country , on top of their usual holidays . "

Some officials working for non-governmental organisations in Afghanistan are themselves troubled by the amount of money which foreign government officials and their aid agencies spend on staff compared to the poverty of the Afghan government .
" I was in Badakhshan province in northern Afghanistan which has a population of 830,000 , most of whom depend on farming , " said Matt Waldman , the head of policy and advocacy for Oxfam in Kabul .
" The entire budget of the local department of agriculture , irrigation and livestock , which is extremely important for farmers in Badakhshan , is just $ 40,000 .
This would be the pay of an expatriate consultant in Kabul for a few months . "
Mr Waldman , the author of several highly - detailed papers on the failures of aid in Afghanistan , says that a lot of money is put in at the top in Afghanistan but it is siphoned off before it reaches ordinary Afghans at he bottom .
He agrees that the problems faced are horrendous in a country which was always poor and has been ruined by 30 years of war .
Some 42 per cent of Afghanistan 's 25 million inhabitants live on less than a dollar a day and life expectancy is only 45 years .
Overall literacy rate is just 34 per cent and 18 per cent for women .
But much of the aid money goes to foreign companies who then subcontract as many as five times with each subcontractor in turn looking for between 10 per cent and 20 per cent or more profit before any work is done on the project .
The biggest donor in Afghanistan is the US , whose overseas aid department USAID channels nearly half of its aid budget for Afghanistan to five large US contractors .
Examples cited in an Oxfam report include the building of a short road between Kabul city centre and the international airport in 2005 which , after the main US contractor had subcontracted it to an Afghan company , cost $ 2.4 m a kilometre – or four times the average cost of road construction in Afghanistan .
Often aid is made conditional on spending it in the donor country .
Another consequence of the use of foreign contractors is that construction has failed to make the impact on unemployment among young Afghans which is crucial if the Taliban is to be defeated .
In southern provinces such as Farah , Helmand , Uruzgan and Zabul , up to 70 per cent of Taliban fighters are non-ideological unemployed young men given a gun before each attack and paid a pittance according to a report by the Institute for War and Peace Reporting .
By using these part - time fighters as cannon - fodder , the Taliban can keep down casualties among its own veteran fighters while inflicting losses on government forces .
Some simple and obvious ways of spending money to benefit Afghans have been neglected .
Will Beharrell of the Turquoise Mountain charity , which is encouraging traditional Afghan crafts and reconstruction of part of the old city , says tangible and visible improvements are important .
He said : " We went in for rubbish clearing because it is simple and provides employment .
We brought the street level down by two metres in some places when we had cleared it away . "
A striking feature of Kabul is that while the main roads are paved , the side streets are often no more than packed earth with high ridges , deep potholes and grey pools of dirty water .
New roads have been built between the cities , such as Kabul and Kandahar , but these are often too dangerous to use because of mobile Taliban checkpoints where anybody connected to the central government is killed on the spot .
The international aid programme is particularly important in Afghanistan because the government has few other sources of revenue .
Donations from foreign governments make up 90 per cent of public expenditure .
Aid is far more important than in Iraq , where the government has oil revenues .
In Afghanistan a policeman 's monthly salary is only $ 70 , which is not enough to live on without taking bribes .
Since the fall of the Taliban the Afghan government has been trying to run a country in which the physical infrastructure has been destroyed .
Kabul is now getting electricity from Uzbekistan but 55 per cent of Afghans get no electricity at all and just one in 20 get power all day .
Money can be distributed more swiftly by the US military but this may not undercut the political support of the Taliban to the degree expected .
Afghans themselves are unenthusiastic about President Obama 's plan for more US military and civilian involvement in Iraq .
And the failure of foreign aid to deliver a better life to Afghans also helps explain plummeting support for the Kabul government and its Western allies .
Oxfam 's Mr Waldman believes better - organised aid could still deliver the benefits Afghans hoped for when the Taliban were overthrown in 2001 , but he warns : " It is getting very late in the day to get things right . "
Go figure : The West 's spending in Afghanistan
$ 57 The foreign aid per capita to Afghanistan , compared with $ 580 per capita in the aftermath of the Bosnian conflict .
$ 250,000 Typical salary of foreign consultants in Afghanistan , including 35 per cent hardship allowance and 35 per cent danger money .
Afghan civil servants typically receive less than $ 1,000 a year .
$ 22bn
The shortfall in donations compared to the international community 's estimate of Afghanistan 's need – around 48 per cent .
40 per cent Share of international aid budget returned to aid countries in corporate profit and consultant salaries – more than $ 6bn since 2001 .
$ 7 m Daily aid spend in Afghanistan .
The daily military spend by the US government is around $ 100m .
Japan 's exports have been hit by a collapse in demand
Japan 's economy during the first three months of 2009 shrank at its quickest pace since records began , as exports slumped , officials figures have shown .
Output in the world 's second largest economy contracted by 4 % during the period , or by 15.2 % on an annual basis .
Japan 's economy , which depends heavily on exports , has been hit hard by the global downturn .
But economists predict a modest growth in the coming months , after a small rise in production in March .
The figures from the Cabinet Office show that this is the fourth quarterly fall in gross domestic product ( GDP ) in a row , after a 3.8 % contraction between October and December 2008 .
' Weakness spreading '
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo says people around the world are buying fewer of the cars and electronic gadgets that Japan is renowned for .
In the first quarter of this year , Japanese exports declined by 26 % .
" Weakness in the corporate sector is gradually spreading to households , " Prime Minister Taro Aso said during a budget hearing to Parliament .
" This is a very serious situation , so we need to respond appropriately . "
Investment in factories and equipment dropped by 10.4 % in the first quarter , a sign that firms are reducing their outlay .
Consumer spending fell by 1.1 % during the same period .
" The savings rate has gone up and that has worsened the severity of the recession , " said Richard Jerram , head economist at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo .
" It seems the public has basically panicked about job security to an an extent that has n't happened in previous cycles , " he added .
The latest contraction is the biggest since records began in 1955 .

The roller shutters are a great option for your windows as they are really very easy to operate , not many people even realize it .
They are also very inexpensive , especially if you are able to buy them in bulk which is possible these days .
It can really give you a lot of savings when purchasing them from online shopping stores and there is no need for you to worry about their installation , as you will be able to install them yourself .
Security roller shutters to protect against break - ins
When purchasing the roller shutters , you have to make sure that they are in a good condition so that they do not pose any danger to your house .
It is also very important to check them out properly and then ensure that they are the right kind of shutters that will go with your house .
You should make sure that you take into account the size of your house or room that you want them to cover .
When you are looking for window shutters , it is also important to check the quality of them .
This is one thing that you must keep in mind that there are a lot of different brands of them that are being sold in the market today and they are all priced differently too .
If you do not look around you might end up buying a wrong product because there are a lot of products that are being sold that do not even have the capability of covering your window .
Apple has pulled an iPhone application which simulated shaking a baby until it fell asleep .
But the firm has n’t given a clear explanation as to how it was approved in the first place .
The application was produced by third - party firm Sikalosoft and approved for sale through the App store section of the iTunes store .
Costing 99 c to download , the app was promoted with the line “ See how long you can endure his or her adorable cries before you just have to find a way to quiet the baby down ! ”
Players were presented with a drawing of a child and could then shake the phone until the child ’s eyes were covered with red crosses .
As you ’d imagine , news of the app caused outrage .
Jennipher Dickens , a spokeswoman for the Sarah Jane Brain Project and a mother of child left brain damaged after being shaken , said “ Words do not even adequately describe how much [ the app ] disheartens me . ”
Sikalosoft is n’t commenting on the app .
Apple has confirmed it went on sale on Monday and was withdrawn yesterday , but has n’t answered any other questions , including how it got approval or how many copies were sold .
It ’s the latest in a long string of confusing decisions by Apple over its vetting process , which can take several weeks .
The firm has rejected apps including an official South Park clips app ( despite the same content being available on iTunes ) , an internet radio station app which had been approved three times in previous editions , an app allowing users to download podcasts wirelessly to the iPhone , and a movie listing service .
However , it has approved a Google voice search app ( which contravenes a ban on using the phone ’s sensor which smaller firms have had to follow ) , an app turning the iPhone into a wireless modem ( which breaches the service agreement US users have with AT&T ) , and a screensaver retailing at $ 999 .
Consumer groups warned the new law could punish the wrong people
French politicians have rejected a bill which proposed that people caught downloading music illegally three times should be cut off from the internet .
The legislation , backed by President Nicolas Sarkozy , would have set a tough global precedent in cracking down on internet piracy .
The music industry has been calling for stricter laws as revenues have fallen .
Ministers said an amended version of the bill would go before parliament in the next few weeks .
Three strikes
The new legislation would have operated under a " three strikes " system .
A new state agency would first send illegal file - sharers a warning e-mail , then a letter , and finally cut off their connection for a year if they were caught a third time .
It was backed by both the film and record industries .
But some consumer groups had warned that the wrong people might be punished - should hackers hijack their computers ' identity , and that the scheme amounted to state surveillance .
The socialist parliamentarian Patrick Bloche said the bill was " dangerous , useless , inefficient , and very risky for us citizens . "
Although the legislation was approved by the Senate , France 's upper house , it was defeated in a vote of the National Assembly .
Two members of Mr Sarkozy 's majority government joined the socialist opposition in voting against the bill , in a protest to an amendment which would have made users who had been banned , continue to pay their internet bills .
The government can now re-introduce the legislation to parliament later this year .
It seemed like more troubling evidence that kids these days engage in behavior they would n't want to write home about .
Researchers recently found that one in five teenagers have shared nude or semi-nude photos of themselves by cellphone or online .
That statistic has become a fixture in articles about " sexting " and its social and legal implications .
But that number may be inflated , because the same teenagers who have engaged in such behavior could be the ones most likely to say they have done so in an online poll .
To find out how many teenagers are sharing personal information over new media , researchers last year asked teenagers personal questions using one of those new media , skewing the sample .
" These kinds of samples select Internet cowboys and cowgirls , " says David Finkelhor , director of the Crimes against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire , who has used the telephone for his studies of teens and online behavior .
" These are more likely to be the kind of people who engage in this kind of activity . "
He guesses that online poll - takers might be two to four times more likely to send nude photos of themselves than the average teen .
The sponsors of the poll , the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and CosmoGirl.com , counter that teens are more comfortable telling a Web page than an adult about their risqué behavior .
" We wanted to reach teens where they are -- which is online , " a CosmoGirl.com spokeswoman says .
The debate has played mostly in the background of a flurry of sexting stories in the news media , which have focused on whether such images are child pornography .
But the dispute highlights a growing challenge for pollsters :
Fewer people are responding to them over the phone , yet they have n't yet agreed on how to move their business online .
Douglas Hofstadter ( in his book Le Ton beau de Marot , and again in a lecture at Stanford University ) described Einstein ’s theory of relativity , using only one - syllable English words .
Here ’s the beginning of his talk :
And it was old One Stone , too , who first guessed and then showed that the Pull Down on all things — the Pull that gives us weight , the Pull toward the ground that we feel at all times — is not a true pull at all , but what is known as a “ fake pull ” — the same kind of pull
as pulls things from the hub toward the rim of a wheel that spins .
Such pulls are called “ fake ” since they all go up in smoke when you make a shift in what you deem to be “ at rest ” .
Though but a shift in your head — though but a trick in how you look at things — such a shift casts all things in a new light .
Mind you , fake pulls are not like most pulls , for they make all things , be they great or slight in weight , pick up speed at one and the same clip ( a truth most odd , in truth ) .
Thus , since the Pull Down on all things is this way , old One Stone was tipped off that he might try to see it as a fake pull .
No one else had thought to do this , though it had been plain as day for all to see for scores of years .
( Thanks to Martin Poulter for bringing this to our attention . )
UPDATE : Investigator Dan Brennan recommends a later , grainier yet paradoxically longer , attempt to explain the same thing : Brian Raiter ’s “ Albert Einstein ’s Theory of Relativity ( In Words of Four Letters or Less ) “ .

Researchers have created a new material that overcomes two of the major obstacles to solar power : it absorbs all the energy contained in sunlight , and generates electrons in a way that makes them easier to capture .
Ohio State University chemists and their colleagues combined electrically conductive plastic with metals including molybdenum and titanium to create the hybrid material .
" There are other such hybrids out there , but the advantage of our material is that we can cover the entire range of the solar spectrum , " explained Malcolm Chisholm , Distinguished University Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State .
Sunlight contains the entire spectrum of colors that can be seen with the naked eye -- all the colors of the rainbow .
What our eyes interpret as color are really different energy levels , or frequencies of light .
Today 's solar cell materials can only capture a small range of frequencies , so they can only capture a small fraction of the energy contained in sunlight .
This new material is the first that can absorb all the energy contained in visible light at once .
The material generates electricity just like other solar cell materials do : light energizes the atoms of the material , and some of the electrons in those atoms are knocked loose .
advertisement
Ideally , the electrons flow out of the device as electrical current , but this is where most solar cells run into trouble .
The electrons only stay loose for a tiny fraction of a second before they sink back into the atoms from which they came .
The electrons must be captured during the short time they are free , and this task , called charge separation , is difficult .
In the new hybrid material , electrons remain free much longer than ever before .
To design the hybrid material , the chemists explored different molecular configurations on a computer at the Ohio Supercomputer Center .
Then , with colleagues at National Taiwan University , they synthesized molecules of the new material in a liquid solution , measured the frequencies of light the molecules absorbed , and also measured the length of time that excited electrons remained free in the molecules .
They saw something very unusual .
The molecules did n't just fluoresce as some solar cell materials do .
They phosphoresced as well .
Both luminous effects are caused by a material absorbing and emitting energy , but phosphorescence lasts much longer .
To their surprise , the chemists found that the new material was emitting electrons in two different energy states -- one called a singlet state , and the other a triplet state .
Both energy states are useful for solar cell applications , and the triplet state lasts much longer than the singlet state .

Electrons in the singlet state stayed free for up to 12 picoseconds , or trillionths of a second -- not unusual compared to some solar cell materials .
But electrons in the triplet state stayed free 7 million times longer -- up to 83 microseconds , or millionths of a second .
When they deposited the molecules in a thin film , similar to how they might be arranged in an actual solar cell , the triplet states lasted even longer : 200 microseconds .
" This long - lived excited state should allow us to better manipulate charge separation , " Chisholm said .
At this point , the material is years from commercial development , but he added that this experiment provides a proof of concept -- that hybrid solar cell materials such as this one can offer unusual properties .
The project was funded by the National Science Foundation and Ohio State 's Institute for Materials Research .
Chisholm is working with Arthur J. Epstein , Distinguished University Professor of chemistry and physics ; Paul Berger , professor of electrical and computer engineering and physics ; and Nitin Padture , professor of materials science and engineering to develop the material further .
That work is part of the Advanced Materials Initiative , one Ohio State 's Targeted Investment in Excellence ( TIE ) programs .
The TIE program targets some of society 's most pressing challenges with a major investment of university resources in programs with a potential for significant impact in their fields .
The university has committed more than $ 100 million over the next five years to support 10 high - impact , mostly interdisciplinary programs .
Co-authors on the PNAS paper from Ohio State included : Gotard Burdzinski , a postdoctoral researcher ; Yi-Hsuan Chou , a postdoctoral researcher ; Florian Fiel , a former postdoctoral researcher ; Judith Gallucci , a senior research associate ; Yagnaseni Ghosh , a graduate student ; Terry Gustafson , a professor ; Yao Liu , a postdoctoral researcher ; Ramkrishna Ramnauth , a former postdoctoral researcher ; and Claudia Turro , a professor ; all of the Department of Chemistry .
They collaborated with Pi-Tai Chou and Mei-Lin Ho of National Taiwan University .
A global protest against UK plans to build new coal power plants is being launched today by campaigners from more than 40 developing countries accusing the government of being a " climate criminal " .
They have written an open letter to energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband that follows repeated warnings from UK groups that the decisions to approve new coal power plants and the expansion of Heathrow airport would damage the nation 's position in international negotiations when it tries to persuade other countries to cut global - warming emissions .
The 27 groups , including campaigners from India , Brazil , Indonesia , the Philippines and Uganda , say they are " alarmed " that the UK government is considering allowing new coal plants to be built , including one at Kingsnorth in Kent .
They blame emissions from rich countries for causing global warming and the " increased floods , droughts , sea- levels and disease " that threaten the livelihoods of " hundreds of millions of people " .
" Coal power is the most climate - polluting way to generate electricity , " continues the letter .
" New coal power stations in the UK will exacerbate the impacts of climate change on impoverished communities in the south [ ern hemisphere ] ...
A decision to support new coal power stations will confirm the UK as a climate criminal in the international climate - change negotiations . "
The groups oppose the current plans to build coal plants with no equipment for carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , and existing proposals for a " demonstration " of the technology are inadequate , said the World Development Movement , the UK - based poverty campaigning charity which coordinated the letter .
The letter also criticises proposals to offset the carbon dioxide from coal plants by investing in clean technology projects in the developing world through the UN's Clean Development Mechanism , which the groups say has " continuously had negative impacts on communities in the global south while failing to cut emissions " .
Supreme Court Detainee Decision May Not Block Suits Against Top Officials
Created : May 19 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Supreme Court of the United States ( WDCpix )
In denying the right of a Muslim Pakistani immigrant to sue former Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI director Robert Mueller for his prolonged imprisonment and harsh treatment based on his religion and national origin , the Supreme Court on Monday raised the bar for plaintiffs seeking to sue high - level government officials for policies carried out by their subordinates .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
Some in the media have reported that the decision revokes a detainee ’s right to sue a public official for wrongful detention or mistreatment .
In fact , the ruling was tailored narrowly , leaving the door open to such suits in the future .
Yet it remains unclear how specific the plaintiff ’s claims must be for a court to allow the case to proceed against high - level officials who condone unconstitutional practices .
In a sharply divided 5 - 4 opinion , Justice Anthony Kennedy , writing for the majority and joined by the conservative wing of the court , wrote that Javaid Iqbal had not set out sufficient specific facts to present a plausible case .
Iqbal had claimed that after the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks the Justice Department and FBI , led by Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI director Mueller , instituted a policy that resulted in the arrests and mistreatment of thousands of men based solely on their race , religion or national origin .
Iqbal claims that in November 2001 , he was arrested at his Long Island home for using fraudulent identification documents .
He was designated a person “ of high interest , ” however , purely because he is a Muslim from Pakistan , he says .
Iqbal was held for almost six months in extremely restrictive conditions in a maximum security prison in Brooklyn , N.Y. , where he was segregated from the rest of the prison population and confined to a cell for 23 hours a day under a constant , blinding light .
He claims that while there , his jailers “ kicked him in the stomach , punched him in the face , and dragged him across ” his cell without justification ; “ subjected him to serial strip and body - cavity searches when he posed no safety risk to himself or others , ” and “ and refused to let him and other Muslims pray because there would be ‘ [ n ] o prayers for terrorists , ’ ” according to the Supreme Court .
Although most of the mistreatment was allegedly committed by low - level guards and other officials at the prison , Iqbal claims that Ashcroft and Mueller were at the very least aware of the discriminatory detention and treatment and condoned it — or devised it — in violation of his First and Fifth Amendment rights .
Still , the court concluded that “ the complaint does not show , or even intimate , that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU [ the federal prison ] due to their race , religion , or national origin .
All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation ’s top law enforcement officers , in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack , sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity . ”
Since filing his legal complaint , Iqbal ’s lawyers say they ’ve obtained much more evidence that Ashcroft and Mueller were actively involved in developing the policy that led to the discriminatory detention of Muslim immigrants , partly because they were allowed to proceed with the case against the lower level federal defendants .
In addition , three reports from the Office of Inspector General issued in 2003 confirm many of the charges that after Sept. 11 , pursuant to federal policies , Muslim immigrants were rounded up and detained for prolonged periods without justification in harsh conditions , denied access to lawyers , and physically and verbally abused .
But Iqbal and his lawyers did n’t know the exact role of high - level Justice Department and FBI officials when they filed the case .
In fact , plaintiffs usually do n’t have all the evidence when they file a case ; the evidence is usually produced in the course of the litigation .
“ Rarely will you know the inner workings of what happened , especially where the government is trying to keep things secret , such as after 9 - 11 , ” said Alex Reinhardt , a lawyer representing Iqbal in his case and now a professor at Cardozo Law School .
“ If the decision is over - read , it could have significant ramifications , ” he said on Monday .
“ If courts require up front that you know your whole case before you file , it would be impossible to bring most cases . ”
In a vigorous dissent , Justice David Souter , joined by Justices John Paul Stevens , Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , objected to the court ’s imposition of these hurdles to government officials ’ liability .
In their view , the court ’s opinion effectively “ does away with supervisory liability , ” because it implies that even if Ashcroft and Mueller knew that their subordinates were denying prisoners their constitutional rights and condoned it , they would not be legally responsible .
The court does this , Souter wrote , even though Ashcroft and Mueller had conceded that “ they could be held liable on a theory of knowledge and deliberate indifference .
By overriding that concession , the Court denies Iqbal a fair chance to be heard on that question . ”
Lee Gelernt , deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s Immigrant Rights Project , warned on Monday that “ there ’s going to be a tendency to over - read the decision as creating an insurmountable barrier to these kinds of lawsuits .
I think that ’s a mistake .
I do n’t think the court ’s suggesting you need to have detailed knowledge of what high - ranking officials were doing before you can have any discovery .
This case turned in large part on the especially sparse allegations in the complaint , ” he said , noting that much of the evidence supporting those allegations has since been produced .
If they ’d been cited in the case when it was filed , he said , “ I think the court under its plausibility standard would have found it sufficient . ”
Rachel Meeropol , a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights who is representing former prisoners making very similar claims in another case , * Turkmen v. Ashcroft * , said that because the district court allowed her case to move forward , “ we have all of that information that shows high - level official involvement in the practices we ’ve complained of . ”
But when lawyers first bring a case , she said , they ’re usually not in that position .
In cases involving victims of government abuse , then , the court ’s decision “ gives [ government officials ] a sort of practical immunity from suit because only they have the specific information about what actions they may have taken , ” she said .
Souter ’s dissent , interpreting the majority as eliminating supervisory liability , is “ a broad reading of the case , ” she said .
“ I hope it ’s not interpreted as being that far - reaching .
It ’s never been the case that you can hold high - level officials accountable simply because their employees did something wrong , but if they ’re deliberately indifferent to the fact that their subordinates are acting unconstitutionally , that may be the basis for liability .
That basis is called into question by this decision . ”
Although the Supreme Court remanded the case to the court of appeals , which could allow Iqbal to replead his case , the precedent set by the court ’s decision will not be so easily undone .
Four Tibetans have been sentenced to death for starting deadly fires during last year 's unrest in Lhasa , according to China 's state - run media .
The first known death penalty cases in the region since 2002 were handed down yesterday by the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People 's Court .
Tibetan exile groups have condemned the convictions , which they say are politically motivated and carried out without adequate legal safeguards .
According to the Xinhua news agency , Lobsang Gyaltsen will be executed for arson attacks on two garment shops in central Lhasa on 14 March that killed a shop owner .
The same sentence was handed down to Loyak for torching a motorcycle dealership in Deqen Township , which left five people dead , it said .
Suspended death penalties were passed on an accomplice , Kangtsuk , and on Tenzin Phuntsok who reportedly confessed to starting a separate lethal fire .
A fifth defendant is still being tried .
" The three arson cases are among the crimes that led to the worst consequences in the 14 March riot , " the court spokeseman was quoted by Xinhua as saying .
" Their crimes incurred great losses to people 's lives and property and severely undermine the social order , security and stability . "
Free Tibet attacked the sentences , saying that they lacked legal safeguards :
" Today 's report of the imposition of the death penalties in two cases is of huge concern in the light of evidence that has continued to emerge from Tibet since last year , which clearly shows that politically - motivated cases against Tibetans are being mounted in the complete absence of even the most basic legal oversight and due process , " said Free Tibet spokesperson , Matt Whitticase .
" International governments should be demanding immediate access to Chinese courts in Tibet for their consular staff based in Beijing as well as the re-opening of Tibet to the international media . "
China 's state media claimed the trials were open and the defendants were represented by lawyers , but there was no way to assess this claim as access to Tibet is heavily restricted for foreign reporters .

If the alien infestation in EA 's Dead Space did n't scare you , maybe the mega - publisher 's sudden , uncharacteristic willingness to tackle new IP did .
Forget necromorphs , the real danger in the stricken mining space ship USG Ishimura was an EA suit lying in wait to turn the game into something like Lord of the Rings : Gandalf 's Revenge or Harry Potter : Fist - fighting Champions .
Speaking at the Game Developers Conference today , Dead Space 's senior producer Chuck Beaver described the game 's seat - of - the - pants development cycle .
Certainly , being on the cusp of EA 's transformation process was n't easy — in fact , the game did n't get a greenlight from EA execs until one and a half years of development .
Beaver described the project being kept alive by a " aggressive , obnoxious , internal PR campaign , " which included " things we probably should n't have done " including hanging Dead Space posters at events for other games and generally treating the game like it was already OK'd .
In reality , when executive producer Glen Schofield pitched the IP , he was budgeted for only three months .
After that , the game received what Beaver called a " stay of execution " by showing off bite - sized servings of the game every six months .
Tackling new IP was pretty foreign for EA 's Redwood Shores Studio as well .
The developers there had n't got their hands on a new IP since Road Rash was released in 1991 .
But life on a string turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the team .
Beaver said needing to put ideas into code ASAP forces early answers for audio , mission structure , UI and tuning — all elements he warns are often left until it 's too late get the right amount of polish .
" ' Plans ' are worthless .
' Planning ' is priceless , " he said .
" We became quickly aware that the design document is less important than the ideas . "
Beaver said the idea for Dead Space was originally pitched as " Rancid Moon , " a game which would have involved fighting through a moon colony full of escaped criminals .
( As an Easter egg , " Rancid Moon " movie posters can be found in the completed game ) .
But the folks on Schofield 's team hated the prison idea , and they moved on to something a bit more Event Horizon .
Beaver did n't hesitate to admit the game used existing survival - horror games like Resident Evil 4 as a template for what to do with game mechanics like camera control and creating a weapons arsenal for the player .
" They 're like a giant present with a bow on it , " he said .
He urged developers to " fearlessly use standardized features " for a genre and instead concentrate on about five new ways to innovate .
In Dead Space 's case , it was touches like the game 's " HUD - less " design where things like the a health bar and ammo-counter were put on the character himself to help add to immersion .
Beaver 's advice for scaring the pants of people in a game :
1 ) Know the genre : Survival - horror game is n't a high testosterone , alpha - male fantasy fulfillment .
The main character should be a regular person surviving extraordinary circumstances .
That means the character is just like you , maybe weaker .
2) Dread : " Boo ! " scares are cheap , easy to do , but wear out instantly .
Instead focus on a sense of dread , which requires more design , planning , and talent .
3 ) Believability : A player needs a sense of personal association with the character along with events and settings they can relate to .
When doing something science - fiction heavy like Dead Space , the team decided to stay away from " magic " science like teleportation and tried to stick to more readily - believable technology . ®
( CNN ) -- Despite its various setbacks , public bike - sharing is slowly but surely paving the way to a greener urban environment , one city at a time .
Vienna 's Citybike bicycles are easily recognizable in bright yellow and blue .
The concept of community bike - sharing involves an individual checking out a bicycle from one of several public locations ( such as a docked station ) and returning it at another location .
The principle is to provide an alternative or complementary form of public transport to cover short journeys within city limits .
Think reduced carbon - dioxide pollution , smoother traffic flow and a healthier commute .
After all , 94 percent of Parisian bike - sharers can't be wrong .
This is the overwhelming proportion of users who declared themselves satisfied with the world 's most high - profile bike - sharing system in Paris , France , according to a survey done about nine months after its official launch on July 15 , 2007 .
While public - bicycle systems have been popping up progressively around western Europe over the past decade , it was Paris ' Vélib ' that inspired a more global trend .
" Paris showed the world that a substantial bike - sharing fleet can change how people , non-cyclists , in fact , move about a city , " says Paul DeMaio , founder of MetroBike consulting and the man behind the comprehensive Bike - sharing Blog .
For instance , Vélib ' offers a total of 20,600 bicycles ( one per 100 individuals ) at 1,451 stations throughout the city ( every 300 meters ) , making the service both adequate and ubiquitous .
To encourage a high turnover , the first half - hour of cycling is free , with users being charged in increments beginning at 1 euro for every half - hour thereafter .
According to the survey , the average time for a single journey is 18 minutes .
Vélib ' belongs to the currently most common group of " third - generation " systems , in which " smart " bikes are equipped with electronic locking systems verified by credit card , theoretically allowing for better tracking and reduced risk of theft .
Since its launch , Vélib ' claims to have registered some 42 million users , from one - time clients to long - term subscribers , with each bike traveling an average of 10,000 kilometers a year .
" Moral hazard "
However , the double - edged sword of Vélib 's success means that its inevitable flaws have been equally publicized .
Shortcomings include reckless vandalism , theft , unsafe cycling , rude road behavior , and even the deaths of at least three Vélib ' cyclists in traffic .
Most of the damage is shouldered by JCDecaux , the advertising company responsible for keeping the system up and running in exchange for a 10 - year license to exploit 1,600 citywide outdoor displays .
Meanwhile , the City of Paris keeps the revenue from Vélib user fees .
This initial agreement has resulted in ongoing disputes over who should assume financial responsibility for the vandalism and theft of abused bicycles .
DeMaio calls this conflict of interests , characteristic of the advertising model of bike - share funding , a " moral hazard . "
" The advertising company does not benefit from revenues generated by the system as the jurisdiction does , so the advertising company does not have the same incentive to keep the bikes maintained as the jurisdiction would if it were operating the system , " he reasons .
" In fact , the better the advertising company has the bikes maintained , the more expensive it would be , and the less profit they would keep from the advertising contract . "
JCDecaux , which also powers bike - sharing systems in Luxembourg , Brussels , Vienna , Sevilla , Lyon , Marseille and several other cities , is not the only advertising company to grapple financially with municipal administration .
In March 2009 , the Spanish multinational Cemusa reportedly came very close to shutting down Rome 's fledgling 9 - month - old Roma 'n ' Bike after failing to secure a formal contract with the city .
Small - scale starts
Clear Channel Outdoor , the advertising giant behind the SmartBike programs in cities such as Rennes ( since 1998 ) , Oslo , Stockholm , Milan and Barcelona ( with 6,000 bikes reserved for residents only ) has been relatively successful , building up from a smaller scale .
As testimony to Barcelona 's municipal participation to its resident " Bicing " system , the city developed an iPhone application specifically designed to help customers find the nearest available bike , launched in March 2009 .
The company also makes full use of advertising space on the bicycles themselves -- in some cities , even on the mudguards and provided helmets .
Clear Channel Outdoor is also the first outdoor - advertising sponsor to break into the U.S. bike - sharing market with its SmartBike DC program , which has been operating up to 120 bicycles in Washington D.C. since 2008 .
After the city spent the past seven years installing 48 kilometers of bike lanes , the company chose to charge users an annual fee of $ 40 for unlimited use of bikes , up to three hours per journey .
" The advertising - company model can be improved , " says DeMaio , " but I think long - term sustainability would lend itself to the government , quasi - governmental transport provider , university , non-profit , and for - profit models . "
High - tech features
Urban transport providers in particular have been actively implementing bike - sharing programs in close cooperation with municipal governments , often featuring high - tech systems .
Furthermore , most systems are now directly linked to Web sites that update the availability of bikes , and often their location , in real - time .
Rio de Janeiro's Samba bike - sharing system , operated by the Brazilian parking company Mobilicidade , can only be activated by mobile phone , once the customer has registered online .
Furthermore , Samba 's stations are located exclusively along the city 's popular beach promenade of Copacabana , where the system is supported by dedicated bike lanes , as well as the closure of the entire road to motor traffic every Sunday .
Other systems which rely on mobile - phone activation are Deutsche Bahn 's Call a Bike and Nextbike , implemented in German cities such as Berlin , Frankfurt , Cologne , Munich , Stuttgart and Karlsruhe .
While commuters and tourists alike are encouraged to hop on a bike as soon as they get off the train , Nextbike 's advantage is that customers need only call the hotline number to locate the bicycle nearest to them , and then call again when they return it by locking and leaving it anywhere ( i.e. not necessarily at a fixed station ) .
Montreal 's award - winning Bixi system , run by the parking company Stationnement de Montreal and famously designed by Michel Dallaire , has been highly touted for its sleek solar - powered docks equipped with RFID ( radio - frequency identification ) chip readers for wireless ( and thus portable ) connection and operation .
Set to launch in May 2009 with 3,000 bikes at 300 mobile stations , Bixi calls itself a " fourth - generation " system , but for now it is more certainly one to watch .
The Italian bike - sharing company Bicinittà has not only installed solar - powered shelters in cities such as Parma , in April 2009 it inaugurated pedal - assist bicycles in Genoa that help cyclists pedal themselves uphill -- almost one year after its pioneer pedal - assisted program launched in Monaco in February 2008 .
Obstacles
While the bike - sharing concept is no doubt promising in terms of sustainability , DeMaio believes that the biggest obstacles to its success are infrastructure , funding , and liability .
" A jurisdiction must [ already ] have a network of bike infrastructure , such as bike lanes and cycle tracks ( i.e. bike lanes physically separated from motor vehicle traffic ) so that people have safe places to ride , " he begins .
" Funding is the next obstacle , as the capital cost of system implementation is about $ 3,600 per bike , which includes the stations and back - end system , plus another roughly $ 3,000 per bike annually for ongoing maintenance and distribution costs -- still cheaper than creating a streetcar line or subway station .
" Liability is the third major obstacle , especially in more litigious societies such as the U.S. , as insurers are hesitant to insure programs . "
But just as obstacles can be overcome in time , perhaps it will be the popularity of cycling culture itself that contributes most significantly to reducing motor - vehicle traffic and pollution in the long run .
VANCOUVER , Washington ( CNN ) --
When 13 - year - old Alycia Nipp did n't come home from a trip to Wal - Mart , her family had no idea where she was , but a tracking device was transmitting the location of her alleged killer .
Alycia Nipp , 13 , was a free spirit , her aunt says , and liked to collect neon drinking straws .
The quirky seventh - grader , who went by " Licy , " could tell you the origin of every neon drinking straw in her collection and she " sewed buttons on everything , " said her aunt , Amber Hager .
Her family thinks her free - spirited nature may be the reason she walked through a field popular with transients -- a field she 'd been warned to stay away from and where her body was found February 22 .
Licy 's family had reason to be cautious .
Hager was raped twice as a teen and Licy 's grandmother was kidnapped as a child , Hager said , so the family was extra vigilant with Licy and Hager 's young daughters .
" We all made Licy the promise that it would never happen to her .
The cycle would end , " said Hager , who is acting as family spokeswoman .
" Now we 're left wondering : What did n't we say ?
What did n't we do ?
How come she did n't listen ? "

Darrin Sanford , 30 , was one of several homeless people living near the field in an abandoned home slated for demolition , police said .
He was convicted in 1998 of communicating with a minor for immoral purposes and luring minors with sexual motivation ; he was sentenced to probation , said a Clark County sheriff 's report .
When he was released from jail in January , following a November probation violation , Sanford was fitted with a global positioning tracking unit on his ankle , according to the Washington Department of Corrections .

Sanford was wearing the device seven weeks later when he tried to rape Licy before beating and stabbing her in a field a couple of blocks from the street where she lived , according to police .
Authorities said they used GPS to corroborate Sanford 's confession .
A Clark County judge this week postponed his arraignment until June so the defense and prosecution can prepare for death penalty arguments .
Sanford 's defense attorney Michael Foister declined to comment on the allegations against his client .
Debate over GPS
The slaying rocked the enclave of Hazel Dell in Vancouver , a 15 - minute drive from Portland , Oregon , and serves as fodder for those who claim GPS is used too broadly and bluntly as a tool for keeping tabs on offenders .
" They can't monitor it live , and even if you could monitor it live , him being in the field would n't have told you [ if ] he was murdering the girl , " said Evan Mayo - Wilson , an Oxford University lecturer who has studied the use of GPS .
There are two types of GPS monitoring : active , in which the offender 's whereabouts are surveyed in real - time , and passive , in which probation or parole officers check an offender 's movements after the fact .
Sanford was passively monitored , said Anmarie Aylward , the Washington DOC 's program administrator .

Sanford 's History Darrin Eugene Sanford was convicted in 1998 of communicating with a minor for immoral purposes and two counts of luring minors with sexual motivation .
He was placed on probation , which he violated three times before he was arrested in connection with Alycia Nipp 's murder :  On November 15 , 2006 , Sanford was jailed for failing to register as a sex offender .
He was released July 31 , 2008 , and ordered to wear a GPS anklet .

He was then detained August 20 for being in contact with a minor and failing to register .
He was released October 19 , again with an ankle bracelet .

On November 24 , authorities arrested Sanford for a misdemeanor property violation .
He was released with a GPS device January 3 , just 49 days before Licy 's murder .

Both types of GPS are important tools for law enforcement , Mayo - Wilson said , but the technology must be coupled with other efforts to reduce recidivism , including treatment programs , personal visits and interviews with neighbors , family members and employers .
Sex offenders should be assessed on a case - by - case basis , and supervision programs must be based on fluid assessments that weigh the likelihood of reoffense , said Peter Ibarra , a sociologist at the University of Illinois - Chicago who studies the use of GPS in stalking and domestic violence cases .
" You have to use it very responsibly , " Ibarra said .
" It 's a technology that cannot stand alone , especially if you 're thinking about using it with offenders who imperil the public . "
Sanford was registered as a Level 3 sex offender , the category considered most likely to reoffend , according to the Clark County Sheriff 's Office .
He was listed as homeless on the state sex offender registry , one of 34 transient sex offenders in Clark County .
There are eight homeless Level 3 offenders registered in Clark County .

Sanford was living in a vacant home near an overgrown field where Licy 's parents sometimes played paintball .
The field , littered with trash , has " No Dumping " signs along its periphery and is buttressed by fast - food joints , Chinese restaurants and strip malls .
The air smells of frying oil .
Resident Nick Holden , whose daughter was Licy 's friend , told The Oregonian newspaper that the field was a popular shortcut -- " a kid highway . "
Though it was n't necessarily deemed unsafe , he told the paper , " you ask the kids to not go alone . "
Licy was told just that , but on February 21 , as she and a friend returned from Wal - Mart , Licy said she wanted to cut through the field .
Her friend declined , Hager said .
Police : Sanford unsure of his weapon
Sanford told detectives he met Licy near the vacant homes and walked with her to an isolated area of the field , police said .
There , he attempted to have intercourse with her " but was n't able to complete the sexual act , " according to the probable cause affidavit filed in court .
Watch Sanford 's mother say she wishes he was dead »
" After she giggled at him , " continued the affidavit , " he was overcome with a violent rage and hit her with something in the back .
She turned to face him and he kept hitting her , knocking her to the ground . "
Sanford told police he was n't sure what he hit her with -- maybe a stick , knife or beer bottle , the affidavit said .
The 180 - pound Sanford left the body but came back later and moved Licy , a scant 100 pounds , to an area where her stepfather found her early the next morning , according to the affidavit .
" His GPS unit verified that he was in the area and his movements , " the affidavit said .
Attempts by CNN to reach Licy 's mother and stepfather , Maranda and Jason Hannah , were unsuccessful .
On the day before his 20th birthday in 1998 , Sanford was placed on probation .
According to a sheriff 's office report , a group of minors , ages 8 to 11 , reported that Sanford had offered them money for oral sex .
The youngsters fled , but Sanford approached them again in a sparsely wooded area of the playground , asking them if they wanted to go home with him to " play house , " the report said .
Sanford violated his probation three times between November 2006 and November 2008 , the DOC said .
When he was released in January , he was required to check in daily with a probation officer , which he did the day before Licy 's murder and the day after her body was found .
Technology , offenders misunderstood
Experts say GPS can create a false sense of security because its capabilities are overestimated .
Jill Levenson , an associate professor of human sciences at Lynn University in Boca Raton , Florida , said many people believe it is " some magic bullet or panacea that prevents crimes . "
Levenson also concurs with other experts who say the technology is used too sweepingly .
Twenty - seven states have some mandatory requirement that the devices be used on sex offenders , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Only six states have no specific provisions for such monitoring .
See data »
Most sex offenders are neither violent nor pedophiles , and they re-offend in about one of 20 cases , said Levenson , who studies sex crime policy .
Because the media focus on the most sensational crimes , politicians often focus their energies on combating the violent incidents rather than the more common occurrences , such as people being sexually assaulted by those they know , she said .
UIC 's Ibarra called it a " knee - jerk reaction " by lawmakers .
He said he notices that " legislators often propose this kind of [ GPS ] requirement in the aftermath of some notorious act . "
Added Oxford 's Mayo - Wilson , " [ GPS ] could be used effectively to help shape behavior , but it 's being used too bluntly . "
GPS is more likely to work with low - level offenders while the technology 's deterrent effect on the most dangerous perpetrators is limited , Levenson said .

" [ GPS ] is not necessarily going to deter people from having sexually deviant intentions , " she said .
" Many crimes are more impulsive and opportunistic , and that level of thinking may not go into it . "
Homelessness itself poses problems among sex offenders because unstable living conditions can increase recidivism , Levenson said .
Many states have enacted laws limiting where sex offenders can live , forcing more offenders to the streets .
According to a 2007 report by the Council of State Governments , 29 states have residency restrictions for sex offenders .
Washington , which the DOC says is home to about 300 homeless sex offenders , forbids them from living within 880 feet of a school or daycare .
An example of residency restrictions exacerbating the problem is in California , said Robert Coombs of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault .
Since 2007 , when California implemented its version of Jessica 's Law -- which bars registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school , park or places where children congregate -- homelessness among paroled sex offenders spiked 800 percent , Coombs said .
In large metro areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco , " the concentration of schools and parks is so high , the entire jurisdiction becomes largely off limits for housing , " Coombs said .
The Justice Department did not respond to repeated requests to discuss the number of homeless sex offenders in the nation , but in California there are about 65,000 registered sex offenders , of which 3,267 are homeless , according to California 's Sex Offender Management Board .
It 's not only costly and unfeasible to monitor sex offenders , but allowing them to remain homeless increases their stress levels and instability , Coombs said .
It makes for a " really dangerous cocktail when it comes to public safety , " he said .
Connecticut reviews GPS policy
Bill Carbone , executive director of the Court Support Services Division of Connecticut 's Judicial Branch , said the state recently reviewed its use of GPS .
Connecticut , which monitors more than 2,000 offenders , revamped its GPS monitoring after acknowledging the technology had its shortcomings , including error messages , lost signals and susceptibility to manipulation , Carbone said .
Coombs and Carbone also note that charging the devices can be problematic when the offender has no home .
" To some extent , it 's been oversold and misunderstood , " Carbone said .
" I think it is a tool -- not the sole tool -- needed for proper supervision of offenders . "
Hager said she is pleased authorities were able to use Sanford 's GPS bracelet to make a swift arrest in her niece 's slaying , but it makes her angry that a homeless , convicted sex offender was allowed to hang out in a field frequented by children .
Licy 's family may never know why she cut through the field , and many other questions about her murder may remain unanswered .
Hager said her niece 's accused killer should answer one of them .
" My daughters keep asking , ' Why did the angels take Licy ?
If we pray hard enough will they bring her back ? ' " Hager said .
" I just want to tell him , ' You explain to my daughters what happened to their cousin . ' "

Canadian Parliament Votes To Include Seal Skin On Olympic Uniforms
The 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver are less than a year away , but the controversy is starting now .
Today , the Canadian Parliament voted unanimously to support a motion calling for the government to seek ways to include seal pelts on the country ’s Olympic uniforms .
It seems that the Canadian government is not happy that the European Union has banned Canada ’s seal hunt , and they have passed this motion in response .
Bloc Quebec MP Raynald Blais said , “ With the upcoming Winter Olympics that will be in Vancouver in 2010 , the government has a chance to offer some concrete action to promote seal products .
Today we are tabling a motion aimed at studying the possibility to integrate into the Canadian athletes ’ uniforms .
Is the government ready to act to save an industry ? ”
Not everyone in Canada is happy with this vote , however .
The seal skin measure is purely political , something that is strongly frowned upon in regard to any Olympic Games .
Canadian Olympic Committee president Mike Chambers was against including seal in the uniforms for this reason , as well as because it might harm athletes performance .
Presumably , Chambers is imaging that the government - created uniforms would look like the San Francisco Giants ’ mascot , Lou Seal .
Chambers said :
“ I ’m used to those in the political arena wishing to attach their issues to the Olympic arena .
But this is one … that will not and cannot be allowed to occur .
It ’s our intent for our athletes to remain free of the politics that arises in and around the Olympic Games .
The seal issue , while important , is an issue that has become politicized . ”
He added :
“ There are political issues all over the world .
If the IOC started allowing a patch on everyone ’s uniform we ’d all look like FI speed racers .
Let the politics do the political thing and keep the sport to the games . ”
That is 100 % correct .
If every nation started to incorporate controversial political elements in their uniforms , that could get ugly .
Imagine if the U.S. team added dead Iraqis to their Olympic uniforms as snub toward countries who had not supported the invasion of Iraq .
While that ’s of course taking it to an unlikely extreme , political statements made by one nation at the Olympics completely undermine the notion of the world coming together for the event .
Whether you are pro-seal hunting or against it , it should have no place in the Olympic games .

More than 80 allegations have been made about G20 police violence
A police officer is being investigated after allegedly writing on a website that he was keen to " bash some long haired hippies " at the G20 protest .
Pc Rob Ward apparently put the note on Facebook on the evening of 1 April , the first day of City of London protests .
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said : " The matter has been recorded and will be investigated appropriately . "
Pc Ward received a written warning but has not been suspended as the inquiry takes place , a police spokesman said .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) received 185 complaints about police behaviour at the protests .
' Ca n't wait '
The police officer 's profile page on social networking site Facebook contained a message apparently written by Pc Ward at 2017 BST on 1 April .
It stated : " Rob Ward ca n't wait to bash some long haired hippys up @ the G20 . "
Twenty minutes later another Facebook user posted a reply that said : " Dats bad but good in da same way lol [ laugh out loud ] . "
The message was later removed from Pc Ward 's Facebook page .
The police spokesman said officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards would carry out the initial assessment in the investigation .
Pc Ward could face disciplinary action over the message .
' Canteen culture '
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " There is clearly a worry about the canteen culture of some parts of the Met , which this Facebook posting feeds . "
The IPCC received more than 80 complaints from people who said they were assaulted or witnessed an assault by police during the G20 protests .
It also received more than 50 complaints about police tactics .
Ian Tomlinson , a 47 - year - old newspaper vendor , died minutes after he was pushed over by a policeman during the demonstrations on 1 April .
The police officer at the centre of that allegation has been suspended and interviewed under caution on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the death .
Survivalist : Left of center now joining our ' growing ' movement Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday January 30 , 2009

One - time preserve of anti-establishment loners , cultists and gun nuts has gone mainstream
Sick of worrying about the future ?
Then spare a thought for Jim Rawles .
Rawles , 48 , is one of a rising number of " survivalists " --
Americans hunkering down for what they predict will be a nightmare of economic failure , mass terrorism , pandemics and social chaos .
" The movement 's definitely growing , " Rawles , manager of the site survivalblog.com , told AFP by telephone from what he described as a survival - ready ranch " somewhere west of the Rocky Mountains . "
Survivalists have a long history in the United States .
But what used to be the preserve of anti-establishment loners , cultists and gun nuts has gone mainstream .
Government agencies are encouraging citizens to prepare evacuation plans and food supplies in case of myriad disasters .
Firearms , gold pieces , and long - storage food are reportedly flying off the shelves , and the Internet is flooded with sites like survivalblog.com , where the like - minded exchange tips on everything from marksmanship to cheese making .
" We 're seeing three times the number of readers we had just nine months ago , " Rawles said .
" The cross section of the readership is changing too .
Before , most of my readership was conservative Christians .
We 're seeing a lot more left of center . "
Experts say sparks for this phenomenon include the 9/11 attacks of 2001 , government incompetence during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , and now recession : people are more afraid and less trusting in government .
The more radical survivalists are getting ready for what they call EOTWAA , the End - Of - The - World - Armageddon - Apocalypse , or the niftier SHTF , as in Shit Hits The Fan .
Some literally expect the world to end .
They have a date : December 21 , 2012 , which is based on expiry of an ancient Mayan calendar and predictions of rare astronomical activity .
Others are readying for economic and social breakdown , the kind of anarchic existence depicted in the " Mad Max " films , or , more recently , in Cormac McCarthy 's poetic , terrifying novel " The Road . "
One hardcore survivalist reached by email via a specialist website told AFP : " The vast majority of such folks are simply trying to become less dependent ... and not dependent at all on help from the government if a crisis / disaster was to ever occur . "
Reflecting the secrecy , if not outright paranoia , common in the milieu , this survivalist ended the message abruptly : " We have no wish to continue communications . "
A survivalist who agreed to answer emailed questions , but only gave his first name Jon , told AFP he has a farm and is moving into " a bigger , stronger , castle - type structure ... in the immediate near future . "
The survivalist , who said he is currently with the US military in Iraq , is stocking " arms , ammo , food , livestock , equipment , etc . "
" SHTF could be a natural disaster , a terrorist attack , something which again would cause panic and rioting , lawlessness , and thus , put my family at risk . "
These fears may seem over the top to some , but they are increasingly part of the social landscape .
National Geographic Channel runs a television series called " Aftermath : Population Zero , " examining what the world would be like without humans .
" Imagine if one minute from now , every single person on Earth disappeared , " the show asks .
An interactive website lets you do just that , annihilating New York and other landmarks at the click of the mouse .
Publishers have also jumped in .
Among the many books on the subject is " Wealth , War and Wisdom " by Barton Biggs , a former chief global strategist for Morgan Stanley .
He offers commonsense advice like setting aside money for medicine , seeds , and canned food .
Websites hawk vacuum - packed food , camping gear , medical triage kits and respiratory gear .
Many also feature information clearly aimed at beginners .
Need to survive a tsunami ?
" Stay away from the beach , " survival - warehouse.com helpfully advises .
Big government bureaucracies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security want people to prepare for trouble , even if there is no official mention of EOTWAA and SHTF .
The ready.gov website urges citizens to store at least three days ' worth of water and food , to prepare an escape plan from their city , and to have means of filtering out contaminated air .
" Practice earthquake and tornado drills at home , school and work , " ready.gov says , also warning that pets will not be allowed into public evacuation centers .
New York - based specialist Aton Edwards says the government 's stand proves survivalists were right all along .
" People ran away from it at first , saying it was alarmist and fearmongering .
They did n't realize that the government is saying much the same thing , " he said .
Yet Rawles estimates that not more than five percent of Americans are ready -- at least by his high standards .
" I 'm surrounded by national forest .
A river runs through the back end of the property , so there 's no shortage of water and no shortage of fish or game to shoot , " he told AFP .
" If Western civilization were to collapse tomorrow , I 'd have to read about it on the Internet .
I just would n't notice . "
Krauthammer 's Asterisks
Charles Krauthammer , in his Washington Post opinion column this morning , tries to find loopholes for impermissible evil .
" Torture is an impermissible evil .
Except under two circumstances , " he writes .
" The first is the ticking time bomb .
An innocent 's life is at stake .
The bad guy you have captured possesses information that could save this life .
He refuses to divulge .
In such a case , the choice is easy . "
Actually , no .
The ticking time bomb scenario only exists in two places :
On TV and in the dark fantasies of power - crazed and morally deficient authoritarians .
In real life , things are never that certain .
And trained interrogators say that even in the most extreme circumstances , traditional methods are the most effective .
Krauthammer continues : " Some people , however , believe you never torture .
Ever .
They are akin to conscientious objectors who will never fight in any war under any circumstances , and for whom we correctly show respect by exempting them from war duty .
But we would never make one of them Centcom commander . "
Actually , no .
They are normal people who share the post - World War II international consensus that " recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world . "
Indeed , the idea of putting someone without a healthy respect for human rights at Centcom is abhorrent -- unless of course you believe that human rights do n't matter .
Krauthamer : " The second exception to the no-torture rule is the extraction of information from a high - value enemy in possession of high - value information likely to save lives .
This case lacks the black - and - white clarity of the ticking time bomb scenario .
We know less about the length of the fuse or the nature of the next attack .
But we do know the danger is great . "
This of course is a blatant post - facto attempt at rationalizing the ( inevitable ) misdiagnosis of the ticking time bomb scenario .
Now all of a sudden the standards are lower .
Krauthammer is advocating fishing expeditions -- with a waterboard .
" Under those circumstances , you do what you have to do . "
Krauthammer 's core argument then is that the ends justify the means .
He quotes two former CIA officials , both deeply invested in covering their asses , who unsurprisingly insist that torture worked .
But none of the claims they or others in the complicit chain of command have made held up under even modest public scrutiny .
And he mocks the idea put forth by President Obama on Wednesday -- and supported by people who actually have experience in interrogation , rather than in watching TV and fantasizing about being Jack Bauer -- that traditional interrogation techniques are extremely effective .
For instance , he writes : " KSM , the mastermind of 9/11 who knew more about more plots than anyone else , did not seem very inclined to respond to polite inquiries about future plans .
The man who boasted of personally beheading Daniel Pearl with a butcher knife answered questions about plots with ' soon you will know ' -- meaning , when you count the bodies in the morgue and find horribly disfigured burn victims in hospitals , you will know then what we are planning now . "
But as Scott Shane recently pointed out in the New York Times , with more than a little understatement : " Mr. Mohammed , captured on March 1 , 2003 , was waterboarded 183 times that month .
That striking number , which would average out to six waterboardings a day , suggests that interrogators did not try a traditional , rapport - building approach for long before escalating to their most extreme tool . "
And almost nobody who knows anything about the Pearl case ( see , for instance , Lawrence Wright and Peter Bergen ) actually thinks KSM -- who confessed to the killing after being tortured -- had anything to do with it .
Torture after all is really only good at one thing : eliciting false confessions .
That we got plenty of from KSM .
But his " soon you will know " boast was all bluster -- sort of like Saddam Hussein 's claim to have nuclear capability .
( " Responding to bluster with war crimes " -- there 's a great motto for an administration . )
Nothing KSM said came close to thwarting any imminent attack .
One hundred and eighty three waterboarding sessions later , the " bodies in the morgue " and the " horribly disfigured burn victims " were still only a fantasy of the torturers -- and certain opinion columnists .
Krauthammer : " The other problem is one of timing .
The good cop routine can take weeks or months or years .
We did n't have that luxury in the aftermath of 9/11 when waterboarding , for example , was in use . "
But his compacting of the timeline is shameless revisionism .
Top officials of the Bush administration -- and yes , I 'm looking at you , Mr. Cheney -- panicked .
And they continued to panic after any excuse for panic was long over .
Waterboarding was conducted over a period of several months , long after 9/11 -- from August 2002 at least through March 2003 .
Other torture tactics were widely employed in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo over a period of years .
Legal memos defending various forms of torture were being commissioned by the White House until virtually the end of the Bush administration .
And in his final defense , Krauthammer argues that the lack of objections at the time from Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress who were briefed on interrogation policies is proof that " at the time the information was important enough , the danger great enough and our blindness about the enemy 's plans severe enough to justify an exception to the moral injunction against torture . "
Precisely what members of Congress were told and how they responded should absolutely be a part of any thorough official investigation into the abuses of the Bush years .
The enablers must be exposed as surely as the complicit .
And members of Congress who knew what was happening and remained silent must be held to public account for their moral cowardice .
But their failure to speak out does not change the fundamental moral equation .
If the United States is to live up to its core values , if it is to once again be a beacon of human rights to the world and a champion of human dignity , then when it comes to torture -- to impermissible evil , as Krauthammer himself puts it -- there can be no asterisks .
Back in 2001 , I had picked up a Jampack Summer demo disc .
After checking out the demos available , I came across a game I had n’t heard of before and it turned out to be the shining star of that demo disc .
That game was ICO .
The demo had me immediately smitten with the first title coming out of the new studio , Team ICO .
When ICO was finally released in September of 2001 , it was a day one purchase .
From that point on , I eagerly awaited their next title .
When the first details of Shadow of Colossus was shown the gaming community was in a frenzy .
And when it finally dropped in October of 2005 the game received rave reviews , and for good reason .
Ever since then PlayStation fans have been drooling for any bit of info they could get on Team ICO ’s first leap into the next generation of PlayStation with the PS3 .
We have seen what they had done with the limited PlayStation 2 hardware , so having resources such as the cell , and blu - ray fans are expecting an even more impressive showing this time around .
Team ICO is led by famed game designer Fumito Ueda .
Ueda , being scheduled to speak at this years GDC back in March , had fans awaiting some type of announcement .
However nothing was shown .
When Ueda was asked about the upcoming project , he had this to say …
The Japan studio bosses are here so I ca n’t say anything specific , but it might be something similar to what ’s been done . …
The essence of the game is rather close to ‘ Ico .
– Fumito Ueda , Team ICO , GDC 2009
Up until now , the only image that has been released about Team ICO ’s next game is a single image of a chain hanging down what appears to be a well .
Today we help lift the curtain off of this project a bit and shed some light on what Fumito Ueda has been up to these past few years and as you will see , it is rather close to ICO .
This is very early footage the next game from Team ICO .
As with most early footage you can expect graphical enhancements for the final product .
Some of these elements , such as the main character , or scenarios you see here may not make the final cut .

In January , at a symposium at UCLA ( choreographed by the Center for Near East Studies ) , four longtime Israel bashers were invited to analyze the human rights conditions in Gaza , and used the stage to attack the legitimacy of Zionism and its vision of a two - state solution for Israel and the Palestinians .
They criminalized Israel ’s existence , distorted its motives and maligned its character , its birth , even its conception .
At one point , the excited audience reportedly chanted “ Zionism is Nazism ” and worse .
Jewish leaders condemned this hate - fest as a dangerous invitation to anti-Semitic hysteria , and pointed to the chilling effect it had on UCLA students and faculty on a campus known for its open and civil atmosphere .
The organizers , some of them Jewish , took refuge in “ academic freedom ” and the argument that anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism .
I fully support this mantra , not because it exonerates anti-Zionists from charges of anti-Semitism but because the distinction helps us focus attention on the discriminatory , immoral and more dangerous character of anti-Zionism .
Anti-Zionism rejects the very notion that Jews are a nation -- a collective bonded by a common history -- and , accordingly , denies Jews the right to self - determination in their historical birthplace .
It seeks the dismantling of the Jewish nation - state : Israel .
Anti-Zionism earns its discriminatory character by denying the Jewish people what it grants to other historically bonded collectives ( e.g. French , Spanish , Palestinians ) , namely , the right to nationhood , self - determination and legitimate coexistence with other indigenous claimants .
Anti-Semitism rejects Jews as equal members of the human race ; anti-Zionism rejects Israel as an equal member in the family of nations .
Are Jews a nation ?
Some philosophers would argue Jews are a nation first and religion second .
Indeed , the narrative of Exodus and the vision of the impending journey to the land of Canaan were etched in the minds of the Jewish people before they received the Torah at Mt. Sinai .
But , philosophy aside , the unshaken conviction in their eventual repatriation to the birthplace of their history has been the engine behind Jewish endurance and hopes throughout their turbulent journey that started with the Roman expulsion in AD 70 .
More important , shared history , not religion , is today the primary uniting force behind the secular , multiethnic society of Israel .
The majority of its members do not practice religious laws and do not believe in divine supervision or the afterlife .
The same applies to American Jewry , which is likewise largely secular .
Identification with a common historical ethos , culminating in the reestablishment of the state of Israel , is the central bond of Jewish collectivity in America .
There are of course Jews who are non-Zionists and even anti-Zionists .
The ultra-Orthodox cult of Neturei Karta and the leftist cult of Noam Chomsky are notable examples .
The former rejects any earthly attempt to interfere with God ’s messianic plan , while the latter abhors all forms of nationalism , especially successful ones .
There are also Jews who find it difficult to defend their identity against the growing viciousness of anti-Israel propaganda , and eventually hide , disown or denounce their historical roots in favor of social acceptance and other expediencies .
But these are marginal minorities at best ; the vital tissues of Jewish identity today feed on Jewish history and its natural derivatives -- the state of Israel , its struggle for survival , its cultural and scientific achievements and its relentless drive for peace .
Given this understanding of Jewish nationhood , anti-Zionism is in many ways more dangerous than anti-Semitism .
First , anti-Zionism targets the most vulnerable part of the Jewish people , namely , the Jewish population of Israel , whose physical safety and personal dignity depend crucially on maintaining Israel ’s sovereignty .
Put bluntly , the anti-Zionist plan to do away with Israel condemns 5 1/ 2 million human beings , mostly refugees or children of refugees , to eternal defenselessness in a region where genocidal designs are not uncommon .
Secondly , modern society has developed antibodies against anti-Semitism but not against anti-Zionism .
Today , anti-Semitic stereotypes evoke revulsion in most people of conscience , while anti-Zionist rhetoric has become a mark of academic sophistication and social acceptance in certain extreme yet vocal circles of U.S. academia and media elite .
Anti-Zionism disguises itself in the cloak of political debate , exempt from sensitivities and rules of civility that govern inter-religious discourse , to attack the most cherished symbol of Jewish identity .
Finally , anti-Zionist rhetoric is a stab in the back to the Israeli peace camp , which overwhelmingly stands for a two - state solution .
It also gives credence to enemies of coexistence who claim that the eventual elimination of Israel is the hidden agenda of every Palestinian .
It is anti-Zionism , then , not anti-Semitism that poses a more dangerous threat to lives , historical justice and the prospects of peace in the Middle East .

I ’ve been following the “ Rails pr0n star ” scandal , probably too closely for my own good , and making my share of grumpy twitter comments .
Let me just get the standing and being counted out of the way first :
I found the slides in question entertaining and cleverly put together , but inappropriate for their context .
But moreover , I found the reaction of DHH and other prominent members of the Rails community distressing and distasteful .
It shows a lack of maturity to be unable to distinguish between sensitivity and censorship .
I ’ve been involved with Ruby since years before Rails came along , and this is emphatically not the warm , humble , encouraging Ruby community I know and love .
That said , I want to talk about something else .
I want to talk about a couple of terms that I feel have been unfairly besmirched as this mess developed .
The first term is “ Rock Star “ .
Nearly every blog post I ’ve read about how sucky the Rails community is has put the blame on the “ rock star ” stereotype .
I do n’t think this is fair to rock stars .
What programmer has not , at one time or another , committed a righteous act of transcendent coding and been seized with the urge to run down the hall screaming “ WHO RULES ?
THAT’S RIGHT I RULE , BABY ! FUCK YEAH ! ” and then do an air - guitar solo on top of their desk ?
Come on , you all know what I ’m talking about .
In decades past when a Joe Hacker got this feeling it was quickly quashed by the realisation that he was a mere geek , a permanent social pariah , and that such displays of blatant self - confidence were simply not for him .
So he ’d tamp it down , open another Mt. Dew , and slink back into his cave .
But something happened at the dawn of the 21st century .
Geek started to become cool .
Hollywood started making blockbusters out of comic books .
Programmers started writing programs for the web that made ordinary people happy and got them laid , rather than just irritating the living hell out of them at their day job .
That made programmers kind of cool .
And the programmer demographic itself started changing .
Suddenly it was possible to go to a users group meeting and talk to people who not only dug obscure programming languages and D&D , but also playing the guitar and snowboarding .
The fact that you wrote code for fun stopped being something to hide from potential dates , and started being something that might actually help score you a date
Joe Hacker looked out over the rim of his cubicle and realized “ hey !
I am pretty awesome !
And it ’s OK to feel good about that ! ”
And then he moved out of his parents ’ basement .
Being a programming rock star is about empowerment .
It ’s about pride .
It ’s about knowing that you ’re not just another cog in a corporate wheel or an academic wanker , but an artisan with the power to change people ’s lives with nothing but information .
It ’s about hearing “ this is gonna be a great party – be sure and bring your laptop “ .
It ’s about embracing the electricity of that “ eureka ” moment and sharing it with other people who understand the feeling .
But rock stars are supposed to be “ bad boys ” , right ?
Sure ; but chest - beating about being “ edgy ” does not make you a bad - ass .
If anyone knows about being a bad - boy rock star in the Rubyverse it ’s Giles ; and he was n’t impressed .
Neither were Zed or Obie .
To quote Reg Braithwaite :
Porn is * not* edgy .
Walking into Oracle ’s Head Office and shitting on their conference table is edgy .
Matt ’s talk was n’t rock star behaviour , and the defensiveness and posturing that followed it were even less so .
It was just plain old garden - variety immaturity .
The second term I want to defend is “ professional “ .
DHH does n’t seem to think much of it :
Professional to me is facade , fake sincerity , political correctness , not offending anyone , and everything else that makes life lifeless
Spend some time with any real - life career rock star – the kind with groupies and a dozen guitars - and I ’ll wager you ’ll find that whatever else they are , they are a deeply professional musician .
Professionalism is orthogonal to “ edginess ” .
I know edgy people .
I mean really edgy people .
People who play with fire and get suspended from hooks for fun .
People who do things in private to other people for both business and pleasure , things which are beyond the scope of this technical blog to describe .
These people are nothing if not professional about the things they do .
They have careful rules about when and where .
They are profoundly mindful of boundaries , and painstakingly sensitive .
They have to be .
It ’s the same for any practitioner of an extreme sport – beyond the gung - ho , devil - may - care veneer , you will almost always find someone with a finely honed sense of where to draw the line , of what their limitations are , and most importantly , the ability to listen .
There are always exceptions , of course .
In any given “ fringe ” community there ’s always a few irresponsible characters .
They are the ones who wind up getting ostracised from the group because their cavalier attitude threatens everyone else ’s enjoyment and / or safety .
So I do n’t think that word “ professional ” means what he think it means .
I think what he really means is “ corporate ” , which is a whole different animal .
As for me , I still aspire to be both professional and a rock star , both in code and in music .
And I do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with that .
UPDATE : I will moderate any more comments that try to argue the case that people overreacted to the slides .
That debate is both irrelevant and over .
To quote Martin Fowler :
At this point there ’s an important principle .
I ca n’t choose whether someone is offended by my actions .
I can choose whether I care .
The nub is that whatever the presenter may think , people were offended – both in the talk and those who saw the slides later .
It does n’t matter whether or not you think the slides were pornographic .
The question is does the presenter , and the wider community , care that women feel disturbed , uncomfortable , marginalized and a little scared .
This is a post about the meanings of the terms “ rock star ’ and “ professional ” .
Anyone who wants to debate the meaning of the term “ porn ” is welcome to take it up with Justice Potter Stewart .

A number of popular arguments for dualism start from a premise about an epistemic gap between physical truths about truths about consciousness , and infer an ontological gap between physical processes and consciousness .
Arguments of this sort include the conceivability argument , the knowledge argument , the explanatory - gap argument , and the property dualism argument .
Such arguments are often resisted on the grounds that epistemic premises do not entail ontological conclusion .
My view is that one can legitimately infer ontological conclusions from epistemic premises , if one is careful about how one reasons .
To do so , the best way is to reason first from epistemic premises to modal conclusions ( about necessity and possibility ) , and from there to ontological conclusions .
Here , the crucial issue is the link between the epistemic and modal domains .
How can one reason from theses about what is knowable or conceivable to theses about what is necessary or possible ?
To bridge the epistemic and modal domains , the framework of two - dimensional semantics can play a central role .
I have used this framework in earlier work ( Chalmers 1996 ) to mount an argument against materialism .
Here , I want to revisit the argument , laying it out in a more explicit and careful form , and responding to a number of objections .
In what follows I will concentrate mostly on the conceivability argument .
I think that very similar considerations apply to the other arguments mentioned above , however .
In the final section of the paper , I show how this analysis might yield a unified treatment of a number of anti-materialist arguments .
1 The Conceivability Argument
The most straightforward form of the conceivability argument against materialism runs as follows .
(1) P&~Q is conceivable ( 2 ) If P&~Q is conceivable , P&~Q is metaphysically possible ( 3 ) If P&~Q is metaphysically possible , materialism is false .
( 4 ) Materialism is false .
Here P is the conjunction of all microphysical truths about the universe , specifying the fundamental features of every fundamental microphysical entity in the language of microphysics .
Q is an arbitrary phenomenal truth : perhaps the truth that someone is phenomenally conscious , or perhaps the truth that a certain individual ( that is , an individual satisfying a certain description ) instantiates a certain phenomenal property .
P&~Q conjoins the former with the denial of the latter .
If Q is the truth that someone is phenomenally conscious , then P&~Q is the statement that everything is microphysically as in our world , but no - one is phenomenally conscious .
In this version , P&~Q says that the world is a zombie world .
If Q is the truth that a certain individual instantiates a certain phenomenal property , then P&~Q is the statement that everything is microphysically as in our world , but that it is not the case that the individual in question instantiates the relevant phenomenal property .
In this case , it will suffice for the truth of P&~Q that the world is a zombie world , or simply that the individual in question is a zombie in a physically identical world .
It will also suffice that the individual in question is an invert , who has an experience that differs slightly from the corresponding experience of the corresponding individual in our ( physically identical ) world .
The first premise of this argument asserts an epistemic thesis , about what can be conceived .
The second premise steps from the epistemic thesis to a modal thesis , about what is possible .
The third premise steps from the modal thesis to a metaphysical thesis , about the nature of our world .
The third premise is relatively uncontroversial .
It is widely accepted that materialism has modal commitments .
Some philosophers question whether materialism is equivalent to a modal thesis , but almost all accept that materialism at least entails a modal thesis .
Here one can invoke Kripke 's metaphor : if it is possible that there is a world physically identical to our world but phenomenally different , then after God fixed the physical facts about our world , he had to do more work to fix the phenomenal facts .
A familiar complication arises from the observation that physicalism about our world is compatible with the possibility of dualism in other worlds , and in particular is compatible with the possibility of a physically identical world that contains extra , nonphysical phenomenology .
This means that if Q is a negative truth about our world — say , the truth that no - one instantiates a certain phenomenal property — then materialism about our world is compatible with the possibility of P&~Q .
To finesse this point , we can stipulate that in the argument above , Q is a positive truth ( one that holds in all worlds that contain a duplicate of our world ; see Chalmers 1996 , p. 40 ) : if Q is a positive truth , then materialism is incompatible with the possibility of P&~Q .
Alternatively , we can conjoin P with a " that 's - all " statement T , stating that the world is a minimal world that satisfies P ( see Jackson 1998 , p. 26 ) .
Then even when Q is a negative truth , materialism is not compatible with the possibility of PT&~Q ( where PT is the conjunction of P and T ) .
The real work in the argument is done by the first and second premises .
The second premise is particularly controversial , as there are a number of examples that have led many philosophers to deny that there is an entailment from conceivability to metaphysical possibility .
To assess these premises , we need to understand the notion of conceivability .
2 Varieties of Conceivability
Conceivability is to be understood as an epistemic notion , defined in epistemological ( and perhaps psychological ) terms .
To a first approximation , we can say that S is conceivable when S expresses a coherent hypothesis : one that can not be ruled out a priori .
To refine this understanding , it is useful to make some distinctions .
( These distinctions are discussed at much greater length in Chalmers 2002 . )
We can say that S is prima facie conceivable ( for a subject ) when that subject is unable to rule out the hypothesis expressed by S by a priori reasoning , on initial consideration .
We can say that S is ideally conceivable when the hypothesis expressed by S can not be ruled out a priori , even on ideal rational reflection .
The main difference here is that prima facie conceivability is tied to a subject 's contingent cognitive limitations , while ideal conceivability abstracts away from those limitations .
Some examples : ( 1 ) ' 2+2=5 ' is neither prima facie conceivable nor ideally conceivable ; ( 2 ) Where S is a highly complex but provable mathematical truth , ~S will be prima facie conceivable for most subjects , but it is not ideally conceivable ; ( 3 ) Where S is ' There is a flying pig ' , S is prima facie conceivable , and is almost certainly ideally conceivable .
The notions of conceivability discussed above are versions of negative conceivability which is defined in terms of what a subject can rule out through a priori reasoning .
We can say that S is negatively conceivable when S can not be ruled out through a priori reasoning .
The two notions above can then be seen as prima facie negative conceivability and ideal negative conceivability respectively .
It is also possible to define notions of positive conceivability , which is defined in terms of what subjects can form a positive conception of .
We can say that S is positively conceivable when one can coherently imagine a situation in which S is the case .
Where negative conceivability requires merely entertaining a hypothesis and being unable to rule it out , positive conceivability involves being able to form some sort of clear and distinct conception of a situation in which the hypothesis is true .
One can then say that S is prima facie positively conceivable when a subject can imagine a situation that they take to be coherent and that they take to be one in which S is the case .
And one can say that S is ideally positively conceivable when its prima facie positive conceivability cannot be defeated on ideal rational reflection ( in particular , when arbitrary details can be filled in in the imagined situation without any contradiction revealing itself , and when ideal reflection reveals the imagined situation as one in which S is the case ) .
Traditional notions of conceivability ( Descartes ' clear and distinct conceivability , for example ) are arguably varieties of positive conceivability rather than negative conceivability .
At the same time , the notion of positive conceivability is more complex than that of negative conceivability , and a rigorous characterization of the notion requires saying much more about just what it is to imagine a situation , and so on .
I characterize positive conceivability in more depth in Chalmers 2002 .
In this paper , the roles of positive and negative conceivability will often be interchangable ( I will make clear when the difference is relevant ) , so the informal account above will suffice for present purposes .
For much of the discussion one can focus on negative conceivability without much loss , but positive conceivability is available as an alternative if there turn out to be any problems with theses tied to negative conceivability .
Insofar as there is a gap between prima facie conceivability and ideal conceivability , it is ideal conceivability that is a better guide to possibility .
This is especially clear in the case of prima facie negative conceivability : we have seen that the negation of a complex mathematical truth may be prima facie negatively conceivable , but it is not ideally conceivable and it is not possible .
It is less easy to find cases of prima facie positive conceivability without ideal positive conceivability ( see Chalmers 2002 for some potential cases ) , but insofar as there are such cases , there will be little reason to think that they are possible .
Correspondingly , some familiar purported counterexamples to the claim that conceivability entails possibility are really counterexamples to the claim that prima facie conceivability entails possibility .
For example , it is sometimes said that both Goldbach 's conjecture and its negation are conceivable , while only one of them is possible .
Here the relevant notion of conceivability is something like prima facie negative conceivability .
There is no reason to believe that both Goldbach 's conjecture and its negation are ideally conceivable , so there is no reason to think that this is a counterexample to the claim that ideal conceivability entails possibility .
So from here onward , talk of " conceivability " simpliciter should always be understood to be talk of ideal conceivability ( either positive or negative ) .
The other familiar class of purported counterexamples arises from Kripke 's analysis of the necessary a posteriori .
It is often said that sentences such as ' water is not H 2 O ' provide counterexamples to the claim that conceivability entails possibility : it is conceivable that water is not H 2 O , but it is not metaphysically possible .
Here one has to be careful .
There is a sense of ' conceivable ' in which ' water is not H 2 O ' is not conceivable ( given that water is H 2 O in the actual world ) : in this sense , any conceivable situation in which it seems that water is not H 2 O ( a Twin Earth world , say ) should better be described as a conceivable situation in which water is still H 2 O , but in which there is watery stuff that is not H 2 O. Using the term ' conceivable ' this way , one might say that ' water is not H 2 O ' seems conceivable ( or that it is prima facie conceivable , to one without relevant empirical knowledge ) , but that it is not really conceivable .
We might call this sense of conceivability secondary conceivability ( for reasons familiar from a two - dimensional analysis , and discussed in Chalmers 2002 ) .
Then the Kripkean cases are compatible with the claim that secondary conceivability entails metaphysical possibility .
But at the same time , this claim is not very useful for present purposes , as whether a sentence is secondarily conceivable will typically depend on a variety of empirical factors , and an opponent might deny that zombies are secondarily conceivable , on the grounds that there is an a posteriori identity between phenomenal and physical properties .
So a link between secondary conceivability and possibility does not offer an a priori route to conclusions about metaphysical possibility .
Instead , what is relevant here is primary conceivability : the sense in which ' water is not H 2 O ' can correctly be said to be conceivable .
The notion of negative conceivability defined above is a sort of primary conceivability , as it is defined in terms of what can be ruled out a priori , and ' water is H 2 O ' can not be established a priori .
( One might define a distinct notion of negative secondary conceivability , but I will set that aside here . )
One can likewise define a notion of positive primary conceivability , so that S is positively primarily conceivable when S can imagine a coherent situation that verifies S , where a situation verifies S when , under the hypothesis that the situation actually obtains , the subject should conclude that S .
If the subject imagines a Twin Earth situation with XYZ in the oceans and lakes , and assumes that the situation obtains in their own environment , then the subject should conclude that water is XYZ rather than H 2 O .
So ' water is not H 2 O ' is positively primarily conceivable , as well as negatively primarily conceivable .
Unlike secondary conceivability , matters of primary conceivability are plausibly in the a priori domain : whether S is primarily conceivable turns on matters of a priori reasoning .
But primary conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility : ' water is not H 2 O ' is primarily conceivable , but it is not metaphysically possible .
Still , there remains a link between primary conceivability and metaphysical possibility in these cases .
When we conceive that water is not H 2 O , we imagine ( for example ) a Twin Earth situation in which the watery liquid in the oceans and lakes is XYZ .
This situation is metaphysically possible , so there is a sense in which our conceiving involves access to a possible world .
Under the usual way of describing possible worlds , this world is not a world in which water is not H 2 O .
But the world still stands in a strong relation to the sentence ' water is not H 2 O ' .
In particular , if we came to accept that our own world had the character of this world ( with XYZ in the oceans and lakes ) , we should then endorse the claim ' water is not H 2 O ' .
This can be put in two - dimensional terms by saying that while the Twin Earth does not satisfy ' water is not H 2 O ' ( ' water is not H 2 O ' is not true of that world considered as counterfactual ) , the Twin Earth world verifies ' water is not H 2 O ' ( ' water is not H 2 O ' is true of that world considered as actual ) .
Equivalently , we can say that while the secondary intension of ' water is not H 2 O ' is false at w , the sentence 's primary intension is true there .
To a first approximation , a world w verifies S ( or S is true at w considered as actual , or the primary intension of S is true at w ) when , if we came to accept that our own world is qualitatively like w , we should then endorse S. Strictly speaking , the worlds w that are relevant to primary intensions are centered worlds : worlds that come with a marked " center " consisting of an individual and time .
When we consider a centered world w as actual , we consider the hypothesis that we are currently in the situation of the individual at the center .
( For much more on these notions , see Chalmers 2004 . )
We can say that when the primary intension of S is true at some centered world ( i.e. , when some centered world verifies S ) , S is primarily possible , or 1 - possible .
When the secondary intension of S is true at some world ( i.e. , when some world satisfies S ) , S is secondarily possible , or 2 - possible .
Then ' water is not H 2 O ' is not 2 - possible , but it is 1 - possible .
The observation that sentences such as ' water is not H 2 O ' are conceivable but not possible , in these terms , comes to the claim that these sentences are primarily conceivable ( 1 - conceivable ) but are not secondarily possible ( 2 - possible ) .
So there is good reason to believe that 1 - conceivability does not entail 2 - possibility .
However , these cases are entirely compatible with a link between 2 - conceivability and 2 - possibility , and more importantly for present purposes , they are entirely compatible with a link between 1 - conceivability and 1 - possibility .
In fact , it is not hard to argue that all of the standard Kripkean a posteriori necessities ( ' heat is the motion of molecules ' , ' Hesperus is Phosphorus ' , and so on ) have this structure .
For each of these necessities , one might say that it 's negation is conceivable but not possible , meaning that it is 1 - conceivable but not 2 - possible .
But in each of these cases , the sentence in question is 1 - possible .
For example , ' heat is not the motion of molecules ' is verified by a world in which something other than molecules causes sensations as of heat .
' Hesperus is not Phosporus ' is verified by a world in which the objects visible in the morning and evening skies are entirely distinct .
Furthermore , it is plausible that worlds such as these are just what one is conceiving of when one conceives that heat is not the motion of molecules , or that Hesperus is not Phosphorus .
So in these cases , there remains a strong link between conceivability and metaphysical possibility .
To summarize , we have seen that the standard counterexamples to a conceivability - possibility link are accommodated by noting that ( i ) prima facie conceivability is an imperfect guide to possibility , and ( ii ) primary conceivability is an imperfect guide to secondary possibility .
But ( i ) is entirely consistent with a link between ideal conceivability and possibility , and ( ii ) is entirely consistent with a link between primary conceivability and primary possibility .
Putting the pieces together : all of these counterexamples are compatible with the thesis that ideal primary conceivability entails primary possibility .
There are two versions of this thesis , depending on whether one interprets the relevant sort of conceivability as positive or negative .
( CP + ) Ideal primary positive conceivability entails primary possibility ( CP -) Ideal primary negative conceivability entails primary possibility .
CP - entails CP+ , as ideal primary positive conceivability entails ideal primary negative conceivability .
If S can be ruled out a priori , then no coherent imagined situation will verify S. It is not obvious whether or not CP + entails CP - , as it is not obvious whether ideal primary negative conceivability entails ideal primary positive conceivability .
That is , it is not obvious whether or not there is an S that cannot be ruled out a priori , but such that no coherent imagined situation verifies S. ( In Chalmers 2002 I argue that there is no such S , so that ideal primary negative conceivability entails ideal primary positive conceivability . )
So CP - is at least as strong as CP + and is possibly somewhat stronger .
Most importantly for present purposes , however , both CP + and CP - are compatible with all the familiar purported counterexamples to the conceivability - possibility link .
Furthermore , it seems that there are no clear counterexamples to either thesis ( though later in the paper , I will discuss some potential counterexamples that have been put forward ) .
In particular , both theses are entirely compatible with the existence of Kripkean a posteriori necessities , so while existence of these necessities is often used to case doubt on conceivability - possibility theses , they can not be used to cast doubt on CP + or CP - .
So for now , I will take these theses as reasonable conceivability - possibility theses that might be used in mounting a refined conceivability argument against materialism .
Later in the paper , I will return to the question of their truth .
3 A refined conceivability argument
Henceforth , unqualified uses of " conceivability " and " conceivable " should be understood as invoking ideal primary conceivability .
I will often be inexplicit about whether positive or negative conceivability is involved .
In effect , the argument forms below can be understood as generating two different arguments , depending on whether one understands conceivability as ideal primary positive conceivability or as ideal primary negative conceivability .
For many purposes the distinction will not matter .
When it does matter , I will be explicit .
Given the discussion above , one might try generating an anti-materialist argument by simply substituting primary possibility for metaphysical possibility in the original argument .
(1) P&~Q is conceivable ( 2 ) If P&~Q is conceivable , P&~Q is 1 - possible ( 3 ) If P&~Q is 1 - possible , materialism is false .
( 4 ) Materialism is false .
On this reading , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are both plausible theses , but ( 3 ) is not obviously plausible .
The reason is that materialism requires not the 1 - impossibility of P& ~Q but the 2 - impossibility of P&~Q .
That is , materialism requires that it could not have been the case that P were true without Q being true .
This is a subjunctive claim about ordinary metaphysical possibility , and so invokes 2 - impossibility rather than 1 - impossibility .
A materialist might reasonably question ( 3 ) by holding that even if there is a world w verifying P&~Q , w might be a world with quite different ingredients from our own .
For example , it might be that W does not instantiate true microphysical properties ( those instantiated in our world ) , such as mass and charge , but instead instantiates quite different properties : say , pseudo - mass and pseudo - charge , which stand to mass and charge roughly as XYZ stands to H 2 O. Likewise , it might be that w does not lack true phenomenal properties , but instead lacks quite different properties : say , pseudophenomenal properties .
If so , then the possibility of w has no bearing on whether true microphysical properties necessitate true phenomenal properties .
And it is the latter that is relevant for materialism .
Still , it may be that the gap between 1 - possibility and 2 - possibility could be closed .
In particular , when a statement S has the same primary intension and secondary intension , then a world will verify S iff it satisfies S , so S will be 1 - possible iff it is 2 - possible .
If P and Q both have primary intensions that coincide with their secondary intensions , then so will P&~Q , and we could run the following argument :
(1) P&~Q is conceivable ( 2 ) If P&~Q is conceivable , P&~Q is 1 - possible ( 3 ) If P&~Q is 1 - possible , P&~Q is 2 - possible .
( 4 ) If P&~Q is 2 - possible , materialism is false .
( 5 ) Materialism is false .
Here , the truth of ( 3 ) requires that both P and Q have primary and secondary intensions that coincide .
In the case of Q , this claim is quite plausible .
As Kripke noted , there does not seem to be the same strong dissociation between appearance and reality in the case of consciousness as in the cases of water and heat : while it is not the case that anything that looks like water is water , or that anything that feels like heat is heat , it is plausibly the case that anything that feels like consciousness is consciousness .
So it is not clear that the notion of " pseudoconsciousness " , something that satisfies the primary intension of ' consciousness ' without being consciousness , is coherent .
Likewise for other more specific phenomenal properties .
So there is a strong case that the primary and secondary intensions of phenomenal terms coincide .
( For more on this case , see Chalmers 2003b . )
However , in the case of P , this claim is less plausible .
A materialist might reasonably hold that microphysical terms ( such as ' mass ' and ' charge ' ) have primary intensions that differ from their secondary intensions .
In particular , it is plausible that the primary intensions of these terms are tied to a certain theoretical role .
We might say that the primary intension of ' mass ' picks out whatever property plays the mass - role ( e.g. resisting acceleration in certain ways , being subject to mutual attraction in a certain way , and so on ) , and that the primary intension of ' charge ' picks out whatever property plays the charge - role ( e.g. obeying certain electromagnetic principles , being subject to attraction and repulsion in certain ways , and so on ) .
By contrast , one might reasonably hold that the secondary intension of microphysical terms is tied to the property that actually plays the role .
For example , if property M plays the mass - role in the actual world , then one might hold that in any world in which mass is instantiated , mass is M .
It follows that if there are worlds in which some other property M ' plays the mass - role , then M ' is not mass in that world ( at best , it is pseudo - mass ) .
If so , then the primary and secondary intensions of ' mass ' will not coincide : the primary intension of ' mass ' will pick out whatever plays the mass - role in such a world , but the secondary intension will not .
There are other views of the semantics and metaphysics of microphysical terms that may reject this argument for the distinctness of the primary and secondary intensions of ' mass ' .
In particular , the argument will not go through on views according to which it is necessary that mass is the property that plays the mass - role .
( These include views on which ' mass ' is a nonrigid designator whose secondary intension picks out different properties that play the role in some worlds , and views on which it is necessary that M is the property that plays the mass - role , where M is the property rigidly designated by ' mass ' . )
Still , the view sketched above is a quite reasonable view — more plausible than the alternatives , in my opinion — and it is the view that best grounds resistance to an inference from the 1 - possibility of P& ~Q to its 2 - possibility .
So we can suppose that the view is correct in order to see what follows .
On this view , a world may verify P without satisfying P .
The secondary intension of P requires that certain specific properties such as mass , spin , and charge are distributed in a certain specific way across space - time , with appropriate causal and nomic relations among them .
The primary intension of P requires only that whatever properties plays the mass - role , the spin-role , and charge - role are distributed in this way .
If w is a world where these roles are played by properties other than mass , spin , and charge ( we might say that they are played by " schmass " , " schmin " , and " schmarge " ) , which are otherwise distributed in the right way over space - time and have appropriate causal and nomic relations among them , then w will verify P , but it will not satisfy P .
Here , we might say that the physics of W has the same structural profile as physics in the actual world , but that it has a different intrinsic profile , in that it differs in the intrinsic properties that fill this structure .
To verify P , a world must have the right structural profile , while to satisfy P , a world must have the right structural and intrinsic profile .
It follows that premise 3 is not guaranteed to be true .
Because a world can verify P without satisfying P , it may be that P& ~Q is 1 - possible but not 2 - possible .
However , this requires that P and Q be related in a certain specific way .
In particular , it requires that some worlds that verify P also verify ~Q , while no worlds that satisfy P also satisfy ~Q .
This requires in turn that some worlds that have the same structural profile as the actual world verify ~Q , while no worlds that have the same structural and intrinsic profiles as the actual world satisfy ~Q .
We can assume for the moment that the primary and secondary intensions of Q coincide .
Then we can put all this by saying that the falsity of ( 3 ) requires that the structural profile of physics in the actual world does not necessitate Q , but that the combined structural and intrinsic profiles of physics the actual world do necessitate Q .
This idea — that the structural properties of physics in the actual world do not necessitate the existence and / or nature of consciousness , but that the intrinsic properties of physics combined with the structural properties do — corresponds to a familiar view in the metaphysics of consciousness .
This is the view that I have elsewhere called Russellian monism ( or type - F monism , or panprotopsychism ) .
On this view , consciousness is closely tied to the intrinsic properties that serve as the categorical bases of microphysical dispositions .
Russell and others held that the nature of these properties is not revealed to us by perception ( which reveals only their effects ) or by science ( which reveals only their relations ) .
But it is coherent to suppose that these properties have a special nature that is tied to consciousness .
They might themselves be phenomenal properties , or they might be protophenomenal properties : properties that collectively constitute phenomenal properties when organized in the appropriate way .
Russellian monism is an important view on the mind - body problem .
I think that it is certainly not ruled out by the conceivability argument and by related arguments .
If Russellian monism is true , then when we conceive of zombies , we hold fixed the structural properties of physical systems in the actual world , but not their intrinsic properties ( which are protophenomenal properties ) .
If we consider these intrinsic protophenomenal properties to be physical properties , then Russellian monism will qualify as a form of physicalism .
But because it relies on speculation about the special nature of the fundamental properties in microphysics , it is a highly distinctive form of physicalism that has much in common with property dualism , and that many physicalists will want to reject . [*]
* [[ A related position arises from views on which laws of nature are necessary ( e.g. Shoemaker 19xx ) , and on which there is a lawful connection between physical properties and phenomenal properties in our world .
Such a view may hold that it is essential to physical properties that they have this nomic profile , so that there is no world satisfying P&~Q .
Some versions of this view will deny ( 2 ) , and are discussed later in the paper .
But other versions may accept ( 2 ) , holding that there is a world verifying P&~Q , but will hold that it involves distinct " schmysical " properties that lack this nomic profile .
The resulting view resembles Russellian monism in some respects , but differs from the usual form in taking the connection between physical and phenomenal properties to be nomic in the first instance .
Because it turns on this nomic connection , this view does not provide any loophole for materialism : at best , it yields a version of property dualism on which the laws of nature connecting physical and phenomenal properties are necessary .
See objection 12 in section XX for more on related issues . ]]
In any case , we can now close the loophole in the previous argument as follows :
(1) P&~Q is conceivable ( 2 ) If P&~Q is conceivable , then P&~Q is 1 - possible ( 3 ) If P&~Q is 1 - possible , then P&~Q is 2 - possible or Russellian monism is true .
( 4 ) If P&~Q is 2 - possible , materialism is false .
( 5 ) Materialism is false or Russellian monism is true .
This argument is valid .
I discussed the case for premises ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) earlier , and I have just now argued for premise ( 3 ) .
I think that ( 5 ) is the proper conclusion of the conceivability argument .
For the reasons given above , such arguments ( and also related arguments such as the knowledge argument and the property dualism argument ) cannot exclude Russellian monism , and Russellian monism is arguably a form of physicalism , if a distinctive and radical kind .
So the possibility of Russellian monism needs to be explicitly acknowledged as an option in the conclusion .
A couple of minor notes on the argument .
First , to be fully explicit , the argument might take the truth of Q as a premise .
If Q were false , the ground for accepting ( 4 ) would collapse .
In the less explicit version of the argument above , we can consider the truth of Q part of the case for accepting premise ( 4 ) .
In fact , for reasons given earlier , the case for ( 4 ) requires that Q is a positive truth about consciousness .
Alternatively , one can remain silent on whether Q is a positive or negative truth , and handle this matter by conjoining P with a " that 's - all " clause asserting that the world is a minimal world in which P ( or equivalently , by building such a that 's - all clause into P ) .
Second , it is worth noting that ( contrary to a common supposition ) , the assumption that Q has the same primary and secondary intensions is not necessary for the argument for ( 5 ) to go through .
To see this , we can consider the version of the argument where we adjoin a " that 's - all " clause to P. From ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we can derive the conclusion that there is a minimal world verifying P in which the primary intension of Q is false .
If P has the same primary and secondary intensions , then this world will be a minimal P - world in which the primary intension of Q is false .
This world must differ from our world , because the primary intension of Q is true in our world .
( There is a small loophole here arising from the possibility that this world differs merely in the location of the center of the relevant centered world .
I discuss this loophole in section 5 . )
It follows that there is a minimal P - world that is not a duplicate of our world , so that physicalism is false of our world .
It could be that strictly speaking physicalism will be true of consciousness , because P necessitates Q , but physicalism will be false of properties closely associated with consciousness , namely those associated with the primary intension of Q .
We might think of this sort of view as one on which phenomenal properties are physical properties that have non-physical properties as modes of presentation .
Alternatively , if P has different primary and secondary intensions , then by the reasoning given in the earlier discussion of premise ( 3 ) , one can conclude that either there is a minimal world satisfying P in which the primary intension of Q is false ( which again entails the falsity of physicalism ) , or that the primary intension of Q is necessitated by the structural and intrinsic profiles of physics in our world , but not by the intrinsic profiles alone .
This view can be considered another form of Russellian monism , in that the intrinsic properties of physics in our world are crucial for constituting the properties associated with the modes of presentation of consciousness .
So if Q has a distinct primary and secondary intensions , then one will have to formalize premises ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) somewhat differently , but the argument for ( 5 ) will still work just as well .
This completes the exposition of the two - dimensional argument against materialism .
In what follows I will address some objections to the argument that arise from the recent literature .
I have already said what needs to be said about premises ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and I do not anticipate significant objections to them ( with one exception that I will discuss ) .
I will discuss some objections to premise ( 1 ) and some hard - to - classify objections relatively briefly , and then I will focus on objections to the crucial premise ( 2 ) .
4 Objections to Premise ( 1 )
Premise ( 1 ) says that P&~Q is conceivable : that is , that we can conceive a world physically identical to ours containing zombies and / or inverts .
It is worth noting that such a world need not be an entire zombie world .
One might worry that there are complications associated with imagining oneself to be zombie , at the center of a centered world .
For the purpose of the argument , it usually suffices to conceive of a physically identical world in which some other being , corresponding to a conscious being in this world , is a zombie or an invert .
The premise can be understood as invoking ideal primary negative conceivability or ideal primary positive conceivability .
The first version makes a somewhat weaker claim ( positive conceivability entails negative conceivability , but the reverse is not obviously the case ) , and is slightly more straightforward .
In this version , the premise simply says that P&~Q cannot be ruled out a priori : that a priori reasoning cannot rule out the hypothesis that P obtains and that someone else is a zombie , for example .
The second version makes the somewhat stronger claim that we can ( in principle ) clearly and distinctly imagine a situation in which P holds and in which someone is a zombie or an invert , where the hypothesis that this situation obtains cannot be ruled out by a priori reasoning .
Of course , any difference in strength here will be balanced by an inverse difference in strength for the corresponding versions of premise ( 2 ) .
I discussed the strong prima facie case for these claims in Chalmers ( 1996 ) , and will not try to recapitulate it here .
The zombie hypothesis is at least prima facie coherent and imaginable .
To reject the premise , one needs to find something that undermines the prima facie coherence and imaginability , such as some sort of a priori incoherence , contradiction , or unimaginability in the hypothesis that emerges on reflection .
A detailed defense of the premise involves arguing that no candidate for this sort of undermining can succeed .
Here I will consider various suggestions .
(1) Analytic functionalism .
One way to reject the conceivability premise would be to accept an analytic functionalist view of consciousness , on which what it means to say that someone is conscious is that they have a state that functions in an appropriate way in their cognitive system and their behavior .
If consciousness were defined in this way , then any functionally identical being would be conscious by definition , so zombies would be ruled out .
Analytic functionalism about consciousness is widely rejected , however , and I have argued against it at length elsewhere ( see e.g. the discussion of type - A materialism in Chalmers 2003a ) , so I will not argue against it further here .
(2) Prima facie but not ideal conceivability .
It is natural to suggest that zombies may be prima facie but not ideally conceivable ( see van Gulick 2000 and Worley 2003 for suggestions along these lines ) .
This corresponds to the position that I call type - C materialism in Chalmers ( 2003a ) , according to which there is a prima facie epistemic gap between physical and phenomenal truths that may be closed on ideal reflection , perhaps because of new discoveries about physical processes , or perhaps because of novel reasoning .
To very briefly summarize the argument there : to render zombies incoherent even on ideal reflection requires some sort of conceptual link between physical and phenomenal concepts .
Given that physics and physical concepts are all structural - dynamical in character ( and new scientific developments are unlikely to change this , although see option ( 3 ) ) , phenomenal concepts must have a character that is linked to structural - dynamic concepts in an appropriate way .
Upon examination , the only candidate that is remotely tenable is the hypothesis that phenomenal concepts are functional concepts .
But we have already seen that there is good reason to reject that view .
A related objection ( e.g. Bailey forthcoming ) holds that arguments from ideal conceivability are toothless , as non-ideal creatures such as ourselves cannot know whether or not a given statement is ideally conceivable .
I think that there is no reason to accept this claim .
Although we are non-ideal , we can know that it is not ideally conceivable that 0=1 , and that it is ideally conceivable that someone exists .
We know that certain things about the world ( say , all philosophers are philosophers ) are knowable a priori , and that certain things about the world ( say , that there is a table in this room ) are not so knowable , even by an ideal reasoner .
Likewise , reasoning of the sort above gives us very good reason to think that there is no a priori entailment from physical to phenomenal truths and that zombie hypotheses are conceivable , even for an ideal reasoner .
(3) Expanding the conception of the physical .
Stoljar ( 2001 ) argues that whether zombies are conceivable depend on how we understand physical properties .
When we conceive of zombies , we hold fixed t- physical properties , or properties as characterized in physical theory .
But we may not hold fixed o-physical properties , or the underlying properties of physical objects , including the intrinsic properties that play the roles characterized in physical theory .
So the position is left open that o-physical zombie duplicates are both inconceivable and impossible : if we adequately conceived of the o-physical properties , we would see that any o-physical duplicate of a conscious being is conscious .
And if we expanded P to include hypothetical o-physical concepts of these intrinsic properties ( characterizing their intrinsic nature ) , then P&~Q would be inconceivable .
I think that this is an important position , but it is clearly a version of Russellian monism , so I take it to be compatible with the overall argument given above .
(4) Zombies presuppose epiphenomenalism .
John Perry ( 2001 ) has suggested that the assertion that zombies are conceivable presupposes epiphenomenalism , the thesis that consciousness plays no causal role .
If we thought that consciousness plays a causal role , we would not find zombies conceivable .
In Chalmers ( 2004 b ) I argue that this claim is simply false .
Its falsity is demonstrated by the fact that many non-epiphenomenalist views are compatible with the conceivability of zombies .
For example , many type - B materialists ( such as Hill , Loar , Papineau , and so on ) accept that zombies are conceivable , and that consciousness plays a causal role .
These philosophers deny that zombies are possible , but that is a different stage of the argument .
Furthermore , the Russellian monist view is a non-epiphenomenalist view that we have seen is compatible with the conceivability of zombies in the relevant sense .
Finally , even Cartesian interactionist dualism , on which consciousness certainly plays a causal role , is compatible with the conceivability ( and possibility ) of zombies .
On such a view , physically identical beings without consciousness will presumably have large causal gaps in their functioning ( or else will have some new element to fill those gaps ) , but there is nothing obviously inconceivable about such causal gaps .
( For more on this , see Chalmers 2004b . )
(5) The judgments of zombies .
It is an admittedly strange feature of zombies that they appear to make claims about consciousness that are indistinguishable from the claims of conscious beings , and that they even make parallel judgments , if judgments are functionally understood .
I called this " the paradox of phenomenal judgment " , and argued that while it is strange ( many strange things happen in other possible worlds ) , it does nothing to undermine the coherence of zombies .
Thomas ( 1998 ) argues that we have to choose between saying that zombie 's claims are true , meaningless , insincere , or mistaken , and that each of these options is untenable .
Others ( Kirk 1999 , Lynch forthcoming ) have argued that the coherence of zombies undermines our knowledge of consciousness , since we will then be unable to distinguish ourselves from zombies .
In Chalmers ( 2003 b ) I argue that an appropriate account of the content and epistemology of our phenomenal judgments shows that there is no problem here .
(6) Zombies are not positively conceivable .
Some ( e.g. Ashwell 2003 , Marcus 2004 ) have argued that while zombies may be negatively conceivable , they are not positively conceivable .
To positively conceive another creature , one must conceive of some combination of physical processes and conscious states .
But conceiving of physical processes clearly does not suffice to conceive of a zombie ( since conscious beings may have the same processes ) , and in conceiving of a zombie it is out of the question to conceive of conscious states .
So we can form no positive conception of a zombie .
In response , I think it is clear that when we conceive of zombies we conceive of the absence of consciousness .
There is no more problem with clearly and distinctly imagining a situation in which there is no consciousness than in imagining a world in which there are no angels , or in imagining a world with one particle and nothing else .
The argument here appears to require the idea that absences are never positively conceivable , or at least that to positively conceive an absence always requires conceiving something else in its place .
But the cases above suggest that such a claim is clearly false .
The claim may turn on misinterpreting the notion of positive conceivability : presumably there is a sense in which conceiving of an absence is negative conceiving , but this is not the sense that is relevant here .
A general point about the arguments above : Many of these arguments , especially 4 - 6 , turn on considerations that are specific to the conceivability of zombies , and do not apply to the conceivability of inverts and the like .
One should keep in mind that for the anti-materialist argument , one does not need to consider beings as remote from us as zombies , or even as remote as full - scale inverts .
It suffices if we can conceive of a being whose conscious experience is for just a moment slightly different from that of an actual physical duplicate 's : perhaps they experience a slightly different shade at a point in the background of their visual field .
Any problems that are specific to zombies then will not apply .
5 Hard - to - Classify Objections
Here I consider three objections to the argument that are not straightforwardly classifiable as objections to premise ( 1 ) or premise ( 2 ) .
(1) The conditional - concepts objection .
David Braddon - Mitchell , John Hawthorne , and Robert Stalnaker have independently put forward versions of the following intriguing objection .
The conceivability of zombies is compatible with materialism , if the concept of consciousness has a certain conditional structure .
Suppose that ' consciousness ' functions as follows : if dualism is true in the actual world ( that is , if a relevant sort of nonphysical property is instantiated ) , then ' consciousness ' picks out a nonphysical property ; and if physicalism is true in the actual world ( that is , if no relevant nonphysical property is instantiated but a relevant sort of physical property is instantiated ) , then ' consciousness ' picks out a physical property .
Then if dualism is actually true , we should accept that zombies are possible .
And it is at least conceivable that dualism is actually true , in that we cannot rule out the truth of dualism a priori .
It follows that it is conceivable that zombies are possible .
But this conceivability is entirely compatible with the claim that dualism is actually false , so that in fact zombies are impossible .
In response : Let us say that S is meta - conceivable when it is conceivable that S is possible .
Then this objection shows that the meta - conceivability of zombies may be compatible with materialism .
But the relevant premise of the conceivability argument was not that zombies are meta - conceivable , but that zombies are conceivable .
That is , the premise ( at least in the negative conceivability version ) asserts that we cannot rule out a priori that P& ~Q obtains in the actual world , not that we cannot rule out a priori that P& ~Q obtains in some possible world .
But there are good reasons to accept this premise , and the considerations above does nothing to undermine them .
So these considerations do not threaten the argument .
Hawthorne and Stalnaker do not discuss the claim that zombies are conceivable ( as I am understanding that claim here ) , and they say nothing to undermine either that claim or the claim that conceivability in this sense entails possibility , so their discussion leaves all the premises in the argument above intact .
Braddon - Mitchell , by contrast , makes clear that he accepts premise 2 but denies premise 1 .
He says that the apparent conceivability of zombies is just a " shadow " of their metaconceivability : that is , we are apt to conflate the claim that zombies are conceivable with the claim that they are metaconceivable , and we mistakenly take the good reasons for the latter to be reasons for the former .
He does not say anything to argue directly that zombies are inconceivable , however .
On the face of it , even once we distinguish the two notions , the grounds for saying that zombies are conceivable ( e.g. , that there is no a priori contradiction in the idea ) are as strong as ever .
These proponents could suggest that the conditional account predicts that zombies are inconceivable , and that it has independent support .
At least on Braddon - Mitchell 's version of the account ( Hawthorne and Stalnaker are not explicit about this ) , it is an a priori conceptual truth that if PT is the case , then Q is the case , as he takes the conditional account to be an a priori conceptual analysis of phenomenal concepts .
Braddon - Mitchell supports this claim by arguing that if an oracle told us that the world is purely physical , we would respond by accepting physicalism about phenomenal consciousness , rather than denying that it exists .
( Hawthorne makes a similar observation . )
In response : I think that although the observation about our reaction to oracles is correct , it gives no support to the conditional concepts analysis .
As Alter ( forthcoming ) has noted , the observation is grounded in the fact that we are more certain that we are conscious than we are of any philosophical thesis about consciousness .
And our certainty that we are conscious is plausibly a posteriori knowledge , justified by experience .
If so , then ( as Alter argues ) , our inference from PT to Q in the oracle situation is partly grounded in this a posteriori knowledge , rather than being a priori .
So the oracle observation does not support the thesis that it is a priori that if PT is the case , Q is the case .
Furthermore , that thesis is undermined by both the zombie intuition itself and the knowledge - argument intuition that someone who knows PT would not thereby be in a position to know ( through a priori reflection ) what it is like to see red .
So we have good reason to reject the conditional analysis of phenomenal concepts .
(2) The zombie parity objection .
Balog ( 1999 ) has suggested that there must be something wrong with the argument , on the grounds that if zombies are possible , they could make a parallel argument to the conclusion that materialism is false in their world .
This conclusion would be incorrect , as materialism is true in their world .
So something must be wrong with the zombie 's argument .
As the argument is valid , it must have a false premise .
But Balog argues that if the premises of the original argument are true , then the premises of the zombie 's argument are true .
It follows that one of the premises of the original argument is false .
Balog locates the problem in the equivalent of premise 2 , the inference from conceivability to possibility , but this specific claim is not needed to undermine the original argument .
In response , I think it is not correct that if the premises of the original argument are true , the premises of the zombie 's arguments are true .
A tacit premise of the original argument is Q itself , stating for example that someone is phenomenally conscious .
( As discussed earlier , this could either be built in as an explicit premise , or it can function as part of the support for premise 4 . )
The corresponding premise of the zombie 's argument will be its claim ' Someone is phenomenally conscious ' .
I think that this claim is false .
For example , in a debate between zombie realists and zombie eliminativists , the zombie eliminativists ( who say ' No - one is phenomenally conscious ' ) are correct .
( For support for this claim , based in an analysis of phenomenal concepts , see Chalmers 2003 b . )
If this is right , then the zombie 's argument has a false premise where the original argument has a true premise , and the failure of the zombie argument does nothing to undermine the original argument .
(3) The indexical objection .
A fairly common move in response to the conceivability argument ( see e.g. Ismael 1999 , Perry 2001 ) is to suggest that it is undermined by an analogy with indexicals .
Even if I have complete objective knowledge of the world , I may lack indexical knowledge , such as the knowledge that it is 8 pm now .
So it is conceivable that all those objective truths obtain and that it is not 8 pm now .
But it does not follow that the fact that it is 8 pm now is some ontologically further fact about the world , so that materialism is false .
Likewise , it does not follow from the conceivability of zombies that materialism is false .
One might take this to be an objection to premise ( 2 ) , the inference from conceivability to possibility .
But in fact the point is compatible with premise ( 2 ) .
Premise ( 2 ) says that if P&~Q is conceivable , it is 1 - possible .
The analog version for time says that if P& ~N is conceivable ( where N is " It is 8 pm now " ) , then P& ~N is 1 - possible .
But P&~N is 1 - possible , in that there is a centered world verifying P&~N : a world physically identical to our world , with the center placed somewhere else .
In terms of the current argument , the objection is rather that from the fact that there is a centered world verifying P&~N , it does not follow that there is an uncentered world satisfying P&~N ( or satisfying anything in the vicinity ) , and such an uncentered world is what is needed for materialism to be false .
By analogy , something similar goes for P&~Q .
So if we accept the analogy , we should deny premise ( 3 ) .
In my main argument for premise ( 3 ) above , I assumed the thesis that Q has the same primary and secondary intension .
If that thesis is correct , the indexical objection will not apply , as centering is irrelevant to the intensions of such sentences .
If there is a centered world verifying P&~Q , then the corresponding uncentered world will also satisfy ~Q ( and any difference between the primary and secondary intensions of P will lead at worst to Russellian monism ) .
However , a proponent of the indexical objection may hold that phenomenal concepts are themselves indexical concepts , which have distinct primary and secondary intensions ( for example , the primary intension of " I " picks out the individual at the center of a centered world , while the secondary intension of " I " picks out the same individual in all worlds ) .
If so , then Q will have distinct primary secondary intensions .
When I considered this possibility earlier , I noted that the argument still goes through but that there is a small loophole in the argument due to centering .
In effect , the proponent of the indexical objection is exploiting this loophole in order to resist the argument .
To make considerations about indexical concepts maximally explicit , one can modify the formal argument .
The modified argument invokes the sentence PTI , a conjunction of P , T , and I .
Here P and T are as before ( the " that 's - all " truth T is built in explicitly here for completeness ) .
I is a conjunction of relevant indexical truths , such ' I am x ' , ' Now is y' , and so on , where x and y are descriptions picking out unique individuals and times ( see Chalmers and Jackson 2001 for more on this ) .
The modified argument runs as follows :
(1) PTI&~Q is conceivable ( 2 ) If PTI&~Q is conceivable , then PTI&~Q is 1 - possible ( 3 ) If PTI&~Q is 1 - possible , then PT&~Q is 2 - possible or Russellian monism is true .
( 4 ) If PT&~Q is 2 - possible , materialism is false .
( 5 ) Materialism is false or Russellian monism is true .
Here premise ( 2 ) is an instance of the general principle discussed earlier , and premise ( 4 ) is as before .
The case for the modified premise ( 3 ) is more or less the same as that for the earlier premise ( 3 ) .
The main difference is this version removes the residual loophole in the case for premise ( 3 ) at the end of section 3 , after we relaxed the assumption that Q has the same primary and secondary intensions .
That loophole involved the suggestion that a centered world w verifying PT&~Q need not differ in any objective respect from the actual centered world W , since it might differ only in the location of the center .
That loophole is now removed : if both w and w verify PTI , then they cannot differ only in the location of the center , as I specifies that location . [*]
So w and w will differ in objective respects despite both verifying PT , and the rest of the argument will go through as before .
* [[ Strictly speaking , there is an exception for cases of wholly symmetrical worlds where individuals cannot be picked out by any unique objective descriptions .
But there is no reason to think that the actual world is such a world , and any such symmetries play no role in the judgment that PTI& ~Q is conceivable . ]]
As for the modified premise ( 1 ) , this premise follows from the observation that adding indexical information does not close the epistemic gap between PT and Q .
For example , I can coherently conceive that PT is the case , that I am x , that now is y , and that someone else is a zombie .
( Note that this is a disanalogy with indexical cases : PTI&~N is not conceivable , where N is a claim about what time it is now . )
Likewise , if we give Mary in her black - and - white room the same sort of indexical information , she will still not be in a position to know what it is like to be red .
The epistemic gaps are just as wide as they were before .
So the modified premise ( 1 ) is as plausible as the earlier version .
At this point , an opponent may suggest that phenomenal concepts are primitive indexical concepts , quite independent of other indexical concepts such as I and now .
For example , phenomenal concepts might involve a primitive phenomenal indexical ' E ' , which picks out a phenomenal state of the experiencer in a way analogous to that in which ' I ' and ' now ' pick out the speaker and time .
If so , then the full indexical truth I must include claims of the sort ' E is such - and - such ' , where the right - hand - side is an independent specification of the referent .
And the opponent might suggest that this right - hand - side could specify a physical or functional property .
That is , the indexical truth I might include a claim of the form ' E is PP ' , where PP picks out a physical or functional property instantiated by the subject .
( Hawthorne 2002 makes a suggestion along these lines . )
But if so , PTI&~Q may well be contradictory .
Say that Q is ' Someone instantiates E ' .
P will entail that ' Someone instantiates PP ' , and in conjunction with I will entail ' Someone instantiates E ' .
If so , then PTI& ~Q is not conceivable after all .
I think that this interesting suggestion founders at the first stage : there is good reason to believe that our core phenomenal concepts are not indexicals .
I think it is plausible that there are indexical phenomenal concepts such as E , which we might gloss as this phenomenal property , picking out a phenomenal property that the subject is currently having .
But as I argue in Chalmers ( 2003 b ) , these concepts are distinct from our core phenomenal concepts , such as the pure phenomenal concept of phenomenal redness .
Crucially , any identity claim involving pairs of such concepts is cognitively significant .
For example , the thought this phenomenal property is R , involving an indexical concept and a phenomenal concept of phenomenal redness , is as cognitively significant as a thought such as this shape is circle , involving an indexical and a geometric concept of circularity .
If so , the phenomenal concept is distinct from the indexical concept .
One can also make a direct case against any analysis of phenomenal knowledge as indexical or demonstrative knowledge , as follows .
The epistemic gaps associated with indexicals always disappear from an objective perspective .
Say that I am physically omniscient , but do not know whether I am in the USA or Australia ( we can imagine that there are appropriate qualitative twins in both places ) .
Then I have am ignorant of the truth of ' I am in Australia ' , and discovering that I am in Australia will constitute new knowledge .
But if someone else is watching from the third - person point of view and is also physically omniscient , they will have no corresponding ignorance concerning whether I am in Australia : they will know that A is in Australia and that B is in the US , and that is that .
There is no potential knowledge that they lack : from their perspective , they know everything there is to know about my situation .
So my ignorance is essentially indexical , and evaporates from the objective viewpoint .
The same goes for indexical ignorance concerning what time it is : when I am ignorance of the truth of ' It is 3 am now ' , a physically omniscient historian in later years will have no corresponding ignorance about whether it was 3 am then .
Demonstrative ignorance concerning what " this " is works in a similar way .
In all these cases , the ignorance disappears from the objective viewpoint .
An objectively omniscient observer can know everything there is for them to know about my situation , and there will be no doubts left for them to settle .
The epistemic gaps associated with phenomenal knowledge behave quite differently .
Consider Mary in her black - and - white room , ignorant of what it will be like for her to see red for the first time .
In this case , a physically omniscient observer may have precisely analogous ignorance : even given his complete physical knowledge , he may have no idea what it will be like for Mary to see red for the first time .
So this ignorance does not evaporate from the objective viewpoint .
The same goes even more strongly for knowledge of what it is like for others to see red .
For any observer , regardless of their viewpoint , there will be an epistemic gap between complete physical knowledge and this sort of phenomenal knowledge .
This suggests strongly that phenomenal knowledge is not a variety of indexical or demonstrative knowledge at all .
Rather , it is a sort of objective knowledge of the world , not essentially tied to any viewpoint .
If so , then any analysis of phenomenal concepts as indexical concepts will fail .
(4) Objections to two - dimensional semantics
One general sort of resistance to the two - dimensional argument comes from resistance to the two - dimensional framework as I have set it out .
If one does not think that the notion of a primary intension is coherent , then most of the premises of the argument will not even be meaningful , let alone true .
This sort of objection is too broad in scope to be covered in this paper ; see Chalmers ( 2006 b ) for some replies to objections .
Here , I will just note that much prominent resistance to two - dimensional semantics is really resistance to the claims that the intensions it postulates are the semantic content of utterances , or that they are what is said , or that they are what is ascribed in propositional attitude ascriptions , or some such similar thesis .
But the arguments in this paper need no such thesis .
All they need is that sentences or utterances can be associated with primary intensions in the way I describe .
Nothing turns on whether this association yields a sort of " semantic content " , can be used for attitude ascriptions , and so on .
All that matters is that the relation of verification between worlds and utterances is well - defined ( and then , of course , that it makes the premises true ) .
For example , a critical paper by Bealer ( 2002 ) focuses all of its arguments on the semantic theses , and gives no argument at all against the claim that statements can be associated with primary intensions or against the claim that they satisfy the CP theses .
Something similar applies to a book on two - dimensionalism by Soames ( 2004 ) , which is mostly devoted to arguing against certain two - dimensional analyses of attitude ascriptions , and spends very little time arguing against the underlying association of statements with primary intensions .
Setting arguments of this sort aside , the majority of other arguments against two - dimensionalism are really arguments against specific theses such as the associated conceivability - possibility premise , and are addressed below .
So henceforth I will assume the coherence of the framework , and will defend the specific theses .
6 Objections to Premise ( 2 )
Finally , we come to the crucial premise ( 2 ) .
It is this premise that bridges the epistemic and modal domains , and it is this premise and associated principles that have attracted the most in - depth philosophical discussion .
Premise ( 2 ) says that if P&~Q is conceivable , P&~Q is 1 - possible .
This premise can be seen as an instance of the general conceivability - possibility thesis CP :
CP : If S is conceivable , S is 1 - possible .
Here , " conceivability " should be understood as ideal primary conceivability , of either the negative or positive variety ( I always take " ideal primary " as understood from here on ) .
The two versions of the thesis that result are equivalent to theses CP - and CP + , discussed earlier .
Thesis CP - is equivalent to the claim that if ~S is not a priori , S is 1 - possible .
The positive version CP + , holding that if S is positively conceivable , S is 1 - possible , is somewhat weaker than the negative version , as positive conceivability entails negative conceivability but the reverse is not obviously the case .
Much of my discussion will apply equally to both CP + or CP - , so I will often just speak of CP , except where the distinction is relevant .
The case for premise ( 2 ) largely derives from the case for CP , and from here on I will mostly focus on the general principle rather than the specific premise .
Of course if it turns out that the general principle needs to be restricted to a certain class of sentences to be plausible , then the question will arise as to whether P& ~Q falls into that class .
Why believe CP ?
In the first instance , the thesis is plausible because there are no clear counterexamples to it .
Principles linking conceivability and possibility have been widely accepted in the history of philosophy , but have more recently been questioned because of various counterexamples , such as the Goldbach case ( both Goldbach 's conjecture and its negation are conceivable but only one is possible ) and especially the Kripke cases ( ' Hesperus is not Phosphorus ' is conceivable but not possible ) .
But CP accommodates these examples straightforwardly , with the idealization accommodating Goldbach cases , and the primary / secondary distinction accommodating Kripke cases .
If it handles these cases , then the central sources of resistance to conceivability - possibility principles is undermined .
But of course , there may be other possible sources of resistance .
7 Strong Necessities
Before proceeding , it is useful to clarify CP by making clear what a counterexample to it would involve .
According to the two - dimensional analysis , ordinary Kripkean a posteriori necessities such as ' water is H 2 O ' and ' Hesperus is Phosphorus ' have a necessary secondary intension but a contingent primary intension .
That is , such statements are 2 - necessary but 1 - contingent : there are centered possible worlds ( a Twin Earth world , or a world with distinct morning and evening stars ) that verify their negations .
When S is an a posteriori necessity of this sort , with a contingent primary intension , we might say that S is a weak a posteriori necessity .
By contast , we can say that an a posteriori necessity is a strong a posteriori necessity , or just a strong necessity , iff S has a necessary primary intension .
Strong necessities are a posteriori necessities that are verified by all centered metaphysically possible worlds .
It is not easy to give examples of strong necessities , as all of Kripke 's a posteriori necessities appear to be weak necessities .
But I will discuss some putative candidates in what follows .
It is easy to see that CP - is equivalent to the thesis that there are no strong necessities .
If S is negatively conceivable but not 1 - possible , then ~S will be a strong necessity .
If S is a strong necessity , then ~S will be negatively conceivable but not 1 - possible .
Insofar as CP + is potentially weaker than CP- , the relationship between CP + and the thesis that there are no strong necessities is not as clear .
Certainly any counterexample to CP + will yield a strong necessity , but the reverse is not obviously the case .
To handle this , we might define two classes of strong necessities , according to whether they provide counterexamples to CP + or merely to CP - .
Let us say that a negative strong necessity is a statement S such that S is 1 - necessary and 2 - necessary but ~S is negatively conceivable .
The latter condition is equivalent to the requirement that S is not a priori , so negative strong necessities are equivalent to strong necessities as defined above .
A positive strong necessity is a statement S such that S is 1 - necessary and 2 - necessary while ~S is positively conceivable .
Then all positive strong necessities are negative strong necessities , but the reverse is not trivially the case .
CP - and CP + are then equivalent to the theses that there are no negative strong necessities and that there are no positive strong necessities respectively .
What would a strong necessity involve ?
To get an idea , consider a philosophical view on which it is metaphysically necessary that an omniscient being ( e.g. God ) exists , but on which it is not a priori that such a being exists .
Then according to this view , ' An omniscient being exists ' ( or O ) is an a posteriori necessity .
Like all a posteriori necessities , O is 2 - necessary , and ~O is negatively conceivable ( and also positively conceivable , if we add the plausible claim that it is positively conceivable that there is no omniscient being ) .
If O were an ordinary a posteriori necessity , then O would be 1 - contingent : there would be a metaphysically possible world verifying ~O .
But if there is no omniscient being , then it seems that there is no such world .
' There is an omniscient being ' does not seem to have any difference in its primary and secondary intensions , so if a world satisfies O , it verifies O .
So given that O is 2 - necessary , O is 1 - necessary .
It follows that if this philosophical view is correct , then O is a strong necessity : it is at least a negative strong necessity , and given the positive conceivability claim above , it is a positive strong necessity .
One could put the matter by saying that there is an epistemically possible scenario verifying ~O , but no metaphysically possible world verifying ~O .
Here a scenario can be understood as corresponding to a maximal a priori coherent hypothesis , in the way that worlds correspond to maximal metaphysically possible hypotheses .
( I give a formal treatment of scenarios in Chalmers ( 2004a , forthcoming ) , but here I will leave the notion intuitive .
( One might call this sort of scenario a negative scenario , since it corresponds to a maximal negatively conceivable hypothesis .
One could also define a positive scenario so that it corresponds to a maximal positively conceivable hypothesis . )
The notion of scenarios is not defined in terms of metaphysical possibility , and in particular it is not assumed that scenarios correspond to metaphysically possible worlds .
But nevertheless it is plausible that there is an intimate relationship .
For any a posteriori necessity S , there will be a scenario verifying ~S .
For example , as ' water is H 2 O ' is not a priori , there will be a scenario verifying ' water is not H 2 O ' .
That is , there will be some maximal a priori coherent hypothesis H ( perhaps involving the assumption that the watery stuff is made of XYZ , and so on ) such that if we accept H , we should accept ' water is not H 2 O ' .
For ordinary a posteriori necessities , these scenarios will correspond closely to centered metaphysically possible worlds , so that there will be a centered world verifying ~S .
For example , ' water is not H 2 O ' is verified by a centered XYZ - world , where the individual at the center is and has always been surrounded by clear , drinkable XYZ in the oceans and lakes .
There is little reason to doubt that such a world is metaphysically possible , and there is an intuitive sense in which it qualitatively matches the scenario that we imagine when we entertain the hypothesis that water is not XYZ . [*]
( I will leave the notion of correspondence ( or of qualitative matching ) between scenarios and worlds at an intuitive level here , as it is not needed to play a formal role in the arguments .
One might formalize it by requiring that scenarios be described in a limited vocabulary consisting of semantically neutral terms and indexicals , in the form D&I , where D is an semantically neutral statement and I is a conjunction of indexical statements .
Then a scenario characterized by D&I will correspond to a centered world w iff D is true of w and iff I is true ( in the obvious sense ) of the individuals at the center of W. )
When S is a strong necessity , by contrast , there will be a scenario verifying ~S , but this scenario will correspond to no metaphysically possible world .
( When S is a positive strong necessity , there will be a positive scenario verifying ~S ; when S is a negative strong necessity , there will be a negative scenario verifying ~ S . )
For example , given the theist view outlined above , there will be a ( negative and positive ) scenario verifying ' There is no omniscient being ' , involving some maximally detailed hypothesis under which there is no such being .
But on this view , there is no centered world that corresponds to this scenario , and there is no centered world that itself verifies ' There is no omniscient being ' .
We might put this intuitively by saying that on this view , the space of ( centered ) metaphysically possible worlds is smaller than the space of epistemically possible scenarios , at least in the relevant respect .
On this view , there are scenarios that correspond to no world .
To bring this back to the mind - body case : take the paradigmatic type - B materialist who holds that premise ( 1 ) is true , premise ( 2 ) is false , and materialism is true .
On this view , the material conditional P⊃Q ( which is itself the negation of P&~Q ) is a strong necessity .
The truth of materialism implies that it is 2 - necessary , the truth of ( 1 ) implies that it is a posteriori and its negation is 1 - conceivable , but the falsity of ( 2 ) implies that its negation is 1 - necessary .
On this view , there will be a scenario verifying P&~Q , including various specific zombie scenarios .
But these scenarios will correspond to no metaphysically possible world .
Note that the analog of CP with scenarios instead of worlds is close to trivial : if S is conceivable in the relevant sense , there will automatically be a scenario verifying S ( at least if the notions of a scenario and of verification are unproblematic ) .
Even a type - B materialist and a believer in strong necessities can accept that principle .
They must simply deny that all scenarios correspond to worlds .
So CP might be seen as equivalent to the thesis that for every scenario , there is a corresponding world .
( In Chalmers 2004a , the Core Thesis of epistemic two - dimensional semantics says that S is a priori iff S has a necessary 1 - intension .
If 1 - intensions are defined over scenarios , then the resulting Weak Core Thesis is independent of CP , makes no claim about metaphysical possibility , and need not be disputed by believers in strong necessities .
If 1 - intensions are defined over centered worlds , then the resulting Strong Core Thesis is equivalent to CP and must be disputed by believers in strong necessities .
The Strong Core Thesis can also be understood as the thesis of Metaphysical Plenitude : that every negatively conceivable statement is verified by some centered world .
So the nexus of the debate over premise ( 2 ) might be phrased in terms of either CP , the Strong Core Thesis , or the thesis of Metaphysical Plenitude . )
My view is that for every scenario there is a corresponding world , and that there are no strong necessities .
In The Conscious Mind , I gave the following reasons for this : ( i ) strong necessities cannot be supported by analogy with other a posteriori necessities ; ( ii ) they involve a far more radical sort of a posteriori necessity than Kripke 's , requiring a distinction between conceptual and metaphysical possibility at the level of worlds ; ( iii ) they lead to an ad hoc proliferation of modalities ; ( iv ) they raise deep questions of coherence ; ( v ) strong necessities will be brute and inexplicable ; and ( vi ) the only motivation to posit a strong necessity in the mind - body case is the desire to save materialism .
I still accept most of these reasons , but there is more to say .
In the last decade or so , numerous objections to CP have been proposed .
These objections fall into a number of classes .
The first , and largest , involves attempts at exhibiting clear cases of strong necessities .
The second involves attempts at explaining how there might be strong necessities in the phenomenal case ( if not elsewhere ) , by analyzing the nature of phenomenal concepts .
The third involves general philosophical objections .
I will take these in turn .
8 Are There Strong Necessities ?
I : Examples .
I will discuss a number of putative counterexamples to CP in turn .
The first five involve a posteriori identities .
The next four involve are tied to issues about the a priori and a priori entailment , and involve potential challenges to CP - .
The last five , suggested especially by Yablo ( 1999 , 2002 ) , involve challenges to CP - and CP +.
(1) Kripke cases :
It is occasionally proposed that some Kripkean a posteriori necessities are in fact strong necessities .
In particular , it is sometimes proposed that coextensive names such as ' Cicero ' and ' Tully ' may have the same primary intension as well as the same secondary intension .
If so , ' Cicero is Tully ' is a strong necessity ( as it is clearly a posteriori ) .
In response :
When we entertain the hypothesis that Cicero is not Tully , this hypothesis corresponds to specific scenarios that we can elaborate .
In particular , the relevant scenarios may involve the hypothesis that the causal chains associated with names ' Cicero ' and ' Tully ' pick out different historical individuals .
A scenario like this certainly corresponds to a centered metaphysically possible world : there are certainly worlds where the causal chains associated with these words functions in this way .
And it seems clear that if we discovered that our world were such a world , we would reject the hypothesis that Cicero is Tully .
So such a world seems to verify ' Cicero is not Tully ' ( although it may not satisfy ' Cicero is not Tully ' ) .
Worlds like this can be found for any Kripkean a posteriori necessity S ( as Kripke himself pointed out , in effect ) , and such worlds will always verify ~S .
One might resist the claim that the world in question verifies S by rejecting the claim that there is an a priori entailment ( for the speaker in question ) from a description of the world in question to S .
In response , I think that the sort of considerations in Chalmers and Jackson ( 2001 ) strongly suggest that these entailments are a priori at least in principle .
But even if one rejects this claim , there is clearly remains some distinctive epistemic relation between the world in question and ' Cicero is not Tully ' : in particular , it remains the case that if one accepts ( hypothetically ) that the actual world is qualitatively just like the world in question , and reflects on this hypothesis , then one will reject the claim that Cicero is not Tully .
( Note that this is quite unlike the situation that the theist thinks obtains in the God case , where there is no world that stands in this inferential relation to ' There is no God ' . )
So if one rejects a priori entailments , one can use this sort of inferential relation to define primary intensions , and ordinary Kripkean necessities will always have a primary intension that is false at some world .
(2) Essential modes of presentation .
Block ( ?? ) and Tye( ?? ) have suggested that one might get counterexamples to CP via identities in which each expression picks out an identity via an essential property .
For example , let Q be a quantum - mechanical description that happens to pick out H 2 O .
Then ' Q=H 2 O ' is a posteriori ( since the quantum - mechanical and chemical descriptions are not conceptually connected ) , but each picks out the referent via an essential property ( which corresponds to the primary intension ) , so ' Q=H 2 O ' will be 2 - impossible .
Kallestrup ( forthcoming ) also argues that a posteriori microphysical identities such as ' Q=H 2 O ' will be strong necessities , on the grounds that microphysical terms have identical primary and secondary intensions .
In response :
It is arguable that microphysical and chemical expressions pick out their referents by contingent properties , for reasons described earlier .
Further , an entity can have more than one essential property , so that if a substance is picked out by distinct essential properties , the corresponding primary intensions will differ and the sentence will not be 1 - possible .
Finally , it is pretty clear that the scenario one has in mind when one conceives of the falsity of ' Q=H 2 O ' ( say , a world where something with the structure of Q yields quite different chemical - level properties due to different quantum - mechanical laws ) will itself correspond to a possible world W that verifies ' Q is not H 2 O ' .
So unless one gives independent reason to think that there is no such world w ( perhaps because one holds the strong view of the necessity of laws of nature , discussed under objection ( 12 ) below ) , there is little reason to deny the natural view that ' Q ' and ' H 2 O ' have distinct primary intensions .
If so , there is no counterexample here .
(3) Distinct homophonous expressions .
Block ( 2006 ) has suggested a case analogous to the ' Cicero=Tully ' case above in which the same orthographic expression is used on each side .
E.g. , perhaps one has acquired the term ' chat ' on two separate occasions for two separate species .
One may then lose any associated information , but still recognize that they are distinct expressions , so that ' chat=chat ' will not be a priori .
But let us say , the two expressions ' chat ' pick out the same referent .
Then ' chat=chat ' will be necessary , but both sides will have the same primary intension .
At least , the explanation above , suggesting a primary intension along the lines of " the thing causally connected to my use of ' chat ' " , suggests that the sentence will be 1 - necessary .
In response : Even here , there will be a centered world corresponding to the scenario one has in mind when one entertains the falsity of the hypothesis one expresses with ' chat=chat ' .
Such a centered world involves distinct causal chains from each of the two uses of ' chat ' to distinct entities .
Here the two uses can at least be distinguished indexically , with a primary intension along the lines of " the thing causally connected to this use of ' chat ' " .
( If necessary , these indexicals can be grounded in direct indexical reference to token mental states , along the lines below . )
(4) Demonstratives : Schiffer ( 2004 ) suggests a worry about identities involving perceptual demonstratives , such as ' that =that ' .
In most such cases , there is no problem : the conceivable falsity of such a claim corresponds to a scenario in which the item causing a certain sort of experience in one differs from the item causing a different sort of experience , and this scenario will correspond to a centered world , such that if one discovered this world to be actual then one would reject ' that =that ' .
But there are cases in which the relevant experiences are indistinguishable , such as Austin 's " Two Tubes " case ( 1989 ) in which one simply sees two red dots in a symmetrical visual field , or a case where one sees many dots and has no way to pick out any one of them by description .
Then the model above involving different sorts of experience will not apply .
In response : Again one will have to invoke indexicals here , so that the primary intension of each ' that ' will be roughly equivalent to that of ' the cause of this experience ' , for different phenomenal indexicals ' this ' .
In this case , the phenomenal indexical must be considered a primitive indexical akin to ' I ' and ' now ' .
Formally , evaluating the primary intension of such an indexical requires a centered world where the center includes not just a subject and a time , but certain marked experience tokens , to which the distinct phenomenal indexicals are linked .
Then ' that =that ' will be false at centered worlds where the two relevant experience tokens marked at the center are caused by different objects .
For more on this , see Chalmers ( 2003 b ) .
(5) Dancing qualia : Hawthorne ( 2006 ) suggests a case involving phenomenal concepts , based on the dancing qualia case in The Conscious Mind .
Say that Fred starts with identical red experiences in the left and right half of his visual field , forms concepts R1 and R2 ( pure phenomenal concepts , in the language of Chalmers 2003b ) of the relevant phenomenal property ( phenomenal redness ) and judges R1=R2 .
After this the experiences in the right half of his visual field " dance " between red and blue every minute , while they continue to play the same functional role ( in The Conscious Mind I argued that this is naturally impossible but allowed that it is logically possible ) .
Fred has been told that this may happen , but when a change happens he is unable to notice it .
After four minutes his right - field experience is back to red , and he once again entertains the thought R1=R2 .
But he is unable to know that this is true through any amount of a priori reasoning , so R1 is not R2 is at least negatively conceivable .
But both R1 and R2 have the same primary intension , so R1=R2 is 1 - necessary .
If so , this is a counterexample to CP - .
In response : This should be treated analogously to a case in which Fred 's cognitive processes are tampered with so that they first judge 7+5=12 ( with normal processes ) , then 7+5=14 with abnormal cognition , then back again .
If Fred knows this is happening , then when he entertains 7+5=12 he will be unable to know that it is happening through any amount of a priori reasoning .
Nevertheless , his thought is still a priori .
This is simply a situation in which tampering with cognitive processes renders him less than ideal , so that he is unable to know all a priori knowable truths .
( Or , in a closely related version , it is a situation where misleading empirical evidence undercuts his ability to know these . )
The dancing qualia case above should be treated the same way .
(6) Ordinary macroscopic truths
Another class of examples comes from the suggestion that consciousness is not alone in its failure to be a priori entailed by microphysical truths .
Block and Stalnaker ( 1999 ) have suggested that many ordinary macroscopic truths , such as " water boils at 100 degrees " ( or W ) , are not a priori entailed in this way .
If so , then P& ~W is at least negatively conceivable .
But P&W is not possible ( at least if water and its properties supervene on the microphysical ) , and it is not clearly 1 - possible , either .
If it is not , then P& ~W is a counterexample to CP - .
In response : Chalmers and Jackson ( 2001 ) argue that these macroscopic Ctruths are a priori entailed by P , or at least by PQTI ( say what this is , here if not before ) .
Of course P&~Q , P&~T , and P& ~I may be negatively conceivable , but the latter two are clearly also 1 - possible , while the former is precisely the main topic of dispute .
So any failures of entailment by P associated with the failure of entailment to Q , T , or I give no further support to the existence of strong necessities .
Such support would require at least a truth M such that PQTI does not a priori entail M , and such that PQTI⊃M is 2 - necessary and 1 - necessary .
The arguments in Chalmers and Jackson 2001 suggest that at no ordinary macroscopic truths M are like this .
In any case , even if one rejects the a priori entailment thesis here , these cases will yield at best exceptions to CP - ( i.e. negative strong necessities ) , not exceptions to CP + ( i.e. positive strong necessities ) .
Even if w above is like Q in that P&~W and even PQTI&~W is negatively conceivable , PQTI&~W is not positively conceivable : " water - zombies " are not positively conceivable in the way that zombies are positively conceivable .
So this sort of case leaves CP + unthreatened .
(7) Unknowable mathematical truths .
Perhaps the most challenging cases for CP - are mathematical truths M such that M is true ( and so necessarily true and 1 - necessarily true ) , but not knowable , and so not knowable a priori .
If there are such cases , M is a negative strong necessity ( though not a positive strong necessity , as ~ M is not positively conceivable ) .
Here one might appeal to unprovable true mathematical sentences , such as those whose existences is entailed by Gödel 's theorem .
In response : Unprovability in a given system does not entail non-apriority .
For example , the consistency of Peano Arithmetic is not provable in Peano Arithmetic , but is still plausibly knowable a priori .
One can make the case ( see Chalmers 2002 ) that all true statements of arithmetic are knowable a priori at least under an idealization ( i.e. , our failure to know them a priori is due to certain limitations of our cognitive systems ) .
One might worry about higher set theory , such as the Continuum Hypothesis , but here it is far from clear that such sentence are determinately true or false , and it is also far from clear that they are not knowable a priori under an idealization .
So although these cases provide an interesting challenge to CP - , they do not provide clear counterexamples to CP - .
And as in the previous case , there is no challenge to CP + here .
(8) Inscrutable truths .
A related class of potential counterexamples to CP - includes special sorts of true sentences M such that according to certain philosophical views , M is not a priori entailed by any underlying qualitative truths , but such that it is necessitated by such truths .
In Chalmers ( 2002 ) I call these inscrutable truths .
Such sentences might include vague sentences such as ' John is bald ' , under some versions of the epistemic theory of vagueness , according to which such sentences can be true but unknowable even in principle on the basis of underlying qualitative information .
Others might include certain moral or metaphysical truths , on views according to which there are true such sentences with no a priori link to underlying qualitative truths .
In Chalmers ( 2002 ) I argue that there are no compelling counterexamples here , as the views in question should all be rejected .
In any case , these cases do not typically go along with the positive conceivability of PQTI ⊃~M , and so at best challenge CP - , not CP +.
(9) The deeply contingent a priori .
Hawthorne ( 2004 ) suggests that some truths may be a priori even though they are false in some possible worlds considered as actual .
For example , let E⊃H be a conditional from one 's total evidence to a hypothesis it supports .
Then there are some grounds for holding E⊃H to be a priori ( since the inference from E to H transmits justification and arguably cannot itself be a posteriori ) .
But E⊃H it is certainly not 1 - necessary : E&~H is verified by many worlds where the evidence is misleading .
If so , E&~H is ruled out a priori ( so it counts as inconceivable by the earlier definition ) , but it is 1 - possible .
Strictly speaking this sort of case does not challenge CP - , but rather challenges the associated " right - to - left " principle .
This is still a worry for the framework , however , and addressing it helps to clarify an important issue .
In response :
There may be a sense in which E⊃H is a priori here , in that it has some justification independently of experience .
But there is a sense in which it is not , or at least in which its justification is much weaker than that of many other a priori truths .
Intuitively , one cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that E&~H , whereas one can conclusively rule out the hypothesis that 2+2=5 for example .
Conclusive justification is the sort that one gets from proof and analysis , rather than from abduction and induction , for example .
In the uses of the a priori in the current context , it is always the conclusive a priori that is relevant .
By this standard , E&~H is not ruled out a priori .
This allows one to accommodate the clear intuition that E&~H is not just 1 - possible but 1 - conceivable : it is always conclusive apriority that is relevant to matters of conceivability .
( 10 ) Disquotational truths .
Yablo ( 2002 ) suggests that certain disquotational truths , such as " ' sister ' means sister " , are a priori but are not 1 - necessary .
It could turn out that ' sister ' does not mean sister , in worlds where the term is used differently , and such worlds verify " ' sister ' does not mean sister " .
In response : I think the treatment of this case differs depending on whether one sees ' sister ' picking out its referent orthographically ( so just a certain orthographic form is required ) or semantically ( so that a certain meaning is required ) .
If " ' sister ' " is understood orthographically , then " ' sister ' means sister " is not a priori : it is substantive a posteriori knowledge that the orthographic item means anything at all .
If " ' sister ' " is understood semantically , then " ' sister ' means sister " may be a priori , but it is also 1 - necessary : cases where the orthographic item is used with a different meaning will be irrelevant to the primary intension of " ' sister ' " .
( 11 ) Response - enabled concepts .
Yablo ( 2002 ) argues that certain geometric terms such as ' oval ' may pick out certain shapes according to the way they trigger certain responses , rather than through a substantive independent grasp .
In the actual world ' oval ' picks out cassinis ( where ' cassini ' is defined mathematically ) , but ' ovals are cassinis ' is not knowable a priori .
But ' ovals are cassinis ' is nevertheless necessary and 1 - necessary ( a world where cassinis cause oval experiences is not a world where it would have turned out that ovals are cassinis , according to Yablo ) , so it is a strong necessity .
In response : I think that the actual term ' oval ' may embody a geometric understanding , so that ' ovals are cassinis ' ( or something like it ) is a priori .
But there might be other terms that could work in Yablo 's response - enabled way , though , so I will go along with his treatment of ' oval ' as one of them .
Under this assumption , we should say that ' ovals are cassinis ' is not 1 - necessary .
If w is a world where Hs cause oval experiences , then ( under this model of ' oval ' ) it is a priori that if w is actual , so that Hs cause oval experiences , then ovals are Hs .
( What matters for evaluating a primary intension is the a priori connection , not the " turns out " claim above . )
( 12 ) Laws of nature .
According to some philosophical views , laws of nature are not just naturally necessary but are metaphysically necessary .
Shoemaker ( 1999 ) holds such a view , and suggests that it may provide a counterexample to CP .
In response :
On some versions of this view , laws of nature follow a version of the Kripkean model .
That is , if mass in the actual world obeys certain laws , then nothing in any counterfactual world counts as mass unless it obeys exactly those laws , so any law involving mass will be necessary .
This might hold because of the semantics of mass ( which require that a counterfactual property have the same nomic role as actual mass in order to qualify as the referent of ' mass ' ) , or it might hold because of the metaphysics of mass ( according to which properties such as mass have their nomic profile essentially , as on Shoemaker 's view ) .
On these models , we need not deny that there are worlds that correspond to the scenario we conceive when we conceive that mass obeys different laws : it is just that such worlds will contain " schmass " rather than mass .
I think that it is implausible that the modal profile of ' mass ' and / or the essential properties of mass are this precise ( see Fine 2002 and Sidelle 2002 for arguments ) , but in any case , this model does not provide a counterexample to CP .
In this case , a schmass world may verify the hypothesis that the relevant law of nature is false , so laws of nature are not strong necessities .
To yield strong necessities , this sort of view must hold that not only are there no worlds where mass obeys different laws , but there are also no related worlds where something else , " schmass " , obeys those different laws .
Here , the relevant sort of view is one according to which the fundamental properties and laws of all worlds are the fundamental properties and laws of our world ( and on which these laws are not knowable a priori ) .
In effect , this restricts the space of metaphysically possible worlds to the space of naturally possible worlds .
If this view is correct , then a fundamental law will be a strong necessity : there will be no world corresponding to the scenario that we conceive when we conceive that is false .
I think that there are no good reasons to accept this extremely strong view of laws of nature , and that there are good reasons to reject it .
The best reasons to take the hypothesis that laws of nature are necessary seriously come from the Kripke and Shoemaker models above .
But nothing in these models supports the strong view , or yields a strong necessity .
Rather , the CP thesis can itself be taken as reason to reject the view .
( 13 ) A necessary God .
I have already noted that the existence of strong necessities is entailed by a theist view on which an omniscient being ( or an omnipotent being , or a perfect being ) exists necessarily but on which the existence of such a being is not knowable a priori .
If we say that a god is by definition an omniscient being ( or a perfect being , or whatever ) , then ' A god exists ' will be a strong necessity .
In response : I think that theist views of this sort are to be rejected .
If the existence of such a god is knowable a priori , then it may exist necessarily .
But if it is not , then one should conclude that such a being exists at best contingently .
I cannot go over the arguments for believing in a necessary god here , but they all rest on highly contentious premises , and once again , CP itself provides an argument against these views .
The best way to defend the existence of a necessary god is to argue that a world without such a being is not even conceivable .
Even if one believes in that the existence of a god provides a strong necessity , it is not clear that this sort of strong necessity undermines the case against materialism .
The debate over materialism uses necessity as a criterion of ontological distinctness : the question of whether physical truths necessitate phenomenal truths is relevant precisely insofar as it bears on the question of whether the phenomenal involves nothing ontologically " over and above " the physical .
But a variety of necessity in which the existence of a god is necessary will not be well - suited to this role .
On such a view , the existence of a god will be necessitated by physical truths , but such a god will presumably nevertheless be ontologically nonphysical .
So if the only strong necessities are strong necessities of this sort , connecting ontologically distinct existences , their existence is no help to physicalism .
Under this assumption , then if P&~Q is conceivable , Q will be something over and above the physical , either because it is nec

After the Cold War had ended , then Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti confirmed to the Italian Senate in August 1990 that Italy had had a secret stay - behind army , codenamed Gladio – the sword .
A document dated 1 June 1959 from the Italian military secret service , SIFAR , revealed that SIFAR had been running the secret army with the support of NATO and in close collaboration with the US secret service , the CIA .
Suggesting that the secret army might have linked up with right - wing organizations such as Ordine Nuovo and Avanguardia Nazionale to engage in domestic terror , the Italian Senate , amid public protests , decided in 1990 that Gladio was beyond democratic control and therefore had to be closed down .
During the 1990s , research into stay - behind armies progressed only very slowly , due to very limited access to primary documents .
It was revealed , however , that stay - behind armies covered all of Western Europe and operated under different code names , such as Gladio in Italy , Absalon in Denmark , P26 in Switzerland , ROC in Norway , I&O in the Netherlands , and SDRA8 in Belgium .
The so - called Allied Clandestine Committee ( ACC ) and the Clandestine Planning Committee ( CPC ) , linked to NATO 's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ( SHAPE ) , coordinated the stay - behind networks on an international level .
The last confirmed ACC meeting took place on 24 October 1990 in Brussels , chaired by the Belgian military secret service , the SGR .
According to the SIFAR documen of 1959 the secret stay - behind armies served a dual purpose during the Cold War :
They were to prepare for a communist Soviet invasion and occupation of Western Europe , and – also in the absence of an invasion – for an “ emergency situation . ”
The first purpose was clear :
If there had been a Soviet invasion , the secret anti-communist armies would have operated behind enemy lines , strengthening and setting up local resistance movements in enemy held territory , evacuating pilots who had been shot down , and sabotaging supply lines and production centers of the occupation forces .
The second purpose , the preparation for an emergency situation , is more difficult to understand and remains the subject of ongoing research .
As this second purpose clearly did not relate to a foreign invasion , the emergency situation referred to is likely to have meant all domestic threats , most of which were of a civilian nature .
During the Cold War , the national military secret services in the countries of Western Europe differed greatly in what they perceived to be an emergency situation .
But there was agreement between the military secret services of the United States and of Western Europe that communist parties , and to some degree also socialist parties , had a real potential to weaken NATO from within and therefore represented a threat to the alliance .
If they gained political strength and entered the executive , or , worse still , gained control of defense ministries , an emergency situation would result .
The evidence now available suggests that in some countries the secret stay - behind armies linked up with right - wing terrorists and carried out terror attacks that were later wrongly blamed on the political left in order to discredit the communists and prevent them from assuming top executive positions .
Evidence suggests that recruitment and operations methods differed greatly from country to country .
The research project into NATO ’s secret armies that is being undertaken by the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) , Zurich , and is headed by myself , has collected and published the available country - specific evidence in the first English - language book on the topic , entitled NATO 's Secret Armies : Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe ( London and New York : Frank Cass [ www.tandf.co.uk/books ] , 1 January 2005 , 300 pages ) .
In a second step , the project is working on gaining access to declassified primary documents , while encouraging discussion among NATO officials , secret services and military officials , and the international research community in order to clarify the strategy , training , and operations of the stay - behind armies .
