On a distant planet , two species evolve : the Dark Ones , who are evil and set out to exterminate all other life , and the Encyclopods , who defend all life from the Dark Ones and store the DNA of all endangered species for future reference in case they become extinct .
Eventually the chi recedes and the Dark Ones exterminate the majority of the universe 's biodiversity , including the Encyclopods .
Only one Encyclopod egg is left behind , in the form of a violet dwarf star .

Note that all existing light continues to move at its original slow pace ( otherwise the plot of " When Aliens Attack " falls apart , if nothing else ) , and that it is never explicitly stated that the scientists in question are from Earth .
This is the reason why intergalactic travel is possible in the Futurama universe .
Thus , this event probably marks the beginning of real interstellar travel on the part of humanity - and , conjecturally , every other species in the Futurama universe .
As a result , first contact between humans and extraterrestrials is quite likely to have occurred almost immediately after this .
Read on .
Intergalactic travel by any species before this date has not been depicted onscreen .

Farnsworth is fired but takes one of the metaparticles with him , Mom gets back together with Ogden Wernstrom ( her ex-husband ) , and Mom Corp creates an energy company based on the dark matter .
( Farnsworth describes this as " Thirty - odd years ago " in around 3008 , which places this event around 2978 , but it must also precede the mining of Vergon VI which occurs below , and I trust Nibbler 's timekeeping more than Farnsworth's . )

Note also that at this point Leela has not yet met her true parents , so she cannot know her own birth date or age with much certainty .
Most likely she is counting from the date she was abandoned on the doorstep of the Orphanarium , which may post - date her actual birth by as much as a few months .

By 3008 , if this was n't already the case , the Nibblonian battery farm is the only ready source of dark matter in the universe and Mom has an energy monopoly .

Lars Fillmore , who is hiding inside the same tube , freezes himself for a further two years .
Fry gives the year as 3000 in this episode , putting it out of sequence .
However , he also refers to his life " in the year 2000 " , which is fallacious since he was frozen after only a few seconds of 2000 had elapsed .

The duplicate body is eventually destroyed .
( 5ACV01 - 4 ) Bender 's Big Score
27th November 3007 Events of " Bender 's Big Score " .
This feature - length episode takes place ( mainly ) in late 3007 ; it seems logical to assume that its events begin on 27th November 3007 , precisely 1000 years after the real - life US release of the " Bender 's Big Score " DVD .
During this episode , Bender travels back to 1351 BCE , 1509 CE , 2308 CE , and many other eras , retrieving priceless treasures and bringing them to the present day .
Many of his trips ( e.g. acquiring the sarcophagus of pharaoh Amenhotep III and the 2308 Nobel Peace Prize ) fulfill established history because the treasures in question are lost to history ; however , equally many ( the Mona Lisa , Vincent van Gogh 's Self - portrait of Autumn 1887 ) result in the creation of doomed time paradox duplicates of the artifacts in question .
All these duplicates are destroyed by the end of the episode , however , resolving the paradoxes .
Bender 's head is already 1045 years older than his body due to the events of " Roswell That Ends Well " , but during this episode his head and body both accrue a grand total of more than a hundred thousand years of additional age .

At Lars ' funeral , Bender , now in funeral wear , extracts the Time Code tattoo from Lars ' butt cheek and travels back to January 1 , 2000 one final to paste it onto Fry 's ass , completing the Time Code causal loop .

Planet Express was actually founded in 2961 but it is entirely conceivable that the organisation made no successful deliveries until Fry , Leela and Bender joined the crew , and Hermes is counting from their first successful delivery ( to the Moon in " The Series Has Landed " , set early in 3000 ) .

Verbal bits from the Debian Project Leader

LinuxTag 2010 is the host of a Debian miniconf ; that , in turn , was where relatively new Debian leader Stefano Zacchiroli delivered a relatively high - energy " state of Debian " talk .
According to Stefano , Debian is doing great , but can do better yet ; he has some ideas for how to make the project better .
Debian has grown a lot since its origin back in 1993 .
At this point , it holds around 29,000 packages and is the base for some 120 derivative distributions .
There have been eleven major releases over the life of the project , with the twelfth getting closer .
The project has about 900 developers , plus about 120 " Debian maintainers " working on it .
It would seem that Debian is going strong .
Still , Stefano says that there is a certain amount of FUD going around the project , often voiced by Debian 's developers themselves .
Those developers worry that other distributions release more often , innovate more , and have more users than Debian does .
Also , somehow , those distributions seem to get more credit .
In this context , Stefano asked : is Debian still better , and is it still relevant ?
His answer was " yes " on both counts .
So why is Debian better ?
Freedom and independence were at the top of Stefano 's list .
Debian , he says , has pushed the concept of free software more strongly than most other distributions , and certainly more than the company - backed distributions have .
As a result , Debian 's users are more aware of freedom - related issues .
Debian is free software from the bottom to the top - even down to the firmware anymore .
There are no non-free web services either , for users or for developers .
Most high - profile alternatives to Debian are tied to companies , which means that , to some extent , they are answerable to those companies .
Debian is not , which gives the distribution the freedom to make its own decisions .
And , in fact , project governance is , according to Stefano , one of Debian 's strengths .
It is , at its core , a " do - ocracy , " where any developer is entitled to make all decisions related to his or her own work .
For group decisions , reputations are tightly tied to the work that each developer has done .
So those who do the work make the decisions ; Debian 's decisions are not imposed by any outside entity .
Finally , Stefano asserts that Debian is better because of the quality of the distribution .
The " release when it is ready " policy may lead to slow and unpredictable releases , but it also enables stable releases .
And , in Debian , most package maintainers are experts on the software they deal with .
That said , Debian can be better yet .
To that end , Stefano is trying to encourage Debian developers to take more responsibility for the quality of the distribution as a whole and to step up to get the work done .
At the top of his list is helping to get releases out the door ; that responsibility , he says , does not just lie with the release team .
Debian developers should " be bold " and , once they have dealt with their own release - critical ( RC ) bugs , they should go off and fix RC bugs in other packages as well .
In other words , Stefano is pushing Debian developers to use the non-maintainer update ( NMU ) process to push fixes into other developers ' packages .
Traditionally , Debian has given its developers a high level of control over their packages ; an NMU is seen as an action to be taken only when there is a dire need to do so .
Stefano thinks that NMUs should be done much more frequently ; the " delayed " mechanism should be used to give the package maintainer a chance to respond to the changes .
The use of NMUs is at the core of Stefano 's RC bug of the week initiative .
He has performed some 180 NMUs fixing RC bugs without hearing a single complaint from the maintainers involved .
Instead , he often gets thanks .
On occasion , the maintainer has overridden the NMU with a different fix , but that 's good too : it still means that the bug gets fixed .
All told , Stefano thinks it has been a successful initiative which should be adopted by others .
With regard to the perception that Debian lacks the manpower to get jobs done , Stefano says : be that manpower .
In particular , he would like to see more developers joining core teams which are having a hard time getting their work done .
It is , he says , harder than ranting on the mailing lists , but it is also more productive and satisfying .
There is also , he says , a feeling that Debian has reached a point where there is too much inertia to make large changes .
But it should n't be that way if developers jump in and simply make those changes happen .
Along the way , developers should n't always try to seek consensus on the mailing lists ; there will always be vocal , dissatisfied minorities but they should n't be able to keep things from getting done .
Speaking of the mailing lists , Stefano would like to see Debian become a more attractive community to be a part of .
Things have improved a lot over the years , but they can improve further yet .
The project cannot afford to lose people who are unable to develop a thick - enough skin to work within the community .
So he would like to see more active discouragement of bad behavior , both privately and publicly .
Finally , it would be good , he says , to reduce the barriers to participation in Debian .
One of the best things that could happen there would be to improve the documentation of Debian 's processes and procedures .
A posting to debian - devel - announce is not , he says , documentation ; there is no central organization and it is hard for newcomers to find later on .
With Stefano , the Debian project seems to have picked a more energetic and more communicative leader than in the recent past .
He seems determined to make use of the soapbox the project has loaned him to push the project toward improving itself .
Time will tell how much Debian 's famously independent - minded developers are willing to follow Stefano 's lead , but his goals - better releases and a more pleasant , more engaged community - seem uncontroversial .

The next - gen iPhone may be getting all the WWDC buzz , but some other Apple products could get a refresh during Monday 's keynote .
According to French blog MacGeneration ( French ) , the next Safari may be announced this Monday by Apple at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2010 ( WWDC ) , and could be loaded with features .
According to the rumor , the new Safari 5 will include improvements such as a " smarter " address field , hardware acceleration of Web page elements for the Windows version , improved history searching , a new private browsing icon , and a plethora of other improved features .
Safari 5 is rumored to have multiple new features including : Safari Reader ( which sounds like a new version of Safari 's built - in RSS reader ) , improved performance , better page caching , faster DNS prefetching ( which should improve page loading times ) , a Bing search option , improved HTML5 support , and more developer tools .
These rumored specs make Safari 5 sound like a major improvement over previous versions , but it 's still missing two big things : a good API for building extensions ( though blogger John Gruber hinted at an extension API for Safari last month ) and the option to automatically reopen pages that you left open when you closed the browser .
Until then , I 'm sticking with Google Chrome .

I 'm a thirty - something gay man married to a thirty - something gay man .
For almost two years , we 've been seeing another pair of married gay men around our age .
They were our first experience with any sexual or romantic interaction outside of our relationship .
The first six months were hot and heavy .
We were together constantly and having sex almost every night .
After the “ honeymoon phase ” ended , one member of the other couple ( “ Roger ” ) wanted to slow things down .
Roger and I had some conflict over this , and I have to admit that I showed a pretty bad side of myself while grappling with insecurity .
Eventually , Roger pulled me aside to talk one - on - one .
He wanted us to be “ friends who have sex sometimes . ”
Then , right after the COVID - 19 lockdown started , Roger and I had another heart - to - heart on my birthday .
After many drinks some a lot of making out we both said we loved each other .
Roger walked it back the next day .
“ I do n't know what you thought you heard last night , ” he basically said , “ but I 'm not in love with you . ” I was devastated .
This is n't what I want .
I am in love with Roger and his husband .
I do n't want to be “ friends who have sex sometimes . ”
My husband is OK with just being friends with Roger and his husband , especially since their large friend group has adopted us and he worries we ’ll lose all these new friends if I end our friendship with Roger and his husband .
I would really like to talk this out with Roger , but I 'm not sure I can get through that conversation without DTMFAing him .
I mean , which was it ?
Were we a fun sexy fling and nothing about the last two years mattered ?
Or was he in love with me but decided the conflict and complication of this relationship was n't worth it ?
Which was it ?
Trouble In The Quad
Horrified classmates defend ' hero ' pupil arrested for killing neighbour ' who attacked his mother '
James Killen , who killed a maniac attacking his mother , was at her bedside last night as doctors fought to save her life
The friend of a teenager arrested on suspicion of murder described him as a ' hero ' today for trying to defend his mother from a knife attack .
Schoolboy James Killen , 18 , was held by police after next - door neighbour Jonathan London , 46 , died of stab wounds .
It is believed Mr London attacked the teenager 's mother , former air stewardess Sandra Crawford , at her home in St Alban 's , Herts on Friday .
Mr Killen was arrested on suspicion of stabbing to death Mr London but later released on bail .
It is believed the teenager , a student at nearby Sandringham School , attacked Mr London after he discovered him slashing his mother .
Today his close friend Ben Riddell , 18 , also from St Albans , said ' kind and gentle ' James was desperately trying to defend his petite mother .
Ben , a fellow sixth - form pupil at Sandringham , said James came downstairs and initially thought his mother was being punched repeatedly by Mr London .
He said : ' James is one of the kindest , most gentle people I 've ever known .
' I went to the station last night for when James was released .
I spoke to him very briefly and we brought him a KFC and some clothes .
He was crying .
' Apparently at 8.40 am on Friday morning the man just walked in off the street and James came downstairs to his mum 's screams and thought the man was punching her .
' He jumped on his back and got the knife and managed to kill him .
James panicked and was running down the street and got arrested at the end of the road .
' James ' dad was at the police station but no one saw James until he got let out 12 hours later .
He can't go back to his house or get his clothes or his phone .
' He went to see his mum in hospital yesterday .
She has had heart surgery and is still heavily sedated .
' There had been no problems before whatsoever .
My grandmother knows the Londons and apparently they are the nicest family .
It 's horrible situation for everyone .
' I 've known James and his mum since I was three and have played football with him in the same team for ten years .
' It was a freak tragedy and James was a hero for getting his mum 's attacker off her and for killing him . '
Jonathan London 's elderly parents Jack and Maureen lived next door , and was described by his sister - in - law Jane London as epileptic and on medication .
Yesterday , an au pair described the bloody aftermath of the fight .
Livia Frakas , a 27 - year - old au pair from Slovakia , was taking her employer ’s two children to school when she heard a man ’s ‘ furious yell ’ before finding Ms Crawford ‘ covered in blood ’ outside her £ 600,000 home in St Albans , Herts .
She said : ‘ She was in a nightdress and pyjamas , blood was everywhere , all over her body and her face as well . ’
She said a younger man , believed to be James , then emerged from the house looking ‘ shocked and desperate ’ .
She added : ‘ He was crying for help .
He was in his school uniform .
He was on the phone to the ambulance and I heard him give the name of the road . ’
Police said there was no evidence of an ongoing dispute between the neighbours and they could find no reason for the attack .
Other neighbours described their shock as the drama unfolded .
One said : ‘ Officers were getting out of the car with guns , there were paramedics on the scene – we just did n’t know what was going on .
Ambulances and police gather at the scene of the attack in St Albans
Then an air ambulance landed in a field at the local school – it was absolute chaos . ’
He added that Ms Crawford and her son were ‘ nice people , quiet , they keep themselves to themselves generally ’ .
Another nearby resident , who was walking his dog past the house as paramedics treated one of the victims , said : ‘ I saw somebody on the lawn , they were trying to revive them .
‘ There was a young lad there in a bit of a state . ’
Police said Mr Killen had been bailed to ‘ a date in June ’ and they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack .
A local source said Mr London was known to take medication to control epilepsy .
The source also revealed there were no records to suggest he had received any treatment at a mental health institution .
Another schoolfriend of James , who refused to give his name , said he is studying for his A - levels and is planning to go to university .
He said : ‘ I have grown up with James and he is the nicest , most peaceful
person I know .
‘ Nobody would have anything bad to say about him and I know he ’s never had a violent encounter in his life . ’
Ms Crawford is being treated at Addenbrooke ’s Hospital , Cambridge .
As the financial reform debate formally begins in the Senate , the amendments have begun to pour in .
Many are sure to be controversial .
One such amendment : an excise tax on banker bonuses for 2009 .
Offered by Senator Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , it would impose a 50 % tax on what it defines an " excessive " incentive compensation award .
Such measures have become popular in Europe , with Britain and France adopting similar taxes .
Perhaps the most interesting part about U.S. version is how it defines " excessive " :
For purposes of this section , the term `covered excessive 2009 bonus ' means any 2009 bonus payment paid during any calendar year to a covered employee by any major Federal emergency economic assistance recipient , to the extent that the aggregate of such 2009 bonus payments ( without regard to the date on which such payments are paid ) with respect to such employee exceeds the dollar amount of the compensation received by the President under section 102 of title 3 , United States Code , for calendar year 2009 .
The emphasis is mine , to highlight the key point .
Webb wants a banker from a bailout firm to be taxed if his or her bonus exceeds Barack Obama 's salary .
According to the U.S. Code , that 's $ 400,000 .
Of course , Webb could have just said $ 400,000 .
So why did he instead choose to say the " compensation received by the President " ?
No doubt to make a political point .
He and many of his colleagues in Congress likely believe that any given Wall Street banker does n't deserve to receive a 2009 bonus larger than Obama 's total salary .
Webb wants to make clear that he did n't just pick $ 400,000 arbitrarily : he used the salary of his chief executive as a guide .
Jon Stewart Rips The President Over Gulf Oil Spill
When Comedy Central ‘s Jon Stewart , the host of The Daily Show , rips into the president we know there is something wrong .
While I have been defending him these past few weeks I am afraid now is not the time for him to be looking like Mr. Spock .
He needs to appear more presidential .
I have no doubt that he cares and cares deeply about what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico but his persona is betraying his actions .
Here is the story and Stewart ’s take on it :
So far this month , Alan is giving an intro to app localisation , but still looking for more speakers
So it ’s finally the day everyone has been waiting for … especially me .
I ’ve been looking forward to this day because it means I get to take a break .
But anyway , you do n’t want to hear what I have to say .
You want to play version 1.1 .
So head on over to the new official website , supermariobroscrossover.com , and play that shit !
This new version is awesome .
It has tons of new stuff , and it ’s almost like a re-release of the game .
This is how I would have wanted to originally release the game if I had the time .
Version 1.0 did n’t even feel like a game to me .
It did n’t add enough stuff to Super Mario Bros to be its own thing , so that ’s why I often referred to it as a demo .
Hopefully seeing all the new stuff I added gives you some hints that I plan on adding A LOT to this game .
This is just the beginning .
It really does feel like the beginning to me .
Ryu is now in the game , but that is old news to me .
The thing I ’m most excited about , and also the new feature I spent the most time on by far , is that the game now features a built - in NES sound emulator .
All of the music you hear in the game now is emulated using a C/C++ library called Game Music Emu .
There is no more mp3 music , so the filesize is significantly smaller and the sound quality is better .
The drawback is that this causes a decrease in performance for the game because of all the extra work it ’s doing .
I ’ve offered several sound quality options that change the amount of processing the emulator does , so I am hoping if people with slow computers use the low quality option , they ’ll still be okay .
If it still runs slow , you can turn off the music completely and performance will improve even more .
My computer is kind of slow so I have to use low quality .
And then there ’s a lot of other new stuff that I do n’t feel like talking about .
You can just play and you ’ll see it .
I made a page that talks about what I changed .
It ’s the new version history page .
And like I said before , there ’s now a website just for playing the game .
And I made a cool banner for the website .
At least , I think it ’s cool .
Oh I remember what I wanted to say .
A lot of people ask me about porting the game to other systems like Wii Homebrew , PSP , ROM , and other stuff like that .
So here ’s the deal .
For now , I ’m just making this one version of the game , and I do n’t want people to port it to anything else .
Why , you may ask ?
I have been advised by people in the game development industry that it ’s best to leave it as only a Flash game for now because it does n’t compete with Nintendo or any of the other companies whose intellectual property is used in the game .
As a flash game , Super Mario Bros .
Crossover is very nonthreatening .
It ’s just a fan game .
But if it starts getting ported to run on other hardware , especially Nintendo hardware , then it ’s a different story .
So for now , it ’s just an online game that you play in your browser .
And I ’m also not going to officially have any download links for the game .
It helps me when you play the game on my website instead of just downloading it and playing it on your own .
Your visits will help increase the page rank of the site and can help me to get more exposure and have more opportunities in general .
I did n’t put anything in the game that stops you from playing it offline though , so you still can if you want , but I ’d rather you play on the site .
And I guess that about wraps things up for now .
Hopefully everything works in the game .
If not , I can do some small fixes .
Report the bugs in the appropriate topic in the forum , and I ’ll destroy them … one by one .
I do n’t know how long it will be until the next big feature gets in the game .
I ’m definitely taking a vacation , but it ’s sort of in my nature to work constantly , so who knows .
I hope you enjoy version 1.1 .
I worked like hell to make it , and a few people helped me with some stuff , mostly J Squared and Blargg .
So thanks for your support , thanks for playing the game , and most of all , thanks for enjoying the game .
If no one liked it , I would have stopped at version 1.0 .
And now , it is my great pleasure to tell you to get your ass over to supermariobroscrossover.com and play Super Mario Bros.
Crossover Version 1.1 … and while your ass is doing that , mine is going to sleep !

FRANKFURT  Signs emerged Tuesday that Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis was feeding through into the euro area economy , as unemployment rose and a survey pointed to a slowdown in the recovery of manufacturing , with a sharp decline in Greece .
While Greece accounts for less than 3 percent of the euro area gross domestic product , a survey of purchasing managers by Markit Economics pointed to a plunge in manufacturing that would make it that much more difficult for the country to solve the debt problems that are at the heart of Europe ’s crisis .
Manufacturing growth in Spain also may be losing momentum , according to Markit .
Meanwhile , Spain retained the dubious distinction of being the euro zone country with the highest unemployment rate  19.7 percent , compared with an average of 10.1 percent for the 16 countries using the single currency .
Unemployment for the euro area as a whole in April was up from 10 percent in March , according to Eurostat , the European Union ’s statistics agency .
During the 1870s , the Brighton photographer Harry Pointer ( 1822-1889 ) became well known for a series of carte - de - visite photographs which featured his pet cats .
Pointer began by taking conventional photographs of cats resting , drinking milk or sleeping in a basket , but from around 1870 he specialised in photographing cats in a variety of poses , placing his cats in settings that would create a humorous or appealing picture .
Pointer often arranged his cats in unusual poses that mimicked human activities - a cat riding a tricycle , cats roller - skating and even a cat taking a photograph with a camera .
Harry Pointer soon realised that even a relatively straight - forward cat photograph could be turned into an amusing or appealing image by adding a written caption .
Pointer increased the commercial potential of his cat pictures by adding a written greeting such as " A Happy New Year " or " Very many happy returns of the day " .
Purchasers sent the small cartes - de-visite as tiny greetings cards , thereby publicizing Pointer 's distinctive cat photographs .
By 1872 , Harry Pointer had created over one hundred different captioned images of cats .
Harry Pointer 's series of cat photographs were collectively known as " The Brighton Cats " .
The Photographic News reported that , by 1884 , Pointer had published about two hundred pictures in " The Brighton Cats " series .

The engraved picture of a cat in a roundel was used for a brief period in and around 1870 .
It is likely that the original picture of the cat was drawn by his wife , the artist Rosa Myra Drummond .

Jenson Button beat Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton to the fastest time in opening practice as Formula 1's return to Montreal got underway .
The reigning champion set a best time of 1m18.127s , 0.156 seconds ahead of Mercedes driver Schumacher , and 0.225s clear of his McLaren team - mate Hamilton .
Though weather conditions were dry , bar a few spots of rain , all morning , drivers reported a very dirty and tricky surface on their exploratory laps , so half an hour elapsed before anyone tried setting a time - and it was halfway through the session before the quick men started lapping in earnest .
When they did , the morning quickly became a battle between Schumacher and the McLaren duo , with all three having turns in first place .
McLaren spent much of the rest of the session holding a one - two , but in the end Schumacher was able to get between Button and Hamilton .
The former champion was clearly testing the limits , having a few near - misses under braking and the odd trip over the run-off areas .
Schumacher was not the only one to venture off - road , with Fernando Alonso , Vitaly Petrov , Bruno Senna , Hamilton and Sebastien Buemi among the others to go straight on at chicanes , and Pedro de la Rosa spinning his Sauber at the hairpin .
To complete a promising morning for Mercedes , Nico Rosberg moved the second car up to fourth with his final lap , just ahead of Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel , whose team - mate Mark Webber was a low - key 14th .
2008 Montreal winner Robert Kubica ( Renault ) took seventh for Renault , ahead of Alonso 's Ferrari , and the two Williams .
Lucas di Grassi was the only driver not to set a time , spending most of the session in the Virgin pits and then stopping out at Turn 6 not long after taking to the track .

WASHINGTON 
The weekend ouster of Sen. Bob Bennett , a three - term Utah Republican , represents a triumph for the " Tea Party " movement and a warning for other incumbents facing ideological litmus tests this month .
Bennett , 76 , failed to make the cut Saturday at a Republican Party convention dominated by Tea Party activists and fiscal conservatives concerned about the growth of government .
Instead , the 3,500 delegates sent lawyer Mike Lee , 38 , and businessman Tim Bridgewater , 49 , to a June 22 primary .
The senator has deep roots in his state 's Mormon community and solid ratings from the American Conservative Union and the National Rifle Association , and he had the backing of fellow Mormon Republican Mitt Romney .
Bennett has , however , tried to work across party lines on health care and immigration .
And , along with 33 other GOP senators , Bennett backed the 2008 bailout package that then - president George W. Bush said was necessary to avoid a meltdown of the financial system .
Party conservatives hailed his defeat .
" We think this really is a harbinger of things to come , " Brendan Steinhauser , political director of FreedomWorks , one of the Tea Party - affiliated groups that opposed Bennett , told USA TODAY .
" It should send a shock wave and put people on notice . "
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine called it proof that the Republican Party is now in the command of its far - right wing .
" That the Tea Party would consider Bob Bennett , one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate , too liberal , just goes to show how extreme the Tea Party is , " Kaine said in a statement .
Bennett told the Associated Press he would n't rule out a write - in candidacy .
State law prohibits him from running as an independent .
" I do think I still have a lot of juice left in me , " Bennett said .
" The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic , and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment . "
Both parties face internal strife as activists on the right and the left push to oust establishment - backed candidates for being too centrist .
Three such challenges surface in May 18 primaries :
• Arkansas .
Sen .
Blanche Lincoln has the backing of President Obama and former president Bill Clinton , but labor and liberal groups , such as MoveOn.org , are backing Lt. Gov. Bill Halter 's Democratic Senate primary challenge .
• Kentucky .
Conservatives , including Sens. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , and Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , are defying party chiefs , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , to back Rand Paul , the son of libertarian Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , for the GOP Senate nomination over Secretary of State Trey Grayson .
• Pennsylvania .
Sen .
Arlen Specter avoided one tough primary challenge by switching from the GOP to the Democratic Party last year but now faces another .
Although Obama and Gov. Ed Rendell back Specter , Rep. Joe Sestak , D - Pa. , is gaining in polls with the backing of liberal groups such as Democracy for America .
Last month , Florida Gov. Charlie Crist dropped out of the Republican Senate primary in his state to run as an independent .
Crist was initially backed by a number of top GOP leaders , including Sen .
John Cornyn of Texas , the head of the his party 's Senate campaign committee .
But Crist fell far behind in the polls to former state House speaker Marco Rubio , a favorite of fiscal conservatives .
Cornyn , whose committee backed Bennett as it does all incumbents , issued a statement hailing his Utah colleague 's " professionalism , integrity and friendship " and promising to " wholeheartedly " support the winner of the state 's GOP primary .
The success of the conservative insurgencies will make DeMint , whose political action committee backed Rubio and Paul and endorsed Lee in Utah , more influential , predicts Steinhauser of FreedomWorks .
" He took on McConnell ... and won . "
Others worry that activists on the Republican right and Democratic left will purge the parties of centrists and further gridlock the Senate , where rules make action nearly impossible without bipartisan compromise .
" The parties are going through a process of purification , " former senator Bob Graham , D - Fla . , told USA TODAY recently .
" One thing the Senate does n't need , in my judgment , is more people who are living in the right or left end zones . "
Tactics can only explain a team ’s victories or defeats to a certain extent – this awful French performance was quite clearly a failing in terms of motivation , team spirit and countless other factors that are n’t directly concerned with strategy .
Nevertheless , tonight did demonstrate something important – a well - drilled teams of decent individuals will generally triumph over a disorganised bunch of top - class players .
France were woeful , but Mexico were excellent .
France made one change from their first match , with Florent Malouda replacing Yoann Gourcuff , whilst Mexico also made a single switch from the draw with South Africa – Paul Aguilar dropped to the bench , and in came Hector Moreno .
Neither of these were straight swaps , however .
France shifted to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system , with Jeremy Toulalan and Abou Diaby sitting in front of the defence , the Arsenal man slightly ahead .
Frank Ribery played in a central role , whilst Malouda started from the left .
Mexico ’s system saw Ricardo Osorio shifting out to right - back / right - wing back , and Moreno playing in his central position .
This immediately worked well for Mexico , because they had a defensive - minded player on the right , against the double threat of Malouda and Patrice Evra – and Ribery , when he drifted left .
Mexico nullify
France through sheer numbers
Javier Aguirre deploys his three forwards in a very interesting manner .
They all broadly stay high up the pitch against the opposition defence , but the central striker , Guillermo Franco , is often the one who drops deepest .
Today , he actually did a very good defensive job on Jeremy Toulalan , France ’s deepest midfield player – sometimes moving goalside of him when Mexico were without the ball .
This meant that Mexico often had an extra central midfield player ( creating a 4 v 3 , if you include Ribery ) , had both the wide players covered with wing - backs , whilst having 2 v 1 in defence .
There was n’t enough movement from the French players to really worry Mexico ; France had slightly more possession ( 53 % ) , but never in dangerous areas , and they created few goalscoring opportunities because none of their inventive players had time on the ball .
Each of France ’s six furthest - forward players were generally occupied by a Mexican , with two spare players providing cover – one in defence , one in midfield .
The centre - backs often had time on the ball if Carlos Vela and Giovani dos Santos were wide , but their distribution was poor and lacking in any real purpose .
France high line
Maybe it was the fact that they often had no striker to deal with , as Franco was dropping deep – but those two centre - backs played a suicidally high defensive line .
This was almost exposed twice in bizarre circumstances in the first half – not because Mexico played balls over the top for onrushing forwards , but because backpasses from Abidal and Gallas were underhit and almost let Mexico in for one - on - ones .
The problem in these instances was , of course , the poor touches of the centre - backs in playing the ball back towards Lloris rather than a problem with positioning , but it did emphasise how high the defence was playing up the pitch .
The warning came in the first half when a Rafael Marquez chipped pass put three Mexico players in ( see above ) – all clear of the French defence who could n’t get back in time , but Carlos Vela slashed his shot wide .
It was only when substitutions were made in the second half that Mexico broke through .
The goal , when it arrived , was incredibly simple .
Javier Hernandez picked the ball up inbetween France ’s midfield and defence , with no pressure on him .
He laid the ball back to Rafael Marquez , then sprinted in behind the defence – Marquez ’s chipped pass was both exquisitely timed and beautifully placed , and Hernandez had 40 yards of space to himself , to round Lloris and score .
That effectively decided the game .
Not once did France look like scoring .
Salcido crucial
The most interesting feature of Mexico ’s game was the different nature of their full - backs .
As previously mentioned , Osario was up against France ’s biggest attacking threats and was playing on the same side as the energetic Efrain Juarez , and so generally kept his position .
On the other side , however , Carlos Salcido was barely threatened by the ineffectual Sidney Govou , and had space ahead of him .
Even if he got forward , he did n’t leave Mexico with a shortfall in defence – and therefore took every chance to cause France trouble .
He got into the box for a shot at Lloris when Gallas hesitated in the first half , and soon after swung an excellent ball into the box which Lloris headed against substitute Pablo Barrera .
This is the best thing about Aguirre ’s fluid system – they have two centre - backs that remain in position , but the three players ahead of them can all either play as defenders or midfielders , and therefore their roles can be varied to suit the circumstances .
With France playing only one striker , Marquez played in midfield , but could have moved back to defence to maintain the spare man had France gone 4 - 4 - 2 .
Similar things can be observed of the full - backs .
Usually these three players shift to either form a 3 - 4 - 3 or a 4 - 3 - 3 , but tonight it was a combination of the two in order to get the best out of Salcido , who produced the best full - back / wing - back performance of the tournament so far .
We ’re increasingly seeing lopsided systems in attack , but here Mexico showed that a lopsided defensive shape can work well too .
Conclusion
List France ’s biggest five problems at the moment , and none will involve tactics ; Raymond Domenech has no authority within the French squad , so his instructions are almost irrelevant .
On the pitch , the team has no cohesion , no organisation , does n’t look like scoring and always looks like conceding .
The change in formation did nothing to solve these problems and the substitutes brought little to the side , and yet Domenech was seemingly happy to pass up his chance to make a third change .
Mexico were the complete opposite , and offer a great deal from both an entertainment and tactical point of view .
In some respects they are similar to Marcelo Bielsa ’s Chile side – always three up top , but with the ability to shift between a three - and four - man defence according to the formation of the opponents .
They lack defensive solidarity at times and wo n’t score enough goals to be in with a serious chance of winning the competition , but they are a very interesting , likeable side .
France are n’t definitely out , and Mexico are n’t definitely through – but only one side deserves a place in the knockout stages .

WHOEVER failed to erase the words “ Number One ” in blue Korean script etched inside the propulsion shaft of a deadly torpedo may well be in deep trouble in Pyongyang .
On May 15th a ship dredging the site of the attack on a South Korean warship in March that killed 46 seamen made a spectacular find : propellers , motors and a steering section that international investigators say “ perfectly match ” those of a CHT - 02D torpedo that North Korea sells abroad .
What 's more , the blue marking was similar to one on a previously captured North Korean torpedo .
This was as close to a smoking gun as the South Koreans could have hoped to find .
The discovery , combined with intelligence reports indicating North Korean submarines were out of port during the attack , allowed the investigators to conclude on May 20th that the Cheonan “ was sunk as the result of an external underwater explosion caused by a torpedo made in North Korea . ”
Or as one person close to the investigation succinctly put it : “ It was either the North Koreans , or it was the Martians . ”
The South Korean government of President Lee Myung - bak had barely dared hope to find hard evidence of North Korean guilt , however strong its suspicions .
In doing so , it pushes the belligerent regime in Pyongyang into a corner .
True to form , it continued to deny its involvement on May 20th , calling the investigation a “ fabrication ” and threatened “ all - out war ” if new sanctions were imposed .
Diplomats say it will also make it harder for North Korea 's main ally , China , not to accept the regime 's culpability .
A senior official in Beijing reportedly called the incident “ very unfortunate ” .
He did not comment on the investigation , though an official in Seoul said China 's ambassador was briefed on the results on May 18th .
In coming days China will come under pressure to issue a tougher response , during what could be some uncomfortable diplomatic meetings .
Hillary Clinton , America 's secretary of state , is to visit Beijing on May 24th and 25th .
Following that , the leaders of China , South Korea and Japan are scheduled to hold a summit in South Korea on May 29th and 30th .
The proof of North Korean involvement , say diplomats , may help South Korea and its allies persuade China to back some form of United Nations condemnation of the attack .
South Korea 's allies such as America , Japan , Britain and Australia were quick to express their outrage .
But the toughest condemnation , in the form of a Security - Council resolution , needs China 's support , or at least abstention .
Beyond diplomatic measures , South Korea 's retaliatory options are relatively puny — and dangerous .
South Korean diplomats suggest that the government may announce a halt to remaining business ties with the North , except through the cross - border industrial complex , known as Kaesong .
It may close a shipping shortcut to North Korean vessels , and conduct joint training exercises with American maritime forces in the Yellow Sea .
A retaliatory strike , which some hawkish South Koreans are calling for , is something the pro-business President Lee is considered reluctant to do for fear of escalating the conflict .
His party faces local elections that it is expected to win on June 2nd ( his liberal opponents already accuse him , perhaps unfairly , of using the incident for political ends ) .
After that he hosts an important G20 summit in November .
Among the population at large , there seems little stomach for a fight .
Indeed , despite a national outpouring of grief , the senseless attack aroused surprisingly few public demonstrations of wrath with the North .
Brian Myers , a writer on North Korea , notes that there was more palpable anger in 2002 when an American army vehicle ran over two South Korean schoolgirls .
However , he and other North Korea watchers think tough measures may eventually be called for .
The more the cash - strapped regime in Pyongyang feels economically isolated , the more it is likely to step up its provocations against the South unless it is decisively put in its place , Mr Myers says .
As it is , the North is in desperate economic straits .
Six - party talks that aimed to encourage it to give up nuclear weapons in exchange for cash are stalled indefinitely as a result of the torpedo attack .
International sanctions have hit other sources of hard currency .
China is its economic lifeline , as was shown again when Kim Jong Il , North Korea 's dictator , made a hasty trip to Beijing not long after the Cheonan incident to beg for continued economic support .
At that point , Beijing had an excuse , in public at least , to take his claims of innocence at face value .
It no longer does .
Earlier this week I blogged about IIS Express , and discussed some of the work we are doing to make ASP .
NET development easier from a Web Server perspective .
In today ’s blog post I ’m going to continue the simplicity theme , and discuss some of the work we are also doing to enable developers to quickly get going with database development .
In particular , I ’m pleased to announce that we ’ve just completed the engineering work that enables Microsoft ’s free SQL Server Compact Edition ( SQL CE ) database to work within ASP.
NET applications .
This enables a light - weight , easy to use , database option that now works great for ASP .
NET web development .
Introducing SQL Server Compact Edition 4
SQL CE is a free , embedded , database engine that enables easy database storage .
We will be releasing the first public beta of SQL CE Version 4 very shortly .
Version 4 has been designed and tested to work within ASP.
NET Web applications .
Works with Existing Data APIs
SQL CE works with existing .
NET - based data APIs , and supports a SQL Server compatible query syntax .
This means you can use existing data APIs like ADO.NET , as well as use higher - level ORMs like Entity Framework and NHibernate with SQL CE .
Pretty much any existing data API that supports the ADO.NET provider model will work with it .
This enables you to use the same data programming skills and data APIs you know today .
No Database Installation Required
SQL CE does not require you to run a setup or install a database server in order to use it .
You can now simply copy the SQL CE binaries into the \bin directory of your ASP .
NET application , and then your web application can run and use it as a database engine .
No setup or extra security permissions are required for it to run .
You do not need to have an administrator account on the machine .
It just works .
Applications you build can redistribute SQL CE as part of them .
Just copy your web application onto any server and it will work .
Database Files are Stored on Disk
SQL CE stores databases as files on disk ( within files with a .sdf file extension ) .
You can store SQL CE database files within the \ App_Data folder of your ASP.
NET
Web application - they do not need to be registered in order to use them within your application .
The SQL CE database engine then runs in - memory within your application .
When your application shuts down the database is automatically unloaded .
Shared Web Hosting Scenarios Are Now Supported with SQL CE 4
SQL CE 4 can now run in “ medium trust ” ASP .
NET 4 web hosting scenarios – without a hoster having to install anything .
Hosters do not need to install SQL CE or do anything to their servers to enable it .
This means you can build an ASP.
NET
Web application that contains your code , content , and now also a SQL CE database engine and database files – all contained underneath your application directory .
You can now deploy an application like this simply by using FTP to copy it up to an inexpensive shared web hosting account – no extra database deployment step or hoster installation required .
SQL CE will then run within your application at the remote host .
Because it runs in - memory and saves its files to disk you do not need to pay extra for a SQL Server database .
Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Web Developer 2010 Express Support
VS 2010 and Visual Web Developer 2010 Express will add SQL CE 4 tooling support for ASP.
NET scenarios in an update we ’ll be rolling out in the future .
This will enable you to add SQL CE database files to your ASP .
NET projects , use the Visual Studio Server Explorer to create and edit tables in them , and use higher - level designers like Entity Framework ( see below ) to model and map the database to classes that you can then query and program against using LINQ .
This means that in addition to using the same data APIs you know today , you will also be able to easily use the same development tools you already know with SQL CE .
Supports Both Development and Production
SQL CE can be used for both development scenarios and light - usage production usage scenarios .
With the SQL CE 4 release we ’ve done the engineering work to ensure that SQL CE wo n’t crash or deadlock when used in a multi- threaded server scenario ( like ASP.NET ) .
This is a big change from previous releases of SQL CE – which were designed for client - only scenarios and which explicitly blocked running in web - server environments .
Starting with SQL CE 4 you can use it in a web - server as well .
There are no license restrictions with SQL CE .
Easy Migration to SQL Server
SQL CE is an embedded database – which makes it ideal for development and light - usage scenarios .
For high - volume sites and applications you ’ll probably want to migrate it to use SQL Server Express ( which is free ) , SQL Server or SQL Azure .
These servers enable much better scalability , more development features ( including features like Stored Procedures – which are n’t supported with SQL CE ) , as well as more advanced data management capabilities .
We ’ll ship migration tools that enable you to optionally take SQL CE databases and easily upgrade them to use SQL Server Express , SQL Server , or SQL Azure .
You will not need to change your code when upgrading a SQL CE database to SQL Server or SQL Azure .
Our goal is to enable you to be able to simply change the database connection string in your web .config file and have your application just work .
Summary
SQL CE 4 provides an easy , lightweight database option that you ’ll now be able to use with ASP .
NET applications .
It will enable you to get started on projects quickly – without having to install a full database on your local development box .
Because it is a compatible subset of the full SQL Server , you write code against it using the same data APIs ( ADO.
NET , Entity Framework , NHibernate , etc ) .
You will be able to easily deploy SQL CE based databases to a remote hosting account and use it to run light - usage sites and applications .
As your site traffic grows you can then optionally upgrade the database to use SQL Server Express ( which is free ) , SQL Server or SQL Azure – without having to change your code .
We ’ll be shipping the first public beta of SQL CE 4 ( along with IIS Express and several more cool things I ’ll be blogging about shortly ) next week .
Hope this helps ,

There 's a reason economics is called the dismal science , and weeks like this just give it further meaning .
In economics , there is what you see and what you do n't .
This week we are going to examine the headline data we all see and then take a look for what most observers do not see .
Then we 'll try to think about what it all really means .
With employment , housing , and the ISM numbers , there is a lot to cover .
And this letter will print out longer than usual , as there are a lot of charts .
Warning : remove sharp objects from the vicinity and pour yourself your favorite adult beverage .
This does not make for fun reading .
But first , a very quick three - paragraph commercial .
In the current market environment , there are money managers who have not done well and then there are managers who have done very well .
My partners around the world would be happy to show you some of the managers they have on their platforms that we think are appropriate for the current environment .
If you are an accredited investor ( basically a net worth over $ 1.5 million ) and would like to look at hedge - fund and other alternative - fund managers ( such as commodity traders ) , I suggest you go to www.accreditedinvestor.ws and sign up ; and someone from Altegris Investments in La Jolla will call you if you are a US citizen .
Or you 'll get a call from Absolute Return Partners in London if you are in Europe ( they also work with non-accredited investors ) .
If you are in South Africa , then someone from Plexus Asset Management will ring .
And in Canada it is Nicola Wealth Management .
And Fynn Capital Management in South America .
( In this regard , I am president and a registered representative of Millennium Wave Securities , LLC , member FINRA . )
If you are not an accredited investor , I work with CMG in Philadelphia .
We have created a platform of money managers who specialize in the alternative management space .
By this I mean they do not need a bull or bear market in order to have the potential for profits .
( Past performance is not indicative of future results . )
You can go to http://www.cmgfunds.net/public/mauldin_questionnaire.asp and quickly read about the past performance of a manager we recently added to the platform , and then sign up to get more information .
If you are an investment advisor or broker , all of my partners can work with you in providing your clients exposure to alternative - style investments and managers .
Obviously , if your clients are high - net - worth individuals , then you will want to work with Altegris , ARP , or one of my other international partners ; and if your clients need lower minimums , then you should work with CMG .
And if you have any feedback or comments , feel free to write me .
Now , on to the letter .
Some Really Dismal Numbers
The unemployment numbers this morning were just bad , even though the spin doctors were out in force .
Of course we knew that because of census workers being laid off the number would be negative , and it was , down 125,000 .
But the " bright spot " we were told about was that private payrolls came in at 83,000 new jobs .
Let 's look at what you did not see or hear .
First , last month 's dismal ( there 's that word again ) private job - creation number was revised down from 41,000 to 33,000 .
So in two months , total private job creation is 116,000 jobs .
We need 125,000 jobs per month just to keep up with population growth .
But it is worse than that .
The headline number we look at is from the Establishment Survey .
That means they call up existing businesses they know about and ask them how many people are working for them , etc .
One of the first things I do when the employment numbers come out is look at the birth / death assessment on the BLS ( Bureau of Labor Statistics ) web site .
For new readers , the birth / death assessment has nothing to do with people dying , but rather is the BLS 's attempt to estimate the number of new businesses that have been created or have " died " within the last month , and they use these numbers to adjust the employment total .
They use historical , seasonal numbers to create a model from which they make these estimates .
There is nothing conspiratorial about the numbers - they have to make an attempt at such an estimate , otherwise the employment number would be badly off .
But the birth / death number can skew the totals a lot more than is typically realized .
Take the last two months .
Using the birth / death model , the BLS assumes that 362,000 jobs were created somewhere .
That is three times the number of jobs in the headlines we read .
Those extra jobs were added into the total because that is what the model told them to do .
And over a complete business and employment cycle , those numbers will average out to be pretty close to right .
But as I said , they can also be misleading in the short term .
Let 's look closer at some of the details .
The B/D adjustments say that we added 65,000 construction jobs in the last two months , over half the total number of jobs created .
Really ?
US single - family homes set an all - time low sales number this week .
Mortgage applications are way down .
Home construction is off .
Commercial real estate construction is down .
Where are those construction jobs ?
158,000 new jobs have supposedly been created in the hospitality and leisure industry in the last two months .
And that is consistent with what normally happens in summer time .
Typically , these are lower - paying jobs .
( I worked a few myself while in college . )
In the actual numbers , as surveyed , they estimated only 33,000 new jobs in L&H , so the B/D adjustment accounted for nearly all the positive number .
But what happens is that most of those L&H jobs go away in the fall , so then the B/D adjustment goes negative .
Further , I am not sure we can assume a typical cycle here , to base the B/D number on .
( One more thing to complicate all this .
The headline number we see is seasonally adjusted , but the B/D assessment is n't .
And we just wo n't go there .
That 's way too much " inside baseball " sort of trivia . )
But look at this chart from my favorite data maven , Greg Weldon ( www.weldononline.com).
It shows that the number of people planning vacations is way down , dropping by over 35 % in the last three years , for the second lowest number ever .
Ever .
That is not consistent with a typical hospitality and leisure job - growth pattern .
I have three kids working in that field , and the talk is not of robust job creation or lots of overtime .
( By the way , my Tulsa readers should go to Los Cabos for some good Mexican food and leave my daughters Abigail and Amanda some really big tips !
And make sure they get your name and address . )
Unemployment Went Down ?
We were told that the unemployment number dropped from 9.7 % to 9.5 % .
That 's a good thing , right ?
Well , no , not really .
The number dropped because the number of people counted as being in the labor force dropped .
If you have n't looked for work for four weeks , you are not counted as unemployed .
If you add those who were taken off the rolls back in , the unemployment number would have risen to 9.9 % .
In the past two months nearly one million people have dropped out of the labor market .
If you counted all the people who would take a job if they could find one as unemployed , the unemployment number would be closer to 11 % .
As an aside , if I have any real beef with the BLS over how they create their data , it is this last point .
If you would take a job if you could get one , you should be counted as unemployed .
Period .
The Household Survey was rather dismal .
( This is where they call households and ask about their employment situation . )
The survey showed a loss of 301,000 jobs , or 363,000 jobs if you adjust it to match the Establishment Survey .
Not pretty .
Maybe a better way to look at unemployment is to look at the percentage of the total population that has a job .
That number has been rising off and on for almost 50 years as more and more women have moved into the labor force .
But notice the large drop over the last year - almost 5 % of working people in the US have lost their jobs .
The initial unemployment claims 4 - week moving average stubbornly refuses to go down any further .
It has essentially gone sideways for over 6 months .
If you go back and look at the data from the last 45 years , the current level is typical of recessions .
Earnings Take a Hit
No , not business earnings , which seem to be holding up , but personal earnings .
Average hourly earnings dropped 0.1 % in June , something that David Rosenberg notes is a 1 - in - 50 event .
The trend is downward , with annual growth of less than 1.7 % .
Average hours worked were also slightly down .
My friend and Maine fishing buddy Bill Dunkelberg , chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Businesses , has produced his monthly survey , and there was not much to cheer about from a future employment perspective .
Over the next 3 months , 8 percent of the businesses surveyed plan to reduce employment ( up 1 point ) , and 10 percent plan to create new jobs ( down 4 points ) , yielding a seasonally adjusted net 1 percent of owners planning to create new jobs , unchanged from May and only the second positive reading in 20 months - but barely so .
From Dunk 's email : " Since January , 2008 , the seasonally adjusted average change in employment per firm has been negative in every month , with a seasonally adjusted loss of 0.3 workers per firm reported in June for the prior three month period .
Most firms did not change employment , 5 % ( down 3 points from May ) increased average employment by 3.4 employees , but 15 % ( down 5 points ) reduced their workforces by an average of 3.3 .
" Job creation " still has n't crossed the 0 line in the small business sector .
Government ( including health care and education ) and manufacturing ( a large firm activity ) has been providing what few jobs are created , weak given the magnitude of employment loss during the recession .
And now the elimination of temporary Census jobs will make the picture look more bleak , although more accurate .
A few more private sector jobs is not enough , we need 225,000 every month for 3 years to re-employ 8 million workers who lost their jobs and another 125,000 a month to keep up with population growth . "
A few more data points from this week , and then let 's look at some of the implications .
The numbers from the Conference Board survey were weak .
The total of people planning to buy a major appliance is at an almost 16 - year low .
Car sales were low last month , and the survey says they may go lower , as plans to buy a car are down from 6 % to 3.7 % .
In fact , in almost all categories plans to buy were down .
Which makes sense , as 17 % of people say their incomes are decreasing .
New home inventory is back up to 8.5 months of supply .
As noted above , single - family sales hit an all - time low , as anyone who wanted to buy a home did so in order to get the government incentive .
Just as with Cash for Clunkers , all we did was bring buying forward ; we did not create actual new buyers , at least not in any significant numbers .
Money Supply Concerns
After the explosion in the money supply by the Fed in the depths of the Great Recession , growth in the money supply has gone flat .
We recently looked at the fact that M - 3 ( the broadest measure of money supply ) has turned negative for the first time in many decades .
Look at the adjusted monetary base , below .
And now let 's look at MZM , or Money of Zero Maturity .
MZM is a measure of the liquid money supply within an economy .
MZM represents all money in M2 , less the time deposits , plus all money market funds .
MZM has become one of the preferred measures of money supply because it better represents money readily available for spending and consumption .
This measurement derives its name from its mixture of all the liquid and zero-maturity money found within the " three M's " ( Investopedia ) .
Notice that it too has gone flat , for over a year now .
These charts suggest that deflation is in the wind .
A Central Banker 's Nightmare
Let 's recap .
Unemployment is high and is in reality going higher if you count those who would take a job if they could get one .
Incomes are weak .
Plans to purchase discretionary items are falling .
Housing is likely in for a further drop in prices .
The stock market is not exactly booming .
Treasury yields are falling , not from a credit crisis or a flight to quality , but because of economic conditions ( deflation ) .
Money supply is flat or falling .
Prices are under pressure .
The list goes on , and all factors are indicative of deflation .
As noted last week , the data suggests we could see weak growth in the last half of the year .
Over two - thirds of the past quarter 's 2.7 % growth was from inventory rebuilding , which surveys seem to show is abating as inventories begin to stabilize .
I was on Larry Kudlow 's show ( links below ) last Tuesday , and he gave me some time to air my views .
My main concern , as readers know , is that we may have a weak economy in the latter half of the year and then introduce a large tax increase , which my reading of the economic studies on tax increases suggests will throw us into recession .
Recessions are by definition deflationary .
( Not to mention what another one would do to unemployment and the stock market ! )
With inflation at less than 1 % , could we see the central banker 's nightmare of outright deflation ?
We very well could .
I think that is what the bond market is saying .
How would the Fed react ?
For an answer , we need to go back to Ben Bernanke 's famous helicopter speech of November 2002 , entitled " Deflation : Making Sure ' It ' Does n't Happen Here . "
( By the way , I have always been convinced that his remark about printing presses and helicopters was an attempt at economist humor , which is why we do n't get many offers from comedy clubs . )
I did a fuller assessment of that speech in my weekly letter at http://www.2000wave.com/article.asp?id=mwo112802.
But I want to pull out a few quotes from the speech .
You can read the speech itself at : http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm
Let 's sum up the helicopter section :
You can create inflation by printing a lot of money .
But that is not the interesting part of the speech .
Quoting from my letter :
" Let 's look at what Bernanke really said .
First , he begins by telling us that he believes the likelihood of deflation is remote .
But , since it did happen in Japan , and seems to be the cause of the current Japanese problems , we cannot dismiss the possibility outright .
Therefore , we need to see what policies can be brought to bear upon the problem .
" He then goes on to say that the most important thing is to prevent deflation before it happens .
He says that a central bank should allow for some ' cushion ' and should not target zero inflation , and speculates that this is over 1 % .
Typically , central banks target inflation of 1 - 3 % , although this means that in normal times inflation is more likely to rise above the acceptable target than fall below zero in poor times .
" Central banks can usually influence this by raising and lowering interest rates .
But what if the Fed Funds rate falls to zero ?
Not to worry , there are still policy levers that can be pulled .
Quoting Bernanke :
" ' So what then might the Fed do if its target interest rate , the overnight federal funds rate , fell to zero ?
One relatively straightforward extension of current procedures would be to try to stimulate spending by lowering rates further out along the Treasury term structure - that is , rates on government bonds of longer maturities ....
" 'A more direct method , which I personally prefer , would be for the Fed to begin announcing explicit ceilings for yields on longer - maturity Treasury debt ( say , bonds maturing within the next two years ) .
The Fed could enforce these interest - rate ceilings by committing to make unlimited purchases of securities up to two years from maturity at prices consistent with the targeted yields .
If this program were successful , not only would yields on medium - term Treasury securities fall , but ( because of links operating through expectations of future interest rates ) yields on longer - term public and private debt ( such as mortgages ) would likely fall as well .
" ' Lower rates over the maturity spectrum of public and private securities should strengthen aggregate demand in the usual ways and thus help to end deflation .
Of course , if operating in relatively short - dated Treasury debt proved insufficient , the Fed could also attempt to cap yields of Treasury securities at still longer maturities , say three to six years . '
" He then proceeds to outline what could be done if the economy falls into outright deflation and uses the examples , and others , cited above .
It seems clear to me from the context that he is making an academic list of potential policies the Fed could pursue if outright deflation became a reality .
He was not suggesting they be used , nor do I believe he thinks we will ever get to the place where they would be contemplated .
He was simply pointing out the Fed can fight deflation if it wants to . "
( And now , in 2010 , that question might become more than academic . )
With the above as background , we can begin to look at what I believe is the true import of the speech .
Read these sentences , noting my bold - faced words :
" ... a central bank , either alone or in cooperation with other parts of the government , retains considerable power to expand aggregate demand and economic activity even when its accustomed policy rate is at zero .
" The basic prescription for preventing deflation is therefore straightforward , at least in principle : Use monetary and fiscal policy as needed to support aggregate spending .... "
( As Keynesian as you can get . )
Again : " ... some observers have concluded that when the central bank 's policy rate falls to zero - its practical minimum - monetary policy loses its ability to further stimulate aggregate demand and the economy .
" To stimulate aggregate spending when short - term interest rates have reached zero , the Fed must expand the scale of its asset purchases or , possibly , expand the menu of assets that it buys . "
Now let us go to his conclusion :
" Sustained deflation can be highly destructive to a modern economy and should be strongly resisted .
Fortunately , for the foreseeable future , the chances of a serious deflation in the United States appear remote indeed , in large part because of our economy 's underlying strengths but also because of the determination of the Federal Reserve and other U.S. policymakers to act preemptively against deflationary pressures .
Moreover , as I have discussed today , a variety of policy responses are available should deflation appear to be taking hold .
Because some of these alternative policy tools are relatively less familiar , they may raise practical problems of implementation and of calibration of their likely economic effects .
For this reason , as I have emphasized , prevention of deflation is preferable to cure .
Nevertheless , I hope to have persuaded you that the Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers would be far from helpless in the face of deflation , even should the federal funds rate hit its zero bound . "
And there you have it .
All the data pointing to a slowing economy ?
It puts us closer to deflation .
It is not the headline data per se we need to think about .
We need to start thinking about what the Fed will do if we have a double - dip recession and start to fall into deflation .
Will they move out the yield curve , as he suggested ?
Buy more and varied assets like mortgages and corporate debt ?
What will that do to markets and investments ?
Note that last bolded line : " For this reason , as I have emphasized , prevention of deflation is preferable to cure . "
If he is true to his words , that means he may act in advance of the next recession if the data continues to come in weak and deflation starts to actually become a threat .
That is the thing we do n't see in all the economic data - the potential for new Fed action .
Let 's hope that , like the deflation scare in 2002 , it does n't come about .
Stay tuned .
" Why do n't you reform yourselves ?
That task would be sufficient enough . "
- Frédéric Bastiat
It is time to hit the send button .
The letter is overly long already .
I 'll finish with this thought .
This financial reform bill should be thrown out and they should start over .
So much has been tagged onto this bill that has nothing to do with reform but is all about political agendas .
It is also far too vague .
Essentially , they create all these new committees or empower the bureaucracies that missed it last time to come up with the actual details of regulation .
For all intents and purposes , a small number of unelected individuals will be given almost total control to write new rules overseeing a huge part of our economy .
No matter how well - intentioned , this is not something that should be done in closed rooms .
We need major reform , of course .
And when are we going to get to Freddie and Fannie , which are totally ignored but will cost the taxpayer the most ?
Local Congressman Jeb Hensarling has it right .
He estimates there are about 3 unintended consequences on every page of that 1,200 - page bill .

Earlier on Twitter , I teased some images from a new poster and it ’s time to see the fruits of those labors !
I would like to introduce you to a new series of posters … LOST in Horror .
First up in the series is The Freighter .
The Freighter is a whopping 24 x 36 inches !
Limited to 42 signed and numbered posters .
Printed on heavy somerset velvet cotton paper .
Ships rolled in heavy kraft poster tube .
$ 60 shipped anywhere in the world .
Begins shipping next week !
$ 60 shipped anywhere [ Sold out ! ]
The Freighter is heavily inspired by a particularly bad ungood piece of celluloid from 1980 called Death Ship .
I ’ve always had a special place in my heart for horror on the high seas cheese like Leviathan and DeepStar Six .
My absolute favorite might be Triangle .
Every LOST fan should see Triangle .
It ’s got mystery , suspense , and not to mention time travel ( ! ) .
A word on size .
These are BIG .
2 feet wide and 3 feet tall !
Much bigger than my previous prints .
We ’ve worked very hard to bring you larger posters without charging an arm and a leg .
You can expect the same quality paper and print as my previous editions .
It will also be much easier to find off - the - shelf frames since it is a standard size .
If all goes well with this release , you can expect follow - ups , like there ’s this other crazy scary movie called The Hatch and I ’m dying to do a poster for it !
As a bonus treat , I engaged the talents of my friend , Mr. Ben Murphy , to cut together a nice creepy trailer for our faux cult classic …
The Freighter Movie Trailer on YouTube
He did such a wonderful job !
Oh , one more thing .
How ’bout some remastered “ Hurley - sized ” special editions coming maybe later sometime to a galaxy near you possibly …
The IGLHRC is already pressuring a number of UN member states to change their laws to advance sexual rights .
When the application was put on hold , the U.S. reacted very aggressively and announced that it was planning to take an unprecedented move to bypass the UN Committee on NGOs and go directly to the full ECOSOC body to try to ram the approval through .
This has never been done before , and it has caused quite a stir among the UN delegations of many of the developing nations around the world .
So we have a situation where the Obama administration is again putting support for the radical homosexual agenda above virtually all other considerations .
In light of what this administration is doing domestically , we should not be surprised , but in this case , the United States government ’s almost obsessive quest to advance sexual rights has been exposed to the whole world , and this should concern every American .
Hey , remember Congressman Ralph Hall ( R - TX ) who inserted a totally non sequitur amendment into a science research and education funding bill in a blatant partisan ploy to derail the bill and make Democrats look bad ?
And remember how the Democrats tried to compromise , removing almost $ 40 billion of the funding from the bill , but Republicans still stonewalled ?
After the Democrats managed to pass the bill despite this , guess what the honorable Ralph Hall had to say .
Go on .
Guess .
Did you guess this ?
" I am disappointed that my Democratic colleagues resorted to using a procedural tactic to defeat Republican changes that would have saved over $ 40 billion and restored the original COMPETES priority of basic research , " science committee ranking member Ralph Hall said in a press release after the vote .
Oh , Representative Hall .
It was n't enough for you to accuse the Democrats of blatant and transparent partisan parliamentary tactics when they were responding to your very own blatant and transparent partisan parliamentary tactics , was it ?
So you went ahead and blamed them for not saving the $ 40 billion that they offered to cut to make you happy in the first place .
Instead of taking that compromise , you slammed the door in their face .
Oh , that wacky , wacky Representative Hall .
Hyperpartisan hypocritical hackery does n't look good on anyone , sir .
I sometimes think the Emperor would be better off just coming out and saying he 's naked , rather than trying to sell us on his new clothes .
MEXICO CITY —
After battling through health care and finance reform , U.S. President Barack Obama waded into one of the most contentious issues of all – immigration – advocating a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal migrants .
But while his proposal , made during a speech Thursday , promised sweeping change , it was greeted by little applause either in Mexico – the country that sends the highest number of undocumented workers to the United States – or in migrant communities north of the border .
After a 2006 bill on amnesty ended with the building of a border fence , few were optimistic that Obama ’s proposal would conclude any differently .
“ This was n’t a policy speech .
It was an election speech , ” said Jorge Mujica , a Mexican - born migrant activist based in Chicago .
“ He wants to get the Latino vote in the midterm elections but he is not showing any real will for reform . ”
In his speech , Obama stressed that a recent enforcement law in Arizona had fanned the flames of the debate and that Americans could not let a divisive political climate stand in the way of resolving important issues .
“ This administration will not just kick the can down the road .
Immigration reform is no exception , ” he told the audience at the American University on Thursday .
“ In sum , the system is broken and everybody knows it .
Unfortunately , reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special interest wrangling . ”
But many activists felt that Obama betrayed his lack of will for change by saying it was “ the political and mathematical reality ” that the Republicans had to be on board for any bill to pass .
Activists said that hammering out major bipartisan support for an immigration reform bill , especially before the November vote , seemed like an impossible task .
“ They passed health reform without major Republican consensus so why is immigration different ? ” asked Mujica .
“ Latinos voted for Obama because he promised change . ”
In migrant communities across Mexico , people shared the same doubts .
Rafael Ramirez , a Mexico City mechanic who has been going back and forth to work in California for 20 years , said he saw little reason to be hopeful .
“ You think that change is coming and then you just get let down again and again , ” said Ramirez , whose two sons are currently working in San Francisco without papers .
“ Now , it is hard to imagine a time when we are not risking our lives crossing the desert to earn some dollars . ”
About half of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States were born in Mexico .
Last year , Mexicans in the United States sent home $ 21.2 billion in remittances , providing the nation with its second biggest source of foreign currency after oil exports .
Despite such economic clout , the struggle for these migrants to obtain legal recognition has been met with a series of disappointments over the last decade .
On Sept. 6 , 2001 , Vicente Fox became the first Mexican president to address a joint session of Congress , giving a speech imploring an overhaul in the immigration system .
Five days later , the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington shoved any immigration reform onto the backburner as the United States marched into war in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In January 2004 , former U.S. President George W. Bush proposed a new guest worker program for millions of migrants , only to leave that proposal on hold as he prepared for his reelection campaign .
Then , in 2006 , a series of historic demonstrations sparked heated debate in the U.S. Congress over amnesty and guest worker programs .
But lawmakers ultimately discarded those proposals , choosing instead to approve the extension of the border fence and the placement of more border guards .
Unlike his predecessor , Mexican President Felipe Calderon has invested little time and energy fighting for migrant rights .
In the day following Obama ’s speech , Calderon was notably silent on the issue while making various statements about the war on drugs and other unrelated matters .
Some pundits argue that the Mexican president has been smart to recognize that his statements could only have a negative impact , being used by reform opponents as evidence of foreign meddling .
Others here see Calderon as being wise not to put political capital into an issue it is very hard to win ground on .
The activist Mujica is more cynical , arguing that the Calderon administration cares little about the conditions of Mexicans in the United States as long as they are sending money home .
“ Calderon is too busy trying to collect money for his war on drugs , ” Mujica said .
“ If there was a new guest worker program on the table , he would be happy because that would help him reduce poverty .
But he does n’t give a damn about people who are already here . ”
Women who work out together are far more likely to lose weight
Desperately trying to shed the pounds ?
You are far more likely to success if you diet and exercise with a friend .
The average female will shed more than 10 pounds when she has girlfriends who are willing to eat healthily and train with her .
But a fifth of those who choose to go it alone do n't drop a single pound .
Seven out of ten women said exercise was less of a chore when they did it with friends
The study of 3,000 women also revealed 61 per cent find it almost impossible to summon up the energy to exercise alone .
However the same proportion enjoy going for a jog or taking a swim with a friend - and admit they push themselves harder if they have company .
Exercising together has the added benefit of bringing you closer to a friend - more than half of those surveyed thought working out with a mate had improved their relationship .
Sian Lewis , director of female car insurance company Diamond which commissioned the survey , said : ' It can be really hard to find the time , energy and enthusiasm for exercising when there 's no -one to do it with .
' At the end of a long busy day at work , it would be so easy to slip into the arm chair for a few hours to relax , rather than go out for a jog or swim .
' But having a friend who is interested in keeping fit and toned can really help keep motivation - suddenly exercise is n't just about getting sweaty , and losing weight , it 's about catching up on the latest gossip , and having a bit of quality time together . '
Seven out of ten girls said exercise was less of a chore when they did it with friends , but over half admitted talking non -stop during the work - out .
But the poll shows dieting and exercising with a friend is n't all about improving relationships - for some it 's a fashion contest .
A third of girls always buy themselves a new exercise outfit to train with a friend for the first time .
The same proportion always wear make up when exercising .
Sian Lewis added : ' Women would n't be women if they did n't pay some attention to their appearance before exercising with a friend .
' Girls like to look their best at all times , whether it's in the gym , in the pub or at work , and there 's no reason why we can't combine a bit of fitness with a bit of glamour - who knows who you might bump into . '
Police have confirmed they are treating the explosion incident at Manchester Arena on Monday night following a concert by American pop singer Ariana Grande as a terrorist attack .
It is the deadliest such incident on British soil since 2005 .
It is believed many of the victims were teenagers .
This is what we know so far :
Police say 22 people were killed and at least 59 others were wounded
Police are calling it a “ terrorist incident ”
The blast occurred at 10:35 pm BST
Witnesses reported two loud bangs , although the matter is still under investigation
Investigators said the explosion or explosions took place “ within the foyer area of the stadium ” and the venue said it was “ outside the venue in a public space ” .
Britain is on its second - highest alert level of “ severe ” meaning an attack is considered highly likely .
Nobody has claimed credit for the attack
Police say they believe the attack was carried out by a lone suicide bomber who died on the scene .
Speaking to the BBC , an eyewitness gave this account of what happened :
The apparent bombing in Manchester at the Ariana Grande concert is the second terror attack to hit England in two months .
In March , five people were killed and more than 50 injured when a man drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in central London .
His vehicle then crashed into the gates of parliament .
The attacker was shot dead by police .
Nobody has been charged in connection with that incident .
London Mayor Sadiq
Khan says security measures are being stepped up in the capital following events overnight in Manchester .
“ I am in constant contact with the Metropolitan police , who are reviewing security arrangements in London .
Londoners will see more police on our streets , ” he said .
Is n't it funny that when Apple removes apps from the App Store , a major ruckus rears its head — but when Google removes apps from people 's phones , just a few quiet grumblings are heard .

This could be because when Apple removes apps , it 's apps they do n't agree with — apps with a spot of controversy or nudity , even if it is in a graphic novel for the classic tome Ulysses .
While Apple agreed to allow the publisher to make changes to the small nudity contained in the app , many have n't been so lucky .

Now , Google 's Android Security Lead , Rich Cannings , has taken to the Android Developers blog to explain why they had to remove several apps from your phones .

Third body found in Guatemala sinkhole ( WOW ! pictures )

Third body found in Guatemala sinkhole
February 25 , 2007
GUATEMALA CITY -- Emergency crews Saturday found a third body in a 330 - foot - deep sinkhole that had swallowed a dozen homes and forced the evacuation of nearly 1,000 people in a crowded Guatemala City neighborhood .
The body of Domingo Soyos , 53 , was carried out of the enormous fissure and identified by family members , medical crews said .
Soyos was the father of teenagers Irma and David Soyos , whose bodies were found floating in a river of sewage soon after the sinkhole opened Friday .
Residents said there were other people unaccounted for , but emergency crews could not confirm that .
Officials blamed recent rains and an underground sewage flow from a ruptured main for the tragedy .
The pit emitted foul odors , loud noises and tremors , shaking the surrounding ground .
A rush of water could be heard from its depths , and authorities feared it could widen or other sinkholes could open .
Police evacuated nearby homes and cordoned off a 500 - yard perimeter around the crater .
Security officials were on guard for possible looters and curious onlookers .

Birthday : Aug 06 , 1970
Birthplace : Pondicherry , India
M. Night Shymalan was an American director best known for directing several crowd - pleasing films that are known for their supernatural plots and unforeseen twist - endings .
Shymalan , whose birth name was Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan , was born in the Indian town of Mahe .
He moved to the United States with his parents when he was six years old , and settled in the well - to - do suburb of Penn Valley , Pennsylvania .
Both of Shymalan 's parents were doctors , and when he was a young boy , Shymalan 's father just assumed that one day his son would follow in his footsteps by pursuing a degree in medicine .
The young M. Night Shymalan , however , had different plans .
At 8 years old he was given a Super 8 camera and almost immediately began making his own movies .
Inspired by his childhood hero Steven Spielberg , Shymalan made dozens of films in his teens ( by his count , 45 by the time he was 17 ) , and quickly became determined to make moviemaking his career .
Although Shymalan 's father wanted him to become a doctor , it was his mother who encouraged him to pursue his passion .
Thus , when it came time to attend college , Shymalan enrolled in film school at New York University 's Tisch School of the Arts .
He made his first feature , the drama " Praying with Anger " ( 1992 ) , while attending NYU .
In order to fund the film , Shymalan borrowed money from his family and close friends .
" Praying with Anger " was screened at various film festivals , but never received a distribution deal , so it was never widely seen .
After graduating from NYU in 1992 , Shymalan spent the next few years writing the script for his follow - up feature , a comedy called " Wide Awake " ( 1998 ) .
For the cast , Shymalan got relatively big names to appear in his film , including Rosie O'Donnell , Camryn Manheim and Julia Stiles .
" Wide Awake " was shot in 1995 but was not released until 1998 .
The film received lightly positive reviews , but failed to make any kind of significant dent at the box office .
It was Shymalan 's third film , however , released the following year , that would truly make him a household name .
That film , 1999's " The Sixth Sense " starred Bruce Willis and newcomer Haley Joel Osment , and was the first of Shymalan 's films to include the twist ending technique he would later become famous for .
In addition to being a massive hit at the box office , " The Sixth Sense " would go on to be nominated for 6 Academy Awards , earning Best Director and Best Original Screenplay nods for Shymalan .
After the huge success of " The Sixth Sense , " Shymalan 's career really took off .
In the 2000s he made one crowd - pleasing hit movie after another , including " Unbreakable " ( 2000 ) , " Signs " ( 2002 ) , " The Village " ( 2004 ) , and " The Happening " ( 2008 ) , thus establishing M. Night Shymalan as one of the most commercially successful and widely popular directors of his generation .
The early part of the 2010s , however , were not as kind to Shymalan .
In 2010 he directed " The Last Airbender , " which was panned by critics .
But it was his next film , 2013 's " After Earth , " that would truly prove to be the low point in Shymalan 's career .
The film , which starred Will Smith and his son Jaden , was universally derided by critics , leaving Shymalan in something of a career funk .
Determined not to allow let the critical backlash of his last two films to get to him , Shymalan put his head down and got back to doing what he loved : making movies .
Two years later , in 2015 , he directed the found footage horror film " The Visit " ( 2015 ) .
The low budget film , which was made for $ 5 million , took in nearly $ 100 million at the box office , thus signaling M. Night Shymalan was back !
His next two films , " Split " ( 2016 ) and " Glass " ( 2019 ) , were also huge financial successes , proving once and for all that whatever career funk M. Night Shymalan found himself in in the early part of the decade , it was only short - lived .
" Glass " was the third and final film in Shymalan 's " Unbreakable " trilogy ( the first two being " Unbreakable " and " Split " ) , and would go on to make over $ 240 million at the box office .
The film also receive mostly favorable reviews from critics .
2019 was also the year that Shymalan debuted his psychological horror TV series " Servant " ( Apple + , 2019 - ) .
The series , which Shymalan executive produced , premiered on Apple 's brand new streaming service Apple + in November of 2019 .
Why is Mayor Gavin Newsom proposing cuts to mental health treatment for those with the most serious mental illness ?
One block from where the mayor announced that cuts to mental health programs would be small , at the offices of the Citywide Case Management and Community Focus , we learned that we would lose 38 percent of our total budget .
We provide comprehensive services for the highest users of San Francisco 's psychiatric emergency services and mentally ill offenders under the jurisdiction of the Behavioral Health Court .
The mayor proposes to cut $ 1.3 million in city funds from us , but because we bring $ 1.21 in federal funds for every $ 1 of city funds , the actual blow to the budget is $ 2.9 million .

JERUSALEM ( AP )  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's hawkish coalition partners vowed Thursday to keep building Jewish homes and demolishing unauthorized Palestinian homes in contested east Jerusalem despite indications the Israeli leader has put the brakes on both .
The United States opposes both at this delicate time , when indirect talks between Israelis and Palestinians have just begun .
The remarks by Netanyahu 's partners show the thin tightrope he has to walk in trying to address the conflicting demands of his political allies at home and Israel 's strongest ally abroad .
On Thursday , Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party reasserted his claim that Israel would never freeze construction in east Jerusalem the sector of the holy city that Palestinians claim for a future capital .
" We will build in every part of Jerusalem , the capital of the Jewish people 's homeland for eternity , and I made this clear to our American friends and colleagues as well , " Yishai , whose ministry is authorized to approve Jerusalem construction , told Shas ' Yom Leyom weekly .
He was also quoted as saying he plans to convene the Jerusalem planning committee soon to move ahead with new construction projects .
A day earlier , Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said demolitions of unauthorized Palestinian homes had been postponed in the past so as not to hurt efforts to renew peace talks .
But demolitions , he said , would resume within days .
" If there was a postponement , it 's no longer in effect , " he told parliament .
The demolitions have become a hot - button issue because the Palestinians claim that Israel gives them no choice but to build in east Jerusalem without authorization because it gives them very few permits .
Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev and the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem had no comment on the ministers ' remarks .
But in a statement , Defense Minister Ehud Barak called on his fellow government ministers not to make inflammatory statements about Jerusalem .
" These statements hurt Israel 's interests with the U.S. and the world in general , " said Barak , whose centrist Labor Party is the most moderate member of the governing coalition .
" These statements could make Israel look like it is obstructing peace , and undermine its international standing . "
Sovereignty over Jerusalem is the most emotionally charged issue dividing Israel and the Palestinians .
The eastern sector of the city , which Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and immediately annexed , is home to a contested site that houses both the sole remnant of the biblical Jewish Temples and the Al - Aqsa Mosque , where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven .
About 193,000
Jews have moved to east Jerusalem in the past 43 years , where they live alongside 263,000 Palestinians .
Netanyahu maintains Israel has the right to build in all of Jerusalem and says he wo n't share the city with the Palestinians .
But the Palestinians , the U.S. and the rest of the international community do not recognize the annexation and presume sovereignty will be shared between Israel and the Palestinians under any final agreement .
Both the Jewish construction and the demolition of Palestinian homes have provoked sharp criticism from the Obama administration .
Israel 's announcement in March , during a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden , that it planned to build 1,600 homes for Jews in an existing neighborhood infuriated the Americans and provoked the Palestinians to postpone the U.S. - mediated talks until earlier this month .
But an Associated Press investigation in late April revealed that Israel had imposed a de facto moratorium freeze on new Jewish construction in east Jerusalem after the Biden visit .
And the last demolition of a Palestinian home in east Jerusalem was carried out in October .
According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem , Israel razed 449 unauthorized Palestinian homes between 2004 and 2009 .
Both developments suggest Netanyahu might have a quiet understanding with Washington to keep declaring its right to build Jewish homes and demolish unauthorized Palestinian ones while in practice doing neither .
Both ministers are members of Netanyahu 's coalition and would be privy to his decisions .

As if anyone thought otherwise , the final shape of finreg has now been formalized and as Shahien Nasiripour at the Huffington Post notes , " many of the measures that offered the greatest chances to fundamentally reshape how the Street conducts business have been struck out , weakened , or rendered irrelevant . "
Congrats , middle class , once again you get raped by Wall Street , which is off to the races to yet again rapidly blow itself up courtesy of 30 x leverage , unlimited discount window usage , trillions in excess reserves , quadrillions in unregulated derivatives , a TBTF framework that has been untouched and will need a rescue in under a year , non-existent accounting rules , a culture of unmitigated greed , and all of Congress and Senate on its payroll .
And , sorry , you can't even vote some of the idiots that passed this garbage out : after all there is a retiring lame duck in charge of it all .
We can only hope his annual Wall Street ( i.e. taxpayer funded ) annuity will satisfy his conscience for destroying any hope America could have of a credible financial system .
From Huff Po :
The two most high - profile provisions were the last items to be considered .
Neither emerged intact .
One would have forced banks to stop trading financial instruments with their own capital and give up their stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds , named after their original proponent , former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker .
The other would have compelled banks to raise tens of billions of dollars because they'd have to spin off their derivatives - dealing operations into separately - capitalized affiliates within the bank holding company , pushed by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Blanche Lincoln .
As currently practiced both activities are highly lucrative , annually generating billions for the nation 's megbanks .
Ultimately , despite widespread approval among those pushing for fundamental reform in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , yet perhaps aided by near - unanimous revulsion among those on Wall Street , both were watered down in front of C - SPAN cameras beginning around 11 p.m. ET .
Democratic lawmakers had been rushing to complete the bill by Friday morning under a self - imposed deadline .
The final vote was recorded at 5:40 a.m .
The conference began their final day just before 10 a.m. on Thursday .
Among the " compromises " were the push to have Tier 1 instead of Tangible Common Equity as a variable in determining how much could be invested in hedge funds and private firms :
After days of leaks to the news media that the Senate was looking to ease the restrictions , on Thursday afternoon Senate conferees confirmed the rumors : banks could invest up to three percent of their tangible common equity in hedge funds and private equity firms .
Tangible common equity -- considered to be the strongest form of bank capital -- is comprised of shareholder equity .
A few hours later , the Senate amended its proposal , changing the metric from tangible common equity to Tier One capital .
Banks have more Tier
One capital than they have tangible common equity , so changing the requirement to the weaker form of capital allows banks to invest more of their cash in hedge funds and private equity funds .
The concession was confirmed by Steven Adamske , spokesman for House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank .
Unlike Dodd , luckily Barney Frank can at least be voted out .
The 1.5 % to 3.0 % increase was solely dictated by Jamie Dimon so that the firm could keep its investment in mega fund Highbridge and have breathing room for other asset management allocations .
From FT :
The limit for JPMorgan Chase , which owns a hedge fund called Highbridge and a private equity group , would be about $ 2.8 bn .
People close to JPMorgan said the company had more than $ 1bn invested in Highbridge alone .
Limits for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , securities houses with smaller balance sheets , would be lower : about $ 900 m for Morgan Stanley , which has already signalled its intention to sell its stakes in hedge funds , and about $ 1.78 bn for Goldman , which has a large and very profitable fund business .
For those who remember that Obama , to great fanfare , said prop trading would spin off , well , it 's good to see the President was purchased by Dimon 's henchmen too :
As for the measure 's proposed ban on banks trading with their own money , also known as proprietary trading , the agreed - upon provision calls for federal financial regulators to study the measure , then issue rules implementing it based on the results of that study .
It could be anything from an outright ban to a barely - there limit .
Finally , on Lincoln 's derivative spin off proposal , it appears that one is DOA as well :
Lincoln 's divisive measure had been reached .
" There 's been some work done by the administration and some of the senators on a potential compromise , I guess you could call it , " said Peterson , chairman of the House Agriculture Committee , in a reference to the Obama administration .
The negotiations were not public .
Rather than banks being forced to spin off their swaps desks , they'd be allowed to keep those units dealing with " the biggest part of all these derivatives , " Peterson said .
The rest would be pushed out to an affiliate .
Under the agreement , reached late Thursday , banks would continue to be allowed to deal interest rate and foreign exchange swaps , " credit derivatives referencing investment - grade entities that are cleared , " derivatives referencing gold and silver , and the firms would be allowed to hedge " for the banks ' own risk . "
Banks would be forced to push out to their affiliates derivatives referencing " cleared and uncleared commodities , energies and metals ( with the exception of gold and silver ) , agriculture , credit derivatives referencing non-investment grade entities and all equities , and any uncleared credit default swaps , " Peterson said .
" Frankly , the biggest part of all these derivatives , by far , are the ones that I named that are going to be able to stay in the bank , " Peterson added .
" Interest rate and foreign exchange are by far the greatest part of the amount of business that 's involved here . "
In other words , the greatest theatrical production of the past few months is now over , it has achieved nothing , it will prevent nothing , and ultimately the financial markets will blow up yet again , but not before the Teleprompter in Chief pummels the idiot public with address after address how he singlehandedly was bribed , pardon , achieved a historic event of being the only president to completely crumble under Wall Street 's pressure on every item that was supposed to reign in the greatest risktaking generation ( with Other People 's Money ) in history .
We hope , with this farce behind us , Goldman and JPMorgan can resume adding to their hundreds of trillions in IR , FX and other swaps promptly , as always oblivious of the end unwind , and finally blow up the world for good when the $ 1.5 quadrillion in fake credit money collapses into the gold singularity at the bottom of the Exter pyramid , and it all comes crashing down .

Christian Wulff hat sich in eine höchst unbequeme Lage hineinmanövriert oder ist in sie hineinmanövriert worden – je nachdem , ob sein präsidialer Wunsch oder ob Angela Merkels Wille am Anfang der Regierungsentscheidung stand , ihn zum Kandidaten für das Amt des Bundespräsidenten zu küren oder besser : zu ernennen .
Denn nun bekommt er all den Frust ab , der sich nicht erst in diesen Tagen angesammelt hat .
Dieser Frust artikuliert sich am liebsten als Anti-Parteien - Ressentiment , als der eilige Verdacht , dass „ die da oben “ ohnehin alles unter sich auskungeln .
Diesmal war es aber auch so .
Die Entscheidung für ihn fiel im allerkleinsten Kreis , und offensichtlich waren die Akteure vor allem bestrebt , die jäh vakante Stelle in Schloss Bellevue so schnell wie irgend möglich zu besetzen .
Das – sicherlich auch taktisch motivierte – Angebot der Oppositionsparteien , in dieser unwirklichen , einmaligen Situation einen für alle Demokraten wählbaren Kandidaten zu suchen , wurde links liegen gelassen .
Und Wulff – die personifizierte Mitte , der personifizierte bundesdeutsche Normalfall – hätte gar nicht so schlechte Chancen gehabt , ein gutes Bild abzugeben .
Er hat etwas Väterliches , dazu immer noch etwas Jugendliches und kennt sich – ein hohes
Gut – dank jahrzehntelanger Partei - und Regierungsarbeit bestens im politischen Gefüge aus .
Das hätte etwas werden können , wäre nicht plötzlich Joachim Gauck aufgetaucht .
Gegen ihn sieht er schlecht aus , fällt ab .
Das ist nicht sein Fehler , sondern Gaucks Verdienst .
Anzeige
Die Tiefen , die Joachim Gauck durchschreiten musste , sind ihm erspart geblieben , er ist ganz Kind dieser Republik .
Die Narben , die das Leben schlagen kann , sind ihm nicht anzusehen .
Und so präsidial er sich auch gibt , er ist ganz und gar ein Partei - Mann .
Verglichen damit verkörpert Gauck einen größeren Reichtum des Lebens .
Und dennoch bringt er sich überzeugend nicht als Anti-Parteien - Kandidat ins Spiel : Seiner Kandidatur fehlt aller plebiszitäre Aufstandsfuror .
Deswegen kam er im Nu so gut an und lässt ungewollt Christian Wulff schlecht aussehen .
In den Regierungsparteien scheint man darauf mit Durchhaltementalität zu reagieren .
Die Reihen werden geschlossen , Abweichung wird als Regierungsverrat hingestellt , und es heißt schon wieder : Eine Alternative gibt es nicht .
Was , außer eitlem Stolz , spräche eigentlich dagegen , die Entscheidung im Lichte der neuen Situation noch einmal zu überdenken ?
Newsweek , currently hosting a series called " The Fat Wars , " is featuring dueling op - eds today , one arguing that fatties need to put down the forks , the other that obesity is genetic .
Neither one gets it quite right .
Advertisement
If you 've ever read a word I 've written , you 've already guessed that I come down on the side of the second argument .
Which is basically this , in the words of Jeffrey Friedman , who wrote the op-ed :
The heritability of obesity — a measure of how much obesity is due to genes versus other factors — is about the same as the heritability of height .
It 's even greater than that for many conditions that people accept as having a genetic basis , including heart disease , breast cancer , and schizophrenia .
As nutrition has improved over the past 200 years , Americans have gotten much taller on average , but it is still the genes that determine who is tall or short today .
The same is true for weight .
Although our high - calorie , sedentary lifestyle contributes to the approximately 10 - pound average weight gain of Americans compared to the recent past , some people are more severely affected by this lifestyle than others .
That 's because they have inherited genes that increase their predisposition for accumulating body fat .
Our modern lifestyle is thus a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition for the high prevalence of obesity in our population .
Advertisement
But Friedman had already pissed me off before he even got to that .
In an apparent effort to prove that he 's a Serious Person and not just some delusional fatass with an axe to grind ( hi ! ) , he acknowledges that obesity is a risk factor for a bunch of diseases , claiming it has " consequences that include diabetes , heart disease , and cancer , and that cause nearly 300,000 deaths in the United States each year . "
Y'ALL , THE 300,000 DEATHS THING WAS DEBUNKED IN 2005 .
By the CDC , not delusional fatties with axes to grind .
Same folks who came up with the original stat , in fact .
They just fucked up the first time :
According to the [ second ] study , obesity and extreme obesity cause about 112,000 deaths per year , but being overweight was found to prevent about 86,000 deaths annually .
Based on those figures , the net U.S. death toll from excess weight is 26,000 per year .
By contrast , researchers found that being underweight results in 34,000 deaths per year .
Emphasis added .
Seeing that error — four years after that crucial revision came out — automatically makes me think I can't take the person talking seriously .
Which sucks , because in this particular debate , Friedman is , generally speaking , the one dealing in reality .

Ken Thorpe and Christine Ferguson , on the other hand , get it wrong from the headline : " We Have the Power to Change Our Weight " ( And no , they probably did n't write the headline , but they wrote the op - ed that made that a logical summary . )
Sure , most of us have the power to change our weight , temporarily .
I was a champion dieter for a while there , losing 65 lbs .
the first time I got serious about it , and 45 lbs. the second time .
Haters will go to their graves believing that 's because I gave up , both times , and started mainlining powdered sugar delivered to me via an elaborate pulley system constructed so I 'd never have to leave the couch , but those who have even a passing interest in facts might consider looking at the research on long - term weight loss .
Such as the 2007 UCLA study ( PDF ) , in which researchers reviewed 31 earlier studies and concluded that on the whole :
[ D]ieters were not able to maintain their weight losses in the long term , and there was not consistent evidence that the diets resulted in significant improvements in their health .
In the few cases in which health benefits were shown , it could not be demonstrated that they resulted from dieting , rather than exercise , medication use , or other lifestyle changes .
It appears that dieters who manage to sustain a weight loss are the rare exception , rather than the rule .
Dieters who gain back more weight than they lost may very well be the norm , rather than an unlucky minority . "
Advertisement
The part about not being able to identify which variables actually produced the ( few demonstrated ) health benefits is crucial .
Thorpe and Ferguson write , " We know that as little as a 5 to 10 percent weight loss can significantly reduce risk factors for chronic disease , including lower blood - glucose levels , lower blood pressure , and reduced cholesterol levels , " but they do n't question how those studies proved it was the weight loss itself , as opposed to the lifestyle interventions that elicited it .
In fact , other research suggests that a Health at Every Size approach — focusing on intuitive eating , exercise and ( wonder of wonders ) self - acceptance , all without regard to weight loss — delivers better health outcomes than dieting .
No one disputes that a steady diet of junk food and a sedentary lifestyle are bad for your health .
But A )
Many fat people can and do eat balanced diets and exercise just as much as thin people without losing weight — that 's where the whole genetic thing comes in — and B ) plenty of thin people suffer from health issues related to lifestyle choices , but the default assumption is that they 're " taking care of themselves " because they do n't happen to have fat genes .
Eating a balanced diet and exercising can be beneficial for all of us , but they will not cause permanent weight loss in most of us — and there 's no real proof that we'd be markedly better off if they did .
( Even if being thinner is theoretically advantageous — and again , " overweight " people win the longevity game — we must keep in mind that a fat person who 's lost weight is not the same thing as a person who 's always been thin . )
Friedman gets this mostly right :
There is no evidence that obese individuals need to " normalize " their weight to reap health benefits .
In fact , it is not even clear whether there are enduring health benefits to weight loss among obese individuals who do not suffer from diabetes , heart disease , hypertension , or liver disease .
Advertisement
But then , once again , he blows it , basically reiterating Thorpe and Ferguson 's point about losing 5 - 10 % of your weight :
What is known is that the obese who do suffer from these conditions receive a disproportionately large benefit from even modest weight loss , which together with exercise and a heart - healthy diet can go a long way toward improving health .
Advertisement
Apart from what I 've already said about the variables involved in weight loss and the fact that permanent weight loss is a pipe dream for all but a few statistical outliers , here 's the obvious question about the " just lose 5 - 10 % " thing :
What happens when I do that and am still fat ?
Losing 10 % of my weight (+/- 19 lbs.*) would leave me squarely in the obese category , not improving their statistics one little bit — so even if my health improved , would anyone actually quit bitching about the " obesity crisis " ?
Oh , but wait — enough people are on the cusp of BMI categories that if we all lost 5 - 10 % of our weight , we 'd see a dramatic drop in " obesity " and " overweight " population - wide , at which point we could all congratulate ourselves on no longer being a nation of embarrassing fatties who are going to die younger than our parents , even though individual losses would generally be quite small .
The important thing is , on paper , that would look fantastic .
At least until everyone gained it back .
Thorpe and Ferguson argue for many of the public health interventions I addressed in an inexplicably controversial post last week , and as always , I 'm in favor of several of them , e.g. , " lowering copays on preventive care ... reinstating physical education and requiring school lunches to meet nutritional standards ... ensuring that all Americans have access to a place to be physically active and purchase healthy foods . "
What I 'm not in favor of are undefined " programs to help overweight Americans " ( unless they mean programs to help us overcome the ill effects of relentless fat - hatred , see above about diets not working ) and " tax credits to employers that offer wellness benefits and encourage health inside and outside of the workplace " — which sound fairly unobjectionable until you consider that this is what leads to demeaning " Biggest Loser " competitions at the office , employers badgering their workers to join specific commercial weight loss programs , and hysteria about a plate of cupcakes in the break room .
If we 're talking about tax credits for offering employees free or discounted gym memberships — and then leaving them the hell alone to work out as they please , or not — then great , have at it .
But that 's never all we 're talking about .
We 're talking about diet culture invading the workplace even more than it already has , and a whole new layer of shame for fat people who are n't interested in joining Weight Watchers — probably because they 've already been on it multiple times , and gained back everything they lost .

" [ T ] o win the fight against obesity , " Thorpe and Ferguson write , " all of us need to be individually committed . "
Really ?
All of us ?
What role do people who are n't fat play in this , exactly ?
If you mean they need to be constantly reminding fat people that we 're disgusting , unlovable , smelly , lazy , undisciplined , and above all , unhealtheeeeeee , then as a whole , they 're doing a bang - up job already .
( This does not , of course , apply to all thin people .
Some of my best friends are thin ! )
So I 'm pretty sure what you mean is " Fat people need to be individually committed " to fighting their own bodies .
To which I 'd point out : Most of us already are .
Who the fuck do you think is keeping the $ 50 billion dollar weight loss industry afloat ?
Magic sprites ?

Oh , and about that .
You know that population - wide weight gain that happened in the last 30 years ?
( Friedman says the average is about 10 lbs. ; I 've heard anywhere from 7 to 20 ) .
Check out that last sentence from the UCLA researchers I quoted above : " Dieters who gain back more weight than they lost may very well be the norm , rather than an unlucky minority . "
Not only does dieting not work , but a lot of times it makes you fatter .
And the weight loss industry has been growing right along with our asses all that time .
Is that the only reason for the gain over that period ?
I have no idea , probably not .
But it 's something obesity alarmists never , ever factor in , even though common sense suggests somebody really ought to explore that correlation .
If you 're a regular reader of mine and you feel like you 've heard everything in this post a million , billion times , you have my apologies .
I am so sick of making these arguments , I can not even tell you .
Unfortunately , people can't even get it through their heads that diets do n't work — despite both a mountain of scientific evidence to that effect and a friggin ' " results not typical " disclaimer on every ad — let alone that it is possible to be fat and healthy , that it is equally possible to be thin and unhealthy , that correlation does not equal causation , that there is strong evidence that obesity is highly heritable , that calories in / calories out is a ludicrously simplistic equation unless you think human beings are Bunsen burners , and that , above all , fat people are human beings .
Which means we can hear you .
And our continued fatness is not a personal attack on you or our country or our healthcare system , but the result of complex factors science is only beginning to understand , and in very many cases , something we have already tried our damnedest to change .
Advertisement
Or , as Friedman puts it :
While research into the biologic system that controls weight is moving toward the development of effective therapies for obesity , we are not there yet .
In the meantime we must change our attitudes toward the obese and focus less on appearance and more on health .
In their efforts to lose weight they are fighting against their biology .
But they also are fighting against a society that wrongly believes that obesity is a personal failing .
Advertisement
I 've stopped fighting against my biology , but I am still fighting against that society every goddamned day .
And I do n't just mean the trolls who swing by to tell me things like ,
My fear that a woman with the legal power to take half of my possessions might some day become so fat and sexually unappealing that I 'd sooner cut my own penis off than have sex with the manatee that used to be my wife is unfortunately all too common and blogs like this one that dangerously suggest to naive future fatties that it's ok are only leading your victims down the primrose path to a battle they can't win . "

Or :
I personally dislike most fat people for their lack of will power or mental strength .
If fat people would just have a strong mental will power , then they would either be able to deal with the jokes , or become skinny by actually sticking to their dieting and exercise plan without giving up .

( I truncated that one .
By a lot . )
It 's not just those shitheads , who are incredibly easy to dismiss .
I 'm talking about the people who swear they are really only concerned for my health , without ever having heard of Health at Every Size .
The people who write screeds on how much obesity ( theoretically ) costs our healthcare system , and exhort individuals to fix that problem , without acknowledging that pile of research showing permanent weight loss is virtually impossible .
I 'm talking about the people who try to sell good ideas for improving public health as cures for childhood obesity , making fat kids feel like enemies of their entire communities , and yet not making them noticeably thinner .
I 'm talking even about people like Friedman , who are starting to get the message about the basic intractability of fat — and kudos to him for spreading it — but still repeat debunked , alarmist statistics in an effort to boost their own credibility before daring to suggest that fat people might not be a bunch of lazy slobs .
I 'm talking about everyone who 's ever said , " I do n't think we should treat fat people badly , but ... "

Because that right there ?
Is treating fat people badly .
It 's still treating us as a problem to be solved , not as human beings .
To win the fight against fat hatred and discrimination , we all must be individually committed .

* I 've said many times that I weigh around 200 lbs. , though I have n't weighed myself since I jumped on a dog scale at the vet 's office to prove a point 2 years ago .
I weighed 185 then , after which I gained a pants size , which probably represents 10 - 15 lbs .
But as it happens , I have recently dropped a pants size , so am probably somewhere around 190 .
Yes , the Queen of the Fat - o - Sphere has lost weight !
And because I love you , I will share the secret of how I did it : I went off the pill .

3RD UPDATE : Megan As Cautionary Tale : Is Shia Heeding ?
2ND UPDATE , 8 PM : I can tell you that this new statement from Megan Fox ’s PR flack about why the actress wo n’t be appearing in Transformers 3 is absolutely untrue :
“ It was her decision not to return .
She wishes the franchise the best . ”
What a pantload .
I stand by my scoop that Paramount and Michael Bay kicked her to the curb by not picking up her option to do the threequel .
UPDATE 7 PM :
Here are just some of the replacements you ’ve suggested : Scarlett Johansson , Mila Kunis , Blake Lively , Amanda Seyfried , Miley Cyrus , Hillary Duff , Isla Fisher , Amber Heard , Zoe Saldana , and a bunch of actresses I ’ve never heard of .
And , of course , Shia ’s real - life girlfriend Carey Mulligan .
And the omnipresent Taylor Lautner .
EXCLUSIVE 1:45 PM : I ’ve just learned that Paramount wo n’t be picking up Megan Fox ’s option on Transformers 3 — and that it was “ ultimately ” director Michael Bay ’s decision .
( So he gets his revenge for her remark comparing him to “ Hitler ” . )
Right now Bay and writer Ehren Kruger et al are finishing up the script for the threequel and “ giving Shia a new love interest makes more sense for the story , ” an insider tells me .
Bay will start casting immediately for the new female co-star .
Let ’s hear your suggestions , readers …
So did Megan deserve to get fired ?
I say yes .
No actor / actress can expect to go around dissing a director and expect to work together as if nothing happened .
Much less the egotistical Bay .
But in Fox , he had met his match .
Why , as recently as this week Megan was quoted as dissing Bay yet again .
In recent months she has shown off a more natural skin hue instead of her usual orange color — and blamed the Transformers helmer for her unhealthy tanning binge .
“ I had been tanning a lot so that Michael would be happy with my skin tone .
Every spare moment of sun that was outside , I had to be in it , ” the 24 - year - old actress lamented in Allure magazine .
“ It ’s not going to happen again because of the damage and the possible skin cancer . ”
This is without doubt a huge blow to Megan ’s career , already damaged by her inability to open Twentieth ’s Fox Atomic film Jennifer ’s Body last September .
The R- rated feminist horror flick did a pathetic $ 6.8 M weekend for a script by Juno‘s Diablo Cody for a domestic total of only $ 16.2 M and a worldwide take of just $ 31.5 M .
And talk about bad timing : right now she ’s doing publicity for her role in Jonah Hex to be released June 18th .
Guess what everyone will ask her ?
Nevertheless , my news today comes a shocker because back in October Bay announced that he had scheduled Transformers 3 for July 1st , 2011 , and made a point to archly warn Megan personally about the rigors of this new installment :
“ P.S. Megan Fox , welcome back .
I promise no alien robots will harm you in any way during the production of this motion picture .
Please consult your Physician when working under my direction because some side effects can occur , such as mild dizziness , intense nausea , suicidal tendencies , depression , minor chest hair growth , random internal hemorrhaging and inability to sleep .
As some directors may be hazardous to your health , please consult your Doctor to determine if this is right for you . ”
In case you ’ve forgotten , Megan promoted Jennifer ’s Body in Wonderland magazine by accusing Bay of wanting to “ create this insane , infamous mad-man reputation .
He wants to be like Hitler on his sets , and he is .
So he ’s a nightmare to work for . ”
That ignited a firestorm of criticism of her .
I broke the story when 3 “ loyal ” members of Bay ’s Transformers franchise crew asked his website to post their response to Fox .
They detailed why she ‘s the nightmare .
( I love when there ’s honesty in Hollywood . )
Here ’s that missive , again :
This is an open letter to all Michael Bay fans .
We are three crew members that have worked with Michael for the past ten years .
Last week we read the terrible article with inflammatory , truly trashing quotes by the Ms. Fox about Michael Bay .
This letter is to set a few things straight .
Yes , Megan has great eyes , a tight stomach we spray with glycerin , and an awful silly Marilyn Monroe tattoo plastered on her arm that we cover up to keep the moms happy .
Michael found this shy , inexperienced girl , plucked her out of total obscurity thus giving her the biggest shot of any young actresses ’ life .
He told everyone around to just trust him on his choice .
He granted her the starring role in Transformers , a franchise that forever changed her life ; she became one of the most googled and oogled women on earth .
She was famous !
She was the next Angelina Jolie , hooray !
Wait a minute , two of us worked with Angelina – second thought – she ’s no Angelina .
You see , Angelia is a professional .
We know this quite intimately because we ’ve had the tedious experience of working with the dumb - as - a - rock Megan Fox on both Transformers movies .
We ’ve spent a total of 12 months on set making these two movies .
We are in different departments ; we ca n’t give our names because sadly doing so in Hollywood could lead to being banished from future Paramount work .
One of us touches Megan ’s panties , the other has the often shitty job of pulling Ms. Sourpants out of her trailer , while another is near the Panaflex camera that helps to memorialize the valley girl on film .
Megan has the press fooled .
When we read those magazines we wish we worked with that woman .
Megan knows how to work her smile for the press .
Those writers should try being on set for two movies , sadly she never smiles .
The cast , crew and director make Transformers a really fun and energetic set .
We ’ve traveled around the world together , so we have never understood why Megan was always such the grump of the set ?
When facing the press , Megan is the queen of talking trailer trash and posing like a porn star .
And yes we ’ve had the unbearable time of watching her try to act on set , and yes , it ’s very cringe - able .
So maybe , being a porn star in the future might be a good career option .
But make - up beware , she has a paragraph tattooed to her backside ( probably due her rotten childhood ) — easily another 45 minutes in the chair !
So when the three of us caught wind of Ms Fox , pontificating yet again in some publication ( like she actually has something interesting to say ) blabbing her trash mouth about a director whom we three have grown to really like .
She compared working with Michael , to “ working with Hitler ” .
We actually do n’t think she knows who Hitler is by the way .
But we wondered how she does n’t realize what a disgusting , fully uneducated comment this was ?
Well , here let ’s get some facts straight .
Say what you want about Michael – yes at times he can be hard , but he ’s also fun , and he challenges everyone for a reason – he simply wants people to bring their ‘ A ’ game .
He comes very prepared , knows exactly what he wants , involves the crew and expects everyone to follow through with his or her best , and that includes the actors .
He ’s one of the hardest working directors out there .
He gets the best from his crews , many of whom have worked with him for 15 years .
And yes , he ’s loyal , one of the few directors we ’ve encountered who lowered his fee by millions to keep Transformers in the United States and California , so he could work with his own crew .
Megan says that Transformers was an unsafe set ?
Come on Megan , we know it is a bit more strenuous then the playground at the trailer park , but you do n’t insult one of the very best stunt and physical effects teams in the business !
Not one person got hurt !
And who is the real Megan Fox ?
She is very different than the academy nominee and winning actors we ’ve all worked around .
She ’s as about ungracious a person as you can ever fathom .
She shows little interest in the crew members around her .
We work to make her look good in every way , but she ’s absolutely never appreciative of anyone ’s hard work .
Never a thank you .
All the crewmembers have stopped saying hi to Ms. Princess because she never says hello back .
It gets tiring .
Many think she just really hates the process of being an actress .
Megan has been late to the sets many times .
She goes through the motions that make her exude this sense of misery .
We ’ve heard the A.D ’s piped over the radio that Megan wo n’t walk from her trailer until John Turturro walks first !
John ’s done seventy - five movies and she ’s made two !
Never expect Megan to attend any of the 15 or so crew parties like all the other actors have .
And then there ’s the classless night she blew off
The Royal Prince of Jordan who made a special dinner for all the actors .
She does n’t know that one of the grips ’ daughters wanted to visit their daddy ’s work to meet Megan , but he would n’t let them come because he told them “ she is not nice . ”
The press certainly does n’t know her most famous line .
On our first day in Egypt , the Egyptian government would n’t let us shoot because of a permit problem as the actors got ready in make up at the Four Seasons Hotel .
Michael tried to make the best of it ; he wanted to take the cast and crew on a private tour of the famous Giza pyramids .
God hold us witness , Megan said , “ I ca n’t believe Michael is fucking forcing us to go to the fucking pyramids ! ”
I guess this is the “ Hitler guy ” she is referring to .
So this is the Megan Fox you do n’t get to see .
Maybe she will learn , but we figure if she can sling insults , then she can take them too .
Megan really is a thankless , classless , graceless , and shall we say unfriendly bitch .
It ’s sad how fame can twist people , and even sadder that young girls look up to her .
If only they knew who they ’re really looking up to .
But ‘ fame ’ is fleeting .
We , being behind the scenes , seen em ’ come and go .
Hopefully Michael will have Megatron squish her character in the first ten minutes of Transformers 3 .
We can tell you that will make the crew happy !
- Loyal Transformers Crew
That prompted Michael Bay to update his website with this message :
The Crew Letter
09/12/2009 11:32 PM
I do n’t condone the crew letter to Megan .
And I do n’t condone Megan ’s outlandish quotes .
But her crazy quips are part of her crazy charm .
The fact of the matter I still love working with her , and I know we still get along .
I even expect more crazy quotes from her on Transformers 3 .
Michael
And then the Megan Fox publicity machine fought back by giving this non-statement from the actress to EW : “ I have spoken with the parties involved privately .
I am very fortunate to be involved in this amazing franchise and look forward to Transformers 3 . ” ( Interesting that now everything was private again after she started the brouhaha by going public in the first place . )
Megan ’s flack then gave the media a letter in defense of the actress from a production assistant :
My name is Anthony Steinhart and I have worked on both Transformers movies and have had the pleasure of working with Ms. Fox .
I read the letter by the three unnamed crew people and was blown away by their description of Ms. Fox .
Especially , since I am the one usually getting Ms. Fox at her trailer .
I have personally never been nor ever witnessed Ms. Fox being rude or inconsiderate of people ’s feelings or the work to be done .
Everyone is entitled to their good days and bad .
Contrary to popular belief , she is like us ( human ) and has both good and bad days as well .
Working on the Transformers movies can be intense at times and sometimes intense situations cause intense moments .
Some of the examples the three unnamed writers give as evidence of Ms. Fox and her horrible attitude are so ridiculous .
It ’s unfortunate the grip did n’t want to bring his daughter to set because Megan Fox was n’t nice and not the fact that we had a closed to set .
No visitors unless approved by the UPM [ unit production manager ] .
That is what the call sheets have always said .
By the way , Ms. Fox wished my 12 - year - old brother a happy birthday over the phone while we were shooting in New Mexico .
Not so heartless …
It ’s also unfortunate that she did n’t attend any of the “ 15 ” parties , but I clearly remember her hanging out in New Mexico with some of the crew and watching her get hounded by passers - by as she walked through the hotel lobby and being nothing but gracious to her fans .
Also is n’t it refreshing to hear that she does n’t need to be a part of the party machine that sometimes swallows people whole , only to spit them out on the front page of every magazine .
And incidentally , if these crew members were at the wrap party , I only saw 2 cast members there .
Granted I was n’t there the whole night , but I was there long enough to know that the others probably were n’t going to show .
I also remember walking with her through the hordes of people lined up , while we shot at Princeton and she signed autograph after autograph .
She signed many publicity photos , magazines , pieces of white paper for crew members and their families .
Now I know that is n’t the same as curing a disease , but if we are to take anything an actor / actress says or does to personally , then I fear we have far greater problems on our hands .
Unfortunately , I do n’t always keep up with or hang on to quotes and / or quips “ actresses ” say , so I was n’t familiar with the incident that incited the tasteless letter , but none - the - less leave the war of words to those involved .
No need to drag her name through the mud and at the same time , unknowingly , bring others down .
But , it ’s Michael Bay , not Megan , who gets the last word .
Bitchslap !

Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) --
A criminal case has been launched against four Russian soldiers on charges they illegally used credit cards belonging to a Polish official who died in the presidential plane crash in Russia in April , Russian authorities said Tuesday .
" The criminal case has been started against four conscript soldiers on charges of theft by an organized group .
The four were in the cordon at the scene of the crash , " the Investigation Committee of the Russian Prosecutor 's Office said .
The soldiers took several cards but only used one of them to withdraw cash , stealing about 60,345 rubles ( about $ 1,900 ) in several transactions , the committee said .
The committee said the suspects were identified by the command of the military base that services the military airport near Smolensk , Russia , where the plane crashed April 10 .
" It was established in an inquiry that soldiers Sergei Syrov , Igor Pustovar , Artur Pankratov , and Yuri Sankov made use of these bank cards , " the committee said .
All four soldiers have confessed and are actively cooperating with the investigation , the committee said .
The plane went down near Smolensk airport in western Russia , killing Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 other top Polish officials and dignitaries .
They had been heading to Smolensk to mark the 70th anniversary of the massacre of Polish soldiers there during World War II .
Russian and Polish aviation experts last month ruled out any emergency or equipment malfunction as the cause of the crash , but they did find there were people in the cockpit who were not members of the crew .
There was also heavy fog in the area at the time .
Russian State TV reported the soldiers admitted they spent the money at a local cafe .
Three of the four suspects had a criminal record before they were conscripted into the army , the committee said .
They are now being held at their military base " under the observation of their command . "
Russia 's Interfax news agency , quoting the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita , said the misappropriated credit cards had been owned by Andrzej Przewoznik , who was secretary - general of the Council for the Protection of the Memory of Combat and Martyrdom .
The Russian Defense Ministry issued a statement Tuesday saying it will reimburse Przewoznik 's relatives for the stolen money as soon as the investigation is over .
SAN DIEGO -– Say goodbye to donor lists and organ shortages .
A biotech firm has created a printer that prints veins using a patients ’ own cells .
The device could potentially create whole organs in the future .
" Right now we 're really good at printing blood vessels , ” says Ben Shepherd , senior research scientist at regenerative - medicine company Organovo .
“ We printed 10 this week .
We 're still learning how to best condition them to be good , strong blood vessels . "
Most organs in the body are filled with veins , so the ability to print vascular tissue is a critical building block for complete organs .
The printed veins are about to start testing in animal trials , and eventually go through human clinical trials .
If all goes well , in a few years you may be able to replace a vein that has deteriorated ( due to frequent injections of chemo treatment , for example ) with custom - printed tissue grown from your own cells .
The barriers to full - organ printing are not just technological .
The first organ - printing machine will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop , test , produce and market .
Not to mention the difficulty any company will have getting FDA approval .
" If Organovo will be able to raise enough money this company has [ the ] potential to succeed as [ the ] first bioprinting company but only time will show , " says Dr. Vladimir Mironov , director of advanced tissue biofabrication at the Medical University of South Carolina .
Organovo walked Wired.com through the process it uses to print blood vessels on the custom bioprinter .
Above :
Bioreactor — — —-
Shepherd places a bioreactor inside an incubator where it will be pumped with a growth medium for a few days .
The bioreactor uses a special mixture of chemicals that are similar to what cells would see when they grow inside the body , which will help the cells become strong vascular tissue .

Stem Cells — — —-
Senior research scientist Ben Shepherd removes stem cells from a bath of liquid nitrogen .
The cells will be cultured to greatly increase their number before being loaded into the printer .
Eventually these cells could be taken from a variety of places in a patient 's body –- fat , bone marrow and skin cells –- and made into a working vein .
After the cells are defrosted they are cultured in a growth medium ( above ) .
This allows the cells to multiply and grow so they can be used to form veins .
The medium also uses special chemicals to tell the stem cells to grow into the cell type required , in this case blood - vessel cells .
Once a enough cells are produced , they are separated from the growth medium using a centrifuge ( below ) and compressed into pellets .

Hydrogel Scaffolding — — — — ——
–
The first step of the printing process is to lay down a material called hydrogel , which is used as a temporary scaffolding to support the vein tissue .
The custom - made printer uses two pump heads that squirt out either the scaffolding structure or the cells into a petri dish .
The pump heads are mounted on a precision robotic assembly for microscopic accuracy .
The head on the right is dipping into the container of hydorogel in the photo above .
A chamber called a bioreactor is used to stimulate the vein .
It 's prepared before the vein is printed .
The bioreactor is a fairly standard piece of biotech machinery .
It is machined out of a block of aluminum that surrounds a plastic container with various ports .
These ports are used to pump in chemicals that will feed the growing vein .
Before printing the veins , tubes of the cultured cells are loaded into the print head manually , like a biomass print cartridge .

Hydrogel Mold for Blood Vessels — — — — — —————-
Lines of the hydrogel are laid down in parallel in a trough shape on the petri dish .
Then cylinders of cell pellets are printed into the trough .
One more cylinder of hydrogel is printed into the middle of the cells , which serves to create the hole inside the vein where blood will eventually flow ( below ) .

Growing Into Veins — — — — ——
The printed veins are then left in a different growth medium for several weeks .
The cells soon release from the hydrogel , and a hollow tube of vascular cells is left behind .

Happy Veins — ——

The printed cells in tubular form are then placed into the bioreactor .
The bioreactor ( above ) pumps a special cocktail of proteins , buffers and various other chemicals ( below ) through the printed vein .
This conditions the cells to be good , strong veins and keep them happy .

Finished Product — — — — —-
After their stay in the bioreactor , the pellets of cells grow together to form veins which can then be implanted in the patient .
Because the veins are grown from the patient 's own cells , their body is more likely to accept the implanted vein .

Tesla earned a spot among the great minds of the early electrical era , but , despite his genius , he ended up ostracized from the science community and died impoverished .
Learn more about Tesla ’s interesting life in under three minutes with a little help from this clever video .
Did you know that Tesla once rubbed two cats together in an attempt to generate electricity or that Thomas Edison electrocuted an elephant in an attempt to discredit Tesla 's theories ?
A new device uses optical fibers to measure light from individual ions .
Since these charged atoms store quantum information , this ion trap could allow us to build practical quantum computers and to link light and matter at the quantum level .

The real stumbling block for quantum computers is finding something that can practically be used to house a qubit , the building blocks of quantum information .
This ion trap makes the electrically charged atoms a genuine possibility by isolating each one and making possible the extraction of individual qubits of information .
In fact , the researchers were able to use them in some very rudimentary experimental quantum computing .

So how does it work ?
The device is just one square millimeter in size and has a built - in optical fiber .
Tiny electrodes are used to trap the ions that pass through it within 30 to 50 micrometers below the surface of the device .
The ion is then within reading distance of the optical fiber , which detects the ion's fluorescence signals and uses that data to figure out the ion 's quantum information content .
Previous attempts to read the fluorescence of ions have depended on external lenses located about 5 centimeters away .
That may not sound like much , but it 's a full 500 times further away from the ions than the fiber needs to be , which means the detection system can be miniaturized and packed in on a level never before imagined .
A huge number of these fibers could be put on a single quantum computer chip , which just would n't be possible with the older lens system .
The fiber method is n't as efficient as its lens counterpart , although its developers are confident they can improve the light absorption of the device .
Either way , since ions give off millions of photos per second , they are plenty bright enough for the fibers to detect and read .
For this particular trap design , the researchers ultimately hope to pair individual photons with individual ions .
That would allow information to be swapped from matter qubits to photon qubits .
Matter qubits , like those using ions , are currently the preferred foundation of quantum computers , while photon qubits are used for quantum communications , which is thought to be the most secure form of communication possible .
By linking data between the two types of qubits , the developers could set up a system that would bring together quantum computers and quantum communications networks .

The PlayStation 3 version of one of the world 's most popular board games is coming to the U.S .
Gamers will be able to download Settlers of Catan via the PlayStation Network starting June 15 , the game 's official site said Wednesday .
Settlers of Catan is a popular board game created by Klaus Teuber .
Since its first publication in 1995 , the game has sold 15 million copies .
Last year ,
Wired magazine called it a " perfect " game ; we were not exaggerating .
Catan will cost $ 6.50 and support two - to four - player online games .
Xbox 360 owners have enjoyed playing a different version of Catan , developed by Big Huge Games , since 2007 .
The PlayStation version Catan was developed by Game Republic , the Japanese developer responsible for games like Genji and Folklore .
But do n't hold that against them .
The videogame developer has a little known sideline in board game design .
A handful of its tabletop offerings , such as Owner 's Choice and Shadow Hunters , have been localized for American gamers by Z - Man Games .
Gamers in Europe and Japan have had access to the Game Republic version of Catan for more than a year .

For the longest time , Nintendo executives either ignored or dismissed the growing impact of gaming on the iPhone platform .
They would consistently scoff at the quality of the games while at the same time assert that the two companies served entirely different demographics .
But with gaming on the iPhone and iPod Touch emerging as a bona fide and arguably unstoppable force , it was only a matter of time before Nintendo had to wake up and see Apple for what it truly was – a threat .
The Nintendo DS has been a rousing success for the Japanese game maker , but there ’s no denying that the versatility of the iPod Touch ( games + music + movies + internet ) was making it a more attractive handheld device than the DS while fundamentally impacting Nintendo ’s bottom line .
In fact , Nintendo ’s profits took a hit recently for the first time in six years .
And now , the sleeping giant has awoken .
The Times Online reports that Apple ’s continued success in the mobile gaming sphere has finally attracted the full attention of Nintendo President Satoru Iwata .
Iwata has reportedly told his minions that Nintendo ’s battle with Sony ( Will vs. PS3 ) has been won , and that the next battle will be against Apple .
Driving the point home , Iwata told executives and employees at Nintendo that they should now view the iPhone and iPad devices as the “ enemy of the future . ”
Especially concerning for Nintendo is that the iPhone , iPod Touch , and the iPad have proven to be viable gaming devices for children and families – the exact demographic Nintendo worked hard to court with its successful DS handhelds .
And so , the battle lines have been drawn , and Nintendo is “ preparing to unleash the full force of its development and marketing artillery against Apple . ”
WHY do some widows and widowers quickly follow their spouses to the grave ?
It seems the so - called widowhood effect could be caused by the combined effects of stress and age - related changes in the immune system .
Previous studies found that among elderly men and women the risk of dying within three months of being widowed increases between 30 and 90 per cent .
It had been suggested that this might be connected with changes in the immune system , yet exactly how was unclear .
Now new research has identified some of those changes , and shown that increased cortisol levels caused by stressful events …
Another planetary extreme where life might be possible are worlds where the average temperatures are around the levels of liquid nitrogen ( colder than minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Such extremes would require organic components and physiologies radically different than those found on Earth .

CD Projekt has reason to be proud of The Witcher .
The studio claims its judgment was called into question for making a game in what was perceived as a dying genre for what was perceived as a dying platform .
While that assessment seems extreme to the point of inaccuracy , I 'm gratified to know that the company nevertheless managed to sell 1.5 million copies of The Witcher .
It was , it seems , not only enough to keep the lights on , but also enough to justify a full sequel , The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings .
The company was showing the game at this year 's E3 .
The second game follows the same general tone of the original ; it 's still heavily focused on an adult - themed story and still has loads of combat and , of course , it still focuses on Geralt , the professional monster hunter of the title .
After quashing the rebellion last time around and saving the life of the king , Geralt now finds himself on a quest to hunt down the assassins who have been killing rulers across the Northern Kingdoms .
Along the way , Geralt will also take the opportunity to find out more about his own origins and his connection to the events transpiring around him .
In true Witcher style , there will also be plenty of sex and violence .
The engine has been entirely rewritten to accommodate the branching story , multi-character dialogue system and new cinematics .
We saw two sequences that showed off all three features to great effect .
In the first , Geralt , his special lady friend , Triss Merigold , and a new character named Vernon Roche find themselves passing through a forest on the trail of a murderer .
I wo n't spoil the story except to say that they encounter an elf named Iorweth .
He 's the captain of an elite unit that was destroyed in the recent war , and he and Roche seem to have had some sort of tension in the past .
During the course of the dialogue , Iorweth and Roche do most of the talking , but the player , as Geralt , has the opportunity to interject from time to time with responses that are themed like those in Mass Effect and can steer the confrontation in a new direction .
Things ended badly when we saw it , but there may be a way for Geralt to have a more calming effect on the encounter .
Moving on from that , we saw another encounter where Geralt , Triss and Roche come across a public hanging in a town square .
Without giving too much away , two of the people being hanged are known to Geralt and he takes it upon himself to rescue them by talking to the guards and appealing to the public .
The dialogue system here allows the player to select the general tone of Geralt 's responses without knowing exactly what he 'll say .
I wo n't spoil the outcome of this encounter either , but the ultimate resolution left me with the intriguing impression that we might have been able to do better .
The morally ambiguous world of The Witcher was never as concerned with traditional notions of good or evil as it was with the consequences of a player 's decisions .
Sometimes this may be as simple as a particular NPCs reaction to your character , while other times it may mean the opening or closing of entire plot lines .
The Witcher 2 is a non-linear game with three distinct plot lines and multiple endings .
And unlike BioWare 's Dragon Age Origins , CD Projekt 's game is short enough that you 're likely to play through it multiple times to see how different decisions might affect the story .
The player can even import their choices from the original game to add instant consequences and context to the world .
The team 's promised a much more fluid combat system this time around as well , with none of the click - tests of the previous game .
Now Geralt can mix melee and magic attacks at will and use blocks , ripostes , and dodges to switch things to the defensive .
For times when you may not want to completely kill your enemies , there are also options for fistfights in the game .
More importantly , there 's now an easy option for combat for players who care more about the story and the exploration of the world and the characters ' motivations than the fighting .
The game is currently only being confirmed for the PC , but CD Projekt also says that the game will " surely be out on console at some point . "
Just when that will be is unclear , but we 'd expect to hear more about the company 's console plans later this year .
The American Academy of Pediatrics has reversed its decision last month regarding the practice of female circumcision by immigrants from some African , Middle Eastern and Asian cultures .
The academy had suggested in a policy statement that doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial pinprick or nick on girls if it would keep their families from sending them overseas for the full circumcision .
Although the nick on a girl ’s clitoris is illegal in the United States , the academy ’s bioethics panel had noted it is practiced in some countries .
The policy statement ignited a storm of criticism from opponents of female genital cutting .
Dr. Judith S. Palfrey , president of the academy , said : “ We ’re saying do n’t do it .
Do everything that you can to support that family in this tough time , but do n’t be pulled into the procedure . ”
Men wearing diving suits were on their way to carry out an attack in Israel , claims military spokesman
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
At least four Palestinians were killed when Israeli navy commandos opened fire on what they said was a squad of militants in diving suits off the coast of Gaza today .
The Palestinians " were on their way to carry out an attack in Israel " , a military spokesman said .
The spokesman declined to give any further details about how the military had identified the men or what they had been doing in the sea .
The al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , a militant offshoot of Fatah , said the men killed were members of its marine unit and had been training .
One Palestinian was missing , and there were no Israeli casualties .
The attack follows a week in which the Israeli navy has faced international criticism for its assault on the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship in a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza , in which nine activists were killed .
An anonymous military official told Israel 's army radio yesterday : " This will be a shot in the arm for the commandos after the hard week they have been through . "
Today 's incident was followed by an air strike on what the military spokesman described as " terrorists trying to fire rockets into Israel " from the northern Gaza Strip .
He could not confirm casualties , although at least one Palestinian was believed to have been seriously injured .
Sami Abu Zuhri , a Hamas spokesman in Gaza , said : " The bloody escalation today is a desperate attempt by the occupation government to divert the world attention away from the massacre committed against the flotilla . "
Israel today released a list of five passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara whom it accused of having links with al - Qaida , Hamas and other militant organisations .
A statement from the Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) named Ken O'Keefe , who it said was a US and British citizen , as a " radical anti-Israel activist and operative of the Hamas terror organisation " .
" He attempted to enter the Gaza Strip in order to form and train a commando unit for the Palestinian terror organisation , " the statement said .
The British Foreign Office said O'Keefe did not have UK citizenship , while his website says he renounced his US citizenship on 1 March 2001 .
O'Keefe , due to be deported to Ireland by Israel after attempting to reach Gaza on the Mavi Marmara , rejected the charges as " slanderous " .
The IDF said the other passengers with alleged terrorist links were Fatimah Mahmadi , a US resident ; two Turkish citizens , Hassan Iynasi and Hussein Urosh ; and a French citizen , Ahmad Ummimon .
According to Israeli media reports , the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , has held at least half a dozen telephone conversations with world leaders over the past few days .
He has faced intense pressure to agree to an international commission of inquiry into the assault on the aid flotilla .
The Israeli government is keen to deflect an international investigation , preferring an internal inquiry , possibly with limited US representation .
The oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico is clearly harming wildlife and the economy of the region , but just how is it affecting human health ?
It 's a question coastal residents and visitors want answered -- but so far , those answers are hard to come by .
Although health professionals in Alabama and beyond are monitoring reports of illnesses in the Gulf , they say it could be months or years before the full impact is understood .
" A lot of it depends on how long it continues and to what degree , " said Tom Miller , assistant state health officer at the Alabama Department of Public Health .
" There are a lot of unknowns , to be honest . "
The health department is tracking reports of oil exposure from people seeking treatment in emergency rooms or urgent care centers in Mobile and Baldwin Counties .
As of the beginning of this week , 37 people had been tallied since the monitoring began May 14 , Miller said .
Of those , 22 had inhaled oil fumes or vapors ; 11 had skin contact ; three had swallowed the oil and one had both touched and inhaled it .
For now , Miller said , the best bet is for residents or visitors to stay away from the oil in the water or on the beaches .
The department has reinstated advisories against swimming at and near Dauphin Island and is particularly warning pregnant women , asthmatics , children and the elderly about avoiding contact with the oil , dispersants and vapors .
" You do n't want to touch it and walk in it , and you do n't want to take home a souvenir , " Miller said .
" We 've been getting stories of people taking tarballs home as souvenirs . "
In addition to the health department , the Environmental Protection Agency is tracking air quality along the Gulf coast and has found ozone and particulate levels ranging from " good " to " unhealthy for sensitive groups . "
Although the odor - causing pollutants associated with the oil are generally at low levels , they may cause headaches , nausea or irritation to the eyes , nose and throat , the agency says .
CDC monitors
The Centers for Disease Control is also monitoring the spill in cooperation with state health departments and the national poison control centers , paying special attention to upper respiratory conditions , cardiovascular problems , eye issues and stomach complaints such as nausea .
It 's following both workers -- who have more intense exposure to the oil , as well as other issues like heat exhaustion -- and the general public .
OTHER RESOURCES :
Web sites you can visit for more information on health issues and the oil spill .
But so far , the numbers are so small that it 's impossible to draw any conclusions about what might happen , Miller said .
In addition , scientists say little is known about past oil spills , and there 's no way to guess what could happen with a spill of this magnitude so close to shore .
The U.S. surgeon general , former Bayou La Batre resident Regina Benjamin , emphasized that last week when she spoke at a conference in New Orleans called by the federal Institute of Medicine , which pulled scientists from around the country to discuss the issue .
" The current scientific literature is inconclusive with regards to the potential hazards resulting from this spill , " Benjamin said .
" Some scientists predict little or no toxic effects , while others express serious concerns about the potential for short and long - term health impacts . "
Down the road
Nalini Sathiakumar , a physician and public health professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , was one of the experts invited to that meeting .
She has done research on a Greek supertanker that ran aground in 2003 off the coast of Pakistan , and says oil contains compounds and heavy metals that can damage organs like the lungs and kidneys and also may harm DNA .
But she said there 's little understanding of what could show up 10 or 15 years down the road , especially with a spill of this unprecedented magnitude .
She said that only eight of the 38 supertanker spills that have occurred since the 1960s have been studied so far , with little long - term follow up .
To compare , the Gulf spill is releasing the equivalent of a supertanker a week , she said .
" As long as oil rig operations are going on in the deep sea , these accidents could occur again , " said Sathiakumar , who is a pediatric nephrologist in the epidemiology department at UAB .
" So I think we need to understand more both in terms of the technology to prevent these leaks , and also the lessons as far as health is concerned , because we do n't know a lot of these things . "
In fact , a 2008 study of a tanker spill published in the journal Mutation Research urged more such investigation , calling it " a relevant but overlooked public health field that involves a large number of people all over the world . "
Earlier this month , members of the American Medical Association voted at their annual meeting to adopt a resolution urging Congress to support long - term studies of the health effects of the oil spill .
It also strives to provide more information to doctors and the public about the risks of oil and dispersants .
And Sathiakumar said the National Institute of Medicine and a CDC advisory board she 's part of are looking at ways to gather baseline health information ranging from respiratory tests of cleanup workers to blood samples from babies born in Gulf hospitals .
In addition , she said , there will need to be studies of the psychological effects of the spill and how social changes in the Gulf community affect health there .
Jeanne Birkenhauer , a physician in Gulf Shores , said that her patients have n't complained of direct physical effects of the spill , but have been pouring in with stress - related symptoms like anxiety , insomnia and panic attacks .
" They live and die on the water , so they have a different relationship to it , " she said .
" It 's having a greater emotional impact , and I do n't know that a lot of people have the coping skills that you would need to deal with something like this . "

Louie Psihoyos has been widely regarded as one of the top photographers in the world .
He was hired directly out of college to shoot for National Geographic and created images for the yellow - bordered magazine for 18 years .
His ability to bring humanity and wit to complicated science stories carries over to his filmmaking .
An ardent diver and dive photographer , he feels compelled to show the world the decline of our planet ’s crucial resource , water .
He has been on contract for Fortune Magazine and shot hundreds of covers for other magazines including Smithsonian , Discover , GEO , Time , Newsweek , The New York Times Magazine , New York Magazine , Sports Illustrated and Rock and Ice .
His work has also been seen on the Discovery Channel , National Geographic Television and the History Channel .
Museums and private collectors around the world have sought Psihoyos ' photography .
With Jim Clark , he created The Oceanic Preservation Society ( OPS ) , in 2005 .
The non-profit organization provides an exclusive lens for the public and media to observe the beauty as well as the destruction of the oceans , while motivating change .
With his first film , The Cove , he has touched many with his unflinching view of a dark subject .
The eco-thriller has won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 82nd Academy Awards , Audience Awards at Sundance , Newport Beach and Toronto 's HotDocs and sweeped through the festival circuit .
Ok Louie , first of all congratulations for winning the Academy Award® and of course for exposing the dolphin massacre in the secret cove in Taiji .
In this talk we will concentrate at the gear you used and how did you managed to film such a difficult subject in such difficult filming locations .
Alexandros Maragos :
• So , what was your production & visual plan ?
Did you had any digital previsualization before filming , any 3D representations of the difficult sequences to be shot , storyboard ?
Louie Psihoyos :
We did n’t do any story boarding until after principle shooting in Taiji was done .
Very little was preconceived in terms of story .
The story really came together in the edit .
We were shooting a making of film about how we acquired the covert footage and we ended up editing that story into the film – so in the end we had a kind of thriller , a real life Oceans Eleven kind of film .
• You used various shooting techniques that we often see from the big Hollywood studios and production companies like Lucas Film .
You went from hidden tree - cameras to fake - rock cameras .
What type of cameras did you manage to fit in ?
Who made the custom equipment ?
Kerner Optical , used to be owned by Lucas Film ’s 3 - D prop department .
They made the fake rocks that we hid some of the first hard drive cameras ever manufactured .
The hard drive cameras allowed us to record about 4 hours of footage .
At the time , there were not commercially made batteries to accommodate the run time so we had expedition batteries made for this operation .
We used remote controlled cameras for the blimp photography , helicopter shots and the nest camera .
We also used button hole cameras on Ric and video camera that shot through the hole in a camera bag for the sequences with police interrogation .
• What hd cameras did you use on and off the water and why ?
We needed the thermal camera to detect guards at the cove at night .
We also had night vision cameras but heat is a better indicator of isolate living things .
We also used Sony HD cams in blinds operated by OPS camera persons but the rock cameras revealed a more intimate view of the cove because we could plant them so close to the action .
• What were your camera settings for the various shooting situations ?
The rock cameras were all set on automatic .
The lighting conditions in the cove were pretty extreme and varied greatly .
The dolphin hunters like to do their work just after sunrise so cameras would have difficulty picking up what they were doing .
Automatic was the only way to go in this instance .
Some of the Sony HD cameras operated by people we had to push the gain to 12db sometimes because it was so dark .
• What was your frame rate ?
We shot everything at 60 and downcoverted to 24 .
In the future we ’re going to start shooting at 24 because the pans can be a bit jaggy when you film straight edges .
• Did you used any particular lenses ?
We did side by side tests of Fujinon and Canon and the Fuji lenses won .
We had two zooms , one that went very wide and a long telephoto - ca n’t recall what they were now – We sold them .
We did n’t use primes as docs require shooting fast .
UK ' stop and search ' law declared ILLEGAL by European court ... but it stays
A police officer searches a teenage boy ( Posed by models ) .
A European court has declared Britain's ' stop and search ' laws illegal
A ' Big Brother ' stop and search power which has been used by police to harass hundreds of thousands of innocent people will remain in force despite being ruled illegal .
The news that police may continue to search members of the public without having any reasonable grounds for suspicion provoked fury among civil liberties campaigners .
The power - section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 - was ruled unlawful by the European Court of Human Rights on Wednesday .
The Home Office now has no remaining grounds for appeal .
But , despite the crushing Strasbourg defeat , officials say they will not stop the police from using the power for months or even a year or more .
In the meantime , tourists , photographers and other members of the public will continue to be subjected to the humiliating searches - of which 256,000 were carried out last year , without catching a single terrorist .
Isabella Sankey , policy director for the campaign group Liberty , said : ' The objectionable policy of broad stop and search without suspicion was wrong in principle and divisive and counterproductive in practice .
' Now that the doomed appeal of the last government has finally been kicked into touch , the continued use of this power will only lead to confusion for police and the public alike . '
Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows the Home Secretary to authorise police to make random searches in areas judged at risk of terrorist attack .
In recent years its use has expanded , with 73,967 whites stopped last year as officers sought to avoid accusations of racial profiling .
Lord Carlile , the Government 's reviewer of terror laws , said : ' I have evidence of cases where the person stopped is so obviously far from any known terrorism profile that , realistically , there is not the slightest possibility of him / her being a terrorist . '
Police insist the power is a useful weapon against terrorism .
But the European judges said it was a breach of the right to privacy , there were not ' adequate legal safeguards against abuse ' , and it might lead to discrimination against ethnic minorities .
In opposition , both the Lib Dems and Tories voiced grave doubts about the power .
But now they say they want to wait until a review of all Labour 's draconian anti-terror laws has been completed before deciding what to do next .
Ministers are given a period of grace by the European court to implement its ruling which , based on previous examples , can last for up to a year , or even longer .
A Home Office spokesman said : ' The Government has already committed to reviewing counter - terrorism legislation , which will include the operation of the section 44 stop and search provisions .
' We are currently giving full consideration to the judgment and its implications . '
The two people who took the test case to Europe , Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton , were awarded £ 30,400 costs , but no damages .
They were detained in 2003 outside the Defence Systems and Equipment International exhibition at the Excel Centre in London Docklands , where there had already been protests and demonstrations .
With the annual Burning Man celebration of art and self - expression four months away , its organizers are taking a second look at their Draconian photo and video policies .
As it is now , the Burning Man Organization requires ticket purchasers to assign to the group the legal rights of photos and video taken at the festival .
That grants the festival the legal standing to order the removal of images taken at the Black Rock City when they appear online .
Burning Man 's organizers say this is so they can control how the content is used commercially .
They also require commercial users to let the organization review and approve any photos or video in advance .
The group says the policy has two " essential " reasons : " To protect our participants so that images that violate their privacy are not displayed , and to prevent companies from using Burning Man to sell products . "
It " affords an opportunity to monitor for uses of footage and imagery that are exploitative of participant privacy or artists ' rights , or are overtly commercial in nature , " says the organization , on its website .
But the policy has been controversial .
" We understand the real challenges BMO faces in trying to preserve its noncommercial , community character , " Corynne McSherry , of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , wrote in a blog post on Friday .
" That said , a benevolent censor is still a censor , and if other event organizers follow suit , assignment and abrogation of rights could become standard Terms of ( Ab) use in all ticket contracts . "
The organization has agreed to accept public comment on the policy , and is currently inviting feedback in advance of its next meeting on April 28 .

But Texas did n't recognize their accreditation , so they filed to get it approved .
Not so surprisingly , scientists and educators rose in protest , and in 2008 the Texas Higher Education Coordination Board -- the organization that grants accreditation -- denied the ICR .
The creationists appealed .
In the meantime , they also tried to extend their ability to grant degrees temporarily while the lawsuit continued .
What happened this week is that the extension as denied .
And I mean denied .
Check out what the court said :
It appears that although the Court has twice required Plaintiff [ the ICR ] to re-plead and set forth a short and plain statement of the relief requested , Plaintiff is entirely unable to file a complaint which is not overly verbose , disjointed , incoherent , maundering , and full of irrelevant information .
That 's not surprising , as that 's the only kind of information the ICR is capable of producing .
Not to mention wrong .
See the Related Posts links below for lots more on the ICR 's recent follies .
As far as I can tell , this defeat means that the ICR is still seeking accreditation , but until and unless it does , it cannot grant degrees in Texas .
So what can be said about this ?
Oh , let me quote one of the pithiest and to - the - point minds of our day : < Nelson Muntz > Haha !</ Nelson Muntz >

Back in the ’70s , BP teamed up with a company called Printabox to bring us BP Offshore Oil Strike , an “ exciting board game for all the family ” which concerns drilling the North Atlantic for oil until it ’s dry and pitting a BP surrogate called “ Hull ” against its oil rivals “ Bergen , ” “ Rotterdam , ” and “ Dieppe , ” which stand in for Amoco , Chevron , and Mobil , respectively .
First player to $ 120 million wins !
But “ exploring for oil , building platforms , and laying pipelines to bring the offshore oil back to the player ’s home company ” is n’t all fun and games :
There are also risks like storms , which can hurt the productivity of your offshore operations , and , more presciently , catastrophic oil spills , which cost the player a small token amount of money to clean up and thereafter forget about :
One “ hazard card ” reads “ Blow - out !
Rig damaged .
Oil slick clean - up costs .
Pay $ 1 million . ”
In the set of Offshore Oil Strike pics below ( courtesy of BoardGameGeek ) , you ’ll see that the game featured a strike indicator which featured “ hazard ! ” “ dry ! ” and “ oil ! ” outputs ; presumably , these outcomes are determined by rolling dice rather than , say , deciding whether or not to install a $ 500,000 acoustic trigger which cancels out the impacts of negative rolls .
For the record , real - world BP has spent more than $ 3 billion attempting to contain the oil spill , and some estimates have pegged the total damage caused by the spill at more than $ 100 billion .
Below , more pics of the weirdly prescient board game :

Looking rather a lot like the remote controlled car I wish I had owned in the 80’s the Yokohama EV Sports Concept HER - 02 Buggy ( bit of a mouthful of a name , I know ) is going to be making an assault on the Pikes Peak Hill Climb , a 12.5 mile , 4,271 foot climb around 156 corners and is hoping to beat its predecessors time of 14:50.754 set last year , incidentally the quickest time for any car is 10:01.408 .
The electric buggy uses an AC motor with twin lithium ion battery packs developed by Sanyo in Japan and is rolling on proprietary Yokohama ADVAN ® ENV - R2 ™ orange oil infused tires that are said to reduce rolling resistance and improve energy efficiency by as much as 20 % .
If you paused for a moment there when you read “ orange oil infused tires ” you are n’t alone , it took us by surprise as well .
Turns out the tires are made using natural rubber and oil from used orange peels in place of petroleum products which makes the tires far easier to recycle and as a bonus , makes them better performers on the road as well .
We ’ll update with a full race video and results when they become available .

The brain and neurological tissue are extremely sensitive regions of the body that are highly susceptible to environmental damage .
To make matters worse , our culture is loaded with brain poison .
Some of the most damaging brain poisons include protein gluten , unfermented soy , blood sugar imbalances , poor posture , & a sedentary lifestyle .
One of the most common nutritional / toxicity issues in our society today deals with gluten .
Gluten is the common protein found in wheat , barley , rye , oats , kamut , & spelt .
According to gluten researcher Kenneth Fine , up to 81 % of our society has a gluten allergy .
When they are exposed to gluten their bodies have differing degrees of inflammatory responses .
Some individuals have mild inflammatory reactions while others have severe reactions .
The most vulnerable tissue to the inflammatory cascade in response to gluten is the brain & nervous system .
The immune molecules that are secreted ( cytokines ) destroy brain tissue and cause massive neurological damage .
The most common symptoms associated with this reaction are " brain fog , " memory problems , and mental fatigue .
Unfermented soy contains many molecules that can be detrimental to cognitive function .
One of soy 's primary isoflavones , genistein , has been shown to inhibit the enzyme tyrosine kinase in the brain .
The highest amounts of tyrosine kinases are found in the hippocampus , a brain region that is essential to learning & memory .
High soy consumption actually blocks this mechanism of memory formation .
Several studies have associated high intakes of tofu and other unfermented soy products to increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairments .
On the flip side , fermented soy products such as tempeh are associated with greater cognitive abilities .
Researchers hypothesize that this is due to the deep fermentation process that removes enzyme inhibitors and phytoestrogens .
In addition , this process increases folate , which is a critical nutrient for brain and nervous system function .
The brain depends on a continual supply of glucose for energy and any imbalance can cause major problems .
A 2003 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people 's memory is harmed by poor blood sugar metabolism .
The slower the sugar metabolism in the body , the less fuel is available for the brain to store memories .
Stable blood sugar levels are critical for healthy brain and neuronal cells that fire quickly and efficiently .
Abnormal blood sugar levels also cause neuronal damage and weaken the protective blood - brain barrier .
This makes for easy passage of different toxins and other particles that will disrupt brain function .
A mechanism for Alzheimer 's disease is that of poor blood sugar metabolism .
This pre-diabetic disorder opens the door in the blood brain barrier for toxic aluminum particles to cross-over and accumulate in the sensitive regions of the temporal lobe .
The brain depends on oxygen and activation from muscle and joint receptors on a continual basis .
A lack of motion equals a lack of oxygen generating energy getting up into the brain .
Poor posture and subluxated spinal vertebrae cause spinal joint receptors to fire abnormal feedback patterns into the brain .
This causes further brain - body feedback problems and disrupted movement patterns in the body .
Chronically poor posture is one of the most detrimental factors for brain function .

– Moland & the French ?
Så kult .
Låter de bra også ?
Dette skal jeg fortelle Tjostolv og Joshua , sier advokat Morten Furuholmen som representerer Moland og French .
Han tror det blir et lyspunkt for de to nordmennene , som torsdag ble dømt til døden i Kongo for tredje gang , å høre at de har inspirert et fremadstormende band i Fredrikstad .

Navn på impuls
Søker du på bandnavnet til søskenbarna Gabriel Arntzen ( 20 ) og Frøydis Dale Arntzen ( 18 ) på Google får du hundretusener av treff .
Men info om bandet forsvinner i mengden av artikler om det siste årets mest omtalte rettsdrama .
– Navnevalget var en impulshandling da vi skulle melde oss på til Ungdommens kulturmønstring , og trengte et navn , sier Gabriel , gitaristen i bandet .
Får mye oppmerksomhet
Sammen med kusinen Frøydis som synger og skriver sangtekster , startet han bandet i januar .
– Hvordan kom dere på dette navnet ?
– Det er en sak som mange snakker om , alle kjenner navnene .
Vi var ute etter et navn som ville få mye oppmerksomhet .
Siden bandet startet som en duo , og Gabriel faktisk er halvt fransk , passet navnet perfekt .
De gikk videre til Fylkesmønstringen i UKM med sine egne låter , og utvidet nylig bandet med bassist og trommis .
Forrige helg spilte de på det store bandarrangementet på St. Croix .
– Rettssaken er komisk
– Sangene våre handler om helt andre ting enn rettssaken i Kongo , sier Gabriel , som mener at han ikke har fulgt noe bedre med i saken enn folk flest .
– Hvordan reagerer folk på navnet ?
– Vi har fått mest latter , og ikke noe negativt .
Hele Kongo - saken har jo hatt et komisk preg .
Rettssaken har ikke akkurat vært helt seriøs , selv om anklagene er alvorlige .
Nå håper det nystartet bandet på å spille flere konserter , og at publikum ikke dømmer dem for hardt .
The mayor of Coppell , Texas , and her daughter were found dead in their home with gunshot wounds to the head , officials in the suburban Dallas city said Tuesday .
Authorities did not disclose a motive for the deaths .
But Mayor Jayne Peters ' home showed no signs of forced entry , the city said in a statement .
Peters and her 19 - year - old daughter , Corinne , were found dead Tuesday evening by officers who had been sent to do a welfare check on the family .
The officers had gone to the home at the request of the city manager 's office after the mayor did not show up for a scheduled council meeting .
This week headlines across the United States screamed that new home sales in the U.S. had declined to the lowest level since the U.S. government began keeping track in 1963 .
But in the news stories covering this data in the mainstream media , they were always very careful to give their readers lots of reasons why things are going to " get back to normal " very soon .
But the truth is that is simply not going to happen .
Right now the United States is heading for another real estate crash .
The only thing that has been holding it back was the huge bribe ( called a tax credit ) that the U.S. government was giving people to buy houses .
Now that the tax credit has expired , there is no artificial incentive to buy homes and the real estate market has fallen through the floor .
Unfortunately , there is every indication that things are going to get even worse .

The digital adverts would scroll when the vehicle is stuck in traffic
California is weighing whether to allow advert - broadcasting digital number plates on vehicles , in a bid to raise revenue for the cash - strapped state .
Drivers could select messages to display and could earn rewards from advertisers that pay the state .
The state senate is considering a bill to allow research into the move .
At least one firm , in San Francisco , is developing an electronic number plate that would scroll adverts while a car is stopped at lights and in congestion .
The company , Smart Plate , holds a patent on the technology but has yet to produce a demonstration model .
" We 're just trying to find creative ways of generating additional revenues , " said Democratic Senator Curren Price of Los Angeles , who introduced the legislation to explore whether to adopt the new plates .
" It 's an exciting marriage of technology with need , and an opportunity to keep California in the forefront . "
Free speech
Under the bill before the state legislature , the California motor vehicles department would have until 2013 to research digital number plates , including the amount of revenue they would raise , restrictions on the messages they display and any impact on traffic safety .
According to a state analysis of the bill , while the vehicle bearing a digital plate is in motion the plate would display the registration number .
But when the vehicle is stopped for four seconds or more , the number would be replaced with a scrolling set of messages including advertisements for private businesses , educational institutions and other organisations that have contracts with the state .
Free speech protections mean it is likely the state would have to accept any " non-obscene " message , but the individual motorist would be able to choose which messages to display .
The plate would be controlled from within the vehicle .
Many US states allow motorists to opt for number plates displaying a religious or political message , such as opposition to abortion rights or support for the military or a sports team .
The California government is currently grappling with a $ 19bn ( £ 12.8 bn ) budget deficit .

In the heart of the city , Martin Avery finds the comedy in all of his troubles .
Your prayers have been answered : Scottish brewery BrewDog , which has pushed the limits of high alcohol by volume beer before , announced this morning that they ’d broken the world record for strongest beer ever with The End of History , a 55 % ABV behemoth that is named for Fukuyama ’s famous work on the future of Western democracy .
Oh , and the beer comes wrapped in taxidermied dead animals .
( Which BrewDog assures us is roadkill . )
BrewDog made only eleven bottles of The End of History ; despite the fact that they sold for either 500 or 700 pounds ( ~$ 800 or $ 1100 US ) , depending on the animal , the beer is already sold out .
While BrewDog ’s high ABV beers , which have previously hit 41 % ABV and 32 % ABV , are a surefire way to draw press attention ( and , apparently , make bank ) , not everyone in the beer world is a fan .
The main reason :
They stretch the definition of ‘ beer . ’
At 55 % ABV , or 110 proof , The End of History is stronger than most vodkas , which are usually around 40 % ABV ( 80 proof ) .
How is that possible ?
Beers , as you know , are produced by fermenting a mash of starch and flavoring , but the yeast used in that fermentation process typically dies off at about the 12 % ABV mark .
As a result , some brewers have developed so - called “ turbo yeast , ” which can withstand alcohol concentrations of as high as 20 % .
But that ’s a long way off from 55 % .
To get that extra distance , BrewDog and its chief competitor in the high - ABV arms race , Kleinbrauerei Schorschbrau , use ice distillation , which takes advantage of alcohol ’s lower freezing point than water to filter out the stuff that is n’t alcohol and build up the concentration .
Ice beers produced using this process like Bud Ice and Molson Ice are common enough and are widely accepted as beer , but distilling as extremely as BrewDog does raises the question of whether the stuff that ’s produced is ‘ beer ’ at all or really just a distilled spirit .
Whichever side you come out on , you ’ve got to grant it to BrewDog that they know how to self - promote .
Here ’s the video they put out announcing The End of History :

Have a tip we should know ?
tips@themarysue.com
I ’ve been using the bleeding edge version of GNOME Shell for some time now .
I ’ve put off coming to quick judgements during that time .
I wanted to get used to it .
Also , it ’s been changing a lot .
Now that I have given the shell some time and now that the implementation has matured , the time has come to come to some conclusions about the current design .
So what ’s the shell like ?
The good news is that GNOME Shell contains some really cool features and has some real quality .
The bad news is that there are a few problematic aspects of its design .
What ’s cool
The activities button .
It ’s a hot corner .
You do n’t have to look at it .
You just throw the mouse into the corner and the overlay pops up .
Muscle memory takes over before long .
Soon you barely have to think about opening the overlay .
It just happens .
Instant search .
GNOME
Shell does much of what GNOME
Do does , enabling fast keyboard based application launching and switching .
It currently only takes me three keystrokes to launch Firefox using GNOME Shell : Super L ( aka the Windows key ) , f , return .
That ’s it .
Pretty cool , huh ?
Messaging .
The messaging tray is one of the more recent additions to the shell .
I really like the concept of the tray .
It gives users the ability to receive and respond to messages without having to switch window .
A little notification peeps up from the bottom of your screen .
If you want to read the full message , you hover over it .
If you want to reply you can type your reply right into the box , all without switching window .
The application menu .
Many GNOME applications have a File menu that contains entries which do n’t have anything to do with files – open a new window , quit , etc .
This bugs the hell out of me .
GNOME
Shell will help to put an end to this sort of thing .
Each app will have an application menu in the Shell , which means that we ’ll get much more logical menus .
We ’ll also get snazzy application loading indications .
This will be a definite improvement to the current desktop .
The application well .
It ’s like a dock , only a bit different .
The use of columns means that the application well can accommodate more items than a dock .
I think the well looks really good , too .
What ’s not so cool
The zoom out animation .
At first I did n’t mind the shift to and from the overlay mode , but I ’ve found it increasingly unenjoyable as time has gone on .
The shift feels jarring and it can be uncomfortable to watch if I ’m tired .
Overlay arrangement .
The representation of workspaces in the overlay leaves large amounts of screen estate unused ( this contributes to the severity of the zooming in and out effect ) and adds complexity to the design .
I ’d really like to see the representation of workspaces removed from the overlay .
This 30 second hack of Jon McCann ‘s beautiful mockup shows what I mean :
Top panel arrangement .
The arrangement of the elements in the Shell ’s top panel seems aesthetically and conceptually awkward to me .
Visually , there ’s little rhythm and large amounts of the screen edge go unused .
Conceptually , the order of Activities button , Application Menu , Clock , System Status and Session Menu seems like a bit of a jumble .
The session menu .
The top right hand corner is one of the most valuable parts of the screen , and yet it has been devoted to the session menu – an item which will be infrequently used .
Also , I ’m unconvinced that most users will understand the idea of a session menu .
I doubt most of them know what a session is even is …
I ’ve personally seen someone struggle for a good long time to find shut down .
Why would you click on something with your name on it to turn off your computer ?!
What happens next ?
GNOME
Shell is a bold project .
This is a good thing ; exactly what GNOME 3 should be about .
The Shell has some brilliant features too ( far more than I ’ve been able to describe in this post ) .
Preventing distraction and helping people to concentrate on the task in hand is a worthy and worthwhile aim that is backed up by strong evidence that users are increasingly suffering from constant distraction .
If the Shell works as intended , it will make its users ’ lives better .
There are issues with the Shell though , and some changes are needed if it is going to succeed .
( The recent proposals made by Seth Nickell need to be taken seriously .
His proposal for the top panel overcomes many of the problems I ’ve outlined above ) .
These changes would n’t be an admission of failure .
Far from it .
They would be a way of building on the excellent work that has already been done and they would be a way of getting people excited about the awesomeness that is already there .
Is Betty White 's burgeoning sex scandal too strange to be true , or too out - of - the - blue to be untrue ?
Miley Cyrus says she 's not " slutty . "
Perez Hilton says his Miley Cyrus upskirt was n't kid porn .
Wednesday 's gossip roundup is open to interpretation .
" Insiders " tell a minor gossip blog that four pictures of Betty White getting railed by late husband and television house Allen Ludden are circulating the sex photo buyers ' market .
( Would any tabloid sink so low ?

The images were supposedly " found " in an abandoned box at Betty 's old house .
It 's farfetched , ridiculous , and too easy — but then , people really like posing for sex pictures , including old people from bygone eras , so there is a microscopic kernel of possibility , I guess .

Description :
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a preparation method for magnetic fluid , especially to oil - based magnetic fluid that absorbs organic material , oil - based material and metal ions inside the fluid .
Then by the application of the magnetic field , the absorbed material is separated from the fluid so as to achieve the purposes of fluid treatment or purification .
2. Description of the Related Art
Magnetic materials have been applied broadly to recording tapes , magnetic materials for memory such as magnetic disks or tapes , building materials such as ink , paint , and mechanical parts such as electromagnetic switches , or seals .
By the development of new preparation method , magnetic materials are applied in more fields such as biomedicine for purification of drugs , protein and DNA or environmental waste treatment .
For example , U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,748 applied in 1987 discloses magnetically responsive spheres having an average diameter less than 1,000 nm , prepared by dissolving a carbohydrate polymer in a polar solvent and being applied to cell separation as well as affinity purification .
Basically , such magnetic separation techniques have two types according to features of material being processed ( 1 ) apply the magnetic field to separate material itself with magnetic properties .
( 2 ) combine material without magnetic properties with magnetic material by chemical reactions and then apply the magnetic field for separation .
In combination of the material without magnetic properties with magnetic material , various types and preparation methods of magnetic material play important roles .
There are various preparation methods for magnetic material according to users ' requirement .
The most common is ( 1 ) grinding : refer to U.S. Pat.
4,604,222 , applied in 1986 , magnetic fluid is prepared by mixing of magnetic particles , dispersing agent such as a cationic surfactant and organic liquid carrier such as an ester or a glycol and then employing a grinding or ball mill technique so as to improve electrical conductivity and seal computer disc drives .
( 2 ) oxidation reaction : such as U.S. Pat.
No. 6,140,001 , applied in 2000 , disclosing a method that mix a solution of a soluble phosphate compound such as sodium orthophosphate with a solution of ferrous ion , and alkali or alkaline hydroxide solution to form ferrous hydroxide .
Then an oxidation step is performed by passing an oxygen - containing gas through the mixture .
Finally , the iron oxide particles of the invention will precipitate from the solution .
( 3 ) chemical coprecipitation : refer to U.S. Pat.
No. 6,743,371 , applied in 2004 , disclosing magnetic fluid prepared by mixture of magnetic sensitive particles such as nickel - zinc ferrite or manganese - zinc ferrite and conductive particles such as gold , silver , copper , aluminum and graphite .
The magnetic fluid is utilized in electrical switching applications .
Because the magnetic particles attract each other and thus aggregate , it is necessary to take surface treatment step during preparation process for effectively separation of particles .
Not only the diameter of particles is smaller , but the particles are more easily to be dispersed inside the solvent .
The ways of surface treatment are different depending on hydrophilic or lipophilic characteristics of the oil - based magnetic fluid being prepared .
As to the preparation of lipophilic oil - based magnetic fluid , refer to U.S. Pat .
No. 5,124,060 , applied in 1992 , a method includes steps of adding the low boiling organic solvent and the dispersant having oleophilic groups to separate particles and heating the resulting material to evaporate the low boiling organic solvent thereby obtaining a magnetic fluid that is applied to seal vacuum apparatus .
Moreover , U.S. Pat. 6,068,785 , applied in 2000 , disclosing a slurry is formed of particles of a non-magnetic oxide of iron ( α - Fe 2 O 3 ) , an oil carrier liquid and a surfactant .
The slurry is then processed in an attrition mill to generate magnetic iron oxide particles for form an oil - based material .
Due to direct grinding operation , oil and surfactant may attach on surface of magnetic particles so as to make the surface coating fall off .
This leads to negative effect on yield rate .
Generally , magnetic fluid is more applied to magnetic materials for memory and design of mechanical seal .
However , it 's seldom used in eliminating organic compounds or oil inside the water and processing metal ions inside the inorganic wastewater .
Conventionally , organic wastewater is processed by heat treating or chemically oxidation .
This not only costs much but also generates secondary wastewater due to addition of chemicals .
As to wastewater with metal ions , besides conventional chemical precipitation , physical treatment methods such as membrane technologies can also be used .
Although there is no addition of chemicals , it requires higher equipment cost and more technical support .
In order to make the oil - based magnetic fluid have lipophilic interface and strong binding force between the magnetic metal oxide particles , the present invention adds surfactant with a carboxyl group during the preparation process of iron oxide so as to generate the magnetic material such as iron oxide with the carboxyl group .
Then , the material further reacts with oil material to form oil - based magnetic fluid by crosslinking reaction .
The bonding between the magnetic material and the compounds is formed by chemical reaction .
Thus the final product has higher bonding force between molecules with better stability .
Thus the oil - based magnetic fluid in accordance with the present invention can react with oils , organic compounds , and metal ions inside water and then being separated by the application of magnetic field .
The present invention has advantages of no addition of chemicals , simple equipment and easy operation .
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a preparation method for oil - based magnetic fluid that combines magnetic material with oil - based material by crosslinking reaction of functional groups to form chemical bonds therebetween .
By the application of magnetic field , the oil - based magnetic fluid absorbs organic compounds or metal ions for separation from solution .
Thus the purposes of fluid treatment or purification are achieved .
It is another object of the present invention to provide a preparation method for oil - based magnetic fluid .
The oil - based magnetic fluid has both magnetism and mobility of fluid .
While being mixed with fluid such as wastewater , the oil - based magnetic fluid absorbing organic material and metal ions is insolvable with water .
During the process of fluid treatment , there is no need to add catalyst , oxidizing agent or other chemicals .
Not only the cost for treatment is saved , but also the recovery process of the catalyst is left out .
At the same time , by magnetism , the oil - based magnetic fluid absorbing organic material and metal ions is separated with water rapidly and it's convenient to operate .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
Refer to FIG .
1 , in step S10 , a diamino compound is added into oleaginous material to form oil - based compound containing diamino group .
Refer to step S12 , the oil - based compound having a carboxyl group and a diamino group is obtained by adding carboxyl compounds into the oil - based material containing a diamino group .
In step S14 , iron solution is mixed with carboxyl compounds to get magnetic iron oxide with a carboxyl group .
Refer to step S16 , the oil - based compound having a carboxyl group and a diamino group is added into the magnetic iron oxide with a carboxyl group so as to obtain the oil - based magnetic fluid with particles whose diameter ranges from 60 to 100 nanometers .
In step S10 , an embodiment is taking as an example .
The compound containing a diamino group such as urea is dissolved into the water .
Then add into the same amount of alcohol so as to make the concentration of the urea become 24 to 30 % weight / volume ratio and the mixture is heated inside the reflux condenser at the temperature ranging from 70 to 90 Celsius degrees and 75 Celsius degrees is the preferable temperature .
Moreover , take some oil ( such as vegetable oil or other organic oils ) and dilute it with equal volume of ethyl acetate .
The diluted oil is dropped into the hot urea solution so as to make the volume ratio between the oil and the urea solution be two .
Continuingly heat the resulting mixture for thirty minutes .
After the solution cooling down to room temperature , wash it with water and centrifugate the solution to get the raw urea synthetic oil .
Repeat the steps of washing and centrifugation several times , the product is urea synthetic oil .
That 's oil - based compound with a diamino group .
Take an embodiment for explanation of step S12 .
The urea synthetic oil is stirred and heated to 85 Celsius degrees in the reflux condenser .
Then slowly add the carboxyl compound solution , such as undecenoic acid , oleic acid , lauric acid , or caproic acid , into the urea synthetic oil until the volume ratio of the carboxyl compound solution to the urea synthetic oil becomes 1/ 5 .
Continuingly heat the resulting mixture for 30 minutes .
Then let it cool down to room temperature , add alcohol into the solution and washing the mixture .
After centrifugation , oil - based material having carboxyl group and urea is obtained .
The oil - based material having carboxyl group and urea made by condensation reaction between the undecenoic acid and an amino - terminal of the urea is an oil - based compound having a carboxyl group and a diamino group .
In step S14 , ferrous chloride and ferric chloride are dissolved inside deoxidized water and the molecular ratio between them is from 1/2 to 1/3 .
The solution is heated to 80 Celsius degrees inside the reflux condenser .
Then slowly add the carboxyl compound solution ( such as undecenoic acid ) about 2.4 % volume ratio into the solution and continuingly heat the solution .
Take an amount of 25 % ammonia water , diluted with equal amount of alcohol and ethyl acetate and pour into solution inside the reflux condenser .
The ammonia water occupies about 20 % of the total volume .
Keep heating at 80 Celsius degrees for thirty minutes .
Then cool down the mixture to 65 Celsius degrees and keeps in this temperature for 5 hours and thirty minutes so as to get the precipitation of magnetic iron powder with a carboxyl group .
Magnetically decant clear supernatant , wash the precipitation with alcohol several times and then preserve in a bit alcohol solution .
Or after decanting clear supernatant , dry the precipitation at room temperature so as to get the magnetic iron powder with a carboxyl group .
That 's magnetic iron oxide coated with a carboxyl group .
In step S16 , add carboxyl urea synthetic oil into magnetic iron powder with a carboxyl group and heat inside the reflux condenser at the temperature from 65 to 80 Celsius degrees for thirty minutes .
The temperature is preferably 85 Celsius degrees .
After washing with alcohol , water , and separation , the stable oil - based magnetic solution is obtained .
The composition of the solution includes iron oxide Fe 3 O 4 .
Refer to FIG .
2 , in the step S20 , mix iron solution with carboxyl compounds so as to obtain magnetic iron oxide with a carboxyl group .
Take the step S22 , mix the carboxyl compounds with organic extraction reagent to get organic extraction solution with a carboxyl group .
In step S24 , mix the magnetic iron oxide with a carboxyl group with the organic extraction solution with carboxyl group , then add the organic extraction solution with oleaginous material into the mixture so as to get oil - based magnetic fluid .
Dissolve 2.78 gm ferrous sulfate in 100 ml pure water and heat the solution to 85 Celsius degrees .
Add 1 ml undecenoic acid into the solution , stir and heat at 85 Celsius degrees inside the reflux condenser .
Add 10 cc 10 % sodium hydroxide into the mixture drop by drop and keep heating the solution at 85 Celsius degrees in the reflux condenser for an hour .
Magnetically decant the solution , wash with acetone for several times , put into the reflux condenser .
Slowly add the mixture of 10 ml tributyl phosphate ( TBP ) with 1 ml undecenoic acid into the reflux condenser and heat for an hour .
Again magnetically decant the solution , wash with acetone for several times , then wash several times again with 30 % solution of tributyl phosphate in kerosene .
Then the product is dispersed inside the 30 % solution of tributyl phosphate in kerosene .
This is oil - based magnetic fluid .
In summary , oil - based magnetic fluid in accordance with the present invention is used in combination with external magnetic field for absorption of floating oil on water surface and separation as well as treatment of organic compounds , metal ions and oil in wastewater .
Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art .
Therefore , the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details , and representative devices shown and described herein .
Accordingly , various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents .
The Five Nutrients
Food is composed of five types of nutrients and they are : proteins , fats , sugars , starches and acids .
Every type of food we eat is composed of all five , but one of these is dominant in each food type .
The dominant nutrient is in greater proportion than the other nutrients contained in that particular food type .
For example the dominant nutrient in steak is protein .
Therefore , steak is considered a protein when being classified as a food type .
It is the nutrient that is in the greatest proportion in that particular food type that programs the entire digestive process after you eats .
Therefore , the protein in steak would be what determines which enzymes will be needed in order to digest the steak properly .
It is essential to know which one is the dominant nutrient in each of the food types we consume , in order to know how to combine it correctly with other food types and this way we can assure ourselves , we have an optimal digestion .
Listing of the Five Nutrients and How They are Processed by the Digestive System
Proteins : Proteins are polymers and they consist of the twenty amino acids .
The number of different proteins derived from amino acids is quite high .
There are eight amino acids that we do not manufacture in our bodies , therefore is essential that we consume foods that supply us with these needed amino acids .
For a food to be considered a protein , the proportion of protein to other nutrients in that food type must be at least ten percent .
Fats :
Include most substances that are insoluble in water and are present in all cells .
In most foods , proteins and fats are usually contained together .
Proteins tend to dominate when in conjunction with fats ; fats are normally a subordinate to proteins .
Sugars :
Are divided into milk sugars and vegetable sugars .
Sugars as well as starches are carbohydrates .
Although , sugars behave differently when combined with other foods than starches do .
Fruits generally have a sugar content of twelve percent ; therefore sugars are a dominant nutrient in fruits .
Milk sugars , on the other hand , have a lower percentage than the sugars in fruits .
Starches : Starches belong to a group known as polysaccharides or complex sugars .
This is an important form of sugar found in plant cells .
It is a dominant nutrient in seeds and grasses like buckwheat .
Starches are of the highest importance in terms of the food we consume .
A large proportion of the world ’s staple diets consist of mostly starches .
Acids :
They normally have a lower ph value due to their higher degree of acidity .
These are the acids that can cause the salivary enzyme ptyalin to slow down and cause the body to produce more gastric juices .
Acidic foods include vinegar , wine vinegar and brewer ’s yeast .
How Digestion Works
The digestive system is comprised of the alimentary canal , which is the long track that begins at the mouth and ends at the anus .
The process of digestion is basically one of decomposition .
It is the process of breaking down various substances into their basic constituents .
Digestion takes place with the aid of enzymes that are the catalyst that promote the biochemical process of breaking down the food and turning them into you .
Digestion begins in the mouth , aided by the salivary glands .
From the mouth the food goes down the tubular passage , referred to as the esophagus .
The food then travels from the esophagus to the stomach .
The stomach is a J shaped organ that fills gradually and the food is then layered in the stomach , the bottom layer is composed of what you eat first , and each subsequent layer is composed of the rest of the food you eat .
Here in the stomach the food is mixed with gastric juices and kneaded by the muscles of the stomach wall .
Bile is secreted by the gallbladder in order to emulsify fats .
The pancreas also secretes three fluids that are for digesting fats , carbohydrate and proteins .
The food then goes to the small intestine , here the elements are broken down and absorbed through the intestinal wall , leaving waste matters and water to go further .
The absorbed nutrients are taken to the bloodstream to the liver , where they are further processed .
The function of the large intestine is critical for completing digestion .
In the large intestine water and other fluids are removed from the waste matter , and feces are formed and compacted and finally extracted through the anus .
There you have the digestive process , in a nutshell .
For the past half - century , I have been reading and studying the sources of Hasidism with both affection and respect .
I have worked as a historian of Hasidic thought and , more recently , as a theologian trying to construct a contemporary Judaism on the basis of Hasidic insights .
Like the Hasidic master Pinhas of Korzec , who once thanked God that his soul came into the world after the Zohar was revealed “ because the Zohar kept me a Jew , ” I know that I owe my own Judaism primarily to the Baal Shem Tov and his followers .
Over this same time period , however , I have looked with growing dismay at contemporary Hasidism and the various positions it has taken on matters of concern to all Jews .
The latest , and most ridiculously degrading , incident is the flap about Ashkenazic - Sephardic integration that is convulsing Israel .
At the center of the current furor is the ultra-Orthodox Beit Yaakov school in the West Bank town of Immanuel , where mostly Sephardic girls were literally walled and fenced off from the mostly Ashkenazic girls in the school ’s Hasidic track , with religious differences offered as the justification .
I laughed and cried when reading that , in order to attend the school ’s Hasidic track , Sephardic girls were required to daven , even at home , using the Ashkenazic pronunciation of Hebrew .
How many recall that the Hasidim ( themselves Ashkenazim ) were once fiercely denounced for adopting Sephardic versions of Jewish prayers , then thought to reflect a higher level of sanctity ?
What happened to Hasidism ?
How did a daring and innovative movement for the spiritual regeneration of Judaism turn into a hard core of embittered defenders of a lost past , squabbling constantly among themselves , producing headline - grabbing violators of Jewish ethical norms , and viewing the outside world as entirely defiled and hostile ?
To understand how Hasidism went astray , we need to know its history , including some flaws that were present from the outset .
The goal of the Baal Shem Tov ’s followers was a Jewish life refocused on such essentials as the love of God , the joy of living out God ’s commandments and the faith that divinity was to be found everywhere .
The Jew ’s task was to seek sparks of holiness throughout creation and to return them to their root , meanwhile celebrating the privilege of this life of holiness .
Divinity was to be found in fields and forests , in the letters of the Torah , and in the Jewish heart .
Left out of the equation was the non-Jewish human community in whose midst the Hasidim lived .
It is easy to say that Polish and Ukrainian Christianity , filled with anti-Semitic stereotypes , dehumanized the Jew , and we merely returned the favor .
But the history is more complex .
The view that gentiles are less fully human than Jews , even said to be lacking the divine soul , had ancient roots in kabbalistic tradition .
Sadly , that bit of racist Jewish folklore is alive among the Hasidim ( and a few others ! ) even today .
Although it should have nothing to do with internal Jewish divisions , since the unity of Jews is also a cardinal principle , we know that the stain of racism is one that tends to spread .
Two other developments that led to the decline and even degeneration of Hasidism can be attributed to decisions made in the course of its history .
The first is dynastic leadership .
The idea that a holy man ’s charisma could be passed down to sons and grandsons — instead of the obvious , and more inherently Jewish , choice of master - to - disciple — began in a few key families of Hasidic lineage at the turn of the 19th century .
The grandsons and great - grandsons of Hasidic tzaddikim quarreled with one another over loyalties , over doctrines , but especially over money .
As the numbers of dynastic claimants swelled , the movement came to be seen as characterized by pettiness and increasingly weak and uninspired leadership .
While a few great latter - day figures proved exceptions , the rule was that the quality and originality of those at Hasidism ’s helm was already in sharp decline over a hundred years ago .
The second development stems from the Hasidic movement ’s response to modernity .
When the brash new Hasidic movement first appeared on the stage of history , the rabbinic leadership of Eastern Europe , famously including the Vilna Gaon , was outraged .
For 30 years , beginning in 1772 , these mitnagdim — Hasidism ’s “ opponents ” — would excommunicate anyone who had anything to do with the Hasidim .
But by 1810 , the rabbinic leadership began to feel the pressure of a much more dangerous enemy , that of Haskalah , or Jewish enlightenment .
The rabbinic leaders then made common cause with the Hasidim to fight modernity .
The Hasidim , anxious to please their one - time persecutors , enthusiastically led the charge .
The Baal Shem Tov ’s world - embracing legacy was turned into a weapon with which to bludgeon anyone who dared deviate , whether in religious practice , educational views or even in style of dress , from the norms of the 18th century .
This is the Hasidism that got carried forward into succeeding generations .
As the struggle became fiercer , especially once it involved governmental pressures , Hasidic anti-modernism turned spiteful , justifying techniques of resistance that are no source of pride .
By the 20th century , the battle was mostly lost , and children of Hasidim by the drove were turning toward various secular Jewish movements , including Zionism .
The surviving Hasidic movement then turned toward politics , creating the Agudat Yisrael movement and other bodies that sought to defend the ever - receding turf of Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox domination .
World War I , the terrible pogroms that followed it and Sovietization ravaged Hasidism in Eastern Europe .
Hitler did the rest .
By 1945 there seemed to be almost nothing left .
Then the most remarkable period of Hasidic history began to unfold .
Out of the Holocaust ’s ashes , the community began to rebuild itself .
The fiercely anti-Zionist Satmar rebbe , Joel Teitelbaum , re-created a large chunk of pre-war Hungary in Williamsburg and Jerusalem .
The surviving Bobover scion , Solomon Halberstam , who had lost nearly all of his following , reached out to surviving Hasidim who had lost their own rebbes to re-build Galicia , first in Crown Heights , then in Boro Park .
The Lubavitchers had an active underground network that was keeping some sparks of Torah alive in the Soviet Union .
The Lubavitchers — eventually followed by the Bratslavers — reached out , often with some success , to the children of modern Jews .
The Gerer and Belzer rebbes , both rescued in the midst of the Holocaust , rebuilt their empires around grand fortresses in Jerusalem , then conquered ever - larger swaths of Israel .
All of this happened with the support of other Jews , very prominently including the government of Israel .
We were all deeply moved and impressed by the faith - energy displayed by this old - new Jewish community , committed to reconstituting itself in new and uncomfortable surroundings .
Impressive natural increase , in contrast to the rest of us remarkably infertile Jews , helped the postwar Hasidim regain significant numerical representation within world Jewry .
Israeli military draft exemption laws worked to create a huge society of largely idle Hasidic males , supposedly full - time Torah students , a phenomenon completely unlike anything in earlier Hasidic history .
With Hasidim accustomed to viewing all outsiders through the lens of Eastern European hostilities , the Hasidism that has emerged is a strange combination of inner-directed love and joy , an inheritance from the movement ’s first period ; uncompromising and often hysterical degrees of ultra-Orthodox extremism , combined with shrill denunciations of all other Jews , coming from the second era of Hasidic history ; and disdain for the non-Jewish world , the legacy of persecutions old and new .
Of course , there are still sparks of holiness to be found among the Hasidim .
There are young people at the edges of Hasidism still concerned with the real struggle for avodat Hashem , true worship .
But most of the movement is pure imitation and entrenchment in the past .
As the Kotzker rebbe taught long ago , a Hasid by dint of imitation is an imitation Hasid .
How shall we who love Hasidism , who still pore over such writings as the “ Kedushat Levi ” or the “ Sefat Emet ” to find inspiration , relate to the narrowly exclusivist , self - righteous and intolerant version of Judaism that is one face of contemporary Hasidism ?
The answer is that we need to rescue the Baal Shem Tov from his latter - day followers .
The religion of today ’s Hasidim , themselves victims of a tragic and complex history , cannot be allowed to stand as Hasidism ’s only legacy .
Rabbi Arthur Green is rector of the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College .
He is the author of “ Radical Judaism : Rethinking God and Tradition ” ( Yale University Press ) .
BRITAIN'S military chiefs have been at daggers - drawn for much of this year .
Now they are thinking about cutting into real flesh as they debate the Strategic Defence and Security Review , due in October .
This is driven mainly by cost- cutting , “ the absolute mother of horrors of a spending review ” , as Liam Fox , the defence secretary , put it recently .
According to the whisperings from the Ministry of Defence the army may have to give up whole brigades , armoured formations and artillery units ; the air force is considering abandoning maritime surveillance aircraft and retiring its fleet of Tornado strike aircraft and Harrier jump - jets ; the navy may be made to give up the Royal Marines and amphibious landing ships ; and the submarines carrying the nuclear deterrent may be cut from four to three .
Some central decisions are likely to be taken in the coming days .
Ministers first have to decide what kind of power Britain aspires to be : become a more or less insular country minding its own business , or remain some kind of global force able to intervene in far - flung parts of the world ?
Civil servants have drawn up three broad categories for the national security council to consider today .
At one end is “ Vigilant Britain ” , which sets itself a smallish set of military tasks to defend the homeland : protect its airspace and national waters , fight terrorists at home , though still retaining the semblance of a world - wide diplomatic network , the ability to stage short , small - scale interventions ( usually in “ permissive ” environments ) and a nuclear deterrent .
At the other extreme is “ Committed Britain ” , with roughly the capabilities it has now : a blue - water navy , and deep strike air force and substantial deployable forces able to wage a major war in distant places .
Inevitably , the likeliest option seems to be the middle road , “ Adaptable Britain ” , though someone will probably think up a snazzier label .
Turning such a choice into brigades , squadrons and naval task forces is the job of a second meeting , this time of the Ministry of Defence , expected at the weekend .
This will start trying to reconcile the level of military ambition with the “ envelopes ” sent by the Treasury to the MoD seeking options for cuts of 10 % and 20 % .
A logical process would have Britain set out its objectives , then decide the means it requires and then set the level of funding .
The political reality pushes in the other direction : the money available determines the level of ambition .
So the bureaucratic machine will spin around and around : the government will set a scaled - back ambition because it knows money is short , then the MoD will crunch the numbers and conclude that it cannot be achieved with the funds available .
The ambitions will be pared back further and the equipment recalculated , and so on , in an “ iterative ” process .
One complication is that the three categories confuse as much as they elucidate .
A vigilant Britain could be a well - equipped fortress or a demilitarised Iceland ( depending on whether it thinks Russia will ever be a threat ) ; a committed Britain has to decide if it only wants to do short , sharp “ Day One ” operations , or whether it is prepared to stay in hostile places years after the original intervention , as in Afghanistan .
Another complication is that the MoD is not starting with a clean slate .
Most of its equipment budget is already taken up with existing programmes , commissioned long ago with bills to be paid for years to come .
These include aircraft carriers , Typhoon and Joint Strike Fighters , nuclear submarines that may or may not be relevant to today 's recalibrated needs .
So in parallel to the philosophical discussion about Britain 's place in the world is a grittier process of asking what can be given up with least pain .
Each service is being asked to suggest what can be done with cuts of 10 % and 20 % .
Hence the latest round of leaks .
This too feeds into the ministerial discussion : regardless of what kind of global posture the government wants to adopt , will it really risk killing off shipyards by eliminating half - built aircraft carriers or submarines ?
As always , each service defends its corner : the army says wars of the future will look much like Afghanistan , requiring plenty of “ boots on the ground ” ; the navy emphasises Britain 's history as a maritime trading nation , and the importance of securing the sea-lanes ; the air force says that without air power soldiers and sailors alike will be dangerous exposed .
There is a grim irony , therefore , about the review 's set - up : each service 's claims are being examined by senior officers of the other two .
And in case anyone thought this was not a cost - cutting exercise , officials from the Treasury are sitting in all the key meetings .

The concept plane is due to begin flight trials in 2011
The Ministry of Defence has unveiled its prototype unmanned combat air vehicle ( UCAV ) .
Taranis is a concept design for a long - range strike plane that has taken over three million man hours to produce .
Defence Minister Gerald Howarth said it was a " truly trailblazing project " and featured " the best of our nation 's advanced design and technology " .
The aircraft is due to begin flight trials early next year .
Named after the Celtic god of thunder , Taranis is the first step in the development of unmanned strike aircraft , capable of penetrating enemy territory .
Unmanned aircraft carrying weapons are already used in service , such as the MQ - 1 Predator which carries Hellfire missiles , although these are only suitable for use where the airspace is under allied control .
" This is the next generation of combat aircraft and flight trials will begin next year , " Sqn Ldr Bruno Wood told BBC News .
" It 's a technology demonstrator that could be used as a testbed which may form further potential solutions to the RAF , " he added .
Drop the pilot
The issue of " writing the pilot " out of the aircraft equation has long been a controversial topic , more so since the first unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) went into active service .
It is accepted that the most vulnerable part of a plane is the pilot .
While the airframe is capable of pulling multiple Gs - the gravitational force exerted on a body when standing on the Earth at sea level - the maximum safe level for a pilot , even when wearing a protective G - suit , is 8 or 9 , above which they will lose consciousness .
Also , many anti-aircraft missiles are designed to explode near the cockpit , showering the vulnerable pilot with high - speed shrapnel that can cause death or injury .
Peter Felstead , editor of Jane 's Defence Weekly , told BBC News that the development of UAVs paralleled the development of the first manned aircraft during World War I .
" First they were used for reconnaissance , then they were armed for bombing and ground attack missions and they eventually became air - to - air combat craft , " he said .
" This is the first step for the UK .
This is n't an aircraft that will go into service , it 's a tech demo , but it will prove technologies , demonstrate capabilities and inform the direction we [ the UK ] are going in . "
' Human control '
However , Mr Felstead stressed that while we would see greater development of ground attack UAVs , there would always be the need for a pilot with a " Mk I eyeball " when it came to air - to - air combat .
" If you have , say , an airliner that is reportedly hijacked , you are going to need that human factor to evaluate just what 's going on with the plane , what he can see through the windows and everything else .
That 's not something , for now , that can be done remotely . "
The MoD also stressed that all weaponised UAVs were under human control .
" Should such systems enter into service , they will at all times be under the control of highly trained military crews on the ground , " it said in a statement .

Canon EF 70-200 mm f/4.0 L USM
Lens Mug Review
Like the Canon EF 1200 mm f/5.6 L USM Lens , the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens Mug was introduced at a major Olympic event - the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics in this case .
As a member of the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm L Lens family and as part of the new Canon Beverage Delivery System ( BDS ) , the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens Mug arrived to certain popularity and importance in Canon 's lineup .
And of course , a review was in order .
Because of its popularity , initial copies of the 70 - 200 mm Lens Mug were very hard to obtain - and multiple test copies were definitely warranted for this important product .
Five Canon lens mugs , all purchased retail , were tested for this review .
My lens mugs arrived in the boxes seen below - with only a plastic bag protecting the product inside the box .
This is certainly below par for Canon L Lens product packaging and subsequently , one of my mugs has a slight ding in the inner barrel .
A 1 - Page manual with usual warnings is the other included item in the box .
Overall , this is a very sharp looking mug .
This is not surprising , as the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens Mug employs the same great optics as the Canon Extension Tubes .
A manual aperture lens ( shown below in a wide open aperture setting ) , the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens Mug likes to be used with a wide open aperture - and does not get any better stopped down .
In addition to the wide open aperture , intentional lens breathing ( hole ) is visible in the above pic .
This is a weather - sealed lens , but a filter is required for complete sealing due to the features shown above .
I thought this was going to be the first dishwasher - safe Canon L Lens , but alas , the manual warns against this practice .
The " 67 mm " friction - fit lens cap is included with the Canon lens mug .
As you can see , Canon continues to use the side - pinch - only design for this lens mug .
This is an Ultrasonic Ultrasonic lens mug - and in this case , ultrasonic describes the sound you make when drinking an overheated beverage .
I had no focusing issues with this lens - I was autofocused on the lens full time as long as desired liquid remained inside .
Since this is a fixed focus distance lens , Canon was able to utilize an innovative stick - on focus distance window .

Lens
Mug 's build quality is good , but not excellent .
It has the red L ring , but the build quality is indeed a little lite for this class .
To be fair , so is the price .
The mug features a steel ( stainless in this case ) inner barrel as seen below .
The outer barrel is a quality plastic and the ribbed 1.5 " ( 38.9 mm ) zoom ring and 1 " ( 25.8 mm ) focus ring are rubber .
There is no play in the lens , the barrel does not extend with focusing or zooming and the switches are remarkably solid .
Canon has taken the switch design one step past recessed to completely missing on this lens .
As seen in the rotation of images above , one copy of my 70 - 200 mm Lens Mug shows some asymmetry due to a lens mount installation defect .
The lens mug features a new - for - L - Lens rubber , non -skid lens mount .
The appearance and physical dimensions of the 70 - 200 mm Lens Mug are remarkably close to the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens .
Review the similarities :

Mug lens cap adds another .9 oz ( 25g ) to the weight for a very light empty , ready - to - use weight of 7.8 oz ( 220g ) .
In actual use , the lens mug becomes a variable weight product , starting at 23.2 oz ( 660g ) when filled with liquid .
The 1 x 3 " ( 26 x 76.3 mm ) cap adds .6 " ( 14.8 mm ) of length to the overall in -use length .
This is a very comfortable to use size and weight .
Here is another look at these two lenses :
This lens mug is not stabilized .
The lens cap helps a lot , but the ultimate cup holder is an even better solution : The Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens Mug is compatible with Canon Tripod Mount Ring A II .
Mount a Wimberley P20 Lens Plate to the Tripod Ring and Mount it to your Arca - Swiss - compatible ball head on a solid tripod and you have the ultimate cup holder to match the ultimate mug .
Do n't be fooled - the lens barrel says " Made in Japan " , but Canon outsourced manufacturing of this exotic lens to China .
Lens collectors will definitely want a copy of this one in their personal collections .
The big question is , where can you buy this lens mug as the new Canon BDS is not stocked by conventional photo retailers .
I 'll direct the buy button to EBay where you can , of course , find anything .
Note that there are knock - offs floating around this site .
The Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM
Lens Mug is definitely challenging the Canon EF 100 mm f/2.8 L IS USM Macro Lens for my most - fun - per - dollar Canon lens rating .
I anxiously await the Canon EF 400 mm f/2.8 L Lens Beverage Cooler .
Have fun !
There some very humorous individuals among us - this review has generated a lot of fun email .
I 'll share the email Jeff Tallent sent :
Hi Bryan ,
As per my regular visits to your site , I just ran across your amazing review of the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4.0 L USM Lens Mug .
Yet another stunning addition to Canon 's reputable 70 - 200 mm lineup .
As you are familiar with many of my prior e-mails , I 'm once again faced with a new debacle : choosing the new 70 - 200 f/2.8 L II IS USM or the Lens Mug .
I 'm sure you can see my plight .
However , I did notice that there were several things missing from the review .
Looking at the dimension and weight chart , I would have to say that this is arguably one of the most hand - holdable L - series products to date and should occupy a space outside of any camera enthusiast 's bag .
I say ' outside ' since we would n't want the stainless steel barrel to become distorted by the other lenses inside .
Naturally .
The uses for this ' lens ' are incredibly versatile , from indoor sporting events to landscape and wildlife photography .
Its low - light performance is also remarkable , although in very low - light conditions , extra caution should be taken when moving about the area with hot contents inside .
I am surprised that Canon did not release this ' L ' as an IS version .
I suppose we will have to use less caffeinated contents or wait for the Mk. II version for this feature .
I just hope it will be tripod - sensing and wo n't " jump " when first holding the aperture open .
I did notice that in certain uses , the lens will get warm .
I heard this is normal .
Also , the removal of the UD and fluorite lens elements actually make a significant improvement in chromatic aberration and vignetting is non-existent when used with both full - frame and APS - C ' bodies ' .
I did notice the appearance of some CA when used with certain contents , but it was only temporary and was completely gone after an hour .
I would n't recommend this practice , however .
I was wondering though , if the aperture was constant across the full focal range as designated .
And I also wanted to know if the lens was parfocal .
I 'm sure bokeh would n't be as dreamy with this product as the f /2.8 , but I heard that mocha could result in a comparable sensation .
Ok , that was lame .
Anyhow , Canon has set the bar with this ' L ' .
It is definitely the most affordable of the ' L ' series although it loses its resale value over time but this is understandable .
I hope to acquire one soon .
Thanks for reading !
I hope you enjoyed my additions as much as I enjoyed reading your review of the mug .
Very entertaining !
Jeff
Roger Cicala ( LensRentals.com ) has discovered a no-additional - cost source for Canon lens mugs :
I would add though , that for those who do n't want to pay the high prices being asked on eBay , it is not to hard to not only make your own lens mug from existing lenses you have around the house .
The do - it - yourself method allows you to make mugs in various sizes - and mugs that can serve in other useful capacities .
After some trial and error , I 've found it usually is best to drop the lens , sans hood , face down on a concrete floor from about 4 feet .
The remaining work takes little time and can be accomplished with some sturdy pliers and a bit of superglue .
I 'm sure Roger 's creative method voids the manufacturer 's warranty .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 28 , 2010
National Lawyers Guild ( NLG )
In the wake of the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayohis , the mainstream United States media published a slew of stories condemning the so - called human rights violations that led to his hunger strike .
While Tamayo's death is a tragic occurrence , such factual misrepresentation compounds the tragedy by exploiting the death for political ends .

Australian Privacy Commissioner Karen Curtis has issued a muted statement in reaction to a proposal — dubbed “ OzLog ” online — by the Federal Attorney - General ’s Department which could see Australians ’ email and telephone records tracked by internet service providers .
“ My office was consulted by the Attorney - General ’s Department on this proposal last year as part of initial consultations including with industry , ” said Curtis .
“ At this stage , we understand the government is still considering the matter and we look forward to providing further comment as the proposal is developed . ”
The Privacy Commissioner said in general , limiting the amount of information collected and the length of time it was retained was good privacy practice , however she added that under Australian legislation “ it is important to balance other community interests such as public safety and national security with privacy considerations . ”
“ My office would also expect that any proposed legislation would have the appropriate privacy safeguards built - in , ” she said .
Curtis ’ statement came in reaction to a number of questions sent by Delimiter to her office on the issue , which arose on Friday after the Attorney - General ’s Department confirmed it had been examining the European Directive on Data Retention to consider whether it would be beneficial for Australia to adopt a similar regime .
The directive requires telcos to record data such as the source , destination and timing of all emails and telephone calls – even including internet telephony .
ZDNet.com.au has also quoted ISP sources stating that the proposal could go as far as tracking Australians ’ web browsing history — a claim since denied by the office of Federal Attorney - General Robert McLelland .
The questions sent by Delimiter asked Curtis to give her opinion on whether the Attorney - General ’s proposal had the potential to contain privacy risks , but also general questions on how seriously the potential privacy risks were associated with the automatic storage of email information such as “ to ” and “ from ” addresses .
Curtis did not directly address some of the questions .

ARTHUR :
Recently , NHL.com asked two scouts , one from the Western Conference and one from the Eastern Conference , to compose their own mock draft boards .
The Western scout said the Ducks should select Riley Sheahan , whom he gave Getzlaf - ian potential , at 12th , and the Eastern scout said we should pick Kirill Kabanov at 12th , reasoning that with two picks , you gotta gamble on what could be a homerun .
Now , I do n't usually give much creedence to the NHL.com draft boards , but I went out of my way to call these picks insightful ( read depressing ) on The OC Register message boards , because they key in on a rather peculiar trait that Director of Amateur Scouting Martin Madden put on display last year : he 's not afraid of Anti-hype .
When the Ducks selected Peter Holland and Kyle Palmieri , both had run into some draft - year issues : Gare Joyce reported that Peter Holland , who had already gotten a " consistency issues " tag from scouts , interviewed poorly at the Combine and Kyle Palmieri was surrounded by off - ice trouble .
Still , Madden and Murray picked both players where they projected before whispers of anti-hype surrounded them .
And that penchant for the ' homerun pick , ' that tendency to go for players that have only one thing , sometimes only one off - ice thing , going against them was true for the entire Ducks board last year : Igor Bobkov ( lacking in technique ) , Sami Vatanen ( lacking in size ) and Radolsav Illo ( lacking in draft year playing time ) .
Unfortunately , it 's too early to tell if these baseballs have left the park .
But Holland and Palmieri specifically have n't defied critics since leaving the Draft stage .
Holland faced his first major injury this year , but when he did play , it was troubling how much line chemistry seemed to be the cause and the cure for his production troubles .
Palmieri found some new and more serious off - ice trouble that may put his future at Notre Dame into doubt .
And sitting next to Palmieri in that squad car ?
Why , it 's the aforementioned Riley " future Getzlaf " Sheahan .
In an interview with USCHO today , Sheahan said he is trying to move on from the embarrassing incident , and for Sheahan , who was not accused of resisting arrest like Palmieri , that certainly seems possible .
Ultimately , though , his on - ice issues create the bigger risk .
Unlike Kabanov , I did n't see Sheahan projected at 12th all that often this season , and that 's mostly due to a less than prolific campaign with Notre Dame .
He flashed the occasional scoring chance , but even if there was n't an embarrassing arrest to smooth over , 12th would mean the team really liked him , not that he was the best player available at that spot .
The idea of picking Kirill Kabanov at 12th was once a given , but it now seems ludicrous , especially after The Hockey News reported today that he and CAA agent J.P. Barry are parting ways .
For those not following Kabanov 's story , since extricating himself from the KHL , he 's now managed to get dropped by Moncton of the QMJHL , the Russian national team and CAA .
But a quote by Tim Burke seems to put things in perspective :
" The kid 's got a gift , he can score goals , " San Jose Sharks Director of Scouting Tim Burke told NHL.com .
" Sometimes with goal scorers you have to put up with that a little bit . " - ibid
After getting swept by the Blackhawks and starving without a first - round pick for two years , the Sharks now sit 28th in the Draft order .
And while Burke may not be tipping his hand , he could be echoing a sentiment felt by many of the teams that pick before the Ducks ' 29th / 30th position .
So the danger is n't so much that Martin Madden will value Kabanov or Sheahan at 12th best in the pool , but that he 'll be keen on picking one of them and wo n't think they 'll drop to 29/30 .
For my money , even at 29/30 , these players seem like a risky pick , but I would have picked John Moore or Jordan Schroeder ahead of Peter Holland , so you really can't go by me .
Madden 's a guy who likes to like the guys that nobody likes .
Right now , those guys are Kabanov and Sheahan .
Marijuana gives people with schizophrenia a quick rush but worsens their psychotic symptoms within a few hours , a new study reveals .
Researchers in the Netherlands recruited 48 psychiatric patients and 47 healthy people to record what they were doing and how they felt 12 times a day for six days .
All the study participants were regular pot smokers .
The results showed that schizophrenia sufferers were more sensitive than healthy individuals to both the positive and negative effects of marijuana , or cannabis .
" People feel better when they use cannabis , and that 's logical , because otherwise they would n't use cannabis , " said study researcher Cecile Henquet of Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands .
" In spite of that , in the long run it 's not so good for their psychotic symptoms . "
Researchers have long wondered whether the mentally ill are using reefer to alleviate the classic symptoms of the disease : delusions , hallucinations and jumbled thoughts .
The new studies turn that reasoning on its head , said Deepak Cyril D'Souza , a psychiatrist at Yale University who was not involved in the study .
" What the data clearly show are that , if anything , the core symptoms of schizophrenia actually get worse after using cannabis , " he said .
The results , published in the June issue of the British Journal of Psychiatry , help explain previous findings that people with schizophrenia who smoke marijuana require more hospitalization , respond less well to medication and have more trouble with memory tests .
Henquet said therapists have these facts in mind when they advise their mentally ill patients not to get high .
Instead , she said , therapists may need to explore the positive effects with their patients and then get them to acknowledge the downside .
D'Souza said schizophrenics do n't anticipate that after the positive effects of getting high wear off , their hallucinations get worse .
" Showing people with schizophrenia this pattern might help them think about [ the risks of ] using cannabis , " he said .
The new study is further evidence of the tangled relationship between marijuana and schizophrenia .
Researchers know that getting high can trigger schizophrenic symptoms in people who are at risk for mental illness .
The culprit is most likely the signature ingredient of pot , the chemical delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC .
In laboratory studies , people who ingest THC experience psychotic symptoms .
According to one estimate , if marijuana use were eliminated in the U.K. , where the THC content of the drug is reportedly very high , the rate of schizophrenia would decrease by 8 percent to 14 percent .
Henquet said it 's likely that marijuana triggers schizophrenic symptoms in people who have genetic mutations that sensitize them to the drug 's psychotic effects .
Oddly enough , some evidence suggests that a second marijuana component called cannabidiol actually has antipsychotic effects .
D'Souza said he and other researchers are testing whether administering cannabidiol by itself can alleviate psychotic symptoms .
" If there 's enough evidence to support it 's use as an antipsychotic , " he said , " then that might be one way of getting people to stop using cannabis . "
In my my last article I discussed how difficult it can be for unknown bands to book college shows .
In this article , I ’d like to give you some insights into how to do it , with some help from two other former college bookers : Jonelli Gordon , former concerts chair at NYU Program Board from 2004 to 2006 and Sam Welch , former booking agent of the Friday Night Rock group at Dartmouth College .
How to Contact a Booker
The first and obviously most important step in this process is finding a college booker .
If you do n’t know any college bookers , contact someone at the student union .
They will put you in contact with whoever books shows .
When you get a contact , send an e-mail with these essentials : your name , your band ’s name , and a link to your music ( preferably downloadable ) that ’s a contemporary reflection of your music .
For Sam , who set up lots of small shows which allowed him the freedom to book lesser - known bands , “ A short , succinct e-mail saying who you are with a link to few streaming or ( preferably ) downloadable tracks is just about the best thing you can do .
“ For me , the best chance for a band I had n’t yet heard of was if they got a song into my headphones .
The easier they made that , the more likely they were to get booked .
No long e-mails outlining everything they ’ve done so far , not links to blog posts their friends wrote on their Geocities pages or whatever , just a few songs and an email address . ”
Do n’t Be a Jerk
If they get back to you , be willing and easy to work with .
When you negotiate , be reasonable .
If a booking agent has responded to your music , they want the show to happen .
Since these are students not responsible for turning a profit , they will try to give you what you want – within reason .
If you ’re looking for more money , frame it in terms like “ This is what we need to make the show happen ! ” instead of “ If you want us to do this shit , here ’s what we want . ”
But remember : “ Once you ’ve been booked , do n’t forget , that ’s not where the interaction ends , ” Sam stressed .
“ For fuck ’s sake : Show up on time , call if you ’ll be late , be nice to the sound guy , and throw a few ‘ Please ’s and ‘ Thanks ’ in there , ” Sam said .
“ Not to sound like a mom here , but after dealing with more than a few pissed , ‘ I ’m too cool for this shit ’ bands , I made it a POINT to not recommend them to other venues or people .
Just … be nice , if you can . ”
Be An Awesome , Dependable Opener
Often , I ’d book an established , well - known band and think :
Who will open ?
The typical scenario , as Jonelli put it : “ A few times the band wanted to bring someone they were touring with along , other times we just went with local bands .
Sometimes the booking agent would make suggestions from their roster . ”
About half the time , openers are up to the booker , so being in her good graces and close by can get you a show .
On college campuses , bookers use popular campus bands to draw crowds and keep them in the room for the headliner .
Even if you ’re not a student band , if you have a local following from playing gigs in town , whether at house parties or at bars , you can get booked .
If a booker or bartender at a local bar can verify that people come to see your band play , you ’re much more likely to get a gig .
Booking local bands is a win - win - win for the booker .
The local band gets stage time and free beer , the headliner gets a bigger crowd for their set , and the booker gets a packed house and a happy headliner .
The more a booker likes you , the more the booker will depend on you , which will give you more opportunities to play that campus .
Instead of just being another slot for a booker to fill , a good relationship with her becomes a chance to hook a friend ’s band up .
So make an effort to meet people who book shows through other musicians and friends , and once you do , make a good impression .
“ Willingness to work around schedule conflicts , willingness to travel , and willingness to play for cheap , ” are all crucial , Sam said .
“ Flexible bands were a lot more likely to get a slot ! ”
So do n’t forget :
A free t- shirt or CD always leaves a great taste in a booker ’s mouth .
Of course , the easiest way to get booked is to have the bookers come to you .
Consider how you find music – talking to friends , listening to radio , going to shows , and reading websites and magazines .
If a booker comes to you , you ’re in the driver ’s seat .
But if you ’re not lucky enough to light up the blogosphere or know someone booking shows , you ’ll have to do it this old fashioned way .
But if you contact bookers consistently and courteously , you do have a shot at getting a show .
WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday approved the most extensive overhaul of financial - sector regulation since the 1930s , hoping to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis that hit the U.S. economy starting in 2007 .
The legislation passed the Senate 59 to 39 and must now be reconciled with a similar bill passed by the House of Representatives in December , before it can be sent to President Barack Obama to be signed into law .

King Abdullah wants to wipe Israel and Iran off the map
Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah probably refrained from expressing at least half this sentiment in his meeting today with President Obama : On June 5 , he reportedly told French Defense Minister Hervé Morin that " There are two countries in the world that do not deserve to exist : Iran and Israel . "
The scoop comes from Georges Malbrunot , a French journalist with Le Figaro .
Malbrunot , a respected Middle East correspondent who spent four months as a hostage of the Islamic Army in Iraq , goes on to report that two sources , from diplomatic and military circles , have confirmed the story .
He suggests that the anger directed as Israel was the result of the IDF raid on the Gaza - bound flotilla , which occurred just days before this outburst .
( Hat tip goes to the eagle - eyed correspondents at Friday Lunch Club ) .
Update :
Of course , the White House statement following the Obama - Abdullah meeting reaffirmed both leaders ’ sincerest hope that the current round of proximity talks will lead to " two states living side - by - side in peace and security . "
On January 26 , 2010 , the UK's Lord Lucas of Crudwell and Dingwall —yes , it 's a real title — stood up and told his fellow peers in the House of Lords that the new crop of anti-P2P " settle or we 'll sue your trousers off " warning letters were a travesty of justice .
" In a civil procedure on a technical matter , it amounts to blackmail , " thundered the libertarian lord - slash - blogger .
" The cost of defending one of these things is reckoned to be £ 10,000 .
You can get away with asking for £ 500 or £ 1,000 and be paid on most occasions without any effort having to be made to really establish guilt .
It is straightforward legal blackmail . "
The US has had limited experience with the more " entrepreneurial " sorts of copyright lawyers , the ones who send out tens of thousands of letters and threaten expensive prosecutions if alleged P2P users do n't settle first for a significant fee .
Most such letters on this side of the Atlantic Ocean have come from trade groups like the RIAA who were more interested in education and deterrence than profits ( and who actually brought hundreds of cases when people did not choose to settle ) .
But the UK has had much longer experience with small law firms who go into the business as a way to " monetize " P2P ( and make a load of cash for themselves ) .
The best known of the lot is currently ACS Law , a firm run by one Andrew Crossley .
Crossley 's modus operandi mirrors the work currently being done in the US by lawyers like Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver : track IP addresses in BitTorrent swarms , unmask the identities behind them , then send stern letters demanding immediate payouts or tough prosecutions will ensue .
Crossley claimed in April to have pulled in more than £ 1 million to date through the scheme .
As such letters start to rain down on people across the US , it 's worth a look at the reaction to nearly identical ACS Law tactics from the UK to see how this might play out on our shores .
Does anyone actually get sued ?
ACS Law remains controversial for many reasons .
Many defendants have claimed innocence , and MPs and Lords have been bombarded by constituent complaints about the firm .
The methodology for identifying infringers comes from a Swiss firm and remains ... less than fully transparent .
And , notably , ACS Law does n't seem interested in filing actual lawsuits .
In January , the BBC noted that despite thousands of letters , ACS Law had yet to sue anyone .
This makes the entire operation look like " intimidate into easy settlement " rather than " stand up for my rights in court . "
The accusation stings Andrew Crossley of ACS Law , who once claimed that he got into law because he had been a DJ for 25 years and thought law a way into the music business .
In a blog post in May , Crossley painted his reticence to sue in a more noble light .
" It is suggested that I never issue any claims , " he wrote .
" This is not true .
It is fair and correct to say that I try to avoid litigation wherever possible and exhaust all other avenues falling short of litigation prior to proceedings being issued , but proceedings have been and will continue to be issued in appropriate cases .
Litigation has always been the final option in the processes I invoke on behalf of my clients and the number and frequency of such actions is shortly to increase significantly . "
Whatever the case , Crossley 's tactics have outraged some members of the House of Lords .
While debating the Digital Economy bill that passed earlier this year , spirited debate broke out about dealing with companies like ACS Law .
Lord Lucas even introduced an amendment called " Remedy for groundless threats of copyright infringement proceedings . "
" This amendment arose as another attempt to deal with the problem caused by ACS Law and others in their harassment of people with allegations that they have downloaded copyright[ed ] material , " he said on January 20 .
" This would have the benefit of providing a defense against law firms — doubtless the Minister has received as many e-mails and letters as I have concerning the activities of this particular firm — that just repeat endless allegations and threats , with no intention that I can see of actually going to court .
It would give their victims some means of biting back ; it would take only one in 100 victims to do so and bring a successful court case to bring this practice to an end . "
Depression , stroke , blindness
Crossley and his firm face legal problems over their work .
Complaints have poured in to the Solicitors Regulation Authority , which controls lawyers in England and Wales .
An SRA case against Crossley is pending over his letter - writing campaign , though he declared in April , " I have faith that the SRA will remain implacable and objective throughout its deliberations .
The facts , processes , procedures and compliance should be the focus of their investigation , not the remonstrations of less than 3 percent of those to whom my firm has written . "
Crossley has been in trouble with regulators before .
In 2002 , the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal ordered him to pay £ 1,250 .
In a separate incident in 2006 ( PDF ) , the Tribunal demanded he " pay a fine of £ 1,000 , such penalty to be forfeit to Her Majesty the Queen . "
He also had to pay costs of £ 3,348.75 .
In both of these cases , Crossley had not submitted an accountant 's yearly report on his firm — needed under UK rules to show that a lawyer does not improperly hang on to client funds .
The problem appeared to stem from a lack of funds .
At one point , he told the tribunal handling his case that his lack of paperwork was " because he had been unable to raise the money to pay the accountant who retained the papers . "
Crossley suffered " an extended period of clinical depression in 1999 " and then a stroke in 2000 .
" The effect of the stroke , which caused him to lose his sight altogether for a brief period , was that the Respondent could not work full - time for a period and as a consequence he quickly got into financial difficulties . "
This helps to explain his lack of filing in 1999 and 2000 .
As for the missing filings in 2002 and 2003 , those were because his financial problems continued through the middle of 2004 .
By 2008 , Crossley was doing better .
He had founded ACS Law and ended up representing people like Vince Acors , the British telecom exec who became an international news item when he was accused of having sex on a Dubai beach .
( If you 're ever in Dubai , do n't do this . )
At some point after this , Crossley decided to go into the settlement letter business .
The first letters went out in mid-2009 and Crossley claims to have pulled in more than £ 1 million in the year since .
That may have helped with the finances , but it did n't do much for his public relations effort — you know it 's bad when even the major music labels tell the BBC , " We do n't favor the approach taken by ACS Law to tackle illegal file - sharing . "
ACS Law has stirred up so much anger that entire blogs are now dedicated to trashing the firm , and the major consumer group Which ? has taken to running stories about Crossley and others engaged in the same business .
In January , Which ?
noted that it had " heard from more than 150 consumers who believed they had been wrongly accused . "
One letter writer told Which ? , " My 78 year - old father yesterday received a letter from ACS law demanding £ 500 for a porn file he is alleged to have downloaded .
He does n’t even know what file sharing or bittorrent is so has certainly not done this himself or given anyone else permission to use his computer to do such a thing . "
Crossley has also threatened those who disparage him , even in the US .
Earlier this year , he threatened to sue website Slyck.com for defamation after a forum poster referred to ACS Law's " five point plan " as a " wank plan . "
The EFF got involved and told Crossley to go pound sand .
And the negative reactions are n't restricted to consumer groups and outraged Internet users .
They extend even to the House of Lords , where several peers used debate time this year to make clear just how much they dislike ACS Law and its tactics .
All those earlier amendments you thought were extreme ?
They were nothing compared to these .
Gotta hand it to Don McLeroy .
He certainly has the courage of his convictions .
With the Texas Board of Education scheduled to vote on the revamped curricula this week , the board member certainly has n’t been laying awake at night wondering if perhaps he and his fellow far - right conservatives might have gone a bit too far in some of the proposed social studies amendments — like , say , taking Thomas Jefferson out of class discussions of writings of the Enlightenment and replacing him with two theologians .
Nope .
McLeroy must have been sleeping like a baby .
Because last week the staunch conservative and young earth creationist has proposed a flurry of amendments including :
Having students contrast the Founding Fathers ’ original intent related to the wording of the First Amendment ’s freedom of religion clauses to the phrase “ separation of church and state . ”
McLeroy ’s justification for proposing the measure , he writes , is to “ stimulate critical thinking as to the actual wording in the First Amendment . ”
But of course , for literalists like McLeroy , the critical thinking ends at the discovery that nowhere in the Constitution does it say “ separation of church and state . ”
In addition to his 11th - hour attempt to require students to learn that the founders intended to create a theocracy , he has also proposed :
Putting increased emphasis on the studying of the Declaration of Independence “ at the same level ” as the Constitution .
As I ’ve written before , the board ’s conservative - voting bloc wants to equate the Declaration with the Constitution in order to foster the notion of American exceptionalism ( God loves me more because I ’m an American ) and the idea that we are a Christian nation .
The problem is that nowhere in the Constitution is God mentioned , but in the Declaration , Jefferson refers to a creator as well as “ the laws of nature and nature ’s God . ”
In a discussion of civil rights , McLeroy wants to remove the 1948 case of Delgado v. Bastrop , which barred segregation of students of Mexican descent in Texas public schools , and replace it with the 2009 case of Ricci v. DeStafano , in which white firefighters sued over Connecticut hiring practices , and the 2005 case of Kelo v. City of New London , which dealt with government powers of eminent domain .
McLeroy also wants to downplay Progressive Era reforms and said reformers like Upton Sinclair , Susan B. Anthony , Ida B. Wells and W.E.B. DuBois as well as modern historians are “ obsessed with oppression . ”
Also , he wants students to “ discuss alternatives regarding long term entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare , given the decreasing worker to retiree ratio . ”
The board is scheduled to vote on these amendments this week as well as the whole kit-and - caboodle of previous curriculum revisions .
Stay tuned .
It should be an interesting week .

Far Cry 2 is one of two spiritual sequels to Far Cry ( the other being Crysis , made by Crytek , the original developers ) .
A sequel in name only , it does not follow on from Far Cry 's storyline , instead taking the player to a fictional African country wracked by civil war , tasking them with hunting down and killing an arms dealer called " The Jackal " who has been selling weapons to both sides .
Things quickly get more complicated , however , and the player is soon doing missions for the temporarily at - peace factions as a hired gun .
As well as a substantial list of not - particularly - realistic firearms , Far Cry 2 boasts an open world map covering over fifty square kilometres ( split into two 5x5 maps ) , dynamic fire effects , a continuous day / night cycle , and really annoying checkpoints .
The following weapons appear in the video game Far Cry 2 :
Far Cry 2 ( 2008 ) ( 2008 )
Overview
" Get out of this Wiki you are a knife . "
" I made you a door , boss . " " Get out of this Wiki you are a knife . "
Far Cry 2's weapons are split into a four - slot system , corresponding to the four directions of a 360 or PS3 controller 's D - pad .
The first is the player 's melee weapon ; in reference to Far Cry , this is a large machete .
Two additional skins can be downloaded for it , but the player has no choice as to what goes in this slot ; it is always a machete of some kind .
The three other slots accommodate whatever weapons the player has in their respective category ; one primary , one secondary , and one special weapon can be carried at a time , as well as two types of grenade .
Enemy weapons can be picked up , but weapons in Far Cry 2 have simulated wear and enemy weapons are always in the worst condition possible , so this is usually only a good idea in extreme circumstances .
Weapons in poor condition are able to jam , which requires a press of the reload button to clear ; some of the explosive - firing weapons instead misfire , with the shot going violently off - target or dropping dangerously close to the player .
In the end , if the player hangs on to a weapon for long enough it will fail , in a spectacular and generally deeply ridiculous manner .
Jam animations always happen instead of a shot being fired , while failures always happen after the shot fires normally , resulting in some very bizarre occurrences such as a weapon blowing up only after cycling its action completely or misfeeding despite cycling correctly after the preceding shot .
Getting new weapons requires the player to do missions for the Arms Dealer , a shady character who apparently wants to corner the market on driving trucks in circles endlessly ; he sends out the player to deal with any rivals attempting to drive their own trucks in circles , and adds weapons to the list of available ones every time one of these bizarre errands is complete ; only half can be completed in the Northern map , after which he vanishes without explanation , only reappearing when the Southern map is unlocked .
The player pays him for specific weapons in African Conflict Diamonds found in briefcases around the map or earned through completing missions , paying via a website ; it 's best not to think how that 's supposed to work .
The Arms Dealer then makes the bought weapon available in his warehouses , several of which are placed in the two maps ; after buying a weapon , an infinite number of brand - new weapons of that type can be acquired from any warehouse .
In addition , he offers upgrades to the amount of ammo the player can carry , crates allowing weapons to be put in storage and retrieved at safe houses , and per-weapon upgrades which increase a weapon 's accuracy or decrease jam rate ; these are explained to be " technical manuals " the player character simply has to buy to gain all knowledge from .
Secondary Weapons
There are nine secondary weapons available , from the expected sidearms through SMGs , explosives and even a grenade launcher .
The complete secondary weapon wall in the Arms Dealer 's warehouse .
Star Model -P
The Star Model - P , a Spanish M1911 clone , appears as the " Star .45 . "
It is the first weapon the player character is given , after The Jackal threatens them with it .
Since the secondary weapon slot in Far Cry 2 can accommodate remote bombs , a grenade launcher or a submachine gun , it is n't something the player is likely to hang on to , though it 's common among mercenaries as a sidearm .
Despite the game specifically noting it as a .45 , the weapon shares ammo with the two Makarovs and the Desert Eagle , making it the world 's first .45 also chambered in .365 and .50 Action Express .
Like all the handguns , it has an eight round magazine .

The Star .45 features a reload obviously inspired by action movies ;

In an ideal world , an assassination should not end with you flat on your back with malaria while your target holds your gun , reads your orders to you , and then makes fun of you for being useless .
The Star .45 jams ; taken from an enemy and fired repeatedly , the Star will actually blow up before it has jammed even once ; seemingly , a particular gun 's chance of jamming is partly based on how long the player has been carrying that specific gun .
Here Frank is left tugging on the slide until the player prompts him to do so more forcefully .
The Star .45 blows up ; the slide and hammer fly off and the magazine drops out ; there 's just enough time to notice the gun has no magazine well before Frank discards it .
Makarov PM
The Makarov PM is the second regular pistol in the game , and really is n't that different to the Star .45 in practical terms ; slightly less powerful and more accurate , but overall still a questionable choice compared to other secondary weapons .
Makarov PM - 9x18 mm Makarov .
The one in - game has a standard Makarov rear sight and a two - tone finish .

Pressing the button pulls it back sharply enough to actually clear the jam .
The Makarov blows up ; that is indeed the hammer about to subject Frank to a life of pirate jokes .
Makarov PB
The Makarov PB , known by its " 6P9 " GRAU designation , is a modified Makarov PM with an integral two - part suppressor , the rear part of which is fixed around the barrel ; unusually for an integrally suppressed weapon , the 6P9 can be safely fired without the front part of the suppressor attached , though the result is much louder .
The weapon is called the " Silenced Makarov 6P9 " in - game .
The only suppressed weapon available in the secondary slot , it can be useful if the player is sure they 'll need to be quiet , but is rather situational .

But at least it did n't -
IMI Desert Eagle
Referred to as the " Eagle.50 " ( with a missing space ) on the Arms Dealer 's computer , the IMI Desert Eagle is the sidearm of most of the " buddy " characters the player can recruit as allies .
The most powerful of the four pistols by a considerable margin , it wears out extremely quickly and fires slowly compared to the others , but is extremely accurate , and since almost every enemy carries a pistol as a sidearm , the player is unlikely to run out of ammo for very long .
The game says the Desert Eagle is chambered for .50 AE , but it has an eight round magazine like the other pistols ; in reality , this is only seen on the .44 Desert Eagle .
The Desert Eagle is also used if the player chooses to execute a wounded buddy ; some players will find this an emotional , saddening moment , while the rest will wish they were allowed to use the M79 instead .
Magnum Research / Israeli Military Industries Desert Eagle - .50 AE
Frank holds the " Eagle.50 " as he examines a fuel stockpile ; this is ammunition for the flamethrower , molotovs and flare gun .
Note the Desert Eagle has an abnormally tiny hammer and a backwards rear sight .

The Desert Eagle blows up ; note the weapon is massively more detailed internally than the other handguns , including a visible magazine well ; this is also the only handgun failure animation where the hammer does n't fly off .
Ingram MAC -10
The MAC - 10 is the weaker and less accurate of the two SMGs in the secondary slot ; it 's the only one available in the Northern map , and useful if the rest of the player 's chosen weapons are n't geared for fighting up close ; the rapid rate of fire and 30 - round magazine go some way to making up for the terrible accuracy and weak power per shot .
Enemy snipers and soldiers with rocket launchers tend to carry one of the two SMGs as their back - up weapon .

IMI Uzi
The Uzi is the second of the two secondary SMGs , and other than durability is better than the Ingram in every way ; while it fires more slowly , the result is a much more accurate and controllable weapon .
Enemy snipers and rocket launcher troops are likely to carry this in the Southern map , though sometimes they will still have an Ingram .
It has a 30 - round magazine , much like the Ingram .
IMI Uzi - 9 mm .

The Uzi fails ; the charging handle flies up into the air and the magazine falls out .
Number 4 Mark 1 Flaregun
A single - shot signal flare gun can be used by the player and is seen in the hands of some enemies ; while they use it when alerted to call for reinforcements , for the player it is only useful as a means of starting fires from a distance .
Oddly , it uses the same ammunition as the flamethrower and molotovs , which is depicted as a 20 - litre plastic can of fuel .
How this transforms into a magnesium flare in a metal casing is unclear .
The flaregun does n't appear to have a jam animation or misfire ( or even an idle animation ) ; it 's possible that sometimes it misfires and flares fail to ignite , though there may be other causes of this .
Number 4 Mk 1 flaregun - 1.5 in .
Far Cry 2 .

Frank uses the iron sight of the flaregun as he looks over a completed safe house ; finishing buddy missions provides upgrades , until every safe house on the map spawns a truck with a Mk 19 , a medkit inside the building , and stockpiles of all three types of ammo .
A fired flare detonates .
While not hugely useful as a direct - fire weapon , a few flares can level an entire checkpoint with the fires they cause .
Frank reloads his flaregun .
The flaregun as it's intended to be used , ie how nobody in their right mind would use it in this game .
The second " proper " use of the flaregun is to provide illumination at night ; it 's actually extremely bad at this , since the flare does n't produce an enormous amount of light .
In the unlikely event that the player actually holds on to a flaregun for long enough , this happens .
Enemy soldiers killed in vehicles do not drop weapons , and seemingly have yet to decide what sidearm they should carry , leading to this abomination being found in their holster .
IEDs
Far Cry 2's improvised explosive devices are essentially crude remotely triggered bombs made from one of three types of explosive device , a cell phone , duct tape , a battery and some randomly placed transistors .
They can be placed on the ground or attached to objects by standing close to them ; placing one will automatically switch to the detonator , but more can be placed by pressing the aim button to switch back to the explosives .
These explosives are so improvised they come as a mass - produced kit .

M79
The M79 grenade launcher is the most powerful projectile weapon in the secondary slot ; a single - shot grenade launcher which fires shots in a long arcing trajectory , it destroys any object in the game in a single hit and has an extremely wide splash radius ; a few shots will easily annihilate a checkpoint .
M79 Grenade Launcher - 40 mm .

The front of the weapon then leaps over Frank 's shoulder to freedom ; either that or a howitzer has just snuck up on him .
Primary Weapons
The twelve primary weapons are the mainstay of a player 's arsenal , as a rule ; assault rifles , sniper rifles and shotguns are found in this slot , as well as an inexplicable grenade launcher .
The completed primary weapon wall in the Arms Dealer 's warehouse .
Heckler & Koch MP5SD
Without the Fortunes Pack DLC , the H&K MP5SD , referred to in - game as the " Silent MP - 5 , " is the only suppressed weapon in the primary slot ; regardless , it is the only SMG in that slot , and unsurprisingly is therefore extremely weak compared to the assault rifles and sniper rifles it is placed alongside .
A rapid rate of fire and a 30 - round magazine go some way to making up for its shortcomings .

Ithaca Model 37 long barrel
The Ithaca 37 is one of the cheapest weapons in the game , and one of the first available to buy at the Arms Dealer .
It is referred to in the pause menu and on the Arms Dealer 's computer as the " Homeland 37 , " implying it is supposed to be an Ithaca 37 " Homeland Security " version ; however , the weapon itself is actually the long - barreled hunting version .
While the Ithaca 37's most distinctive feature is the combined loading and ejection port , the Far Cry 2 version lacks this , and instead has a separate side ejection port .
It has a six - round internal magazine , half that of the other two shotguns ; coupled with the relatively slow pump-action , this leaves it distinctly inferior to the others .

Franchi SPAS -12
The Franchi SPAS - 12 is the second of the three shotguns in the normal game 's primary slot , and the most balanced between rate of fire and rate of wear .
It fires in semi-auto mode only and holds 12 rounds compared to the real weapon 's 8 .

Daewoo USAS -12
The Daewoo USAS - 12 is a South Korean - made combat shotgun capable of semi-automatic and fully - automatic fire , and can first be found in a Northern safe house ; however , it cannot be acquired from the Arms Dealer until his missions in the South are unlocked .
Despite having the 20 - round drum magazine , it only holds 12 rounds .
It wears out incredibly quickly , starting to jam after only a handful of reloads , but is useful when a lot of enemies will be encountered at close range as the weapon 's firepower is overwhelming .
The jam animation is a misfeed ; the player character will try to deal with this by fiddling with the cocking handle and thumping the opposite side of the receiver until prompted to actually pull the cocking handle by the player .

Heckler & Koch G3A4
The Heckler & Koch G3A4 ( which in - game is incorrectly called the G3KA4 , the carbine version of the H&K G3 ) is the first assault rifle the player will encounter , and is used by many of the soldiers in the Northern map .
It 's a middle - of - the - road weapon , not really excelling at anything but being dependable enough for the early game and relatively cheap .
Like all the assault rifles , it holds 30 rounds per magazine ( even though it 's using 20 round magazines ) , and oddly , it is much weaker than FAL even though they use the exact same round .
The jam animation shows the weapon 's bolt sticking closed ; the player character attempts to operate the cocking lever , then hits the side of the weapon several times for no good reason , then fiddles with the magazine .

Jam animation ;

The G3A4 blows up ; like the USAS , the whole front end comes off .
AK - 47
The AK - 47 is a common sight in the game , and features quite prominently on the box art ; it is also seen frequently on posters and crates .
It does not have a compensator , and therefore is not an AKM .
The game also features a number of hidden " gold " AK - 47s , which are identical to the normal AK - 47s save a gold retexture on metal parts and removed stocks ; these are much more durable than regular AKs .
It 's possible these weapons are a reference to the custom gold AK from the movie Lord of War .
The gun model itself is quite off from the real thing ; it has the rectangular depression of a milled AK47 , but the metal stampings of an AKM .
Kalashnikov AK47 - 7.62x39 mm .

FN FAL
The FN FAL is called the " FAL Paratrooper " by the Arms Dealer 's computer and the in - game menus ; this is odd , since it is shown with a fixed stock , not the folding stock of the Paratrooper variant .
It can be found in the hands of some soldiers in the North , but does n't actually become available to buy until the Southern map is unlocked .
A reliable and accurate rifle , it is a solid choice for general use .
It also somehow holds 30 rounds in a 20 round magazine ...

" Armalite AR - 16 "
This is an essentially fictional AR - 15 based rifle labeled as an AR - 16 possibly to maintain a common calibre with the other assault rifles , ignoring that one of them already is n't chambered for the same cartridge as the other two .
The real AR - 16 never got out of the prototype phase , being the 7.62 mm forerunner of the AR - 18 rifle , and has very little in common with the weapon seen in game .
The " AR - 16 " in Far Cry 2 has single shot and burst fire modes , with a short tap of the trigger firing a single shot while a longer press fires a three - round burst .
The weapon has a flat - top receiver with a mounted Truglo 1x30 Green Dot Sight , with a jungle pattern camouflage forearm and stock .
Ahead of this is an FN FAL - style carrying handle , and it also has a H&K - like front sight .

The AR - 16 jams ; Frank removes the magazine and holds it against the handguard with his left thumb , retracts the charging handle and examines the chamber ; when prompted , he uses the forward assist to correct the misfed round , before replacing the magazine .
Failure animation ; after such an involved jam clearing , it makes perfect sense to forget that the front of a rifle needs a hole in it for bullets to get into the barrel .
Springfield M1903A4
The Springfield M1903A4 is the first sniper rifle available to the player , and often seen in the hands of enemy snipers .
It incorrectly reloads with a stripper clip inserted into a hole in front of the trigger guard instead of having the user load rounds one by one into the breech as the real M1903A4 requires , and has a five - round internal magazine .
The reload also has player character insert the stripper clip into the rifle , which is preceded by them removing a completely full stripper clip from the underside of the action as if it is an empty magazine .
The scope has a duplex crosshair reticle ; the player is able to keep the rifle scoped after firing , but can't operate the bolt like this .
The jam animation is the bolt sticking ; like all jam animations , this triggers before the weapon fires , which makes precious little sense since the preceding shot will have shown the bolt being successfully operated .
The failure animation has the gun blow up , emitting a large cloud of thick grey - white smoke ; it 's then discarded .

How it generates enough gas pressure to eject the bolt clear of the frame with an unsealed hole in the bottom of the action is anyone 's guess .
SVD Dragunov
The SVD Dragunov is the first semi-automatic sniper rifle available to the player , and one of the last set of weapons unlocked through doing the Arms Dealer 's missions in the North .
The SVD is one of the most useful primary weapons , and is better than the Springfield in most regards .
The SVD reloads and fires more quickly and has a ten - round magazine to the Springfield 's five , while the difference in damage is negligible ; it is less reliable , but not nearly as much so as the AS50 .
It features a highly inaccurate representation of the PSO - 1 scope reticle .
The model in Far Cry 2 appears to be a hybrid of the SVD and the FPK / PSL Sniper Rifle , sharing the X - shaped stamping on the magazine the latter rifle has , and having similar twin holes halfway up the side of the forend .
This SVD also , for no good reason , has a three - prong open - front flash suppressor like an early M16 .

Accuracy International AS - 50
The Accuracy International AS50 is a British - made anti-materiel rifle chambered for .50 BMG , and has a five - round magazine like the Springfield ; it is a semi-auto , with the rate of fire falling about halfway between that of the Springfield and SVD .
It is the most powerful sniper rifle in the game and the least durable , and is equipped with an illuminated mil - dot scope with a stadiametric rangefinder .
This distorts slightly immediately after firing .
The failure animation shows the barrel defying physics in order to make one final lunge at the operator 's skull for not knowing how to maintain a firearm .

Milkor MGL Mk 1L
Perhaps the strangest weapon in the primary slot , this version of the Milkor MGL is equipped with a scope with a precision plex reticle .
It only holds 4 rounds in the cylinder compared to the real MGL 's six .
It is a devastating weapon in certain situations , but the MGL is n't something the player can use as a mainstay of their weapon setup due to the low ammo limit , frequent reloads and unsuitability for short - ranged combat .
It does , however , make Far Cry 2 probably the only game in history where the player has three weapon slots and they can all be grenade launchers .
The jam animation has the cylinder emit a metallic shriek and fail to rotate properly ; the player character flips the weapon upside - down and tries to force it .
The failure animation has the weapon , um , split completely in half .

Special Weapons
The seven special weapons are for the most part heavy weapons ; rocket launchers , machine guns and so on , with the sole exception being a CO2 - powered dart gun .
The complete special weapons wall at the Arms Dealer 's warehouse .
" Tranquilizer Rifle "
The " Tranquilizer Rifle " is a version of the Remington 700 , most closely resembling an M40 ; it has additional components from the Pneu - Dart Model 389 tranquilizer gun , a single - shot dartgun powered by .22 " primer load " rounds in a detachable magazine .
It has the gas regulator tube of the latter weapon , but the barrel is at the same level it would be on a normal rifle .
The in - game weapon is a CO2 - powered single shot dart gun , fitted with a sight which appears to be based on the Bushnell - manufactured scopes used on Dan - Inject JM Standard tranquilizer guns ; it 's the only sniper weapon in the special / heavy weapon slot .
It can be surmised that the tranquilizer is not something intended for use on humans ; a hit anywhere will kill the target instantly , and also kick up a spray of blood as with the normal rifles ; odd behaviour for a dartgun .

On the Model 389 this is the magazine for the " primer " rounds which propel the dart , but it is never swapped out in - game and the sounds used imply the version in - game is CO2 - powered .
Despite the different scope model , the Tranquilizer Rifle uses exactly the same reticle as the M1903A4 .
And it 's doubtful that 's what a Tranquilizer dart is supposed to do , really .

PKM
The PK machine gun is the first of the game 's two machine guns , and the only one available to buy in the North ; the model in Far Cry 2 has the newer flash hider .
It feeds from the left and has an ejection port on the right ; this is a reversal of the normal configuration of the weapon , which in real life actually does eject spent casings to the left .
As in a lot of video games , the recoil of the PKM is exaggerated when standing , to the point the weapon is uncontrollable ; with both machine guns , without the accuracy upgrade the muzzle climb is so extreme the player can end up firing straight up if they do n't try to fight it .
In reality , the PKM 's slow rate of fire ( roughly 600 RPM ) allows for controlled full auto shooting even when firing from the shoulder .
Like the SAW , the PKM uses a 100 - round belt .

Pressing the button shows a solid whack was all it needed .
In the failure animation all that pointless whacking of the top cover comes back to haunt Frank .
FN M249 SAW
The M249 SAW is seen in both man portable and emplaced versions .
While handheld the M249 will never overheat no matter how long it 's fired for , but has incredible muzzle climb and limited ammunition .
In this configuration it uses a 100 - round belt box which appears to be made of metal .
The jam animation shows the top cover popping open ; rather than open it all the way to find out why , the player character just tries to slam it closed .
The failure animation has the hinge fail and the whole top cover break off .

The SAW jams ; both the jam and failure animations are essentially recycled from the PKM .
The handheld SAW fails ; once again the top cover goes flying and the belt box falls off .
RPG -7
The RPG - 7 is the first rocket launcher the player can access , available from the Arms Dealer after his missions in the North are completed .
In real life the rocket goes a lot faster than it does in the game , usually at around 295 metres per second , and does not have a smoke trail .
It also self - destructs at maximum range ; the Far Cry 2 version instead has the motor cut out and the rocket fall in a ballistic arc , allowing it to be used like a mortar .
The " jam " animation in this case is a misfire where the rocket 's booster charge ignites but the motor does n't correctly , leaving the rocket spinning in circles on the ground a couple of yards right in front of the player .
Needless to say , when it does this the self - destruct works just fine .

Which goes roughly as anyone would expect it to .
The reload animation presumably has the base of the launcher resting on the ground , given the player is left looking at the muzzle : of somewhat more concern is that the tail assembly of the rocket is exposed , meaning this rocket 's booster charge has already detonated and it could not be fired .
quite as far as he might have hoped .
Misfire : as Frank completes a reload , he finds the previous round did n't travelas far as he might have hoped .
The RPG - 7's foregrip breaks off in the failure animation .
Note that it has no upper surface ; the player character holds it up to the screen briefly , showing it also has transparent internal surfaces and making the player wonder why their attention is being drawn to this .
Carl Gustav
The Carl Gustav recoilless rifle is a Swedish - made 84 mm launcher produced by Saab - Bofors ; in real life it is an unguided recoilless grenade launcher with some rocket - boosted rounds available .
In Far Cry 2 it is depicted as a laser - guided missile launcher with projectiles so manoeuvrable they can turn right around in mid air if the sight is pointed at the user 's feet and return to hit him , and is equipped with a scope with a circle reticle .
The missile can also be manually detonated if the player presses fire again while it is in flight ; normally , this will just start the empty launcher 's reload animation , but if a missile is in the air it will detonate as the animation starts .
The " jam " animation is a misfire similar to that of the RPG - 7 ; the guidance seems to fail just after launch ; the smoke trail turns black , and the missile veers sharply off - course , detonating on impact .
The failure animation has the hinged rear venturi tube break off , after which the player character throws the weapon away .

A brand new Carl Gustav ; it 's difficult to tell when the weaponlow - condition , given it always looks ten minutes from falling apart .
The first Carl Gustav in the game is as ever found in a Northern safe house in the worst possible condition .
Scope of the Carl Gustav .
It 's easy to justify the decision to pick it up even in this state ; it 's longer ranged than the RPG - 7 and vastly more accurate .
Reloading the Carl Gustav .
Unlike other weapons , the reload has to be triggered manually , either by trying to fire the weapon again or pressing the reload key .
The Carl Gustav has simulated backblast ; not good for the careless operator in a game with dynamic fire .
The backblast is also instantly fatal to enemies , allowing a player with no suitable short - ranged weapon to use it as a makeshift flamethrower by turning around .
The Carl Gustav 's missiles turn incredibly quickly ; here , Frank has fooled one into orbiting a tree .
The missile seeks the first thing that intersects a line drawn from the middle of the crosshair , even if there is no way it could actually draw a line of sight to the object being pointed at .
The missiles will only seek targets when the player is looking down the scope ; otherwise , they just travel in a straight line .
In addition to guided missiles , this particular Carl Gustav also has the ability for the user to detonate missiles at will .
Misfire : the missile suddenly decides its target is on the other side of the road .
It 's lucky nobody is around to arrest it for jaywalking .
Failure animation of the Carl Gustav .
Amazingly , it does n't explode .
Norinco Type 63
The Norinco Type 63 60 mm light mortar is one of the harder weapons in the game to use effectively , but one of the most powerful .
By default it fires a marker round that produces harmless smoke , but pressing the reload button switches to the high explosive rounds ; this is rather poorly documented , and many players using the mortar for the first time have trouble figuring out why it does n't do anything .
The mortar can also cause an extremely bizarre glitch if the player is in a boat which is hit by a shot from one ; the impact will catapult the boat miles into the air , where it will become permanently stuck , as will the player .

LPO -50 Flamethrower
The LPO - 50 flamethrower is a Russian - made weapon which featured prominently in Far Cry 2's publicity due to focus on the game 's dynamic fire effects .
While promotional images show it almost correctly as tube resembling a rifle without a magazine hooked up to a backpack containing three fuel tanks , the in - game model appears to be a jury - rigged version built to operate with no backpack .
It instead has a single fuel tank and what appears to be a pressure tank near the muzzle , and a fuel gauge halfway along the weapon .
It is shown as projecting a stream of whatever duration the player desires , which the real weapon cannot do : the LPO - 50 is a cartridge - compressed design which uses an explosive pressurising cartridge to fire the entire contents of one tank at a time , resulting in it having three 2 - 3 second " shots . "
The ' Far Cry 2 version , having only one tank , should only really be able to fire one shot .
It also has a constant small burn at the muzzle as if it has a pilot light : the three things at the muzzle are actually pyrotechnic charges , and only burn while a tank is actually being fired .
The weapon has no reload animation , being loaded automatically with all the fuel the player is carrying , and uses the fuel gauge for an ammo counter .
The misfire animation is a pressure leak at the base of the fuel gauge , requiring the nut there to be tightened to remedy it .
The failure animation shows the pressure and fuel tanks breaking away from the frame , after which the weapon is discarded .

Mounted Weapons
M249 SAW
The SAW behaves rather differently when mounted ; it has no muzzle climb and cannot fail or jam , and has infinite ammunition , as do both the other mounted weapons .
The mounted SAW is fitted with spade grips , presumably to explain why the player is n't able to pick it up and carry it away .
It is secured to whatever mounting it is using by the bipod attachment point , but is always horizontal , which makes it appear that the rear of the gun is levitating .
As with all the game 's crew - served weapons , long bursts will cause the weapon to overheat , though only when it is mounted .
Rather than using a heat indicator , during protracted firing smoke will escape from the SAW ; the longer it is fired without pausing , the darker the smoke that comes out of the weapon will be .
If it is allowed to overheat , flames will briefly be visible , followed by a cooldown period .
A bizarre note of interest is that the mounted SAW 's ammo box ( meant for belts of 5.56 mm ) is reused for the .50 cal M2 HMG and 40 mm MK 19 grenade launcher without any change in size or writing .
Frank uses a mounted SAW in the central village of the Northern map .
Despite this being a cease - fire zone , nobody cares about the player character screwing around with the mounted guns , provided they do n't actually fire them .

Browning M2HB
The Browning M2 is seen both as an emplaced weapon and mounted on vehicles .
It has a significantly lower rate of fire than its real life counterpart , but is incredibly damaging , easily able to kill any enemy and deal lethal damage to an unwary player with a handful of shots .
The M2 overheats much more readily than the SAW , but still not as rapidly as the Mk. 19 .
The final buddy mission in the North will cause all trucks at safe houses to spawn with M2s instead of the usual SAWs , but they are not seen on enemy vehicles until the Southern map .

The rate of fire is n't particularly respectable even for a semi-auto , never mind a machine gun , but M2 is both long - ranged and extremely damaging .
not explode as a result of direct damage ; an M2 can damage a vehicle to the point black smoke is coming from the engine , but after that it catches fire and explodes on its own .
Seemingly , this process cannot be hurried by dealing additional damage with anything barring explosives .

Mk. 19
The Mk 19 grenade launcher is the most powerful of the three mounted weapons , though it overheats quickly , and is only encountered in the Southern map , where it can be found on tripods and monopods near enemy strongholds and on boats and trucks .
The grenades are devastating , easily able to kill the player character ; this can result in some frustrating deaths if the player is taken by surprise .

Sawed - Off Double Barreled Shotgun
An old - fashioned rabbit - ear 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun with decorative engraving , this is used in the secondary slot .
It fires both barrels with a single trigger pull , and is effective at close quarters but not anywhere else ; like the SMGs , it 's a good choice if the rest of a player 's weapon setup is long - ranged or explosive .
The failure animation is essentially lifted from the M79 ; in the jam animation , the shells somehow end up shoved right inside the barrels , leaving the player character struggling to free them .
Also , it is worth noting that even though the shotgun fires two shots , the game only subtracts one shell from a player 's ammo reserves
Any visit to Mike 's Bar must include the wanton destruction of his Barrel .

Given all the engraving on this thing , rather than sawing it off he could probably have sold it on eBay and bought a pump-action or five instead .

The sawed - off shotgun blows up .
Just like the M79 did , in fact .
Suppressed Shotgun
Most closely resembling a Mossberg 500 , this is referred to in promotional materials as the " Silenced Shotgun . "
It is the fourth shotgun in the primary weapon slot , and a second suppressed weapon for that slot .
It is equipped with a pistol grip , ( empty ) spare shell holder on the right hand side , and a suppressor with the weapon 's sight on top of it .
Like the Ithaca , it is pump-action and has a six - round tube magazine ; it also recycles the Ithaca 's jam animation , including pumping the forend an extra time at the start of the jam animation just so it can actually happen .
This weapon may be a homage to the suppressed shotgun used in the movie No Country for Old Men .

How six cartridges fit in that tiny tube is unclear .

possible ?
Failure animation : how is this even supposed to be
Crossbow
A low - durability compound crossbow with wood furniture is the special weapon for the Fortunes Pack .
The Crossbow is equipped with the same scope as the grenade launcher and AR - 16 , this time with a crosshair reticle , and uses exploding arrows ; as with the RPG - 7's rockets , these can deflect off surfaces , though attaching the label " realistic " to this behaviour might be a little dishonest .
Frank resets his crossbow .
The reticle of the crossbow is basically the same as the one used for the M1903A4 .
The crossbow bolt hits home .
The explosions are roughly equal to a hand grenade , and slightly weaker than most other explosive weapons ; they can still easily destroy anything they hit .
Well , other than ...
" What the cluck ? "
Hot Shots !
Part Deux instead .
Yes , that was indeed a screenshot of a high - explosive crossbow bolt rebounding off a chicken .
Maybe Frank should have gone the way ofinstead .

Non-usable
IMI Micro Uzi
While the Micro Uzi is n't usable in the game itself , it appears on the cover of magazines seen in the game world .

Another magazine which appears to be in Japanese shows a number of illustrations of M16 - series rifles , specifically captioning one as an M16A3 .
Some posters and crates also depict M16 - series weapons , though without identifying them .
Some of the closeups seem to show motors in the pistol grip and battery capacities in mAh , which along with the language suggests the texture is taken from a Japanese airsoft magazine .
Nicely incomprehensible reading materials they have around here .
Looking at the title with the scope of the SVD ; while blurred , this appears to confirm at least one of the two M16s is supposed to be an A3 .
The caption of the other is missing due to a folded page corner .

Trivia note : fake widescreen
Like many games , Far Cry 2 defaults to a fake widescreen mode which cuts the top and bottom off a 4:3 aspect ratio image rather than actually increasing the field of view horizontally .
This has been fixed in the PC version , which has a selectable " widescreen " option ; this is because players with multiple monitors were dealing with an image so vertically compressed they could n't see anything .
However , in the console versions it has never been fixed .
All screenshots in this article were taken in " fake " widescreen mode as it is the most common , but a demonstration of the difference is below .
Low - quality PS3 screen capture with some colour shifting ; this is in 4:3 mode .

TODAY , THE Massachusetts
House can do its part to nudge the United States out of the 18th century , where the country still lingers when it comes to its most pivotal political decision .
Our presidential elections , after all , are governed by the Electoral College , a creaky contrivance from an era when democracy was such an untested experiment that the founders felt filters had to be interposed between the will of the people and the way of the government .
As a result , what we have is not a true national election for president , but a series of state - by - state contests .
In almost every case , the candidate who wins a state , even by one vote , collects all its electoral votes .
That anachronistic arrangement occasionally results in a decidedly undemocratic conclusion :
A candidate who becomes president despite placing second in the popular vote , something that has happened four times in 56 elections .
And though the probability tends to be seen as remote , in an era of close elections , the risk is always present .
After all , in 2000 , George W. Bush lost the popular tally to Al Gore by more than half a million votes , but still prevailed in the Electoral College .
It could have happened again in 2004 ; if 59,301 voters had gone the other way in Ohio , John Kerry would have become president , despite a popular vote edge for Bush that still would have been about three million .
A second , and regular , problem with the Electoral College is that it reduces the campaign to an exercise in swing - state hopscotch , one that sees the candidates focus on a dozen or so battleground states while effectively ignoring most of the rest of the country .
Reliably Democratic states like California and New York and reliably Republican states like Texas and South Carolina are treated as little more than fund - raising pit stops in the presidential race .
Millions of voters become distant observers of a campaign that never touches down in their states .
But an ingenious reform known as the National Popular Vote initiative would change that — and without the long and arduous task of amending the US Constitution .
By passing legislation , states would join an interstate compact committing themselves to awarding their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote .
When enough join so that the total electoral votes of committed states numbers at least 270 , the amount required to win the presidency , the new system would go into effect .
We ’d then have a real national campaign .
Think of it :
The contest would no longer turn on who wins in Ohio or a handful of other closely divided states .
Instead , winning an additional vote in Massachusetts or Utah or Rhode Island or Mississippi would matter just as much as tallying another in a swing state .
One oft - cited argument against the plan is that a change like this should only be made by amending the Constitution .
But in fact , the Constitution itself makes it quite clear that an amendment really is n’t required .
What ’s more , should unanticipated problems occur , under this plan , the country could easily revert to the old arrangement .
( Most other objections to the proposal are well countered on the National Popular Vote website . )
Now , the sensible scheme still has a long way to go .
So far , Illinois , New Jersey , Maryland , Washington , and Hawaii have all passed laws pledging to participate , once enough others sign on .
( The bill has passed one legislative branch in at least a dozen more states . )
Those five states have a total of 61 electoral votes , which means the National Popular Vote is just about a quarter of the way there .
Massachusetts , with its 12 electoral votes , would be an important momentum - building addition to that tally .
But though the measure passed both branches of the Legislature in 2008 , in failed to make it all the way through the process .
This year , the Legislature should put Massachusetts firmly in the column of those states favoring reform .
It ’s long past time we left the Electoral College — and the 18th century — behind .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Smokers who have higher levels of vitamin B6 and certain essential proteins in their blood have a lower risk of getting lung cancer than those deficient in these nutrients , according to study by cancer specialists .
Scientists at the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) said that although they had not found a causal link , the results may be a clue to why some smokers never get lung cancer and some non-smokers or former smokers do .
Lung cancer is the most common form of the disease in the world and 90 percent of all cases are caused by cigarette smoking .
It kills 1.2 million people a year .
About 10 to 15 percent of smokers develop lung cancer -- although they often die of other smoking - related causes like heart disease , stroke or emphysema .
Lung cancer is also known to kill people who never smoked or who gave up years ago .
The IARC study , which looked at around 900 people with lung cancer , found a link to low levels of vitamin B6 and an amino acid called methionine , found in protein like meat , fish and nuts .
B6 is also found in meat , nuts , vegetables and bananas .
“ What we have found is that these two things are strong markers of lung cancer risk , but we have not shown they are causing that rise in risk , ” said Paul Brennan of the Lyon - based IARC , who led the study and published its findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) on Tuesday .
“ This indicates that diet may have an important role in lung cancer development , but it ’s still a little premature to say simply that if you change your diet and eat more foods with these vitamins then you ’ll change your future lung cancer risk . ”
NUTRIENTS KEY TO DNA HEALTH
Brennan ’s team studied around 900 lung cancer patients , mostly smokers but also including about 100 who never smoked and 260 who had quit .
Brennan said the change in risk of lung cancer linked to B6 and methionine levels was the same for all three groups , although of course the overall risk of getting the disease was much higher in the smokers to start with .
“ For the two nutrients together , the risk reduction was about 60 percent , ” he said .
“ Obviously if you had a very high risk because you smoke , then a 60 percent reduction of that is quite important , although not as important as quitting smoking . ”
Brennan said his findings appeared to reinforce previous research which suggested deficiencies in B vitamins may increase the probability of DNA damage and subsequent gene mutations .
A Swedish study in 2005 found that women with high levels of vitamin B6 had a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer .
“ Basically , these B vitamins and nutrients are all involved in the pathway which is responsible for the creation and maintenance of DNA , ” Brennan said .
“ So obviously you would want that pathway to work as well as possible . ”
The Achilles Heel of the Hunt During a time of national crisis , the airtime given to the Wildlife Bill last week exposed everything that is wrong with modern Ireland – from obsequiousness to the elite and powerful , to the self - preservation of politicians .
The hunt is on : 10 county councils endorsed the campaign 1
2
Forget your banking inquiries .
If you really want to know why the state is in the state it 's in , look at the events of last week .
All of the evidence points towards a political system that is entirely bankrupt .
The vanities , frailties and cynicism of a system that does not serve its purpose were writ large in the passage of what should have been a minor piece of legislation .
Last week , there were serious issues that a national parliament should have debated with passion and purpose .
The slashing of respite hours for the carers of children with an intellectual disability ; a survey that shows Ireland has the second - highest food prices in the EU ; the revelation Nama is already acting as a cash cow for all manner of professionals ; another leap in the live register .
Instead , the drama and passion was reserved for a group whom Tony Gregory referred to in the Dáil in February 2005 as " some of the richest , most powerful and most influential developers and businessmen in this country " .
A slice of their wealth may be gone , but some members of the Ward Union Hunt have retained their power and influence .
The plight of the leisure activities of this small , exclusive group dominated discourse inside and outside parliament in the early part of last week .
The Wildlife Bill bans the hunting of carted red deer with hounds .
The only group affected by the ban is the Ward Union Hunt .
One of its prominent members is Michael Bailey , who was deemed corrupt by a tribunal and who , with his brother , settled with the Revenue for € 25 m in 2006 .
In developed countries , Bailey may well have been the subject of a criminal prosecution , but we do n't do that kind of stuff here .
The hunt also includes one of Nama 's finest , Johnny Ronan , who , like the late George Best , enjoys the company of Miss Worlds , one of whom he flew to Morocco on a whim earlier this year , at a time when his debts were being socialised into Nama .
You might think high - profile developers would not be flavour of the year with politicians .
But these boys are as popular as ever .
Members of the national parliament were bending over backwards to ensure the likes of Bailey and Ronan could continue scaring the life out of defenceless animals , who are reared and retained for the purpose of having the life scared out of them .
Shouting loudest
Obsequiousness to the wealthy and powerful was a feature of the political system in the bubble years .
Another was the subsuming of the state and wider society 's interests into the agendas of those who shouted the loudest .
Last October , the Green Party inserted the Wildlife Bill into the revised programme for government .
By the standards of any half - developed European state , it was a tame measure .
In January , a " pro-hunting " group , Rural Ireland Says Enough ! ( Rise ! ) emerged .
With an office in Ashbourne – in the heart of Ward Union territory – and fronted by top PR man Liam Cahill , it was obviously well funded .
Cahill had previously worked as PR man for Intel , with Fianna Fáil 's David Andrews and with the Labour Party .
He does n't come cheap .
Over the last six months , he brilliantly purported to represent the interests of rural Ireland with a campaign to " mobilise public and political opinion in support of traditional field sports and rural pastimes " .
The Nama boys and their fellow hunters were thus transmogrified into saviours of rural Ireland , the last bulwark against the rampaging instincts of the Green party .
Apart from the Wildlife Bill , the only other proposal of concern was the Dog Breeding Establishment Bill , which pre-dated the Greens in government , and arose out of recommendations from a group comprising all stakeholders in the dog breeding industry .
This was an overdue bill in any half - developed European country , but facts are the enemy of spin .
In the hands of Rise ! , the breeding bill was another stab from the great Satan of rural Ireland , John Gormley .
Throughout the country , beyond the pale , Rise ! spread the word .
Ten county councils adopted motions endorsing the campaign .
Constituency clinics were visited and politicians asked nicely to support the Nama boys .
A Rise ! rally in Trim , Co Meath last Saturday was told that " the revised programme for government agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Green party will go into the records as one of the most shameful deals ever perpetrated on rural people by an Irish government " .
The programme contained only one provision affecting rural Ireland – a two - page bill banning carted red deer hunting .
The speaker at Trim , Des Crofton , warned TDs : " Vote down Gormley 's bills next week or pay the price by losing your seat . "
For some of us who grew up in rural Ireland , this hijacking of the travails that have dogged that section of the country is insulting .
Where were these people when manufacturing disappeared from rural Ireland ?
When the post offices and the garda stations closed ?
Where were they when towns and villages were being emptied of the young , when the land no longer provided a proper living ?
Slavish devotion to the market was the only game in town , and if that ripped rural Ireland to shreds , nobody was shouting stop .
There was no Rise ! to wield influence over the political system on these matters .
Instead , rural Ireland was reduced to a flag of convenience by lobbies engaged in flogging drink or chasing deer .
Rise ! was pushing an open door with politicians .
Many of them are clueless in their nominal duty of bettering society , but they are brains on wheels when it comes to protecting their seats .
The more sensitive noses sniffed the wind .
Seven Fianna Fáil backbenchers spoke out against the bill .
Meath deputy Thomas Byrne is regarded as the future of the party .
He said the bill could be unconstitutional .
Thomas is a solicitor .
Maybe he really did n't know that he was talking through his hat .
Fine Gael 's resident hyena , Michael Ring , must live in another universe .
He told RTÉ's Late Debate , " People are sick and tired of it .
They can't fish , they can't farm . "
Maybe he believes the Ward Union fish for their deer .
Others saw the thing as an opportunity .
Time to jump ship with a big splash .
On Morning Ireland last Monday , Michael Healy - Rae came on to speak for his father .
Michael was introduced as Jackie 's director of elections .
Is there another country in the developed world in which a parliamentarian 's director of elections is wheeled out to speak on policy mid-term ?
The slot gave Healy - Rae a chance for the voters of Kerry South to familiarise themselves better with him .
Ninety years into independence , and still the post - colonial practice persists of seats in parliament being treated like a family heirloom .
Jackie Healy - Rae showed up on RTÉ's News at One to explain why he was tumbling overboard on this bill .
He denied he had told a Sunday newspaper : " Letting a pack of dogs loose after a deer and scaring it half to death is n't something I agree with . "
The newspaper 's deputy editor rang in to say they have him saying it on tape .
Another government supporter to hop off was Michael Lowry .
He is a proven liar and cheat of whom any self - respecting government would have nothing to do with in the first place .
He told Sean O'Rourke he was worried about the horse - racing industry in Tipperary .
Do they chase deer around Fairyhouse ?
Then we had the Fianna Fáil tribunes of rural Ireland , Mattie McGrath and Christy O'Sullivan , both of whom represent constituencies many miles from where the Nama boys hunt and whoop .
This is the second so - called assault on rural Ireland in which both got their knickers in a twist .
The previous occasion was the lowering of the drink - driving limit to a level deemed necessary by every other developed country in Europe .
For these two lads , drink driving and hunting deer are the only real pastimes in rural Ireland .
The Labour party 's position on the bill suggests it does n't stand for anything anymore , apart from the pursuit of power .
Nine of the party 's 20 TDs have publicly opposed blood sports , yet all but Tommy Broughan had no problem voting against the bill .
Maybe the party 's position was adopted on foot of research from focus groups , the favoured governing tool of Bertie Ahern when he was leading the country into perdition .
That was politics at ground level last week .
Matters of urgency and , in some cases , desperation , were sidelined for a pantomime of what occupies politicians .
The energy spent on self - preservation , making the other guy look bad , sucking up to powerful interests , is all energy lost from any effort to do proper work .
Bankruptcy
Up at leadership level , the bankruptcy is just as stark .
Brian Cowen is a busted flush , leading a discredited party .
The most obvious alternative for Taoiseach , Enda Kenny , is not wanted by the majority of voters polled .
A fortnight ago , he showed how he could be the sharpest tool in the shed when it came to protecting his power .
Yet he can't inspire confidence in an electorate crying out for some – any – leadership .
Eamon Gilmore is promising there will be no recession when he's in charge and everybody will get what they want .
He looks more and more like Bertie Ahern with each passing day .
Gormley is being wrongly vilified over his Wildlife Bill .
But he undermines his party 's position by abusing his power to block an incinerator in his own backyard , which has been given the green light by all the relevant agencies .
In this , he is more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil itself .
They protest about all being tarred with the same brush , about how hard they work .
They claim they are victims of media cynicism .
And they can't understand how the general public do n't appreciate all they do .
The answers were there in stark detail last week .
The system is bankrupt , and so far there appears to be little will to reform it into something fit for governing an alleged developed country .
Nobody wants oil - tainted seafood from the Gulf of Mexico to reach the dinner table — not consumers , not BP , not federal and state officials , and certainly not the people whose livelihood depends on the Gulf 's seafood industry .
But to keep oily fish , shrimp , oysters , and other seafood out of restaurants and markets , regulators are relying on a very old tool : the human nose .
Here 's a guide to the re-energized art of " seafood sniffing " :
What do seafood sniffers do ?
Pretty much what you 'd expect .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the nonprofit International Food Protection Training Institute ( IFPTI ) are teaching Gulf state officials to detect oil contamination by smelling batches of locally caught seafood .
( See the sniffers at work )
How do you learn to do that ?
Trainee sniffers start by smelling " different samples of oil to sort of train our noses and minds to recognize it , " says William Mahan , a University of Florida agricultural extensionist who underwent the NOAA training .
Then they do blind sniffings of shrimp , oysters , and finfish with different levels of oil contamination .
It 's important " to just go by the smell , " not sight , says IFPTI 's Joan Bowman , " because oil can be washed off or masked with something else . "
The " smell test " works ?
Really ?
NOAA , the FDA , and state labs are also doing chemical analyses on thousands of seafood specimens , but the sniff test is " the gold standard " in detecting tainted seafood , says Tulane University toxicologist LuAnn White .
" Properly trained noses are really remarkable organs , " says NOAA 's Brian Gorman , noting that noses have been used for centuries to help make wine , butter , and cheese .
Sniffing is also faster , by several days , and cheaper than lab tests .
What does oil - tainted seafood smell like ?
" It smells just like you 'd expect , like oil , " says IFPTI 's Bowman .
" And sometimes it has a gas smell to it . "
Mahan adds : " Everybody 's nose works differently .
For me , the oysters are a little more challenging . "
Are there enough sniffers to keep us safe ?
Not 100 percent , but sniffers are a second line of defense , after the closing of a third of federal and state Gulf waters ( so far ) to fishing .
What if you eat oiled seafood that slipped through the safety net ?
It would n't be as bad as you think , says White .
You might get a stomach ache , but the oil actually is n't highly toxic , and sea creatures quickly metabolize it .
Based on post–oil spill studies of oysters and mussels in Washington and Texas , she adds , you 'd have to eat " tons " of seafood for decades to be harmed .
Not everyone 's convinced .
" I ain't eating any of it , " says Mississippi gas worker Mike Triana .
" I do n't trust the nose . "

A TINY toxic mushroom was believed to be behind hundreds of deaths in southwestern China .
According to medical investigators , the relatively unknown Little White fungus caused the fatalities , Sky News reported .
At least 400 people mysteriously died from cardiac arrest over the last 30 years , in what is known as Yunnan Sudden Death Syndrome .
In 2004 , local health officials appealed to Beijing for help in finding the killer and a team of medical investigators from The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) were handling the inquiry .
Investigators focused on mushrooms because while deaths were spread out in different villages in the Yunnan province , more than 90 percent occurred mainly in the mushroom harvesting season during July and August .
By 2008 , investigators discovered the Little White , from the Trogia species , in a number of homes where people had died .
Robert Fontaine , a US epidemiologist who took part in the investigation , said : " What we have here is a toxin that is picking off vulnerable people . "

Here are the top 10 most annoying things about watching the World Cup already :
1 . That pesky cerebrum - blowing incessant buzzing sound coming from the TV set .
" Babe , something 's wrong with the TV , " my wife said Saturday .
But there was n't anything wrong .
It was the dreaded vuvuzelas , the yard - long plastic horns ( voo-voo - zella ) that South African fans blow all the time , without rhyme nor reason , when something is happening and when it's not ( it 's usually not ) , during timeouts and time ins , during halftime and at the breakfast table and while they 're on the bus and while doing their taxes , until you just want to stab two fondue forks deep into your ears and stir .
They never stop .
It 's like having a desk in the center cubicle at American Bee , Inc .
They sound like 80,000 yaks getting sick .
They are the leading cause of Tylenol sales in the world today .
2 . The embarrassing photographer bibs the guys on the bench have to wear during the game .
They 're very purple and dorky .
My God , who knew you could make a World Cup team and be made to look like a geek ?
Hey , are you on the American national soccer squad or do you throw bags for Northwest Airlines ?
3 . The Twinkie - fingered gloves goalkeepers wear .
No wonder the English goalkeeper allowed that easy shot to give America a 1 - 1 tie in the Group C opener .
You could n't stop a beach ball with those big goofy things .
What , is Hamburger Helper a sponsor ?
Why must they be so huge ?
Does n't Roger Rabbit need them back ?
And where do the batteries go ?
How are goalkeepers expected to hang on to the ball with them on ?
And is it difficult to play goalie while also taking things out of the oven ?
4 . The godforsaken vuvuzelas !
Make them stop !
One of the charms of soccer is the singing that fans do .
There is always loads of singing and chanting because every game is 1 - nil , so there 's plenty of time for singing and chanting .
Soccer fans sing and chant inane hilarious things like , " We are from Norway !
We came on a plane !
And we are very drunk ! "
But we do n't get to hear the singing and the chanting because of the horrible , hideous , heinous vuvuzelas !
My god , they should take them into the mountainous caves region of Pakistan and play them until Osama bin Laden comes running out , screaming , " OK , OK ! I give ! "
What gives with the goalkeepers ' gloves ?
Why must they be so huge ?
Does n't Roger Rabbit need them back ?
Is n't it difficult to play soccer while also taking things out of the oven ?
5 . All the faking .
I have n't seen this much bad theater since I saw former " American Idol competitor " Ace Young starring in " Hair " on Broadway .
These guys collapse as though they 've just caught a javelin in the groin every time an opponent so much as asks them for the time .
These guys make Paul Pierce look sincere .
Sell it somewhere else , Sven .
We live in the U.S. , where hockey players pop their eye back into their socket without missing a shift .
This will be the new rule when I 'm made president of FIFA :
If you stay on the ground longer than 30 seconds , you 're out of the game ; 45 , you are taken directly to the nearest hospital ; 60 , you get a telethon .
6 . The yellow cards .
I love the way the refs come running up to the player as though he has just taken out a chainsaw and sawed somebody 's hand off .
The ref looks very stern and upset .
And then all the ref does is snap his little yellow piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and stick it in the offender 's face , as though the little yellow card has some kind of superpower .
As if to say , " Ha ! you are powerless against my little yellow piece of paper , which shows your less - than - average marks from third grade ! "
I 'd love to see that in the middle of an NBA fight .
Can you imagine seeing some ref come running up to Rasheed Wallace after laying out Carmelo Anthony with a roundhouse right and sticking that yellow card right in his face ?
He 'd soon be digesting it through his ear hole .
7 . The ties .
In the NFL in the past 10 years , there have been two ties .
As of Tuesday morning , in the first 11 games of this World Cup , there have been five ties .
You will not see more ties at a J.C. Penney 's Father 's Day sale .
I hate ties .
Does n't anybody want to win in this sport ?
All these ties are about as exciting as a Jonas Brothers roundtable on sex .
" Regard the awesome power of this little yellow card I am holding ! ! "

8. The World Cup itself .
Really ?
All this running and vuvuzela-ing and pulling off shirts for that trophy ?
It looks like somebody soldered it together in their basement -- after drinking a handle of Jack Daniel's .
It looks like something you 'd use to prop open your Tuff Shed door during spring cleaning .

On Sunday an Iranian ship left the port of Khorramshahr and is currently headed for Gaza , according to Reuters .
Another ship , loaded with food , construction material and toys , will depart Iran on Friday .
Iranian MPs plan to enter Gaza at the Rafah crossing .
“ Until the end of the Gaza blockade , Iran will continue to ship aid , ” said an official at Iran ’s Society for the Defense of the Palestinian Nation .
The second ship will depart from from Istanbul , Turkey .
Additional aid ship convoys are promised for next week , according to the Jerusalem Post .
Iran had promised to send a military escort to protect its ships .
On June 6 , Hojjatoleslam Ali Shirazi , an aide to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , pledged Tehran would send Revolutionary Guard units to escort Gaza aid convoys .
The leader of the Revolutionary Guard , Hossein Salami , said there were no plans to do so .
“ Such a thing is not on our agenda , ” he was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency on Monday .
Mohammad Ali Nouraee , an official in charge of the aid for Gaza , said the two convoys will not be accompanied by Revolutionary Guard units as “ we are not to fight .
We will go for help and we may even become martyred in this way . ”
It is not clear what Israel ’s response will be to the Iranian convoy .
Israel accuses Iran of supporting Hamas , the Palestinian Islamic organization that won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Parliament in the January , 2006 , Palestinian parliamentary elections .
In addition to the aid ships , three Iranian parliamentarians are planning to visit Gaza through Egypt .
Lawmaker Mahmoud Ahmadi Bighash told the Jerusalem Post that he and two other members of the Majlis , the Iranian parliament , would travel to Gaza by way of Egypt later this week .

Bighash said around 200 of Iran ’s 290 member parliament wanted to travel to Gaza through Egypt ’s Rafah crossing but it was decided to send only three MPs .
Biqash said on Sunday that the Egyptian government has agreed to issue visas to 70 Iranian parliamentarians who have registered to travel to the Gaza Strip .
In January , 2009 , Israel reportedly intercepted an Iranian ship headed for Gaza .
The Iranian ship was stopped 20 miles off the coast of Gaza , according to the New York Times .
It had departed from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas .
Ahmad Navab , an Iranian official in charge of the aid , said aid would be sent through the Rafah crossing .
During an interview with Press TV on Sunday , Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad condemned UN Security Council approved sanctions against his country and said the deadly attack on the Gaza flotilla two weeks ago resulted in “ global hatred ” of Israel .
Ahmadinejad also said the whole world is now “ questioning Israel ’s 60 - year occupation of Palestine . ”
On June 8 , DEBKAfile claimed the Iranian convoy will consist of a cargo ship loaded with food and other essentials , medicines and building materials , while the second ship will carry volunteer marines .
A third ship will be a floating hospital to be anchored permanently in Egyptian Mediterranean territorial waters opposite the divided Gaza - Egyptian town of Rafah .
Small boats will ferry patients between Gaza and the hospital ship .
DEBKAfile is a Jerusalem - based English language Israeli open source military intelligence website .
Yediot Achronot investigative reporter Ronen Bergman reported that the site relies on information provided by American neocons .
Israeli intelligence officials do not consider even 10 percent of the site ’s content to be reliable .
“ Tehran calculates that the Israeli navy will not attack boats carrying sick people and will be constrained from venturing into Egyptian territorial waters to hit the floating hospital .
By this means , Tehran will dismantle Israel ’s sea blockade while also gaining a military presence off the shores of Gaza , ” DEBKAfile reported .

I can sum up this contender for metal album of the year with one word : epic !
Imagine John Williams ( who wrote the soundtracks for the Star Wars films ) and Chuck Schuldiner of Death getting stoned together and writing an album and you will be on the right track towards grasping the sound of Full of Hell .
Comparisons to the early works of Mastodon would also not be far off the mark .
The album roars out of the gates with the song “ Horns of Steel , ” the lyrics of which are the inspiration for the album title , and the thunderous assault of heavy riffs lets up only briefly between songs .
The tracks “ Heavenless ” and “ Gods in Broken Men ” showcase the band at their best , with the perfect blend of heavy riffs from bassist Rob Icaza and rhythm guitarist Andrea Black combining with the soaring guitar solos and throaty roar of Vincent Hausman .
The technical beats and fluid fills of Timmy St. Amour on drums holds everything together .
Apart , each of them is a skilled musician , but together they are a metal churning machine attacking your eardrums with the precision of a predator drone and leaving you begging for more .
The album is light on guitar wankery , with tracks “ You Jackals Beware ” and “ The Scorpion ’s Last Sting ” along with the previously mentioned “ Heavenless ” and “ G.I.B. M ” demonstrating the most technical leads , but trust me when I say you will be too busy head - banging to care .

Full of Hell is one of those albums that you want to listen to from start to finish .
While other bands write songs that play well live and then surround them with filler or throw together a bunch of random songs and call it an album , it is clear from listening to Full of Hell several times that the band spent a lot of time and effort crafting a whole album , and not merely a collection of songs .
Recordings are always great , but there is nothing like the experience of seeing a band live , especially if you are one of those people who hold out on buying an album until after .
Howl does not disappoint in this department , sounding as flawless live as they do on CD , only a hundred times louder .
They have toured relentlessly this year , and show little sign of letting up before year ’s end , so check their Myspace for tour dates and see them when they come to your town .

Warns Pentagon Will Do ' Stupid Things ' in Less than 3 Weeks
Speaking during a Senate Appropriation Defense Subcommittee hearing today , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates demanded that the $ 33 billion war funding bill be approved by Independence Day .
President Obama had promised that the emergency war funding bill passed last year would be his last one , and that future war expenses would be paid for with a record defense budget .
This promise fell by the wayside , however , in the wake of December ’s escalation pledge .
“ We begin to have to do stupid things if the supplemental is not passed by July 4 , ” Gates warned .
Exactly what these would be and how we would be able to tell the difference from ordinary Pentagon strategy was not clear .
With doubts on the war growing , the Obama Administration is likely to face a rare battle with Congress over the expenses .
The Pentagon has angrily dismissed Congressional doubts about the war , insisting things are going according to plan .

Iranian web users recently received some good news : following the media frenzy over last year 's elections , the US has chosen to relax export controls related to technology , giving users access to previously unavailable communications tools .
The changes will affect not only Iran , but Sudan and Cuba as well , countries where free internet use has long been stifled by US restrictions .
In March the treasury department 's office of foreign assets control ( OFAC ) announced the amendments to current controls to " ensure that individuals in these countries can exercise their universal right to free speech and information to the greatest extent possible " .
The amendments will allow those netizens to download software related to communications , such as instant messaging and chat clients , and tools related to social networking , and also permit the export of the same types of software to Iran and Sudan .
This news comes at a time when dialogue surrounding freedom of expression online is at a fever pitch in the United States .
Secretary of state Hillary Clinton , in her celebrated January speech on internet freedom , stated that American companies need to take a principled stand against censorship , and that it should be part of the country 's " national brand " .
In that vein , the amendments to the current export controls are a welcome gesture , both to American companies and to the netizens who benefit from their products .
Iran , of course , is an obvious target for these amendments , with nearly 30 million internet users and significant media attention in recent months .
But what about Syria ?
Although there are no OFAC restrictions placed on Syria , the US department of commerce 's 2004 Syrian Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration
Act prohibits the export of most goods containing more than 10 % US - manufactured component parts to the country .
The act also includes a provision on items deemed imports , including technology or source code controlled on the Commerce Control List , though licences are available for software providers through the bureau of industry and security .
Syrian netizens have long been aware of the effects of export controls on their lives .
They are prevented from downloading popular software such as Java and Adobe Acrobat , and browsers such as Google 's Chrome .
Microsoft products are available , but in pirated form , or smuggled in illegally .
What is surprising to many , however , is when a new ban suddenly emerges ; each year , a number of software providers seemingly crack down on Syrian users , often blocking access to entire websites for fear of non-compliance with the act .
For example , in early 2009 , Syrian visitors to the professional networking site Linked In were surprised to be met with a blockpage .
Though the full - on block was quickly removed , to this day users are barred from accessing the site 's proprietary software .
Similarly , in January 2010 , open - source code repository SourceForge began blocking the IP addresses of users in Iran , Sudan , Cuba , North Korea and Syria , much to the dismay of open - source enthusiasts .
Though in the end , Source Forge removed the blanket block – placing responsibility on project managers to choose their level of restriction – the fact remains that a large swath of open - source projects are still off limits to users from restricted countries .
But in Syria , just as in Iran , the internet serves as an important communications and organising tool for dissidents and average users alike .
And when you consider the fact that the Syrian government filters the internet internally as well ( blocking sites such as Facebook and Blogspot , among many others ) , you realise that users are left with very little wiggle room .
If Hillary Clinton is serious about promoting internet freedom to all , she would be wise to consider the effects of the Syrian accountability act on the average Syrian netizen and what that means for the United States ' " brand " of internet freedom .
After twenty years of listening to the punk band Bad Religion , I sent the group 's front man a note .
I greeted Greg Graffin , told him that he had fans among Christian college professors , and I asked about his doctoral work at Cornell University .
I was surprised to get a note back and then another .
After a few months I printed our emails .
They came to over 100 pages .
Very little of the written conversation between Greg and me concerns the music of Bad Religion .
He gets enough fan mail .
Instead , we discussed what my students would call the " big questions . "
What is life for ?
What are people for ?
Why do people think God exists ?
If you listen to Bad Religion 's lyrics , you know that these kinds of questions are important to Greg , who is an atheist .
In time , Greg turned his focus to recording another Bad Religion CD , and I had to face the mounting number of students in my classes .
Our correspondence became casual and remains that way .
But I learned a lot in those intense months .
For one thing , I realized that the kind of sustained written conversation Greg and I had is rare .
It 's rare because it takes time and mental energy .
It also takes a commitment not to let the discussion turn into a debate .
I 've held to this commitment through radio interviews that followed the publication of Greg 's and my correspondence .
I 've tried to resist the construal of our correspondence as a " debate . "
Yes , we disagreed and went at each other , but we did n't debate .
Debate is about winning , and that 's important in many contexts .
But I did n't care about winning .
Nor did I care about " listening " in the gushy , politically correct sort of way associated with people - friendly evangelism .
Mainly I cared about learning .
I wanted to learn how Greg sees the world , ...

By now everyone is aware that the G20 meeting failed to come to a consensus vis-a - vis strategic rescue approaches on the global bailout , with Tim Geithner pushing for uber - Keynesianism , while a far more prudent Europe saying enough to record deficits , and in essence potentially putting the end to the avalanche of endless bailouts and the Bernanke Uber - Put .
At least such is the case until tomorrow when Europe 's bureaucrats wake up and see a EURUSD at a level that rounds down to 1.10 .
The reason : Der Spiegel reports that Germany 's high court is considering blocking Germany 's participation in the European rescue package , a development which if it were to come to pass , would send the euro plunging to parity not with the dollar but with zero .
Translated from German :
The Federal Constitutional Court , order against the euro rescue to adopt an interim measure .
This would allow the court provisionally prohibit the federal government to guarantee loans to enable the German .
Against the rescue package are constitutional complaints against several .
The President of the Constitutional Court , Andreas Vosskuhle had to Gauweiler complaint , according to information of the SPIEGEL explicitly asked for opinions of different jobs :
He led them to the Federal Government , the Bundestag , the Federal President , all state governments , the European Central Bank and the German Bundesbank and asked for feedback .
It is Vosskule a request for interim relief , the Gauweiler associated with its application has .
Gauweiler has brought in Karlsruhe already against the Treaty of Lisbon complaint .
Disturb him , " that is further given unchecked power to EU bodies .
The German government warned that an interim order could lead to a " self - fulfilling expectation of default " by Europe 's troubled states .
As readers will recall , all it takes is for a country sovereign debt spread to to widen to 5 % over Bunds , for them to have an " out " from the EU rescue package , a loophole most will surely take advantage of eagerly as soon as the market processes this latest development .
All in all , another week of pain for Europe approaches , and of even greater pain for the US manufacturing sector , which paradoxically was the only one to materially add new jobs in the latest NFP report .
Altidore scored twice in 30 appearances for Hull last season
American fears over Jozy Altidore 's fitness appear to have eased after the Villarreal man returned to training .
The 20 - year - old , on loan at Hull last season , missed Friday 's 3 - 1 warm - up win over Australia due to an ankle injury sustained in training on Wednesday .
But after taking part in a five - a- side game on Sunday the first - choice striker will be expected to face England in the United States ' opener on 12 June .
However , neither Altidore nor coach Bob Bradley commented after the session .
Los Angeles Galaxy 's Edson Buddle , who scored twice against Australia , is the favourite to deputise up front should Altidore not be ready for the Group C clash against Fabio Capello 's side in Rustenburg .
According to Australia 's Copyright Tribunal , fitness classes have not been paying enough money for the music they play while attendees sweat into their leotards .
To fix the problem , the Tribunal yesterday announced a new rate for fitness center music , and it 's 1,500 percent higher than the previous rate .
It could have been ( much ) worse for gyms — rightsholders wanted a 4,000 percent increase — but many fitness centers are already pledging not to pay .
They 'd rather play bad cover versions than cough up the cash for the original recordings .
Dance , dance .
Revolution ?
Currently , fitness clubs in Australia pay 96.8 ¢ per class to artists and recording companies for the music they play in workout classes .
That amount will now increase to either AU $ 15 per class or AU $ 1 per attendee .
According to trade group Fitness Australia , this will increase music costs for an average 1,500 member club from AU$ 1,510 a year to AU$ 23,400 a year , though the original amount was arguably a ridiculously good deal , given how crucial music is to such classes .
This was exactly the argument that the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia ( PPCA ) made to the Copyright Tribunal while lobbying for a higher rate , and it presented plenty of research to prove it .
One study examined by the Tribunal looked into alternatives to recorded music and it concluded that the only viable options were no music at all or the use of " beat machines . "
The popularity of the beat machine is then summed up : " even limited use of it would cause considerable migration from fitness classes . "
Given the importance of music to fitness classes , rightsholders wanted more cash — lots more .
Their initial proposal was " a rate of AU$ 4.54 per member of a fitness center per month or AU$.99 per visit by a casual attendee at such a center .
This fee was not related to participation in fitness classes . "
Get that ?
AU$ 4.54 for every club member , every month — whether or not that person ever enrolled in a class .
PPCA would also settle for AU $ 20 per fitness class , or very grudgingly for AU$ 1.50 per person per class .
The Tribunal agreed that the music was far too cheap , but was not impressed with PPCA 's initial proposal , since it recouped money from those who were n't listening to the music .
" It would be unreasonable to require Fitness Centers to pay a license fee to PPCA for use of protected music in classes based upon the membership fees of persons who do not attend those classes , " wrote the Tribunal in one of the most boring government documents I have ever had the misfortune to read .
Instead , the Tribunal agreed to AU$ 15 per class or AU$ 1 per person per class .
The Copyright Tribunal recognized the large percentage increase built into its decision , saying , " The Tribunal is aware of the fact that these amounts are considerably higher than the amounts payable under the present license arrangements .
However , this application to the Tribunal has permitted the first comprehensive examination of the use of music in fitness classes .
Without it the classes would not function in the manner in which they are presently conducted and which fitness class attendees have come to expect . "
This new amount did n't make Fitness Australia happy .
" The international record companies , who are represented by the PPCA , have shot themselves in the foot by demanding outrageously high copyright licensing fees from the fitness industry , the majority of which go straight into record company coffers .
To mitigate the impact of such a decision , Fitness Australia members are already beginning to use music in their gyms that is free of PPCA copyright , " said Lauretta Stace , Fitness Australia Chief Executive Officer .
Bring on the covers
PPCA is a collection society , but it only has authority over certain works that have a connection to Australia ( just how close a connection was a subject of debate ) .
Fitness clubs , keen to stretch their profits , are trying to find ways around the ruling .
One popular strategy already appears to be the use of cover songs that fall outside the PPCA 's remit , and PPCA is furious at the plan .
In a statement yesterday , PPCA blasted the huge Fitness First chain .
The group says that the decision to use covers instead of the original tracks is a case of sour grapes .
Now , aerobics fans will be subject to " second - rate " tunes in all of the chain 's classes .
" Fitness First has treated both its members and recording artists with utter contempt , " said PPCA boss Stephen Peach .
" We ’ve seen a groundswell of discontent from gym members and fitness instructors who ’ve been ordered to use cover music and who are even being encouraged to dob in colleagues who try to use real music in classes ...
We are confident that many fitness centres will choose to continue to use real music and that they will have a strong business advantage over those that take what we think would be a very short - sighted decision to switch to low quality cover versions . "
Looking at the names at the top of this list of the most leveraged European banks -- sent to us from a reader , and compiled by Bloomberg data -- maybe you can get a sense of why it's the Germans that are so eager to push for anti-shorting , anti-speculation regulations .

The microlaser , which was developed over the last year and a half in Zurich , is actually shorter than the wavelength of the light it emits , a feat made possible by the use of an electrical resonant circuit as opposed to the conventional optical one .

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has given U.S. special envoy George Mitchell a list of written proposals for reaching a peace agreement with Israel , which includes leaving the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem and Western Wall under Israeli control , Arabic - language daily Al - Hayat reported on Saturday .

According to the report , Abbas offered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a set of concrete proposals for a peace deal , including proposals on borders and security arrangements .
Abbas is said to have proposed the creation of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders , but with a land swap encompassing 2.3 percent , which would leave larger settlement blocs such as Gush Etzion , Pisgat Ze'ev and Modi'in Ilit in Israel 's hands , along with a swathe of land overlooking Ben-Gurion International Airport .
In return , the Palestinians would get land bordering the southern West Bank in addition to land for a passageway between the West Bank and Gaza .
The report also said Abbas presented a softened stance on East Jerusalem , which would become the future capital of the Palestinian state .
Abbas reportedly proposed that Israel would retain control over the Old City 's Jewish Quarter and Western Wall , while the rest of East Jerusalem would be open to worshippers of all religions .
Palestinian sources told Al - Hayat that Netanyahu has only responded to Mitchell by saying that he wants face - to - face talks with Abbas .
The Palestinians have been wary of direct negotiations , fearing that Netanyahu wants to bring them to the table in order to decrease international pressure on Israel with no intention of signing a deal .
The report also quoted Palestinian sources close to Abbas , who say the Palestinian leader expects more effective U.S. participation in peace talks , with some saying Abbas wants the Obama administration to impose a settlement if negotiations fail .
Netanyahu this week called on Abbas to enter direct negotiations .
Im ready anytime , Netanyahu said .

Math has proven what no one has actually seen — namely that giraffes can swim , according to a new report in the Journal of Theoretical Biology .
Donald Henderson , the curator of dinosaurs at the Royal Tyrell Museum north of Calgary , and Darren Naish , of the University of Portsmouth in England , published a study in which they showed a swimming giraffe to be possible , at least in theory .
The world 's tallest mammal will not be very good in the water , however , the two scientists said in the latest edition of the esoteric academic journal .
A swimming giraffe would have to hold its head at a strange angle to breath while afloat , study suggests .
( ( CBC ) )
" While it is not impossible for giraffes to swim , we speculate that they would perform poorly compared to other mammals and are hence likely to avoid swimming if possible , " Henderson and Naish said in an article abstract .
That conclusion differs from the common wisdom within the scientific community , namely that the giraffe was too awkwardly designed to be able to remain buoyant in water and would drown .
" If you picture the giraffe immersed in water , with its high center of gravity , it 's hard to imagine how it could keep its balance .
The giraffe 's gestalt is definitely not adapted to life in water , " wrote Craig Holdrege in 2004 for the Ghent , N.Y. - based Nature Institute , a non-profit institute that examines science and technology .
Henderson and Naish , however , used a mathematical model in which they hypothesized the floating and rotation characteristics of a giraffe and estimated that the hoofed animal , with a mass approximately 13 per cent denser than a horse , could float in 2.8 metres of water .
" Giraffes are often stated to be unable to swim , and while few observations supporting this have ever been offered , we sought to test the hypothesis that giraffes exhibited a body shape or density unsuited for locomotion in water , " the Canadian and British scientists said in their article .
The giraffe , however , does have unstable dynamics , Henderson and Naish conceded , which would result in the animal 's front legs pulling its entire body downwards .
As a result , the giraffe 's neck would become horizontal in water and force the animal to hold its head above the surface at a strange angle , the scientists said .
Still , Henderson and Naish said , it is possible , say in the case of a forest fire , for a giraffe to swim across a large body of water to safety .

A mom has been reunited with her allegedly kidnapped kids via Facebook — but now they hate her .
The family 's story is a disturbing example of the powers — and limits — of social networking .
Advertisement
Gillian Flaccus of the AP describes the ordeal of Prince Sagala , who says her now - estranged husband took their son and daughter to live in Mexico without her knowledge or consent in 1995 , when they were toddlers .
Police apparently did little to try to get the kids back , and Sagala eventually gave up and had more kids — who knew how to use Facebook .
It was with her 12 - year - old daughter 's help that she found her missing daughter and son on the site .
Authorities were then able to locate the kids and arrest their dad .
But now Sagala 's daughter and son are furious .
Her daughter had resisted Sagala 's attempts to contact her via Facebook , saying , " A flower that was born in a forest can't live in the desert . "
Now , says Sagala ,
She does n't know me , her father 's in jail .
I guess she does blame me for this .
She does n't know the truth .
I told her , you can see me right now , I 'm not that person like what you thought for 15 years , like what your father told you .
Advertisement
And to make things even more complicated , Sagala faces domestic violence charges , meaning she can only have supervised visits with her older kids anyway .
It 's hard to say who 's telling the truth here — it 's possible that some of the " bad things " Sagala 's husband told the kids about her are accurate .
What sets this case apart from other custody battles , however , is the extent to which Facebook seemed like a solution to all of Sagala 's problems — and the extent to which it was n't .
Kids taken out of the country used to disappear — so much so that airports sometimes require both parents ' presence for kids to board international flights .
A diligent kidnapper , sadly , can still hide a child from authorities , but absent efforts at concealment , the average teen 's web presence is a pretty powerful tracer beacon .
But just because Sagala 's daughter was on Facebook did n't mean she wanted to be found , and her story may illustrate some of the limits of the technology .
As much as Facebook looks like an online directory of users ' personal information , from favorite bands to party photos to the addresses of alleged kidnap victims , that 's not how young people really want to use it .
Much as the media may claim that " Generation Me " is cool with showing their credit card statements to the world , many people ultimately think of Facebook as a way to communicate with a select group of people .
And although the site may lead to justice for Sagala and her husband , that 's more of a bug than a feature — it exposed Sagala 's kids to the one person they did n't want finding them .
Sagala and her family have to figure out the personal implications of this — and the police responsible for the case should ask themselves why a social networking site did a better job than they did .
But for Facebook , this story should be yet another reminder that young people expect a level of privacy they 're not getting .

Just in time for The Nightmare on Elm Street Reboot , is the documentary Never Sleep Again that chronicles each of Freddy Krueger ’s adventures starting with the original Wes Craven classic , and ending with Freddy vs. Jason .
The film is comprised of literally dozens of interviews with a huge collection of actors ranging from complete no names , to pretty well known ’s who have participated in the films intermittently spiced between never before seen behind the scenes footage and movie clips .
This is by far the most comprehensive of any horror documentary I have ever seen , and if you are looking for pure content , you will be overwhelmed .
Entering this review , I was prepared for the challenge of reviewing a niche ’ item .
The difficulty breaks down like this ; obviously this is going to be a “ must buy ” for any Freddy Krueger / Horror fanatic , but is it worth checking it out for the average consumer , and from what perspective do I review it ?
Luckily Never Sleep Again allowed me to avoid this controversy altogether .
This documentary is a must buy Fred Heads , for horror fans , any fan of the general genre of documentaries , and just film geeks anywhere .
Not only is it one of the most well put together documentaries in recent years , but the sheer quantity of actors , producers , directors , extras , presented in the film is by far the most cumulative collection I have ever seen .
You will see everyone from Wes Craven , Robert Englund , all the way to individuals who played lineless extras on the set discussing intricate details of individuals scenes and influences .
The only notable actor missing is Johnny Depp , and it almost seems like at this point he may not have actually fit into B - List cornucopia that is Never Sleep Again .
The creators from 1428 definitely exhausted the who’s who of the Nightmare series address book .
The fact that so many , and I am talking over 100 individuals , are willing to come back and be interviewed for this documentary truly shows what a special experience it was to be involved in the process of producing these films .
I think it has become increasingly fashionable to make the filmmakers part of / stars of a documentary .
See Michael Moore ’s ___________ , Al Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth , and Super Size Me as prime examples of what I am talking about .
Never Sleep
Again does not have this problem at all as the filmmakers are invisible and behind the camera as they should be .
In order to deal with the transition between paradigms in Freddy ’s progression the filmmakers have come up with incredible little stop motion shorts that fit perfectly into Krueger ’s world .
These provide a fantastic and fun interruption to the interviewing process , and often mock or recreate iconic scenes from the movies that were just discussed .
Although some enjoy the later Nightmare movies , I believe that it is general consensus that the movies followed the classic film genre sequel formula of progressing from scary –> disgusting –> funny –> cheesy .
This is an interesting meta story told with this documentary as you see this transition happen before your eyes .
Every set of stars claim that their movie was the best one and the most well received by the fans , citing reviews , gross income , or even iconic status as the Gayest Horror Film of All Time as evidence .
There is a clear decay in creativity and quality that not only occur between the films , but also in the filmmakers and stars involved in the process .
Starting with the masterful craftsmanship of Wes Craven discussing his process of creating the character using incredible techniques like color integration in Freddy ’s sweater , and the combination of myth , legend , and dream analysis in the story , and ending with the sheer insanity of Renny Harlin ( 12 Rounds , Cliff Hanger ) discussing the need to make Freddy crash a beach party .
The meta analysis I actually found more engaging than the story being told .
Especially following Robert Englund as he discusses reprising the role over and over again .
It hurts me to hate on a legend of horror , but you clearly see throughout the film that Robert Englund self - esteem is truly engulfed in this character and that he is a slowly making a poor transition from being a living legend to being a forgotten has been with the likes of Bela Lugosi .
Throughout the films his discussion of creating and evolving the character is both interesting and filled with melancholy as you see him progress trying to make sense of the existential dilemma of being a good actor performing in poorly made films .
You can expect Robert Englund to continue coming to Horror Cons near you until the time of his death as the fame and admiration of this character is clearly the source of his heartbeat .
The part I found the most interesting within the documentary was the discussion of the not so covert homoerotic nature of the second film in the series .
The sequencing of showing the actors / directors discussing composed with the clips from the film is just smile provoking fun .
It hard not to laugh out loud as actors say they did n’t notice the film had any Gay tendencies followed immediately by actors spelling off lines like :
Actor 1 : I need to sleep here tonight !
Actor 2 : Are you out of your mind ?
Actor 1 : Something is trying to get inside my body !
Actor 2 : and you want to sleep with me ?
These moments will have you roflcoptering all over the floor .
If there is any weakness in this film it ’s the length .
The film clocks in at almost 4 hours long and this is not something you will be able to sit through all at once .
In addition on the second disc there is an additional couple hours of content including a interview with James Rolfe a .k.a.
The Angry Video Game Nerd , discussing the introduction of the video games and comprising his episode dedicated to it .
Although this is a weakness I found myself continuing to come back to the story over and over across the course of a week , and upon completion of the film adding all of the Nightmare films to my Netflix .
What I am saying is that if too much content is actually a problem ( which it generally is n’t ) that is the only weakness of this documentary .
Just do n’t plan on inviting your friends over for a Fred Head party , because chances are you will not make it through all four hours without being restless to get up and do something else for awhile .
The documentary is a fantastic and very welcomed piece to film history .
I would doubt that any documentary could call itself more comprehensive than this one .
If you are a Fred Head and you do n’t own this …then shame on you .
If you have ever watched more than one of these films chances are you will find this interesting , and if you have n’t then you will want to upon completion of it .
I would like to solute the independent filmmakers over at 1428 studios for their diligence and the amount incredible hard work it must have taken to produce this film .
Chris Tabor has uncovered an interesting bug with his Droid Incredible , and he is n’t stopping until everyone knows about it .
His in depth coverage of this issue is the first I have ever heard of it , and that seems to be the case with most users , but still his evidence is quite compelling as he is able to succesfully demonstrate an issue involving touchscreen unresponsiveness on several Droid Incredible handsets , while the same problems do not occur with the Motorola Droid and HTC Droid Eris .
The logical conclusion is that the issue arises from poor grounding , not allowing the capacitive touchscreen to read touch input .
For those not familiar , capacitive touchscreens only work when the object touching them is electrically conductive .
If you try writing on one with a standard stylus or other plastic item nothing will happen .
If there was a grounding issue somewhere in the phone , touching the screen would n’t register as accurately due to current leaking out somewhere else in the circuit .
The initial problem was discovered using a car dock :
But to prove it was n’t the fault of the car dock alone , user error , or a single defective handset , Chris presents the following :
We have n’t been able to test this one out on our own just yet , and being as this is the first we have heard of it ca n’t say it is a widespread issue , but I ’m presenting this for the benefit of those who may have experienced similar issues .
So anyone else experience this ?
Or is it a singular , isolated incident ?

BANFF , Alberta ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Canada ’s Fox News clone may have its first TV anchor babe .
Controversial Canadian Broadcasting Corp. TV reporter Krista Erickson has left the public broadcaster ’s flagship newscast “ The National , ” she said in a terse staff memo .
The speculation is that Erickson will land a news anchor post with Sun TV News , Quebecor Media ’s right - wing all - news channel modeled on Fox News to the south .
Fox News North may fit better than the CBC with Erickson , as she raised eyebrows at the liberal - leaning public broadcaster by having a Conservative member of Parliament as a partner .
Even before Sun TV
News goes to air , Canadian pundits are already facing off over its pending January 1 , 2011 launch .
Christopher Dornan , writing in the left - leaning Toronto Star , called Sun TV News “ a Canadian Fox News knock - off ” likely to “ give not - so - worked - up citizens the willies . ”
Peter Worthington , writing in The Sun , part of the Quebecor Media empire , welcomed the Canadianized Fox News channel .
“ Unless one views Americans as mostly mindless , rightwing nutbars , since around 2002 Fox News has dominated rival channels and has earned the title ‘ Fair and Balanced ’ that once went to CNN , ” he said .
Quebecor Media must first secure a broadcast license for Sun TV News from the CRTC , Canada ’s TV regulator , before it can launch the 24/7 news channel .
Someone cue Johnny Paycheck , as an improving economy has more Americans finding the gumption -- and employment options - necessary to tell their current boss to take this job and ... well , you know the song .
From an Associated Press report :
More people quit their jobs in the past three months than were laid off - a sharp reversal after 15 straight months in which layoffs exceeded voluntary departures .
The trend suggests the job market is finally thawing .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Some of the quitters are leaving for new jobs .
Others have no firm offers .
But their newfound confidence about landing work is itself evidence of more hiring and a strengthening economy .
" There is a century 's worth of evidence that bears out this view that quits rise and layoffs fall as the job market improves , " said Steven Davis , an economist at the University of Chicago .
Dig a bit deeper into the story and it's clear there are caveats - departures are still well below pre-recession levels , for example -- and the trend is n't necessarily being seen across all corners of the American workplace .
And , as those who work in or watch the technology industry know , there are still ample examples of layoffs being more top - of - mind than job hopping .
This month alone , HP has announced it will be laying off 9,000 workers within its enterprise services business and Oracle said it would be eliminating an unspecified number of jobs related to its acquisition of Sun Microsystems .
Nevertheless , almost 2 million people left their jobs voluntarily in April , the highest total in more than a year .
This could well be a sign of chickens coming home to roost ... mighty tired chickens .
More from that AP story :
Studies have shown that worker morale fell during the recession .
Productivity rose as companies squeezed more work out of their employees .
That points to a reason quits may keep rising : Overworked employees could jump at the chance to switch jobs as new opportunities arise .
" There is going to be a mass exodus of the top performers as the economy starts to turn around , " predicts Razor Suleman , a consultant who helps companies retain their best workers .
About 25 percent of companies ' top performers said they plan to leave their current job within a year , according to a survey published in the May edition of the Harvard Business Review .
By contrast , in 2006 , just 10 percent planned to leave their jobs within a year .

Kabul , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- Suspected Taliban militants have executed a 7 - year - old boy , accusing him of spying for the government , officials in southern Afghanistan said Thursday .
The execution took place Tuesday in the Sangin district of Helmand province , said Dawoud Ahmadi -- the provincial governor 's spokesman .
In the past , militants have carried out similar killings of those accused of spying , Ahmadi said .
Three years ago , a 70 - year - old woman and a child in the Musa Qala district of the province were executed following the same allegations , he said .
During a news conference Thursday , Afghan President Hamid Karzai said officials were looking into reports of the execution and said he condemned the act if it is confirmed to be true .
" I do n't think there 's a crime bigger than that that even the most inhuman forces on earth can commit , " Karzai said .
" A 7 - year - old boy can not be a spy .
A 7 - year - old boy cannot be anything but a 7 - year - old boy , and therefore hanging or shooting to kill a 7 - year - old boy ... is a crime against humanity . "
" If this is true , it is an absolutely hiorrific crime , " British Prime Minister David Cameron said during the news conference on an unannounced stop in Kabul .
" If true , I think it says more about the Taliban than any book , than any article , than any speech could ever say . "
( h/t Raw Story )
Matt Simmons thinks so .
Simmons said the US government should immediately take the effort to plug the leak out of the hands of BP and put the military in charge .
" Probably the only thing we can do is create a weapons system and send it down 18,000 feet and detonate it , hopefully encasing the oil , " he said .
His idea echoes that of a Russian newspaper that earlier this month suggested the US detonate a small nuclear bomb to seal the oil beneath the sea .
Komsomoloskaya Pravda argued in an editorial that Russia had successfully used nuclear weapons to seal oil spills on five occasions in the past .
No , see ... " probably " is n't going to cut it for me .
That video is a pretty decent overview of how the Russians have tackled blown wells with nuclear devices , but it does n't really look at the ecological price attached to detonating a nuclear device in an ecologically sensitive area , or how to contain the toxic waste generated by such an explosion .
David Neiwert wrote about this awhile ago , and some of the comments really sent chills down my spine .
Its possible that the device would create the requisite cavity which would then chimney ( thus sealing the cavity ) .
BUT - you are detonating below sea level - water will flash to steam within a few milliseconds after detonation .
If you want to see what happens when water flashes at 0 time plus a millsecond or two , google on Baneberry ( a sub- surface test that went December of 1969 ) and look at that vent cloud .
You are talking about superheated and very radio- active steam .
That steam will find any fissure .
The gamma , and beta shot into the ocean would be pretty awful ...( read the rest )
I Googled the term Baneberry and found this photo at the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection ( EPA ) :
That plume is the " vent " .
That vent is radioactive steam .
Mmmmhmmm .
What are the chances it would stop the leak (s ) ?
According to Simmons , there 's another plume in the same field that 's even bigger and stronger than the original leak .
He argues that a nuclear device would close them both off .
Probably .
Maybe .
Did I mention that Simmons is n't a nuclear engineer ?
He 's a private investor in energy ventures .
Bottom line for me ?
I see no reason to place any confidence in what someone who may have a clear conflict of interest suggests as a solution .
How it works
This Christian Science Monitor article has some details :
Weapons labs in the former Soviet Union developed special nukes for use to help pinch off the gas wells .
They believed that the force from a nuclear explosion could squeeze shut any hole within 82 to 164 feet ( 25 to 50 meters ) , depending on the explosion 's power .
That required drilling holes to place the nuclear device close to the target wells .
Several articles around the web reason it out as the lesser of two evils in cases where all other efforts have failed .
Indeed , the scientist in the video says there are two options : nuclear and drilling a second well .
Drilling a second well would take months , as we already know .
In nukes we trust ?
There 's a lot of information people would have to accept on trust , especially people like me who have visions of nuclear fallout and mutated sea monsters as the result of something like this .
For instance , MNN.com 's Shea Gunther says :
I wonder , have they considered blasting it with a nuke ?
The Russians first did it in 1966 , four more followed in 1979 with only one failing to stop the leak .
A nuke would collapse the hole carrying the oil in the Gulf and would neatly seal things up .
At that water depth any radiation would be contained .
I 'm sure the U.S. government could rustle something up quick in their stockpile , and we could have this sucker tied up by the weekend .
My problem : I can't find any written empirical evidence that the fallout would be contained at that water depth .
In fact , it appears to me from the comments on Dave 's post that there 's a very real risk of toasting everything within a couple of miles and shooting radioactive steam into the atmosphere for good measure .
What about regular conventional explosives ?
As I understand it , the goal with any explosive device is to cause the hole to collapse on itself .
According to some experts , the problem with conventional explosives is the same problem other solutions are bumping against : this well is so deep and subject to such severe pressure that there 's no empirical evidence available to support or refute the claim conventional explosives would succeed .
If they did n't succeed , the problem might be made even worse .
This is an incredibly frustrating problem , not only because of the draconian measures needed to stop the spillage , but because we 're being asked to take so much on faith when it comes to the steps needed to stop the leak and clear the oil .
We 're told dispersants are non-toxic but hazmat suits are needed and the manufacturer 's own instructions recommend they not come in contact with bare skin .
We have n't been told what kind of impact dropping all that mud has , particularly when mixed with oil .
We have no idea how long it will take the microbial agents to eat the oil and clear the water .
We have absolutely no clue as to whether a nuclear device will work and if it does , whether it will do so at the expense of all living things for years to come .
Worst of all , no one has any faith in the information we 're receiving from BP , because they have not been forthright with us and appear to be acting in their best interests rather than our own .
I was n't a rocket scientist in school , but common sense tells me the nuclear option may not be the best one .
And then , there 's this map from NOAA which tells us that the breach in the pipeline is adjacent to a munitions dump .
Prior planning prevents piss - poor performance .
Someone once gave me that advice .
Too bad Halliburton , BP , Transocean and the MMS ignored it .
“ Honey , ” she said .
“ I was looking through your registry and I have a few thoughts .
Do you have a pen ?
First of all , you only registered for six mugs and that is n’t nearly enough .

I took a Maalox and tried to shake the creeping feeling that this wedding inspired in others the assumption that I had officially joined the fold  no surprise , as I had allowed myself to entertain the same assumption .
With my readmission to polite society , I had implicitly disowned the girl with the sweaty , crumpled cash in her pocket , the girl in long sleeves standing on a downtown corner in the middle of the Los Angeles summer .
And who cared if that girl , that huge part of me , was cast aside ?
She was a disaster of epic proportions anyway .
Then again , that disaster had walked herself into detox , sweated through the sleepless nights , and somehow found a scrap of faith to cling to , even when there was no evidence to support such an act of hope .
I understand why redemption stories end at Happily Ever After .
Who wants to see a married Sleeping Beauty staring out the castle window and wondering if volunteering with Habitat for Humanity might fill that void where she once had a sense of purpose ?
You know  back when snagging the Prince and circumventing that pesky curse was all she had to think about .

WITH each loaded “ You are so lucky .

Paul O'Brien is an Android hacker with mad skills .
He 's the man behind many roots , such as the Legend and the Desire , and now he has also rooted the new Dell Streak .
Rooting instructions , using a technique Paul called Superboot , have just been posted to the MoDaCo forum .
Recovery images are to follow soon .
I will mirror them here ( current version 07 / Jun r1 ) but you should always double check with the post to see if they were updated :
Introducing .... Superboot !
Superboot is a boot.img that when flashed , will root your device the first time you boot ( installing su and the superuser APK by ChainsDD ) .
No need to flash the system partition , no need to use ADB , no messing with the contents of your data partition , no overwriting the shipped ROM on your device , just flash the boot image using the instructions below and you 're done !
The story behind this superboot is a little bit different to what has gone before ... normally a Superboot is created based on a leaked ROM , but this was n't possible on the Streak .
What happened in this case is that I managed to find an exploit to give me root , which in turn allowed me to dump the device to images and create a Superboot image .
This can be flashed because the Streak has a relatively open bootloader .
This is pretty handy because it means that I do n't have to reveal the root exploit ... potentially saving it for further down the line if Dell choose to lock down the device a bit more .
APPLY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK !
Before download , you need to check your device ' about ' screen to determine which superboot version you need .
Superboot ( tested on build 3883 ) - DOWNLOAD ( MediaFire Pro ) / MIRROR ( ROMraid / CoBlitz ) - MD5 : 110e69808dc5145d1d0fca80f0d9ecb5
How to use Superboot - Windows , Linux and OSX
Download the Superboot zip file above and extract to a directory
Put your device in bootloader mode - Unplug the device from your PC , remove the device battery , then replace it and turn device on with the camera button pressed .
Select the ' fastboot ' text on the top right , wait around 10 seconds then plug the device into your PC .
The screen display should change to ' FASTBOOT MODE ' .
If it does n't , repeat and retry ( it 's a bit temperamental ! )
WINDOWS - double click ' install - superboot-windows.bat '
MAC - Open a terminal window to the directory containing the files , and type ' chmod +x install - superboot - mac.sh ' followed by './install-superboot-mac.sh '
LINUX - Open a terminal window to the directory containing the files , and type ' chmod +x install - superboot - linux.sh ' followed by './install-superboot-linux.sh '
Note :
Be careful what you do now you have root !
We do n't as yet have a recovery image or recovery flash ( but will soon ) , so if you badly break it , you might have to wait for a bit .
That 's it , job done !
Enjoy !

Apple stock may have taken a beating in the weeks since the iPhone 4 was released , dropping nearly eight percent as of Wednesday morning .
Nonetheless , indications remain that demand for the devices is brisk .
Consumers are n’t returning the phones much , despite word spreading about a reception issue that can plague the phone when held a certain way , and apparently supplies remain low at retail outlets .
Analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal said iPhone 4 buyers were keeping new iPhones without returning them at the same rates they normally do , also citing limited supplies at stores .
Multiple analysts told the WSJ they did not expect Apple to recall the devices despite this widely reported problem , because it “ occurs with only some units and is easily remedied by inserting the phone into a protective case . ”
Apparently I and everyone else who has seen this problem — including those who have run extensive tests to measure the resulting signal attenuation — happened to examine one of the models that exhibits the issue .
Others have n’t noticed it at all .
Meanwhile Consumer Reports , which boosted the controversy by writing that it “ ca n’t recommend ” the iPhone 4 ( while still rating it the best smartphone available ) , upped the ante Tuesday by demanding that Apple do something to remedy the situation :
In our reporting and a video yesterday , we made the point that the signal drop that iPhone 4 customers have observed when they hold their phones the “ wrong ” way is real — and we ’ve called on Apple to do something about it .
In an earlier statement , the company noted that attenuated performance is a “ fact of life ” for every wireless phone .
Apple suggested [ link ] owners mitigate the problem by holding the phone differently or purchasing a case .
But those solutions put the onus on consumers and skirt Apple ’s obligation to offer a product that works consistently and reliably out of the box .
We think it ’s the company ’s responsibility to provide the fix — at no extra cost to consumers .
If anything , one analyst said , Apple could end up giving a bumper case to each iPhone 4 customer , costing it an estimated $ 1 to $ 5 per customer and putting a one - percent ding in its annual operating profit .
Despite the antenna issue , analysts ’ outlook for iPhone sales remain strong and unchanged at 35 to 36 million units for the whole year .
These analysts may not be worried , but other people are , as indicated by this stock dip ( which an ongoing rally later Wednesday morning has yet to erase ) .
AAPL ’s plunge followed a string of successes .
In late May , Apple overtook Microsoft as the world ’s largest tech company for the first time , in no small part due to its success with the iPhone and other iOS devices like the iPod Touch and iPad .
With the conclusion of the G20 protests in Canada , the inevitable post - mortem dissection has begun in earnest .
Activists prepare to file lawsuits , organizers vow to do things differently next time , police pledge to investigate further , the media highlight the purported “ destruction ” before moving on to the next big story , and world leaders promise to continue their efforts unhampered by the misguided protesters .
And , as is by now par for the post - protest course , pretty much everyone seems to cast blame on “ the anarchists . ”
More recently , in the aftermath of the Oscar Grant verdict in Oakland , the media fan the flames by blaming the few stray acts of window - breaking and looting on “ self - described anarchists , ” while police officials emphasize that this de facto terrorist segment justifies their conduct vis -à - vis protesters in general .
More rifts develop in the streets , and although a tenuous solidarity is at times expressed as well , the lasting images once again are of anarchists acting in seemingly unproductive ways that put the interests and safety of larger movement contingents in jeopardy .
These are but two recent examples of a phenomenon that has been regularly played out in North America since at least the WTO protests in Seattle in 1999 .
Antipathy toward anarchists seems to have increased steadily since then , not only from corporate elites and law enforcement officials , but from a number of fellow movement participants as well .
Ironically , this comes at a time when interest in anarchism among activists has greatly expanded , and likewise when its impact upon American activism in general has seen a strong resurgence in recent years .
Critical voices regularly chastise anarchists without indicating that they fully understand what anarchism actually is .
But anarchists as well oftentimes seem to act in contravention of both historical and political senses of what anarchism represents .
This is further made problematic by the basic fact that anarchists generally eschew doctrinaire definitions and ideological litmus tests , suggesting that people ought to be free to define their own actions and ideas in the manner of their own choosing .
And yet , a kind of orthodoxy that increasingly seems like “ fundamentalist anarchism ” may be taking hold among some sectors that posture as “ real revolutionaries , ” who denigrate as “ pathological ” those who would seek to deploy their version of anarchism in less spectacular ways than overtly “ smashing the state ” by striking at some of its symbolic targets .
Interestingly , this plays right into the hands of the caricature of anarchism as violent , bomb - throwing , chaotic behavior that seems to be the first question one gets asked when their anarchism is presented in mixed company .
Indeed , I always enjoy getting that inevitable query : “ Is n’t anarchism just violence and destruction ? ”
To which I usually reply : “ How many people would you estimate have been killed by anarchists in the last hundred years ?
Now , how many would you say have been killed by liberals , or conservatives , in that time frame ?
If a lawyer or corporate manager were here before you now , would you ask about the blood on their hands or just let it slide as part of business as usual ?
The state did n’t save us from the violence of anarchy — it simply monopolized it , institutionalized it , and expanded its role in our lives . ”
I recently had the opportunity to facilitate a series of workshops on “ Anarchism and Nonviolence ” in the U.S. and Canada .
As one might expect , spirited conversations ensued in which many powerful young voices felt challenged by the notion of being nonviolent in a world that in their lifetimes has appeared as inherently violent .
Indeed , these issues get at the heart of matters of ethics , tactics , and visions for the future , comprising some of the most basic concerns for social movements and individual consciences alike .
One of the exercises we did in these workshops was to create a working definition of anarchism , and then one of nonviolence .
Comparing the two lists , many overlapping values emerged : self - governance , rejection of domination , respect and mutual aid , antiwar and anti-oppression practices , solidarity , a radical egalitarianism , and the politics of “ prefiguring ” the future society .
Further , it was pointed out that both notions , ( an ) archism and ( non) violence , trace their linguistic origins to the negation of something — yet have developed proactive self - definitions despite an initial reactive framing .
And the synergies do n’t end there .
Among the anarchist milieu , we find figures such as Emma Goldman , who dabbled in the use of revolutionary violence in her younger days but came to reject it in her later years .
She once told her comrade and coconspirator Alexander Berkman that “ violence in whatever form never has and probably never will bring constructive results , ” and further elucidated her position that “ methods and means cannot be separated from the ultimate aim .
The means employed become , through individual habit and social practice , part and parcel of the final purpose . ”
In the end , Goldman saw nonviolence and revolution as intertwined :
It is one thing to employ violence in combat as a means of defense .
It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism , to institutionalize it , to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle .
Such terrorism begets counter - revolution and in turn itself becomes counter - revolutionary . …
The one thing I am convinced of as I have never been in my life is that the gun decides nothing at all .
Even if it accomplishes what it sets out to do — which it rarely does — it brings so many evils in its wake as to defeat its original aim . …
If we can undergo changes in every other method of dealing with the social issues we will also have to learn to change in the methods of revolution .
I think it can be done .
If not , I shall relinquish my belief in revolution .
Ira Chernus , in chapter five of his book American Nonviolence , assesses Goldman ’s transition :
It is not surprising that Goldman eventually endorsed nonviolence .
Her anarchist views embraced the fundamental premises of the nonviolent abolitionists .
She believed that all people should be treated as equals because no one should have authority over another … .
She believed that when people do have authority over others they are coercing others , and thus they are bound to do violence .
She believed that no one could achieve right ends by wrong means .
Her anarchism also foreshadowed important ideas that would later shape the nonviolence tradition .
She believed that all power is based on consent .
No one can impose their authority upon another .
Another parallel to consider is the inherent anarchism of Mohandas Gandhi ’s worldview .
Known of course as an iconic figure of nonviolence , Gandhi likewise borrowed from and advanced many aspects of anarchism in his social and political philosophies .
As described by Josh Fattal in the Winter 2006 edition of Peace Power , Gandhi ’s anarchism was made plain in myriad ways :
Mohandas Gandhi opposed the State .
The State is the military , police , prisons , courts , tax collectors , and bureaucrats .
He saw the State as concentrated violence .
“ The State represents violence in a concentrated and organized form .
The individual has a soul , but as the State is a soulless machine , it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence . ”
Gandhi recognized that the State claims to serve the nation , but he realized that this was a fallacy .
“ While apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation , [ the State ] does the greatest harm to mankind . ”
According to Dr. Dhawan , Gandhi was a philosophical Anarchist because he believed that the “ [ the greatest good of all ] can be realized only in the classless , stateless democracy . ”
While Gandhi advocated democracy , he differentiated between direct democracy and western democracy … .
He had no more appetite for majority democracy of America ; “ It is a superstition and an ungodly thing to believe that an act of a majority binds a minority . ”
By centralizing power , western democracies feed into violence .
Thus , he thought decentralization was the key to world peace … .
Reiterating the idea of Anarchy , Gandhi said , “ In such a state ( of affairs ) , everyone is his own ruler .
He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbor . ” …
Gandhi ’s concept of swaraj elucidates the connection between the individual and society .
Swaraj translates into ‘ self - rule ’ or ‘ autonomy . ’…
The principle of swaraj ultimately leads to a grassroots , bottom - up , ‘ oceanic circle ’ of self - ruling communities .
Anarchists will recognize many familiar themes here , including autonomy , self - governance , decentralization , self - sufficiency , and a federated network of horizontal communities .
As Gandhi explained :
Independence begins at the bottom …
It follows , therefore , that every village has to be self - sustained and capable of managing its own affairs … .
In this structure composed of innumerable villages , there will be ever - widening , never ascending circles .
Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom .
But it will be an oceanic circle whose center will be the individual .
Therefore , the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it .
There are more such examples — as well as some that contradict the thesis being advanced here , of course — but a fuller exposition will necessarily await another opportunity .
The point of offering this nexus between anarchism and nonviolence at this juncture is simply to suggest that we look for ways to support and bolster both paradigms since they are increasingly coming into contact with one another in the real world of on - the - ground activism and organizing .
Rather than repeat useful but by now tired mantras about respecting a “ diversity of tactics , ” we might consider instead looking to generate a “ complementarity of tactics ” in which the choices we make are mutually - reinforcing .
This is particularly true in an era when provocateurs and propagandists alike can easily exploit the tensions among movement cohorts to denigrate all .
It seems to me that this is a matter of urgency for our movements .
I ’m not going to assert that my reading of anarchism as inherently nonviolent is somehow correct or true .
I am , however , strongly suggesting that anarchists consider the implications of the moment in which we find ourselves .
The “ useful idiot ” sense of anarchists becoming the justification for the escalating police state and all of its retributive techniques against activists in general has become palpable ( even as we recognize it as obviously fallacious and revisionist ) .
What worked once or even a few times as a tactic can grow stale when done repeatedly , and frankly begins to seem neither creative , spontaneous , or very anarchistic at this juncture .
Not to mention that it has created a situation so rife with the prospect of infiltration that it cannot even be certain any longer whether anarchists themselves are in fact guiding their own course of conduct and self - definitions .
This may not win me any new friends among fellow anarchists , yet it needs to be said : Anarchists ought to publicly and demonstrably proclaim their nonviolence , especially in the context of mass demonstrations .
This will make it clear that any violence done in that theater — which time and again is used to legitimize mass arrests , bloated police budgets , and the rest of the fascistic enterprise — is not the product of anarchists but more likely of agents of the state itself .
After all , that is the basic notion being advanced , is n’t it ?
To wit : the state ( including its corporate underwriters and beneficiaries ) is inherently violent both overtly and structurally ; anarchists above all reject the state and thus would do well to highlight the fundamental contrast .
“ The state is violent , and we are not ” would be a very good place to start the discussion .
( CNN ) -- Canada 's Cabinet ministers are in hot water for their government 's plans to spend nearly $ 2 million building a man-made lake for this month 's G20 summit .
The indoor lake , designed as part of a new complex in downtown Toronto for reporters covering the meeting , was one of several items that drew sharp criticism from left - wing legislators during a question period in Parliament Monday .
" Instead of hosting world leaders , maybe the government should consider party - planning for Lady Gaga , " Liberal MP Mark Holland said , claiming the country 's budget for hosting the event also included paying for " dancers , singers , fiddlers and flowers " with $ 20 million Canadian ( about $ 18.9 million U.S. dollars ) .
Critics said the lavish expenditures seemed out of place for a meeting that will focus on recovering from the global economic crisis .
But cabinet members defended the Canadian government 's plans as they faced shouts and heckles .
" It 's a normal practice for the host country of an international summit to use the opportunity to showcase all their country has to offer , and that is exactly what we 're doing ... and we 're going to be proud to showcase Canada to the world , contrary to what the Liberals want to do , " Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said .
The G8 summit will take place from June 25 - 26 at a lakeside resort north of Toronto .
About 3,000 journalists will cover the event from the media center in Toronto , which will also host the G20 summit from June 26 - 27 , Transport Minister John Baird said Monday .
" We 're proud of our government 's efforts to showcase this great country so it can be a magnet for jobs , investment and opportunity , " he said .
Toronto sits on the coast of Lake Ontario , one of the five Great Lakes .
" We 've got a government here that has to create an artificial lake , when Canada has more lakes than just about any other country in the world , " said MP Jack Layton , Canada 's social democratic party leader .
" The taxpayers are going to end up at the bottom of the fake lake . "
BERLIN — Beset by squabbling ever since it took office eight months ago , the center - right coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel met Sunday to try to reach agreement over how to save as much as € 10 billion a year in Germany ’s national budget from 2011 to 2016 .
“ This cabinet retreat will be an important part of the agenda for the development of the federal republic over the next few years , ” Mrs. Merkel said before beginning the talks , which will last until Monday .
“ It is vital that we readjust the balance between investment in the future and social welfare handouts , ” she said .
“ That can not just be done by simply increasing the revenue side .
It has to happen by making the structures of social security more efficient . ”
The need to find such savings comes amid the crisis in the euro that has prompted several European Union governments — particularly Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal — to make deep cuts to rein in their soaring budget deficits and protect the common currency .
Adopting such measures was one of the main conditions for the €750 billion , or $ 950 billion , bailout package that the euro - zone countries and the International Monetary Fund recently agreed to .

PC = PHP Classes ( Manuel Lemos )
PFA = PHP For Android ( Iván Mosquera Paulo )
PC : First of all , congratulations for your initiative to bring PHP to the Android platform .
Can you please start to talk a bit about yourself , who you are , where you work , what you do and your background in the PHP and Android scene ?
PFA : I am Iván Mosquera .
I am a software engineer at I am Iván Mosquera .
I am a software engineer at Irontec .
We are an Open Source company started 7 years ago .
We are involved in a lot of Open Source projects with all kind of companies and government institutions .
We develop our own VOIP solution based on Asterisk with an extra layer composed of several other projects .
Iván Mosquera Paulo is a lead developer of the PHP For Android project .
He gave the following interview .
PHP is one of our regular tools .
We have been a PHP company since our beginings .
We are also working on our own PHP meta - framework called Karma .
Apart from the PHP For Android project , I am also the lead developer of Evosugar ( SugarCRM evolution integration plugin ) .
We are focusing on Open Source technologies , so Android is the obvious choice now .
Last year we were involved in a few projects with Vodafone on which we developed a few Android apps in Java .
However , our main tool is PHP .
We knew about the existence of ASE ( Android Scripting Environment ) .
So we started working in supporting PHP For Android .
PC : Can you please describe a bit in more detail what is the goal of the PHP For Android project and why did you start it ?
PFA : Yes , of course .
Its first goal was providing support to ASE ( Android Scripting Environment ) , recently renamed as SL4A ( Scripting Layer for Android ) .
We were going to submit quite a big patch to achieve it , but it happened that the ASE folks were working in a refactoring .
This refactoring was about making new interpreter support external to their project .
That was when we thought about creating PHPForAndroid .
net .
It is quite inspired on PHP . net .
I mean , this project is not only about developing tools or apps .
It is about helping PHP developers to get into the Android world for the first time without requiring to have a Java background .
So the first goal is achieved .
It is already possible using PHP For Android with our unofficial ASE build and our PhpForAndroid - APK .
The next big thing is the script to APK issue .
This is something killer in which the ASE ( well , now S4LA ) people are working and we are studying to support it and write documentation or tools ease it .
Scripting for Android is no more geeky stuff thanks to the latest features .
We see a lot of potential in PHP For Android in custom apps like tracking your position and posting it depending in X conditions ...
The ASE API is quite big , the limit might be in the GUI but that is not really a problem in a lot of applications and we might work on improving that GUI API .
PC : It is interesting that you mentioned you work on Asterisk applications .
There was a recent show in the TWIT network about FLOSS , on the It is interesting that you mentioned you work on Asterisk applications .
There was a recent show in the TWIT network about FLOSS , on the Askozia PBX project which also uses PHP and jQuery to implement Asterisk appliances with user friendly Web interfaces .
But tell me , does the PHP For Android project allows PHP developers to build native Android applications , or is it something that still requires a Web server to run on the Android phone devices ?
PFA : Our APK distributes a PHP - CLI binary , cross-compiled , linked to bionic ( Android 's libc ) and just two extensions built - in , those required to talk to ASE : sockets and JSON .
We may improve the binary with the help of the community of course .
So , no webserver required in Android .
It is PHP - CLI and you have GUI access thanks to ASE 's RPC server .
A frequently asked question is whether PHP - GTK is possible to run on Android .
Well , AFAIK no because of the fact that Android lacks an X server .
PC : Interesting , but I just seen a video showing an implementation of KDE running on an Android device .
Are you familiar with it ?
PFA : I heard something about that but I am not sure if it is really being used .
We knew about ASE and we liked what the Python community already had .
And we thought , why not ?
Lets go for PHP support .
Anyway , we are interested in other paths as well .
It would be great having GTK for example .
PC : Right , X on Android devices is not a new thing , but I suppose that is not widely spread .
So , basically what does it take to have installed in Android phone to get PHP developers started ?
PFA : We have put up a We have put up a screencast showing the current process .
Firstly , you need to install our own ASE build because current ASE ( r25 ) does not support the features needed by PHP For Android .
Once installed , it is time to install PhpForAndroid.apk .
It is an Android app which installs : the PHP binary , our Android PHP class ( ported from the Python ) and a few PHP script samples .
Once PHP For Android is installed , you should have those scripts available on Android and they should work .
The easiest way to test the API and having fun is including your own remote code .
All these steps can be watched in the screencast .
PC : Do PHP developers need to have real Android phones or are there any simulators that can be used to try PHP on Android ?
PFA : Good question .
No , you do not need a real Android phone .
You can play with the Android emulator .
We might provide more info on this in our wiki .
What you see in the screencast is the emulator with a skin .
If you have an Android phone you need to know that Android OS 1.5 is required .
PC : Are there any fees that developers need to pay to get access to SDKs and other developer materials to start working on PHP on Android applications ?
PFA : No .
They are free software : gratis y libre .
( gratis y libre is Spanish , in English it is the same word for both things : free )
PC : So , if somebody builds an Android application in PHP what he / she needs to do to make the application available on Android App Store ?
Is it possible already ?
Do you provide any tools to assist in that process ?
PFA : That is the next big thing .
That is a feature ASE developers are working on and according to them , it is already working .
We will see how it works and how easy it is for a PHP developer .
We might provide tools and documentation to ease the process .
PC : I suppose that a PHP applications needs to also have installed your packages first in the Android device , right ?
There are many Android devices in the market from different brands .
Are the Android application installers device independent or do you need to have a specific PHP on Android runtime for each type of device ?
PFA : All the current devices are ARM based and the PHP binary we provide is cross-compiled for ARM devices , so it should work out of the box on them .
It is like an almost static PHP binary that you copy from a PC to another .
It works and does not matter if it is AMD or Intel based .
We have heard about issues in ASE with a few devices but it is usually something related to a missing library , not really a common problem by now .
PC : Great .
So in terms of developing PHP applications for Android , what is the current state of your project ?
Is it ready for starting developing interesting Android applications or only basic ones ?
PFA : Now
It is time to have fun .
Try the ASE API , test our PHP binary , explore ASE 's API limits .
Once the script as APK feature is available we will be able to build Android apps with our code .
Only basic ones ?
Well , it depends on Now It is time to have fun .
Try the ASE API , test our PHP binary , explore ASE 's API limits .
Once the script as APK feature is available we will be able to build Android apps with our code .
Only basic ones ?
Well , it depends on ASE 's API , which is a bit basic about GUI stuff but very interesting on the backend .
Besides , there is another path which is mixing both aproaches .
TwoFortyFourAM for example , I think it uses Python scripts as backend .
So you do not need a whole Java team to achieve it .
We have worked with that logic in a few desktop projects .
Building the view with Swing and using PHP scripts in the backend powered by Quercus .
Adding scripting to a Java app can be an interesting approach .
PC : OK , can you give a few examples of interesting applications you can already develop in PHP with this project ?
PFA : For example GPS logging and For example GPS logging and mctl .
Well , mctl is our way to talk about a protocol used by Irontec when Jabi Infante and Gorka Gorrotxategi ( CTO ) went to Mongolia by car
You take your position via GPS and then you can send data using missed calls against a few DID numbers which represent binary encoded data .
For example , you want to transfer the number 1 ( 0000001 ) so you can make a missed call to the first DID .
It was a little bit complex because they had to start and stop the transfer , checksum and so on .
It was a whole protocol :) .
So , as I have said , you can already have fun with PHP For Android with ideas like this one .
PC : Great , sounds like you implemented some advanced hacks .
Another question , most PHP applications are MySQL based .
Is MySQL already available , or at least SQLite , for use in PHP Android applications ?
PFA : I do n't think so .
I do n't know whether there is some kind of database storage exposed by the ASE API .
Anyway , Android phones are usually Internet based , so you can think of PHP For Android in a role like JavaScript in Web applications , you can call server code .
And this is related to the built - in extensions on PHP .
We want to keep the binary as light as possible but the discussion is open .
PC : Right , I guess at least SQLite can be shipped built - in because it is very simple and does not require any external servers or libraries .
Now a bit on the market and business opportunities .
The Android phone market seems to have exploded lately in reach .
We hear about 5 million Android smart phones of many different brands being sold around the world just in the last month .
Do you think your project can represent a good opportunity for the developers to make even more money selling Android applications or providing other services , than they would doing regular PHP Web applications ?
What is your guess ?
PFA : I hope so .
Apple does not want PHP developers , they want you to invest in their technology .
With Android , you have freedom of choice : Java , AIR , scripting ( Python , now PHP , ... ) .
Besides , a lot of Web developers might try Android development thanks to PFA .
They can reuse their current know - how .
PC : Good .
Another commercial concern , I suppose your project requires PHP applications to be installed with PHP code .
Commercial developers would have concerns about customers ripping their PHP code .
Do you recommend any solution for protecting the PHP applications source code from being stollen or altered ?
Do you think for instance Facebook 's Hip - Hop PHP to C++ compiler could be used to solve that problem ?
PFA : Well , we are an Open Source company .
So we are not really worried about that .
However I understand that there might be people interested in using a different commercial policy .
Hip - Hop , can be interesting .
Obfuscation is sometimes used in Web development .
Anyway , we recommend a more open policy .
PC : OK .
So , what are your immediate plans for the future of this project ?
PFA : We want people involved in sharing scripts , testing , discussion , learning ASE 's API , have fun .
The script as APK feature provided by SL4A will be the next big thing .
PC : Are you looking for help in your project ?
If so , what other developers can do to join you and help evolving the project faster ?
PFA : Any PHP developer can help sharing scripts .
We will give them credit , of course .
Besides , testing is needed , and documentation , we want to have some kind of PFA official manual .
Speaking about the internals , a bit Java and PHP compiling knowledge may be necessary , maybe a bit of C too .
However , I think that this is not so important now .
We can already work with the current release .
PC : Great .
Is there anything else you would like to say besides what was asked , maybe how other developers or companies can get in touch with your company ?
PFA : You can get in touch with our company via email ( info at irontec.com ) .
Besides that , we usually talk about the things we do in You can get in touch with our company via email ( info at irontec.com ) .
Besides that , we usually talk about the things we do in our blog Irontec 's Twitter account is also very active .
For contacting about PHPForAndroid project , the best way is to join the project mailing list
PC : Thank you very much for this interview .
Good luck for your project .
PFA : Thanks , great interview .

Veteran US
White House reporter Helen Thomas has retired after making controversial remarks about Israel .
In an interview on 27 May , she said that Israelis should get " the hell out of Palestine " and suggested they went to Germany , Poland or the US .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said her comments were " offensive and reprehensible " .
She has since apologised .
Thomas , 89 , was the longest - serving reporter in the White House .
She has spent most of her career working for United Press International wire service , but had been working as a columnist for Hearst newspapers since 2000 .
Analysis
The veteran correspondent and columnist has been a feature of life at the White House since the early days of the Kennedy administration .
To withdraw from active duty at the age of 89 might not seem so remarkable , but Helen Thomas 's fall from grace , from a coveted front row seat at White House briefings to retirement amid a chorus of denunciation , was abrupt .
It 's an ignominious end to a career which began in 1943 , when Thomas joined the wire service United Press International .
" Helen Thomas announced Monday that she is retiring , effective immediately , " Hearst news reported .
" Her decision came after her controversial comments about Israel and the Palestinians were captured on videotape and widely disseminated on the internet . "
Thomas 's remarks were made in a video interview with the website RabbiLive.com , when she was asked whether she had any " comments on Israel " .
" Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine , " she said .
" Remember these people are occupied and it's their land , not Germany and not Poland .
" They can go home , Poland , Germany , and America and everywhere else , " she added .
On Monday the White House Correspondents ' Association issued a statement praising Helen Thomas 's " long and distinguished career in journalism " .
" Along the way , she shattered many glass ceilings , including serving as the first female president of the White House Correspondents ' Association , " the statement said .
" We are saddened by her recent comments , but we commend her for a trailblazing career , and we wish her the best . "
Her comments also sparked criticism from the Obama administration and led to her being dropped as graduation speaker for a local high school .
Remember these people are occupied and it's their land , not Germany and not Poland Helen Thomas , Former White House reporter Bitter end for ' press corps dean '
In an e-mail to parents explaining the change , Alan Goodwin , principal of Walt Whitman High School in Maryland , said that " graduation celebrations are not the venue for divisiveness " .
On her website , Thomas said she regretted her comments .
" They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognise the need for mutual respect and tolerance .
May that day come soon . "
* Obama administration working on revised drill ban
* Alex casts more crude into beaches , marshlands
* Investors see leadership change avoiding takeover
* BP resumes booming , spraying dispersants ( Adds companies ’ court filing , graphs 3 - 5 , BP investors , graph 8 , 9 )
By Kristen Hays
HOUSTON , July 2 ( Reuters ) - Washington was preparing a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium and cleanup efforts in the Gulf of Mexico returned to normal on Friday after hurricane Alex passed through the region without doing major damage .
The U.S. Interior Department , one of the departments spearheading the response to the BP BP.
LBP .
N oil spill , could issue a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium for U.S. waters in the coming week .
A federal court last week lifted a six - month drilling ban imposed by the Obama administration after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history .
The administration has appealed the court ’s ruling , but drilling companies filed papers on Friday opposing the administration ’s appeal .
The companies said the administration failed to show how it balanced competing interests when it imposed the drilling ban on all exploration and development below 500 feet ( 152 meters ) .
The revised moratorium is expected to be more flexible and could be adjusted to allow drilling in certain subsea fields .
In another political development , bipartisan lawmakers on Friday sought tax breaks for mostly small business to help cushion the economic blow from the disaster , which has devastated Gulf fishing and tourist industries .
[ n N02164696 ]
U.S. senators from Florida , Mississippi and other spill - hit states asked the leaders of the Senate ’s tax - writing finance committee to back tax relief aimed at boosting economies in states with thousands of workers displaced by the spill .
The Financial Times said on its website that BP investors expect to see a change in the company ’s leadership , possibly once the leak is capped , with both Chief Executive Tony Hayward and Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg in jeopardy . [ n N02241830 ]
Without steps to steady the ship , BP could become a takeover target of companies like ExxonMobil XOM.N , Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L or PetroChina 601857.SS , the FT said , citing a source working on BP 's strategy .
BP ’s cleanup operations , interrupted this week by choppy seas and gusty winds from Alex , were getting back to normal as the storm weakened and passed through the spill area off the coast of Louisiana , company spokesman Mark Proegler said .
Those operations included containment booming and flights to spray dispersant chemicals on the water 's surface , he said .

Alex had pushed more crude onto beaches and marshes along the U.S. Gulf coast , hampering efforts to clean up the oil leaking from the BP ’s blown - out undersea well .
BP said its oil - capture systems collected or burned off more than 25,000 barrels of oil on Thursday .
Robert Dudley , chief of BP ’s Gulf Coast restoration efforts , said high seas and winds had propelled the landward advance of the far - flung oil slick .
“ It has brought in oil , unfortunately , from the panhandle of Florida to Louisiana ... at a higher rate than it has been over the last few days , ” he said in a PBS online interview .
Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the government ’s point person for the spill response , said his team was ready to begin flights to assess storm damage to boom and check for oil -- particularly in Louisiana ’s marshland .
He said absorbent snare boom will initially be used to soak up oil where waves from the hurricane pushed crude inland .
In a move to help wildlife , environmental groups , BP and the U.S. Coast Guard reached tentative agreement on Friday on measures to prevent sea turtles from being incinerated alive in controlled burns of the spilled ill , one of the containment methods being deployed .
Under the accord , the parties agreed to a plan allowing biologists or other trained wildlife observers to accompany oil - incineration vessels at sea to remove as many turtles as possible from designated areas before burning starts .
BP ’s cleanup operations , involving nearly 43,000 personnel and more than 7,000 vessels , were halted on Tuesday as weather conditions worsened with the approach of Alex .
Allen said seas were still rough but skimming operations should resume soon .
The National Hurricane Center is monitoring a new weak low pressure system over the northeast Gulf of Mexico that is drifting west toward the BP spill area .
Even though the center only gave the system a low chance of developing into a tropical depression , its location could further hamper cleanup efforts and scatter more oil after Alex churned up Gulf waters .
Meteorologists have warned that this hurricane season , which began on June 1 , is likely to be one of the most intense in years , with as many as five major tropical storms expected .
DRILL BAN CONCERNS
The Obama administration ’s drill ban targeted exploratory and development wells in more than 500 feet of water to give a special commission time to investigate the spill and propose safety regulations .
But oil companies and many U.S. lawmakers said the moratorium would force U.S. oil rig operators to take their business to other countries , making the United States more reliant on oil imports and at a higher risk for oil spills from the big tankers bringing in the crude .
The Gulf of Mexico holds the most promising untapped crude oil reserves in the United States , and a string of major discoveries over the past decade by companies including BP have rejuvenated investment in deeper and more difficult waters .
The head of oil major Total TOTF .
PA warned of tougher safety rules that could push up crude prices and said it was necessary to drill in deep - water fields to meet global demand .
“ Our policy is clearly towards zero risk , ” The Wall Street Journal quoted Total CEO Christophe de Margerie as saying on Friday .
“ All this means ... potential additional costs , ” he said , warning oil prices could reach $ 90 a barrel by year end .

Long before Velcro was invented , a species of South American ant used its own natural form of the wonder material to hunt .
The claws of Azteca andreae are shaped like hooks and fit neatly into fibrous loops on the undersides of its home plants ' leaves .
It 's " like natural Velcro that is reinforced by the group ambush strategy of the workers , allowing them to capture prey of up to 13,350 times the mean weight of a single worker , " wrote researchers in a study published June 25 in PLoS One .
A. andreae colonies live in trees , and individual ants line the underside edges of leaves , jaws open and outstretched .
When an insect lands , the ants seize its legs , holding it down until other ants dismember the pinioned prey .
In the new study , the researchers held weighted threads in front of the ants .
Instinctively , the ants bit and held .
Without losing its grip , the average worker could hold on to 8 grams , or some 5,700 times its body weight .
In proportional terms , that 's like a house cat holding on to a humpback whale .
Passing insects do n't have a chance .
The ants keep their grip best while on Cecropia obtusa leaves , where the surface loops are pronounced .
The two species seem to have co-evolved : A. andreae provides defense against plant - munching bugs , and C. obtusa helps the ants get a predatory grip .
Another , less gruesome example of Velcro - like plant - insect interaction was recently described between bumblebees and flower petals , which have microscopic loops that enable bees to hang upside - down with little effort .

The final inquiry report on the death of Robert Dziekanski has concluded the RCMP were not justified in using a Taser against the Polish immigrant and that the officers later deliberately misrepresented their actions to investigators .
The long - awaited report , by retired B.C. Court of Appeal justice Thomas Braidwood , was released Friday in Vancouver .
Braidwood was commissioned by the B.C. government to investigate the actions of the four RCMP officers who confronted and subdued Dziekanski on Oct. 14 , 2007 , at Vancouver International Airport .
Braidwood said the four officers involved initially acted appropriately , but the senior corporal intervened in an inappropriately aggressive manner .

" I found that Mr. Dziekanski had been compliant and was not defiant or resistant , did not brandish the stapler , did not move towards any of the officers , " he said .
" I concluded that the constable was not justified in deploying the weapon and that neither the constable nor the corporal honestly perceived that Mr. Dziekanski was intending to attack any of the officers , " he said .
Officers misrepresented actions
Braidwood concluded the officers later deliberately misrepresented what happened at the airport to justify their actions .
" I also concluded that the two other officers during their testimony before me offered patently unbelievable after - the - fact rationalizations of their notes and their statements " to the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team , Braidwood said .
" I found all four officers ’ claims that they wrestled Mr. Dziekanski to the ground were deliberate misrepresentations made for the purpose of justifying their actions . "
Braidwood said the officers ( clockwise from top left ) Const .
Gerry Rundel , Const .
Bill Bentley , Cpl. Monty Robinson and Const. Kwesi Millington deliberately misrepresented their actions during investigations of the incident .
( CBC )
" I also disbelieved the four officers ’ claims there was no discussion between or among them about the incident before being questioned by IHIT investigators , although I did not conclude that they colluded to fabricate a story . "
" From this review I drew two final conclusions , " he said .
" Despite their training , the officers approached the incident as though responding to a barroom brawl and failed to shift gears when they realized that they were dealing with an obviously distraught traveller . "
" This tragic case is at its heart a story of shameful conduct by a few officers .
It ought not to reflect unfairly on the many thousands of RCMP and other police officers who have , through years of public service , protected our communities and earned a well - deserved reputation for doing so . "
Criminal charges left to Crown
Braidwood said he would leave any further questions about possible charges against the officers for the Crown to decide .
In his conclusions , he called on the B.C. government to establish a civilian - led body to investigate similar police incidents in the future .
Braidwood also applauded improvements made by at the Vancouver International Airport since the Dziekanski's death , but criticized the Canada Border Services Agency for making only " minor and few " changes .
After the release of the report , B.C. Attorney General Mike de Jong said he was appointing a special independent prosecutor to re-examine the airport Taser incident in light of Braidwood 's findings .
De Jong also said the government was accepting all of Braidwood 's recommendations and moving immediately to set up a new civilian - led body to oversee investigations of police in B.C .
Confronted in arrivals lounge
Dziekanski died after being stunned multiple times by RCMP officers using a Taser .
The 40 - year - old Polish immigrant , who spoke no English , had been wandering in the international arrival area for several hours , unable to communicate with anyone , while he waited for his mother to drive from the B.C. Interior to meet him .
RCMP officers at the Vancouver airport discharged a Taser five times while restraining Dziekanski on Oct. 14 , 2007 .
( submitted by Paul Pritchard )
He became distraught and angry , prompting airport staff to call police .
Within 30 seconds of arriving at the lounge , the four RCMP officers surrounded him and knocked him to the ground with one Taser stun , then pulled the trigger four more times .
By the time medical help arrived , Dziekanski was dead .
Initially , police said Dziekanski had attacked the officers , but a digital camera video taken by a bystander raised questions about the RCMP account and became the key piece of evidence in the inquiry .
No officers were ever charged in the death and the RCMP defended the handling of the incident , saying Dziekanski was advancing at the officers when he was stunned with the Taser .
Before the report was released , Dziekanski's mother , Zofia Cisowski , said she believed there was no doubt about the role the Mounties played in her son 's death .
" That was torture .
That was execution , because nobody help him .
He should n't [ have ] died on the floor , but I see that , " Cisowski told CBC News Thursday .
Braidwood also released a previous report last July that was critical of police guidelines on their use of Tasers and other conducted energy weapons .
It ’s been 16 months since President George W. Bush left office , but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made it clear that she will continue to blame the former president ’s policies for the country ’s financial and economic problems .
In an interview that aired Friday on MSNBC , Chuck Todd asked the highest - ranking Democrat in the House if there was a statue of limitations on placing responsibility on President Bush .

“ At what point do you think the public says , ‘ You know what , yes , we were unhappy with the Bush administration … [ but ] stop blaming the Bush administration . ’
When does that run out ? ” asked MSNBC ’s Chuck Todd .
“ Well , it runs out when the problems go away , ” Pelosi replied .
“ Here ’s what the president inherited .
He inherited a deficit , when this president [ Bush ] inherited from the Clinton administration four budgets that were either in surplus or in balance .
And he turned it into a massive deficit .
He Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦ brought us to the brink of a financial crisis .
He brought us to the brink of deep recession , ignoring issues that relate to climate change . ”
“ It ’s clear that while some Democrats are n’t sure whether ‘ blame Bush ’ is still a viable campaign tactic , the speaker believes it is , ” MSNBC ’s First Read blog declared .
Pelosi sounded an optimistic note about the Democrats ’ chances of holding on to the House of Representatives in this year ’s mid-term elections .
“ Take it to the bank , ” Pelosi said .

She added : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m very pleased with how the primaries have been going in terms of the votes that my members have received .
Looking at the other side and who the challengers are , I feel pretty good about it .

When businessman Harry Murray hit cash - flow problems , he never dreamt his bank would stop his company 's overdraft and freeze its assets , especially as his joinery firm had a full order book .
Despite the downturn in the housing market , Mr Murray 's firm was still securing orders for the crafted staircases it produced from a unit in a residential street in Staffordshire .
" I had no choice but to sell the factory and we paid the bank back every single penny I owed , which I wish to God I never did , " he told BBC File on 4 .
Four months later , the business is operating again , run by his daughter , as a tenant of the factory 's new owners .
The bank told me they would loan me £ 2 m if I gave them £ 2 m first ... if I had £ 2 m , why would I want it in the first place ?
Omer Kutluoglu , Businessman
" I showed the bank I had contracts in the pipeline and I had them written down ... if they 'd just had an ounce of trust in businesses , it could be a completely different story now . "
Mr Murray is annoyed that his bank , Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , which is 84 % owned by the taxpayer , was saved by government money , but could not help him .
Finance obstacles
" If they can be bailed out on a scale like that , why can't they just help a small business like myself , " he added .
Another businessman who is aggrieved at his treatment by RBS , Omer Kutluoglu , has found that even when the bank agrees to lend , its terms are too harsh .
He believes there will be great demand for his product , an alternative to plywood boards using recycled plastic .
Mr Kutluoglu had secured £ 9 m from venture capitalists and £ 500 k from the East of England development agency , but wanted £ 2 m from his bank .

" The bank told me they would loan me £ 2 m if I gave them £ 2 m first .
I was dumbfounded .
I said , ' If I had £ 2 m , why would I want it in the first place ? ' " he said .
The business eventually got finance from a Belgian bank .
Peter Ibbotson , RBS 's small business chairman , denied the bank lacks sympathy for small businesses , and said 17 out of 20 businesses who apply for loans get the finance immediately .
He said in the case of Mr Kutluoglu 's business he said , " We believe we did the right thing for the taxpayer . "
In the case of Mr Murray , Mr Ibbotson said : " We worked with Mr Murray over about a year and a half in difficult times , and we got to the position at the end where we felt the right thing to do for the bank and for the taxpayer was to work with Mr Murray and work out how he could repay the facility . "
Cable 's pledge
Business Secretary Vince Cable , who was a vocal critic of the banks in opposition , has promised a redoubling of his efforts to make the partly state - owned banks lend more to British businesses .

" We have to change them and make them open for business , " he told File on 4 .
" We have agreements and banks have not been able to meet them .
The question is , how we can give them more teeth and also get more information as the process is very opaque , making the banks report more accurately what they are doing . "
But Mr Cable could not specify how the government could enforce its policy and he added : " There 's no silver bullet , there 's no single mechanical formula , the chancellor and I are going to meet the leading banks to explain the problem .
" Businesses are going to have to be a little bit patient .
We will be talking to the banks .
" What is important is that we get banks lending to good British companies .
It is the results that matter rather than the means . "

Buckingham Palace today barred the BNP leader , Nick Griffin , from a garden party hosted by the Queen .
The palace said it had withdrawn Griffin 's invitation because he had " blatantly " sought to use his attendance for party political purposes .
Griffin described the decision as " an outrage " and " thoroughly anti-British " and blamed the government for putting pressure on Buckingham Palace to withdraw his invitation .
The palace denied him entry following an interview given by Griffin to GMTVtoday and after he posted a message on the BNP website asking supporters for questions to ask the monarch .
Buckingham Palace issued a statement that said Griffin 's use of the invitation for " party political purposes " had increased the security risk as well as the possible " discomfort " of other guests .
Unite Against Fascism said the decision to bar the far right leader was " fantastic " .
Griffin told GMTV that his attendance would not embarrass the Queen , citing his democratic mandate .
He and fellow BNP member Andrew Brons were automatically eligible for a garden party ticket in their capacity as elected members of the European parliament .
In an entry on his blog on Wednesday , Griffin told BNP followers that he would attend " to represent the patriots who made this possible ; I 'll be there for you " and asked for their thoughts on what he should say " if – presumably due to some ghastly blunder by a courtier – I actually meet her ? "
Today Buckingham
Palace said it had decided to rescind the invitation .
In a statement , the palace said : " Nick Griffin MEP will be denied entry to today 's garden party at Buckingham Palace due to the fact he has overtly used his personal invitation for party political purposes through the media .
This in turn has increased the security threat and the potential discomfort to the many other guests also attending .
The statement added : " Mr Griffin 's personal invitation was issued to him as an elected member of the European parliament .
The decision to deny him entry is not intended to show any disrespect to the democratic process by which the invitation was issued .
However , we would apply the same rules to anyone who would try to blatantly politicise their attendance in this way . "
Griffin was due to be among the 8,000 guests at the event , hosted by the Queen and also attended by the Duke of Edinburgh .
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said that Brons 's invitation to the garden party had not been revoked as he had not " exploited " it for political ends .
But Griffin 's guests – thought to be his wife and children – could not attend as he had been barred .
Other members of the royal family who will be mingling on the palace 's lawns include the Duke of York , The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent .
Griffin said the Palace 's reason was " invented nonsense " and that it was " thoroughly anti-British " to hold him by different standards to everyone else .
The MEP for the north - west said he did not " blame the Queen " and claimed Buckingham Palace was under " enormous pressure from the Lib - Con coalition " to withdraw his invite .
He maintained he had a mandate from a million British people and had a right to attend .
" Nowhere in the book of rules given to all attendees does it say anything about not giving media interviews and of course countless people have done precisely that in the past , " he said .
He added : " It is an attack on the right of every person in Britain to get the news of current events reported by the media , and it is an attack on the one million plus patriots who voted for the BNP .
The move has obviously been made under pressure from the ConDem regime who are desperate for any reason to bar the BNP . "
To add to Griffin 's woes , he was confronted by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell , who accused him of being a " gutless coward " as he was leaving BBC studios at Westminster yesterday afternoon .
A Unite Against Fascism spokesman said it was delighted by Buckingham Palace 's move .
" I think this is a fantastic decision that 's been taken .
The invitation in the first place was a blow for those who suffered in the Holocaust and more recently those who have suffered at the hands of racists and homophobes .
" The fact he was invited anyway is a little bit concerning .
The palace needs to understand and the establishment in general , who are giving these privileges , that the whole point of him being so excited about going is because it gives him the chance to legitimise himself . "
Griffin pulled out of a similar event last year following a public outcry , claiming he had " no wish to embarrass the Queen " by attending .
Speaking on GMTV this morning , Griffin said : " This time it 's totally different – 800,000 people voted for us in the European elections and I was voted an MEP . "
He added : " The palace have made it very , very clear that they will not discriminate against any elected MEP and I think that 's the proper thing to do , so there 's no embarrassment there at all . "
Thirty - six female Holland fans were thrown out of their country 's game against Denmark at Soccer City after Fifa officials accused them of wearing orange mini-dresses to promote an unlicensed beer brand .
South African newspaper the Star said the women were accused of " ambush marketing " .
Fifa only allows promotional activity by firms that have official Fifa sponsor status .
A spokesman for the Bavaria beer company denied that the women had any links to their campaign , and said the group had been detained in a Fifa office for several hours .
" It 's a nice dress .
Very fashionable , " Peer Swinkels told the Star .
" In my opinion , people should have the right to wear whatever they want .
" We launched the orange item on 30 April on the queen 's birthday .
The Dutch people are a little crazy about orange and we wear it on public holidays and events like the World Cup .
There is no branding on the dresses .
And Fifa do n't have a monopoly over orange . "
One of the women , Barbara Kastein , told the newspaper : " We were sitting near the front , making a lot of noise , and the cameras kept focusing on us .
We were singing songs and having a good time .
But in the second half , about 40 stewards surrounded us and forced us to leave the stadium .
They pushed us up the stairs , and one of the girls fell . "
Kastein said the women were questioned by Fifa , and then by the police .
" The police came and kept on asking us the same questions over and over , asking if we worked for Bavaria .
They said we were ambush - marketing and it was against the law in South Africa .
They said we would be arrested and would stay in jail for six months .
Girls were crying .
It was bad .
" A police van took us back to our hotel and they wanted my passport .
They made a copy and said they would investigate .
They said they would sue me .
All of this for wearing an orange dress . "
Fifa told the Star there were no arrests and that " several young South African women were used by a large Dutch brewery as an instrument for an ambush - marketing campaign " .
From Wimbledon :
It was when the scoreboard packed in at 47 games apiece in the fifth set that you genuinely began to fear for the players ' sanity .
When France 's Nicolas Mahut and the USA 's John Isner strolled out on to Court 18 just before 1400 BST on Wednesday to polish off their first round match , two sets apiece , barely anyone gave them a second look .
The first set had lasted 32 minutes , the second 29 .
" A quick spot of tennis , " you can imagine a spectator saying , " and then we 'll pop off for lunch . "
Just over seven hours later , the score locked at 59 games each , nobody would have been surprised to hear a Red Cross aeroplane drone overhead and start dropping food parcels .
At 10 - 10 we raised eyebrows .
At 20 - 20 people stopped talking about the England game and started using the " really ? " word .
At 30 - 30 people began rushing from Centre Court and looking for shoulders to stand on .
Seats ?
The last one of those 782 spaces went about 1700 BST , when the set had been in progress for a mere three hours .
At 33 - 32 , Isner had two match points .
When he failed to take them , he slumped to the ground and called for a banana .
At least I think he did .
He may have called for his mother .
At 33 games apiece , the record for the highest number of games in a single match went .
Farewell , Pancho Gonzales and Charlie Pasarell , with your mere 112 games over five sets and frankly laughable 11 - 9 in the final set .
40 - 40 came and went .
Court - side , admiration turned to laughter turned to disbelief .
Men who had sat down clean shaven scratched their straggly beards .
Ball - boys became ball - men .

Throughout it all , Isner looked moments away from collapse .
That he stayed on his feet seemed to defy medical science .
Mahut tried skipping along the baseline to show how fresh he felt .
It was probably unnecessary .
When you 've served to stay in the match more than 50 times , no - one 's going to question your stamina .
Six hours in , packed in like a sweaty sardine with hundreds of other rapt disbelievers , I started to worry about the supporting cast .
Umpire Mohamed Lahyani had n't moved from his chair for the entire duration , let alone taken a courtesy break .
In the BBC commentary box , a chap named Ronald McIntosh could have been forgiven for sobbing into his microphone .
This was the first tennis match he had ever commentated on .
" Stick him out on Court 18 , " the Beeb director had thought .
" Let him cut his teeth on something minor . "
Instead , as the sun disappeared behind the blocks of flats in Southfields , Ron was uttering the immortal words : " To the 104th game we go . "
Somewhere in a rented house nearby , a Dutchman named Thiemo De Bakker was likely to have been laughing uncontrollably .
Why ?
De Bakker is due to play the winner of this match in the second round .
In the first round earlier in the day he had beaten Santiago Giraldo 16 - 14 in the final set , and probably worried that he might feel a little jaded in the next round .
The stats kept piling up .
The two men had clocked up more hours than Serena Williams had in winning the entire championship last year .
Isner ( 98 ) and Mahut ( 95 ) both smashed the record for the most aces in a match .
The previous best ?
Ivo Karlovic 's 78 in a Davis Cup tie in 2009 .
If that was dwarfed , so was everything else .
Mahut got his first break point of the set at 50 - 50 , and promptly lost it .
We should n't have been surprised ; there had only been two breaks of serve in the entire match .
Without the two earlier tie - breaks , where would we be ?
At 59 - 59 , an even more flabbergasting fact on a day of staggering firsts : the fifth set alone had lasted longer than any other professional match in tennis history .
If it was utterly compelling , it was also almost frightening .
Both men looked glassy - eyed , unable to respond to the slightest change of direction .
The longest boxing match ever fought took place in New Orleans in April 1893 and lasted 111 rounds .
By the point darkness brought the epic here to an overnight break , at 2110 BST , the players looked almost as shattered as Andy Bowen and Jack Burke had back then .
In the gloaming , the greats lined up to gasp .
" I 'm so proud , " said John McEnroe .
" This is the greatest advert we 've ever had for our sport beyond the Roger - Rafa final .
Our respect levels in tennis will go up so much after this .
I am amazed that these guys are still standing . "
Roger Federer was next .
" It 's absolutely amazing .
It 's a very special match .
This is unheard of in our game .
I do n't know if I was crying or laughing , it was too much .
I can relate to it to some little degree - but this is beyond anything . "
" You ca n't comprehend it , " muttered Tim Henman .
" It 's just ridiculous .
One of them 's got to win .
Have n't they ? "
In qualifying for the main draw at Wimbledon , Mahut had come through by beating Britain 's Alex Bogdanovic 24 - 22 in the decider .
Peanuts .
On Thursday afternoon he and Isner will go again . 59 games each .
Where will it end ?

A once - bustling mecca of American industry , Detroit , Michigan today lies mostly in blight and ruin .
An empty shell of what it once was , “ Motor City ” has become largely abandoned with the crumbling of the American automobile industry and other once - domestic manufacturing industries that have otherwise outsourced to China .
However , a handful of investors hope to bring recovery to Detroit by bringing back the industry which began the city in the first place : farming .
Michael Score , president of Hantz Farms , has begun purchasing abandoned properties around the city in order to turn them into commercial farming operations .
His company plans to obtain as much as 5,000 acres within the city limits to use for growing organic vegetables for food and trees and shrubs for biofuels .
His company has other agricultural projects that it wishes to pursue as well .
With his initial investment of $ 30 million just two years ago , Hantz hopes to take full advantage of the fertile land within the city .
Next spring , his company plans to begin growing crops on 30 acres of land and has plans in the works for other nearby parcels .

2 Shmi Skywalker And The Females
Okay , women are n’t technically a race , but the status of female characters in the Star Wars movies deteriorated so rapidly that we can’t leave them out .
In the original trilogy , we were at least given Princess Leia , a woman who was not only smokin ’ hot but was actually intelligent and somewhat competent .
She could handle a blaster , threaten people with a thermal detonator , and was n’t afraid to strangle you with a chain if you sexually harassed her enough .
She had goals , dreams , attitude , ambitions and above all , a personality .
In the new trilogy , on the other hand , we are given female characters like Shmi Skywalker , Anakin ’s mother , who has no other character or purpose in life other than to advance the male lead ’s plot points .
Shmi gets some lines in Episode one , where she looks sad and tragic a lot and talks about her important son .
She ’s apparently not important enough for a Jedi to release from slavery , though .
I mean , come on .
Surely Obi
Wan could have pawned off a Jedi statue in Coruscant or something and transferred some money over to free her later .
Or Anakin could have brought up maybe rescuing his mother from slavery in all their years of training .
But apparently it did n’t come up , because really the only important thing someone with lady bits can do in the new trilogy is died .
And that ’s only important because it ’s an excuse for the male characters to get angry and dubiously become evil .
Another example if this progressive degeneration into lazy sexism is Padme , who in the first movie was making tough political decisions and ruling a planet .
By the second movie , she ’s reduced to sitting around in bizarre dominatrix outfits .
1 Jar Jar Binks And The Gungangs source : slashfilm.com
The planet Naboo is inhabited by two races : the cultured humans who build beautiful palaces and hold a cultured royal court and the Gungans who live underground and do n’t understand technology .
The main Gungan in Star Wars is Jar Jar Binks , a dimwitted but ‘ loveable ’ klutz who ends up helping out our beloved heroes .
In the world of George Lucas , Gungans are also known as black people .
But Jar Jar ’s skin is orange , you say .
And black people do n’t have long ears !
Well , here ’s a picture of the guy who played Jar Jar , and provided him with both his voice and gait :
Jar Jar speaks in a barely understandable simplified language .
At first , the audience assumes that English is not his first language and that a kind of lingua franca has developed between the English - speaking human inhabitants of Naboo and the Gungans to allow them to communicate .
However , when we see Jar Jar ’s home , we discover that he communicates to the King in this language and that it ’s all they ’ve got .
Since it seems to be based on English , one assumes that before they met the pale , cultured people of Naboo , they simply communicated by flinging mud at each other .
The Gungans do n’t have much to offer in way of culture , either .
Political debates are settled by simply arguing really loudly and occasionally blowing raspberries .
Wars are fought by slingshot , since the Naboo human weaponry apparently is too complicated .
When Jar Jar actually gets his hands on a gun , tragedy is avoided only by the fact that the movie is clearly aimed at children .
It ’s not that Gungans are bad people ( or whatever ) , per se .
They ’re just simple , childlike loveable folk who are in firm need guidance by the upper races .
One might say that they are the Nabooan ’s burden .
The map of the world 's main energy suppliers is about to change as Iraq 's oil output quadruples over the next 10 years according to new forecasts .
Iraq will eventually displace Saudi Arabia as the world 's biggest exporter , experts predict , giving Baghdad crucial influence over the future price of oil .
The rush to exploit Iraq 's " super - giant " oilfields , of which it has the largest concentration in the world , has gathered impetus with unexpected speed in the wake of BP 's disaster in the Gulf of Mexico which has raised fears over deep - sea drilling .
Iraq 's oil has the advantage of being both onshore and cheap to develop .
The intensifying political isolation of Iran , and the latest moves by the UN Security Council to target the Islamic regime with increasingly tough sanctions in a bid to prevent its development of nuclear weapons is a second key factor influencing Iraqi production .
Iran may have unexploited reserves , but its oil output is expected to fall significantly as its old oilfields are depleted and not replaced .
Iraq , by contrast , aims to raise its crude production from 2.5 million barrels a day today to 9.5 million in 2020 under contracts signed with the world 's biggest oil companies over the last 12 months .
This development should be feasible , experts believe , because the rise in production will come from improved exploitation of oilfields already discovered rather than from the discovery of new ones .
The outcome of what is being called " the great Iraqi oil rush " will inevitably transform the balance of power between oil - producing states with Iraq the winner , Saudi Arabia and Iran the losers .
Dr Leo Drollas , chief economist of the London - based Centre for Global Energy Studies , who has produced the first comprehensive study of the impact of the new Iraqi contracts and the consequences of an accelerated oil rush over the coming years , predicts that " the evolution of Iraq 's oil capacity over the next 10 years promises to be the most important issue confronting Saudi Arabia in particular and Opec and the oil industry in general . "
Saudi Arabia and Iran will both be badly hit as Iraq raises its oil production even if it does not achieve its maximum target .
Dr Drollas says : " Saudi Arabia will only meet its revenue needs if Iraq wholly fails to meet its production plans . "
Given that Opec has more capacity than it needs to meet demand , increased Iraqi output will drive down the price of oil .
The development of Iraqi oil at breakneck pace started when the Iraqi government awarded 11 service contracts in two rounds of bidding to international oil companies such as BP , Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon last year .
At the first auction last summer many companies held back or had their bids rejected as too costly , but at a second round of bidding at the end of the year there was a rush to sign up by more than 20 companies .
Much of the world 's oil industry felt that Iraq 's oilfields represent a once - in - lifetime opportunity they could not ignore .
At stake are some of the biggest oilfields in the world .
Rumaila oilfield just north of the Kuwaiti border , for example , is expected to produce 1.85 million barrels a day , West Qurna 1 , north of Basra , 1.84 million and Majnoon , in the salt marshes on the Iranian border , 1.3 million .
Increased Iraqi output will total 7.5 million , far in excess of the expected increased production capacity of all of the rest of Opec .
The sums of money involved are also huge .
This week Shell signed a $ 12.5 bn natural gas production venture with Iraq .
The companies developing Iraq 's oil , for which they are paid a fee per barrel and do not get a share in production , will spend $ 100 bn over 10 years according to Iraqi oil minister Hussain Shahristani .
He adds that Iraq itself should benefit by $ 200bn .
It has long been known that Iraq has vast oil reserves , mostly in the south of the country around Basra , but these have been under - exploited because international oil companies were locked out of Iraq after the nationalisation of oil by Iraq in 1972 .
The Iraqi government did not have the resources to develop its own oil industry at a necessary pace in the 30 years of war and sanctions following the start of the Iran - Iraq war in 1980 .
But staff from the giant oil companies have been pouring into Basra recently , establishing expensive headquarters in the city .
Visiting diplomats said they were impressed with the speed with which the oil giants are moving to develop the Rumaila field in particular .
At the heart of the current excitement is that there may be more oil under the sands of southern Iraq than almost anywhere else on the planet .
The country has 115 billion barrels of proven reserves but there may be up to another 100 billion barrels under the Western Desert where there has been little exploration .
This is on top of oil and gas reserves already discovered .
These include nine " super - giant " fields ( over five billion barrels ) and 22 known " giant " fields ( over one billion barrels ) .
The US Department of Energy , citing independent consultants , says the cluster of super - giant fields in south - eastern Iraq forms " the largest known concentration of such fields in the world and accounts for 70 to 80 per cent of the country 's proven oil reserves " .
A further 20 per cent of Iraq 's oil is around Kirkuk where it is a source of continuing dispute between the Kurds , the local Arabs and the government in Baghdad .
Iraq badly needs more oil revenues which last year were around $ 60 bn .
This was underlined in June by riots and demonstrations over the lack of electricity as summer temperatures reached 50C .
The Electricity Ministry says it needs $ 5bn a year to build new power stations and fix old ones but it gets a maximum of $ 1.2 bn a year .
The rest of the Iraqi infrastructure is in the same state .
For 10 years after 1980 Saddam 's government spent all its money on weapons and from 1990 until its overthrow it did not have much money because of sanctions .
No new hospitals were built after the early 1980s .
Power stations grew so old that spare parts were no longer manufactured .
Much of Iraq does without clean drinking water and raw sewage often goes straight into the Tigris or Euphrates .
Restoring this derelict infrastructure will be costly .
Not that money alone will solve all of Iraq 's problems .
Government administration is dysfunctional and corrupt .
Basic needs can often only be acquired by bribery .
In one recent case , a pregnant woman who taught at a Baghdad university applied for a month 's paid leave as was her right .
The university administrators informed her that they would reject her request unless she paid them a month 's salary .
The incapacity and corruption of government helps explain why so little has been done to rebuild Iraq seven years after the fall of Saddam .
A significant proportion of state revenues are spent on salaries and pensions because the state acts as a giant patronage machine in which its supporters get jobs regardless of ability .
This is one way of distributing oil revenues , though an unfair one , that is unlikely to change , so money for investment requires higher oil revenues .
Whatever happens politically in Iraq the development of its oil reserves can only gather pace .
It is the one trump card held by the embattled government in Baghdad and it is bound to play it .
Most of the oil discovered hitherto is in the Shia heartlands around Basra where there has been little fighting so continued violence in Baghdad and Mosul will not stop the oil rush .
Political deadlock
Months after Iraqis voted in a general election , there is still no sign of a new prime minister and concerns are growing about the lack of progress in negotiations .
The power vacuum has raised fears about a resurgence of violence which may complicate US plans for military withdrawal .
Bombings and shootings claimed a dozen lives on Tuesday alone , while a suicide bomber blew himself up at a hospital in Anbar province yesterday , injuring several people .
The two main rivals for power , the incumbent premier Nouri al - Maliki and his challenger , Iyad Allawi , neither of whom managed to secure an overall majority at the ballot box , met on Tuesday for only the second time since the 7 March poll .
No breakthrough was announced .
There was speculation , nonetheless , that the two men may start to pursue an alliance of convenience .
Mr Maliki is accused by some , including fellow Shias , of behaving like a dictator , and faces dissent from within his own Shia - led coalition at the prospect of him remaining as Prime Minister for a second term .
His grouping consists of his State of Law party and the Iranian - backed Iraqi National Alliance ( INA ) .
But he may have to turn to Mr Allawi 's secular Iraqiya grouping for support instead .
There is also deadlock over the issue of whether to retain the current , highly sectarian quota system for sharing out government posts between Sunni , Shia and Kurds .

Writing a Research Paper in Mathematics
Ashley Reiter
September 12 , 1995 Section 1 : Introduction :
Why bother ?
Good mathematical writing , like good mathematics thinking , is a skill which must be practiced and developed for optimal performance .
The purpose of this paper is to provide assistance for young mathematicians writing their first paper .
The aim is not only to aid in the development of a well written paper , but also to help students begin to think about mathematical writing .
I am greatly indebted to a wonderful booklet , " How to Write Mathematics , " which provided much of the substance of this essay .
I will reference many direct quotations , especially from the section written by Paul Halmos , but I suspect that nearly everything idea in this paper has it origin in my reading of the booklet .
It is available from the American Mathematical Society , and serious students of mathematical writing should consult this booklet themselves .
Most of the other ideas originated in my own frustrations with bad mathematical writing .
Although studying mathematics from bad mathematical writing is not the best way to learn good writing , it can provide excellent examples of procedures to be avoided .
Thus , one activity of the active mathematical reader is to note the places at which a sample of written mathematics becomes unclear , and to avoid making the same mistakes his own writing .
Mathematical communication , both written and spoken , is the filter through which your mathematical work is viewed .
If the creative aspect of mathematics is compared to the act of composing a piece of music , then the art of writing may be viewed as conducting a performance of that same piece .
As a mathematician , you have the privilege of conducting a performance of your own composition !
Doing a good job of conducting is just as important to the listeners as composing a good piece .
If you do mathematics purely for your own pleasure , then there is no reason to write about it .
If you hope to share the beauty of the mathematics you have done , then it is not sufficient to simply write ; you must strive to write well .
This essay will begin with general ideas about mathematical writing .
The purpose is to help the student develop an outline for the paper .
The next section will describe the difference between " formal " and " informal " parts of a paper , and give guidelines for each one .
Section four will discuss the writing of an individual proof .
The essay will conclude with a section containing specific recommendations to consider as you write and rewrite the paper .
Section 2 . Before you write : Structuring the paper
The purpose of nearly all writing is to communicate .
In order to communicate well , you must consider both what you want to communicate , and to whom you hope to communicate it .
This is no less true for mathematical writing than for any other form of writing .
The primary goal of mathematical writing is to assert , using carefully constructed logical deductions , the truth of a mathematical statement .
Careful mathematical readers do not assume that your work is well - founded ; they must be convinced .
This is your first goal in mathematical writing .
However , convincing the reader of the simple truth of your work is not sufficient .
When you write about your own mathematical research , you will have another goal , which includes these two ; you want your reader to appreciate the beauty of the mathematics you have done , and to understand its importance .
If the whole of mathematics , or even the subfield in which you are working , is thought of as a large painting , then your research will necessarily constitute a relatively minuscule portion of the entire work .
Its beauty is seen not only in the examination of the specific region which you have painted ( although this is important ) , but also by observing the way in which your own work ' fits ' in the picture as a whole .
These two goals -- to convince your reader of the truth of your deductions , and to allow your audience to see the beauty of your work in relation to the whole of mathematics -- will be critical as you develop the outline for your paper .
At times you may think of yourself as a travel guide , leading the reader through territory charted only by you .
A successful mathematical writer will lay out for her readers two logical maps , one which displays the connections between her own work and the wide world of mathematics , and another which reveals the internal logical structure of her own work .
In order to advise your reader , you must first consider for yourself where your work is located on the map of mathematics .
If your reader has visited nearby regions , then you would like to recall those experiences to his mind , so that he will be better able to understand what you have to add and to connect it to related mathematics .
Asking several questions may help you discern the shape and location of your work :
Does your result strengthen a previous result by giving a more precise characterization of something ?
Have you proved a stronger result of an old theorem by weakening the hypotheses or by strengthening the conclusions ?
Have you proven the equivalence of two definitions ?
Is it a classification theorem of structures which were previously defined but not understood ?
Does is connect two previously unrelated aspects of mathematics ?
Does it apply a new method to an old problem ?
Does it provide a new proof for an old theorem ?
Is it a special case of a larger question ?
It is necessary that you explicitly consider this question of placement in the structure of mathematics , because it will linger in your readers ' minds until you answer it .
Failure to address this very question will leave the reader feeling quite dissatisfied .
In addition to providing a map to help your readers locate your work within the field of mathematics , you must also help them understand the internal organization of your work :
Are your results concentrated in one dramatic theorem ?
Or do you have several theorems which are related , but equally significant ?
Have you found important counterexamples ?
Is your research purely theoretical mathematics , in the theorem - proof sense , or does your research involve several different types of activity , for example , modeling a problem on the computer , proving a theorem , and then doing physical experiments related to your work ?
Is your work a clear ( although small ) step toward the solution of a classic problem , or is it a new problem ?
Since your reader does not know what you will be proving until after he has read your paper , advising him beforehand about what he will read , just as the travel agent prepares his customer , will allow him to enjoy the trip more , and to understand more of the things you lead him to .
To honestly and deliberately explain where your work fits into the big picture of mathematical research may require a great deal of humility .
You will likely despair that your accomplishments seem rather small .
Do not fret !
Mathematics has been accumulating for thousands of years , based on the work of thousands ( or millions ) of practitioners .
It has been said that even the best mathematicians rarely have more than one really outstanding idea during their lifetimes .
It would be truly surprising if yours were to come as a high school student !
Once you have considered the structure and relevance of your research , you are ready to outline your paper .
The accepted format for research papers is much less rigidly defined for mathematics than for many other scientific fields .
You have the latitude to develop the outline in a way which is appropriate for your work in particular .
However , you will almost always include a few standard sections : Background , Introduction , Body , and Future Work .
The background will serve to orient your reader , providing the first idea of where you will be leading him .
In the background , you will give the most explicit description of the history of your problem , although hints and references may occur elsewhere .
The reader hopes to have certain questions answered in this section :
Why should he read this paper ?
What is the point of this paper ?
Where did this problem come from ?
What was already known in this field ?
Why did this author think this question was interesting ?
If he dislikes partial differential equations , for example , he should be warned early on that he will encounter them .
If he is n't familiar with the first concepts of probability , then he should be warned in advance if your paper depends on that understanding .
Remember at this point that although you may have spent hundreds of hours working on your problem , your reader wants to have all these questions answered clearly in a matter of minutes .
In the second section of your paper , the introduction , you will begin to lead the reader into your work in particular , zooming in from the big picture towards your specific results .
This is the place to introduce the definitions and lemmas which are standard in the field , but which your readers may not know .
The body , which will be made up of several sections , contains most of your work .
By the time you reach the final section , implications , you may be tired of your problem , but this section is critical to your readers .
You , as the world expert on the topic of your paper , are in a unique situation to direct future research in your field .
A reader who likes your paper may want to continue work in your field .
( S ) he will naturally have her / his own questions , but you , having worked on this paper , will know , better than your reader , which questions may be interesting , and which may not .
If you were to continue working on this topic , what questions would you ask ?
Also , for some papers , there may be important implications of your work .
If you have worked on a mathematical model of a physical phenomenon , what are the consequences , in the physical world , of your mathematical work ?
These are the questions which your readers will hope to have answered in the final section of the paper .
You should take care not to disappoint them !
Section 3 . Formal and Informal Exposition
Once you have a basic outline for your paper , you should consider " the formal or logical structure consisting of definitions , theorems , and proofs , and the complementary informal or introductory material consisting of motivations , analogies , examples , and metamathematical explanations .
This division of the material should be conspicuously maintained in any mathematical presentation , because the nature of the subject requires above all else that the logical structure be clear . " ( p.1 ) These two types of material work in parallel to enable your reader to understand your work both logically and cognitively ( which are often quite different -- how many of you believed that integrals could be calculated using antiderivatives before you could prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ? )
" Since the formal structure does not depend on the informal , the author can write up the former in complete detail before adding any of the latter . " ( p. 2 ) Thus , the next stage in the writing process may be to develop an outline of the logical structure of your paper .
Several questions may help :
To begin , what exactly have you proven ?
What are the lemmas ( your own or others ) on which these theorems stand .
Which are the corollaries of these theorems ?
In deciding which results to call lemmas , which theorems , and which corollaries , ask yourself which are the central ideas .
Which ones follow naturally from others , and which ones are the real work horses of the paper ?
The structure of writing requires that your hypotheses and deductions must conform to a linear order .
However , few research papers actually have a linear structure , in which lemmas become more and more complicated , one on top of another , until one theorem is proven , followed by a sequence of increasingly complex corollaries .
On the contrary , most proofs could be modeled with very complicated graphs , in which several basic hypotheses combine with a few well known theorems in a complex way .
There may be several seemingly independent lines of reasoning which converge at the final step .
It goes without saying that any assertion should follow the lemmas and theorems on which it depends .
However , there may be many linear orders which satisfy this requirement .
In view of this difficulty , it is your responsibility to , first , understand this structure , and , second , to arrange the necessarily linear structure of your writing to reflect the structure of the work as well as possible .
The exact way in which this will proceed depends , of course , on the specific situation .
One technique to assist you in revealing the complex logical structure of your paper is a proper naming of results .
By naming your results appropriately ( lemmas as underpinnings , theorems as the real substance , and corollaries as the finishing work ) , you will create a certain sense of parallelness among your lemmas , and help your reader to appreciate , without having struggled through the research with you , which are the really critical ideas , and which they can skim through more quickly .
Another technique for developing a concise logical outline stems from a warning by Paul Halmos , in HTWM , never to repeat a proof :
If several steps in the proof of Theorem 2 bear a very close resemblance to parts of the proof of Theorem 1 , that 's a signal that something may be less than completely understood .
Other symptoms of the same disease are : 'by the same technique ( or method , or device , or trick ) as in the proof of Theorem 1 ...' , or , brutally , ' see the proof of Theorem 1 ' .
When that happens the chances are very good that there is a lemma that is worth finding , formulating , and proving , a lemma from which both Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are more easily and more clearly deduced .
( p. 35 ) These issues of structure should be well thought through BEFORE you begin to write your paper , although the process of writing itself which surely help you better understand the structure .
Now that we have discussed the formal structure , we turn to the informal structure .
The formal structure contains the formal definitions , theorem - proof format , and rigorous logic which is the language of ' pure ' mathematics .
The informal structure complements the formal and runs in parallel .
It uses less rigorous , ( but no less accurate ! ) language , and plays an important part in elucidating both the mathematical location of the work , as we discussed above , and in presenting to the reader a more cognitive presentation of the work .
For although mathematicians write in the language of logic , very few actually think in the language of logic ( although we do think logically ) , and so to understand your work , they will be immensely aided by subtle demonstration of why something is true , and how you came to prove such a theorem .
Outlining , before you write , what you hope to communicate in these informal sections will , most likely , lead to more effective communication .
Before you begin to write , you must also consider notation .
The selection of notation is a critical part of writing a research paper .
In effect , you are inventing a language which your readers must learn in order to understand your paper .
Good notation firstly allows the reader to forget that he is learning a new language , and secondly provides a framework in which the essentials of your proof are clearly understood .
Bad notation , on the other hand , is disastrous and may deter the reader from even reading your paper .
In most cases , it is wise to follow convention .
Using epsilon for a prime integer , or x ( f ) for a function , is certainly possible , but almost never a good idea .
Section 4 : Writing a Proof
The first step in writing a good proof comes with the statement of the theorem .
A well - worded theorem will make writing the proof much easier .
The statement of the theorem should , first of all , contain exactly the right hypotheses .
Of course , all the necessary hypotheses must be included .
On the other hand , extraneous assumptions will simply distract from the point of the theorem , and should be eliminated when possible .
When writing a proof , as when writing an entire paper , you must put down , in a linear order , a set of hypotheses and deductions which are probably not linear in form .
I suggest that , before you write you map out the hypotheses and the deductions , and attempt to order the statements in a way which will cause the least confusion to the reader .
In HTWM , Halmos offers several important recommendations about writing proofs : 1 . Write the proof forward A familiar trick of bad teaching is to begin a proof by saying : " Given e , let d be e/2 " .
This is the traditional backward proof - writing of classical analysis .
It has the advantage of being easily verifiable by a machine ( as opposed to understandable by a human being ) , and it has the dubious advantage that something at the end comes out to be less than e .
The way to make the human reader 's task less demanding is obvious : write the proof forward .
Start , as the author always starts , by putting something less than e , and then do what needs to be done -- multiply by 3M2 + 7 at the right time and divide by 24 later , etc. , etc. -- till you end up with what you end up with .
Neither arrangement is elegant , but the forward one is graspable and rememberable .
( p. 43 ) 2 . Avoid unnecessary notation .
Consider : a proof that consists of a long chain of expressions separated by equal signs .
Such a proof is easy to write .
The author starts from the first equation , makes a natural substitution to get the second , collects terms , permutes , inserts and immediately cancels an inspired factor , and by steps such as these proceeds till he gets the last equation .
This is , once again , coding , and the reader is forced not only to learn as he goes , but , at the same time , to decode as he goes .
The double effort is needless .
By spending another ten minutes writing a carefully worded paragraph , the author can save each of his readers half an hour and a lot of confusion .
The paragraph should be a recipe for action , to replace the unhelpful code that merely reports the results of the act and leaves the reader to guess how they were obtained .
The paragraph would say something like this : " For the proof , first substitute p for q , the collect terms , permute the factors , and , finally , insert and cancel a factor r. ( p. 42 -43 ) Section 5 . Specific Recommendations
As in any form of communication , there are certain stylistic practice which will make your writing more or less understandable .
These may be best checked and corrected after writing the first draft .
Many of these ideas are from HTWM , and are more fully justified there .
Notation that has n't been used in several pages ( or even paragraphs ) should carry a reference or a reminder of the meaning .
The structure should be easily discernible by headings and punctuation .
There should be a clear definition of the problem at hand all the way through .
The title is the first contact that readers will have with your paper .
It must communicate something of the substances to the experts in your field as well as to the novices who will be interested .
Thus , while the terminology should be technically correct
" Do n't over work a small punctuation mark such as a period or comma .
They are easy for the reader to overlook , and the oversight causes backtracking , confusion , delay .
Example : " Assume that aÂX .
X belongs to the class C , ... " .
The period between the two X's is overworked ...
A good general rule is : never start a sentence with a symbol .
If you insist on starting the sentence with a mention of the thing the symbol denotes , put the appropriate word in apposition , thus : " The set X belongs to the class C , ... " ... The overworked period is no worse than the overworked comma .
Not " For invertible X , X * also is invertible " , but " For invertible X , the adjoint X* also is invertible . " ( p. 44 )
" I recommend " then " with " if " in all mathematical contexts .
The presence of " then " can never confuse ; its absence can . " ( p.44 )
Another critical feature is the layout or architecture of the page .
" If it looks like solid prose , it will have a forbidding , sermony aspect ; if it looks like computational hash , with a page full of symbols , it will have a frightening , complicated aspect .
The golden mean is golden .
Break it up , but not too small ; use prose , but not too much .
Intersperse enough displays to give the eye a chance to help the brain ; use symbols , but in the middle of enough prose to keep the mind from drowning in a morass of suffixes . " ( p. 44-5 )
The same symbol should never be used for more than one thing ; if you have used n as a counter in one proof , use m in the next proof , unless the two play a similar role in each
All notation should be meaningful ( no free variables ) :
" avoid the use of irrelevant symbols .
Example : " On a compact space every real - valued continuous function f is bounded . "
What does the symbol " f " contribute to the clarity of that statement ?...
A showy way to say " use no superfluous letters " is to say " use no letter only once " .
( p. 41 )
" In everyday English " any " is an ambiguous word ; depending on context that may hint at an existential quantifier ( " have you any wool ? " , " if anyone can do it , he can " ) or a universal one ( " any number can play " ) .
Conclusion : never use " any " in mathematical writing .
Replace it by " each " or " every " , or recast the whole sentence " ( p. 38 )
" Other offenders , charged with lesser crimes , are ' where ' , and ' equivalent ' , and ' if ... then ...if... then ' .
" Where " is usually a sign of a lazy afterthought that should have been thought through before .
" If n is sufficiently large , then | an | < e , where e is a preassigned positive number " ; both disease and cure are clear .
" Equivalent " for theorems is logical nonsense .
( By " theorem " I mean a mathematical truth , something that has been proved .
A meaningful statement can be false , but a theorem cannot ; " a false theorem " is self - contradictory ) .
As for " if... then ...if... then " , that is just a frequent stylistic bobble committed by quick writers and rued by slow readers .
" If p , then if q , then r . "
Logically , all is well , but psychologically it is just another pebble to stumble over , unnecessarily .
Usually all that is needed to avoid it is to recast the sentence , but no universally good recasting exists ; what is best depends on what is important in the case at hand .
It could be " If p and q then r " , or " In the presence of p , the hypothesis q implies the conclusion r " , or many other versions . " " ( p. 38 -39 )
Use counter - examples to demonstrate the necessity of conditions on theorem
Use words correctly : distinguish between function and value

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senator Robert Byrd , who evolved from a segregationist to a civil rights advocate in becoming the longest serving member ever of the Congress , died on Monday .
First elected in 1952 , Byrd was 92 .
His death is not expected to have any immediate impact on the Democrats ’ 59 - 41 control of the Senate as West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin is virtually certain to appoint a fellow Democrat to succeed Byrd , whose current term expires in 2012 .
But Byrd ’s death may delay efforts to win final congressional approval this week of landmark legislation that he backed to tighten regulation of the financial industry .
Strong public support , however , means Democrats are likely to get the needed 60 Senate votes from within their ranks and Republicans wary of siding with Wall Street , analysts said .
Byrd helped shape much of the nation ’s history and served with a dozen U.S. presidents .
He died peacefully at Inova Fairfax Hospital outside of Washington , D.C. , said his spokesman , Jesse Jacobs .
Byrd was hospitalized last week with what doctors believed was a heat - related illness .
“ I love to serve .
I love the Senate .
If I could live another 100 years , I ’d like to continue in the Senate , ” Byrd , who kept a copy of the U.S. Constitution in his breast pocket , said in a 2006 interview with Reuters .
“ The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion , the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution , and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C. Byrd , ” said President Barack Obama .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Byrd will be remembered “ for his fighter ’s spirit , his abiding faith and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes . ”
Byrd was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1952 , and served six years in that chamber before moving to the Senate .
His early campaigns were punctuated by his skills as a bluegrass fiddler that helped draw big and enthusiastic crowds for the self - described West Virginia “ hillbilly .
With his old - fashioned courtliness , Byrd was a defender of the Senate ’s traditions and over the years held most of its key positions , including Democratic leader from 1977 to 1988 and later as the top Democrat on the powerful Appropriations Committee .
Byrd was an early and eloquent opponent of the Iraq war , which began in 2003 with popular support but within a few years was widely condemned .
He also warned against a buildup of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
‘ SENATE’S MAN ’
He worked with and challenged presidents , Democrats and Republicans alike , and reminded all of them of Congress ’ responsibility to check their power .
“ I ’m not any president ’s man .
I ’m a Senate ’s man , ” Byrd told Reuters in the 2006 interview .
During his more than half century in Congress , America changed dramatically and so did Byrd .
“ When I got here , I was to the right of Barry Goldwater , ” Byrd told Reuters , referring to a conservative Republican senator and failed 1964 presidential candidate .
“ I moved more to the center . ”
In the early 1940s , before being elected to Congress , Byrd belonged to the Ku Klux Klan , a membership that he attributed to a youthful mistake .
“ It has emerged throughout my life to haunt and embarrass me and has taught me in a very graphic way what one major mistake can do to one ’s life , career and reputation , ” Byrd wrote in a 1987 memoir , “ Robert C. Byrd : Child of the Appalachian Coalfields . ”
In Congress , Byrd , who denounced civil rights leader Martin Luther King as a “ self - seeking rabble rouser , ” eventually became a leading backer of civil rights .
Of the record - setting 18,500 - plus Senate votes Byrd cast , he said his biggest regret was opposing the 1964 Civil Rights Act , a landmark law that brought down barriers for black Americans .
He said his views changed most dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident that Byrd said put him in a deep emotional valley .

“ The death of my grandson caused me to stop and think , ” Byrd said .
“ I came to realize that black people love their children as much as I do mine . ”
‘ BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY ’
In West Virginia , Byrd was revered for his ability to deliver federal dollars to his poor state to build roads , schools and hospitals .
Critics called him the “ Prince of Pork , ” but constituents crowned him as “ West Virginian of the 20th Century . ”
“ I want to be West Virginia ’s billion dollar industry , ” Byrd declared in 1990 .
He succeeded .
In 2000 he won passage of a bill that took import duties paid by foreign firms and transferred them to U.S. corporations .
The Byrd Amendment , reviled abroad , was aimed at helping ailing steel companies in West Virginia and other states .
He also was a long - time champion of his state ’s coal industry , drawing the frequent ire of environmentalists , but later became more conscious of environmental damage and shortcomings in worker safety .
Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. on November 20 , 1917 , in North Carolina and was sent to live with relatives in West Virginia after his mother died in the 1918 flu pandemic .
His new family renamed him and Byrd grew up desperately poor in the West Virginia coal fields .
Unable to afford college , he worked as a meat cutter during the Great Depression and later as a welder building ships during World War Two .
Byrd married his high school sweetheart , Erma Ora James , in 1936 .
They had two daughters and six grandchildren .
“ For two hillbillies -- that is what we are , two hillbillies -- from West Virginia , it has been an exciting and wild ride , ” Byrd said in a Senate speech marking their 65th anniversary .
She died in March 2006 .
Byrd set the record for congressional longevity on November 17 , 2009 .
On that day , Byrd said , “ My only regret is that my beloved wife , companion and confidant , my dear Erma , is not here with me .
I know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying , ‘ Congratulations my dear Robert -- but do n’t let it go to your head . ’ ”
Here are a few organizations you can contact if you want to volunteer your time to help clean up the ecological disaster underway in the Gulf of Mexico .
Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana –
The oil spill off the mouth of the Mississippi River has been declared a “ spill of national significance , ” and threatens damage to the Gulf Coast — perhaps for months to come .
With the first wave of the oil slick expected to impact coastal Louisiana as early as Thursday evening , Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency .
CRCL is joining with our partners at the local , state and federal level to begin registering volunteers to assist with spill recovery efforts .
We do not know the location or the extent of impact to birds , wildlife , and habitat at this time .
What we do know is that we need to be ready with on - call volunteers in the event that they are needed .
National Wildlife Federation , National Audubon Society , the Barataria - Terrebonne National Estuary Program and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana are building a list of volunteers prepared to help with this response .
Volunteers can fill a variety of needs , from oiled wildlife recovery , to monitoring and photographing oil movement , to providing a boat and driver for response activities .
No specific training or experience is necessary , although you must be at least 18 years old to volunteer .
Some tasks , such as food preparation , may require no training .
Other tasks , such as washing oiled birds , may require specific certifications or skills .
We encourage pre-veterinary students , veterinary technicians , and anyone with HAZWOPER training to volunteer .

National Wildlife Federation –
The catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the April 20 , 2010 explosion of an offshore oil rig has put local economies , wildlife and the Gulf ’s delicate coastal ecosystem at risk .
This could be one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation ’s history .
Our immediate task is clear : all resources of British Petroleum , federal and state government and even the U.S. military must be deployed to cap the well , contain the spill and minimize the damage to one of our nation ’s crown jewels : the Mississippi Delta .
And get updates about the oil spill on twitter @ Oil_Spill_2010 :
People looking to volunteer with the response , call ( 866 ) 448-5816 .
To report affected wildlife , call ( 866 ) 557-1401 , claims ( 800 ) 440-0858
A very helpful redditor going by the moniker OccamsAxeWound dropped a huge list of contact numbers , divided by state , for opportunities to help clean up the Gulf Coast .
Here they are :
That headline got ya curious did n’t it ?
Well that Nexus
One is indeed a “ gas ” pedal , only instead of fuel , it controls electricity , in the form of slot cars .
Grant Skinner coded the software for the handset and a computer via Adobe Air .
Once the two are connected , the phone sends the computer the accelerometer data , which then relays the speed control to the slot car track with the help of a Phidgets motor controller .
Sound confusing ?
Well check out the video :
Pretty cool if you ask me .

Die Regelung des Unterhaltes ist oft das Wichtigste .
Unter einer Trennung sollten auch Ihre Kinder nicht zu leiden haben .
Unterhalt
Wenn die Ehepartner oder die nichtehelichen Eltern auseinander gehen , ist ab dem Zeitpunkt der Trennung der Parteien die Frage des Unterhaltes zu klären .
Es wird zwischen verschiedenen Unterhaltsarten unterschieden : Zum Kindesunterhalt gilt , dass zunächst derjenige , bei dem die gemeinsamen Kinder nicht dauerhaft leben , an den betreuenden Elternteil Kindesunterhalt zahlen muss .
Für das erste Jahr der Trennung kann der bedürftige Ehepartner von dem anderen Trennungsunterhalt verlangen , sofern dieser leistungsfähig ist .
Auch Eltern können mit Unterhaltsansprüchen an ihre Kinder herantreten .
Kindesunterhalt
Als ranghöchster Unterhaltsberechtigter ist zunächst der Unterhalt für die gemeinsamen minderjährigen Kinder zu berücksichtigen .
Derjenige , bei dem die gemeinsamen Kinder nicht dauerhaft leben , muss an den betreuenden Elternteil Kindesunterhalt zahlen .
Dieser richtet sich nach dem Einkommen des barunterhaltspflichtigen Elternteils .
Erst wenn die Kinder volljährig werden , sind beide Elternteile ihrem Einkommen entsprechend zum Unterhalt verpflichtet .
Das Einkommen des Pflichtigen errechnet sich aus 1/12 seines Jahresnettoeinkommens , wobei aber auch ehebedingte Verbindlichkeiten berücksichtigt werden , jedoch sind nicht alle Verbindlichkeiten des Unterhaltspflichtigen abzugsfähig .
Der Kindesunterhalt errechnet sich anhand der Düsseldorfer Tabelle .
Hierbei ist jedoch noch das hälftige staatliche Kindergeld in Abzug zu bringen .
Ehegattenunterhalt
Für das erste Jahr der Trennung kann der bedürftige Ehepartner von dem anderen Trennungsunterhalt verlangen , sofern dieser leistungsfähig ist .
Auch der nichteheliche Lebenspartner , der ein gemeinsames Kind betreut , hat grundsätzlich während der ersten drei Lebensjahre des gemeinsamen Kindes Anspruch auf Betreuungsunterhalt , sofern er bedürftig und der andere leistungsfähig ist .
Sobald die Kinder alt genug sind und nicht mehr der Rund - um - die - Uhr - Betreuung bedürfen , kann der Mutter zugemutet werden , wieder eine Erwerbstätigkeit auszuüben .
Sollten die Ehepartner mit dieser Regelung nicht einverstanden sein , so empfiehlt sich der Abschluss eines Ehevertrages , der diese Nachteile berücksichtigt und andere Möglichkeiten , wie z.B. die Einführung eines Alterphasenmodells vorsieht .
Auch der Unterhaltsanspruch wegen Alters , Krankheit und der Aufstockungsunterhalt ist nach der neuen Unterhaltsreform zu begrenzen und darf derzeit nicht länger als 1/3 bis 1/4 der Ehezeit betragen .
Nur noch in ganz seltenen Ausnahmefällen erkennt das Gericht einen unbegrenzten Unterhaltsanspruch aus Vertrauensschutz , oder bei ehebedingtem Nachteil an .
Elternunterhalt
Auch Eltern können mit Unterhaltsansprüchen an ihre Kinder herantreten .
Dies geschieht häufig dann , wenn betagte Eltern zum Pflegefall werden und die Rente nicht ausreicht , um die Heimpflegekosten zu decken .
Voraussetzung ist jedoch , dass die Kinder leistungsfähig sind , insbesondere wenn noch im Rang vorgehende Unterhaltspflichtige vorhanden sind .

Yesterday I stopped a couple on the street to have a friendly discussion about why local " blue dog " Jim Matheson has been concerned about redistricting , but has never had a concern about the voting machines purchased by partisan Republican , ( now governor , Gary Herbert , ( who will be using the machines to conduct his upcoming election . ) )
It became obvious the couple were right wingers , because , as always , the discussion turned to stolen elections in Chicago over 40 years ago and how Nixon had the election stolen from him by Kennedy .
I 'm not really up on how Kennedy was supposed to have done that , but I told them I was sure the Republicans were stealing elections nationwide in recent times .
He told me Kennedy did the same thing .
I replied , " that makes you a conspiracy theorist " , and he said " no it does n't . "
The conversation ended in a friendly way , but I asked them why we were voting on machines on which the name has changed two times since they were purchased and who sold their entire voting machine division for 15 million while Utah paid 25 million originally and has spent many more millions since then .
Today , I find out they 've changed the name THREE times , and it's now owned outside the US !
Earth calling Jim Matheson !

Coupla quick fact - checks to your comment , Larry .
1 ) Kennedy would have won the election even without Chicago .
On the other end of the nation , Hawaii was apparently stolen for Nixon .
Either way , hopefully your friend was n't in favor of stolen elections because he believes " Kennedy did it , so we can too " , right ?
2 ) Diebold sold their entire election division for 5 million dollars !
Not even the 15 million you erroneously suggested !
Ya think maybe they wanted to get rid of that thing for some reason ?
Mission accomplished .

Five Million ?
Well , now I AM mad !
I guess , as a Utahn , I did n't want to think we were THAT duped .
If I could only get Utahn 's mad .
It seems to be a lost cause .
This is the issue that 's " too big " to be discussed in any state or county in the entire nation .
All I know , is that before we started using the hanging chad machines , Utah voted Democrat .
I am positive of that !
Why can't we just put our mark next to the name of the guy / gal we 're voting for and have that vote counted in public ?

Thanks for writing this .
Funny how things come to a full circle if you stick around long enough , eh ?
There 's a special place in Hell for Diebold after what Diebold tried to do to / in North Carolina .
Diebold almost got away with gutting North Carolina 's verified voting law .
NC owes the Electronic Frontier Foundation from preventing Diebold from doing that .
In spite of Diebold 's chicanery , they were certified in our state , but our activists fought the vendor off county by county , with bi partisan hate for Diebold abounding .
Using Occams razor , was Diebold DESI / PESI run by incompetents , criminals , or arrogant execs who figured that they could do whatever they wanted ?

The guy I talked to said he had read a book which told about the John Kennedy election theft and I asked him who wrote the book , " was it Glen Beck ; Bill O'Reilly ? )
He said no .
The conversation pretty much ended there , and I 'm sure the couple wanted to continue their walk on a perfect spring night , but a short time later on MY walk I thought it was most likely John Fund .
I would n't read John Fund 's book if you paid me good money , but I 'll just bet that 's where it came from .

Interesting , is n't it , how they can be involved in the complete destruction of our electoral system but it 's the book cooking that takes them down .
NOTHING said about how they did their part in a huge right wing coup , but if their books are n't cleverly cooked enough , THAT is what will hurt them .
What a joke .
I will never forget their CEO telling everyone in the crowd ( including the idiot bastard son himself ) that his job was to deliver the 2004 election to George W Bush .
That alone sounded like more than enough to have him and his company investigated as well as kicked out of the running to even GET gov't contracts .
NO computers should be allowed in elections .
It 's FAR too easy to corrupt the code , and a computer can be made to do anything the programmer wants .
It can print out what you 've put up on the screen , and store a whole different set of results .
Even the counting software can be altered to make it say whatever you want it to say .
Even with open source software , it 's too easy to sneak something in later , especially with the " security " measures taken by elections boards in this country .
What a shame that we have to use the Capone technique to get something on these crooks .
But if that is what it takes , then so be it .

Sy Hersh had some pretty damning evidence that of the Kennedy 's use of the mob in Illinois to to deliver that state and thus the election in 1960 .
The Kennedys were a ruthless bunch .
They set the precedent for rigging elections , and the Rethugs have been carrying the ball ever since .

The Kennedy and Bush families were total opposites .
Joe Kennedy made his fortune in the shady great depression wall street and then alcohol in prohibition .
A really crooked guy .
The Bush family made its money from Prescott Bush being a banker for Hitler During WW2 .
Bush family was treasonous .
Now the Kennedy boys however were good people .
JFK was elected was determined to take us out of Vietnam ( he had a brother die in WW2 and he was injured in war himself ) and also dropped suport for the attacking Castro .
Both of these got in the way of George HW Bush .
He and the mafia had been booted out of oil field in Cuba by Castro ( hence the 1000s of attacks on Castro by the Bush lead CIA even with some mafia help ) and also had defense contractors making money in Vietnam ( he still owns a defense contractor / oil company / insurance wall street firm The Carlyle Group ) .
RFK tried to follow up on was killed ( just like the anti war MLK ) .
Yes the Kennedy family had the Joe Kennedy very crooked guy but his sons tried to keep the wealthy like his dad from stealing from the poor .
The Bush family has made the poor fight the wars while they made money from them , even W had his first oil company supplied by a combination of Bin Laden and his grandfather 's Hitler made funds .
The Bush 's whole family are war criminals .

Breaking story ( last updated June 25 ) : Socialists and progressive trade union and social movement activists have reacted sceptically to the leadership change in the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) federal government of Australia .
Julia Gillard displaced Kevin Rudd as PM on June 24 after a surprise leadership challenge that came into the open the night before .
She became the country 's first woman PM .
Wayne Swan replaced Gillard as deputy PM .
Australian mining shares shot up on the stock exchanges as soon as Gillard 's takeover was announced .
One of her first announcements was that her government was halting its media information campaign on the proposed Resource Super Profits Tax ( RSPT ) .
She added that here door was open to the mining companies for negotiations .
The Minerals Council of Australia responded by suspending its multi-million dollar advertising campaign against the RSPT .
BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals CEO Andrew Forrest welcomed the change in leadership .
Green Left Weekly spoke to progressive activists about their reactions to the Gillard 's takeover as PM .
* * *
Sam Watson , Murri leader and Socialist Alliance lead Senate candidate for Queensland :
" This leadership change is all about saving the ALP from defeat in the coming federal election .
The decision - making was made by the Labor machinery .
It has nothing to do with changes that might benefit all Australians .
" The ALP machine has dumped Kevin Rudd and promoted Julia Gillard in a move to save themselves in the next election .
" For Aboriginal people , it is a case of ' same horse , different saddle blanket ' .
We need to call on Gillard to end the NT Intervention as soon as possible .
" Socialist Alliance welcomes the opportunity to challenge the ALP in the coming election , as part of the campaign to build a real political alternative in this country . "
Robynne Murphy , steelworker , veteran leader of the Wollongong Jobs for Women Campaign and Socialist Alliance member :
" When the ship 's sinking put a woman in charge ...
I 've seen in many times at work . "
Helen Said , community activist :
" It was Julia Gillard who first publicly proposed cutting off income support payments to poor families with troubled children who avoid school .
She is part of a government that has upheld Howard 's Welfare to Work legislation and changes to the Child Support formula , which has condemned many single mother families to a life of poverty .
" Julia Gillard is a woman PM of Australia , but not a PM of the women of Australia .
Run a socialist candidate against her .
It 's high time the Left had a presence in Melbourne 's outer working class suburbs anyway .
Richard Downs , spokesperson for Alyawarr people and organiser for the July gathering of elders and leaders :
" In Julia Gillard 's address to the nation , there was no mention of the first Australians and owners of this country on the way forward .
" She did mention how wonderfully the previous PM Kevin Rudd 's apology to the first Australians was given .
Little does she know this has all been a farce and now gone by the way side , blown across all directions with the wind .
" Until the new PM acknowledges the racism and discrimination policy that has been imposed on our people across the NT , until the NT intervention is abolished ; until a new chapter of engagement and consultations begins to create a joint partnership with us ... nothing will ever change as we as Aboriginal people have lost all confidence with the governments at federal and state levels .
" Yet we leave our door open for the new PM to meet with myself , elders and leaders from all different language groups on the new way forward .
We advise the PM to remove all previous baggage , including Indigenous affairs minister Jenny Macklin , who we have no confidence in , to achieve the goals set by the federal government in closing the gap . "
Tim Anderson , activist , writer and lecturer at Sydney University School of Political Economy :
" After the excitement of a Rudd - Gillard ‘ transition ’ dies down we should remember that all power plays in Australian politics have to do with the Australian oligarchy - that peculiar mixture of banking , mining , investment conglomerates and media .
" Labor has its own problems , but something different kicks in when key oligarchy interests are challenged : such as by a mining tax .
Labor has been disciplined over such matters before .
" Remember the media campaign against the Whitlam government in 1975 , the mining campaign against Aboriginal land rights in 1983 - 84 , the mining and pastoral - led deceptions over ‘ Native Title ’ in 1993 , and the various media campaigns for new taxes , work contracts and war .
They get what they want from the big parties .
" Who could have imagined , a few weeks back , that an election might be fought on the basis of a tax on the super - profits of a handful of the super - rich ?
Why would there be any popular support at all for a tiny group of super - fat cats , unless they controlled the daily means of public debate ?
" Let ’s remember , for example , that on the boards of all the corporate media companies sit the captains of finance , and that finance and mining in Australia are deeply interlocked .
" The directors of Australia ’s four major banks are also directors of the major mining companies .
Indeed , the major shareholders of Australia ’s major banks are much the same companies : JP Morgan , National Nominees , Westpac Custodian Nominees , ANZ Nominees , City Group , Chase Manhattan , HKBA and HSBC .
Finance , mining and media are well coordinated and act together on any threat .
" So when Julia appears with her ‘ new ’ package , watch out for the deal done over the mining tax . "
Tim Gooden , Secretary Geelong Trades Hall Council and Socialist Alliance member :
" The new leadership of the Labor government has an opportunity now to introduce a real response to climate change , to undo the damage done to refugees by the Howard government and under Rudd , and to resolve the outstanding issues with the trade union movement , including abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission ( ABCC ) .
" But I am not holding my breath .
" Gillard has already begun to sell out to the mining companies on the RSPT - no wonder the mining stocks shot up !
" She 's already sold her soul to the right wing of the ALP .
This is a re-run on her performance on workplace laws .
How many meetings did she have with the bosses over them ?
" We saw how arrogant she was with the teachers .
She 's not called Guillotine Gillard for nothing and she has the best poker face .
" The ALP leadership is looking to gain some votes for putting in a woman PM but sisters should not expect any favours .
Remember Margaret
Thatcher was a woman .
" The ALP leadership is simply cynically responding to the polls .
They have proved over and over again that they have no respect for their party 's rank and file 's attempts to determine policy .
" They have shown no leadership on the refugee issue .
Real leadership means having the guts to demolish the lies about refugee numbers and tell the public that it would take 30 years to fill the MCG with refugees on current arrival numbers . "
Jess Moore , the Socialist Alliance candidate for Cunningham in NSW 's South Coast :
" Julia Gillard 's ousting of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is a blatant attempt to re-brand the Labor Party .
" In the face of Rudd 's epic nosedive in the polls since April this is a desperate attempt by Labor to re-brand itself .
But the swearing in of Julia Gillard as Prime Minister will only mean more of the same for the people of Australia .
" As Kevin Rudd 's deputy she has been as complicit as anyone in the actions of the ALP .
This is a desperate attempt to re-badge a political party in crisis .
" But Labor 's trial of this same tactic in NSW with Premier Kristina Keneally shows that , while it works in the short term , over time the focus shifts back to the issues .
" People are angry with what Labor has done - and failed to do - in government .
We need real change , not more factional maneuvering from Labor .
" Gillard has been responsible for some of this government 's most anti-social acts .
As federal workplace relations minister , she maintained the Australian Building and Construction Commission which
denies construction workers basic human rights .
As education minister she allowed damaging school league tables to be used by the media , stigmatising those from disadvantaged schools .
" We should n't let the scrapping of Rudd fool us .
We need a political alternative to the major parties .
" We still need to fight for real and immediate action on climate and for workers ' rights .
We have to continue the campaign against racism in this country , in particular the racism directed at asylum seekers .
Australia must let the boats land and close the detention centres .
" In this federal election , we need real change , not more of the same . "
Rachel Evans , the Socialist Alliance lead Senate candidate for NSW :
“ If the first female PM of Australia supported abortion rights , for equal pay for women and for same - sex marriage rights , I ’d be celebrating . ”
“ Gillard was just as complicit in Labor ’s cruel policy towards asylum seekers ” , said Evans , a refugee rights activist .
“ As the shadow immigration spokesperson , 2001 - 2003 , Gillard did not disagree with mandatory detention – after all it was Labor ’s idea orginally .
In government , she ’s helped orchestrate the ‘ Indian Ocean ’ solution – forcing Indonesia to take asylum seekers bound for Australia . ”
Pip Hinman , Socialist Alliance candidate in Grayndler :
“ Despite Gillard ’s so - called left credentials , Julia Gillard has proven to be as conservative as the rest of the ALP leadership – on refugees , workplace laws and foreign policy . ”
“ Gillard ’s statements backing away from insisting on the mining companies ’ super profits tax as a clear signal that she is ready to do a deal with the mining bosses ” , Hinman said .
“ All their talk of needing to ‘ share the wealth ’ comes to nothing when there ’s an election hanging in the balance . ”
Hinman believes that Gillard ’s ascension to the leadership of the ALP , and to the PM ’s job , is a desperate attempt to re-badge a party in crisis .
" In the face of Rudd 's epic nosedive in the polls since April , this is a desperate attempt by Labor to re-brand itself .
“ NSW Labor used the same tactic with Kristina Keneally .
But when the superficiality of the stunt wears off , people still want to know what real change will come from the shuffling of the deck chairs ” , said
Hinman .
“ People want real alternatives : they are fed up with these non-conviction politicians . ”
Gemma Weedall , the 21 - year - old Socialist Alliance candidate for Adelaide :
" Unfortunately a change in leadership is unlikely to mean a real change to Labor 's unjust and inadequate policies .
" Gillard has a history of undermining and attacking unions , whether it is through the support of the ABCC or the introduction of NAPLAN testing in schools .
" Her committment to ' throwing open the government 's door to the mining industry ' shows her inability to stand up against the big polluters and take real action on climate change .
" Working people need a real political alternative to the ALP .
The Socialist Alliance seeks to build an alternative party that consistently represents the grassroots and puts people before profits . "
Alex Bainbridge , the Socialist Alliance candidate for Perth :
" How galling to see Julia Gillard in her first media conference pay tribute not only to previous right - wing Labor prime ministers but to Howard and Costello as well .
" She also commended Kevin Rudd for reinforcing the unjust war in Afghanistan .
" Kevin Rudd was elected under the banner of ' change ' and ' new leadership ' but did n't deliver anything like the progressive changes that we need .
Gillard has now become prime minister precisely because people are still hungering for real change and genuine progressive leadership .
" I will be cheering as loud as anybody if the ALP under Gillard turns towards a progressive agenda including : replacing coal power with renewable energy ; bringing the troops home from Afghanistan ; dismantling the ABCC and truly ripping up all the anti-worker laws in this country ; ending the NT intervention and ending detention of asylum seekers .
" If we are to get any of these advances it will only be because we step up our campaigns now instead of waiting to see what Julia Gillard will do .
Gillard does not deserve a ' honeymoon period ' - we need real action now . "
John Gauci , secretary Inner City Teachers Association ( Sydney ) and member of the NSW Teachers Federation executive :
" Teachers have already exerienced the reactonary politics of Gillard in the school league tables campaign .
Gillard was fully conscious of the damage that school league tables have had in Britain yet she persisted with their publication in Australia .
" Although she has some union background , Gillard was also prepared to threaten the WA branch of the Australian Education Union with deregistration simply for taking industrial action in the campaign . "
Stuart Munckton , co-editor Green Left Weekly :
“ The dramatic fall of Kevin Rudd came after he lost record levels of popular support .
Rudd was swept to power on the basis of anger at the policies of the Howard government , especially on workers ’ rights , climate change and refugees .
People expected change .
But Rudd largely continued the policies of Howard .
“ The issue of climate change proved the big turning point .
Rudd came to office declaring climate change the ' greatest moral issue of our time ' and then , at the first sign of political difficulties , dumped his proposed ETS .
Environmentalists had actually pointed out this policy was never going to result in action to tackle climate change , but in the public perception , Rudd had just abandoned what he had assured them was an absolute key principle for him .
People voted him in partly on this basis , because Howard was a dinosaur who refused to even acknowledge the problem .
“ After abandoning the ETS , Rudd ’s popularity began to dive and never recovered .
“ The treatment of refugees was another issue for many , with Rudd continuing much of Howard ’s inhumane policy and , whatever Rudd now claims , waging a ' race to the right ' on the issue with Abbott .
This unnerved sections of people who helped put him in power and , along with the climate change issue , this helps explain why the Greens are polling a record 16 % .
“ Having shown himself to be just another cynical politician , when Rudd tried to claw back lost ground by proposing his mining tax and taking on the powerful companies ( with the backing of other sections of big business ) , he was unable to sell the tax and defend it from the well - funded campaign against it .
“ Why would anyone believe this was not just a cynical move by Rudd , who had revealed himself nothing but another cynical politician who seemed willing to sacrifice any principle , even over an issue as dramatic as climate change , in pursuit of power ?
Who could believe that Rudd would not launch a 180° about face if he thought it suited his interests ? ”
“ In short , who on Earth would want to follow Kevin Rudd into a fight with powerful multinational corporations ? ”
“ So the Labor party dumped Rudd and installed Julia Gillard — who they hope to sell as a fresh face , despite her central role in the Rudd government .
“ But if Gillard takes the same route and fails to implement the change people desperately want , especially in tackling climate change , she too will go the same way as Rudd .
You can only bullshit people for so long .
“ Even if Gillard - led Labor holds Abbott off in the coming elections , it will give ground to right - wing lunatics in the Coalition of it follows Rudd ’s cynical path .
Labor ca n’t be trusted to keep the Liberals out — the need for a left alternative is growing greater ever day . ”
Ewan Saunders , Socialist Alliance candidate for the federal seat of Brisbane :
“ The sacking of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his replacement by Julia Gillard is to a considerable extent a result of the campaign by the multinational mining corporations and the media monopolies to prevent the federal government forcing them to pay fair tax on their massive super - profits .
“ The Australian Workers Union and other right - wing faction leaders in the ALP , in moving to dump Rudd , were essentially acting as a tool of the mining and media bosses , in their determination to allow no limit on their right to rip off the mining wealth of Australian working people and Indigenous communities .
“ This whole operation has the mark of a ' Second Canberra Coup , ' reminding us of how big business and the media combined to bring down Gough Whitlam in November 1975 .
While Gillard is no Malcolm Fraser , the role of the ruling class in determining who is allowed to lead the country is the same .
“ The Labor Party was forced to act against Rudd to try to save its skin in the coming federal election , where it was facing potential disaster , because of a number of factors - but in the end because of the lying scare campaign of the mining companies , which had accelerated the plummeting support for Rudd in the electorate .
“ Now is the time for the trade union movement and the community to say enough is enough .
We must demand that Gillard and the ALP stand up to the mining giants , and refuse to back down on the government 's proposed tax on mining super - profits .
“ We need to rally to reject the dictatorship of the giant corporations , and demand genuine popular democracy -- where the interests of ordinary people prevail over the rampant greed of big business . "
Sharon Firebrace , Koori activist and Socialist Alliance Senate candidate for Victoria :
" Julia Gillard is going to be following the same path as Rudd and be just as anti-union as he was .
With the eleciton of Gillard , now is the time to push for the removal of fines against unions and the removal of the ABCC and other anti-union laws .
We need the right to strike but there is no way the ALP will ever support the right to strike .
" There is no sign that Gillard will do anything to reverse the racist apartheid laws in the Northern Territory where indigenous people have lesser rights than non-indigenous people .
Indigenous workers get paid as low as $ 4 an hour in the Northern Territory .
That 's exploitation of black labour .
It 's weakening us economically and disempowering us .
" The ALP government has also been promoting racism towards refugees and migrants .
Some migrants are working for as little as $ 8 an hour .
That is exploited labour .
" We need a united workers party .
That is the only way that we 'll change things . "

Most Americans know that the U.S. economy is in bad shape , but what most Americans do n’t know is how truly desperate the financial situation of the United States really is .
The truth is that what we are experiencing is not simply a “ downturn ” or a “ recession ” .
What we are witnessing is the beginning of the end for the greatest economic machine that the world has ever seen .
Our greed and our debt are literally eating our economy alive .
Total government , corporate and personal debt has now reached 360 percent of GDP , which is far higher than it ever reached during the Great Depression era .
We have nearly totally dismantled our once colossal manufacturing base , we have shipped millions upon millions of middle class jobs overseas , we have lived far beyond our means for decades and we have created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the world .
A great day of financial reckoning is fast approaching , and the vast majority of Americans are totally oblivious .
But the truth is that you cannot defy the financial laws of the universe forever .
What goes up must come down .
The borrower is the servant of the lender .
Cutting corners always catches up with you in the end .
Sometimes it takes cold , hard numbers for many of us to fully realize the situation that we are facing .
So , the following are 50 very revealing statistics about the U.S. economy that are almost too crazy to believe ….
# 50 ) In 2010 the U.S. government is projected to issue almost as much new debt as the rest of the governments of the world combined .
# 49 ) It is being projected that the U.S. government will have a budget deficit of approximately 1.6 trillion dollars in 2010 .
# 48 ) If you went out and spent one dollar every single second , it would take you more than 31,000 years to spend a trillion dollars .
# 47 ) In fact , if you spent one million dollars every single day since the birth of Christ , you still would not have spent one trillion dollars by now .
# 46 ) Total U.S. government debt is now up to 90 percent of gross domestic product .
# 45 ) Total credit market debt in the United States , including government , corporate and personal debt , has reached 360 percent of GDP .
# 44 ) U.S. corporate income tax receipts were down 55 % ( to $ 138 billion ) for the year ending September 30th , 2009 .

HOLY HELL IT’S FIVE ALREADY .
I want a do - over .
I think I took a wrong turn somewhere .
This day was clearly intended for someone else .
Prime - time soap actor Jeremy London suffered some harrowing real - life drama last week , when the star was kidnapped in the California desert and forced to smoke drugs at gunpoint , according to reports .
London was fixing a flat tire outside a hotel in Palm Springs when two men approached to help , local police confirmed in a statement to E !
Online .
After helping secure a new tire , the pair held London , known for roles on " 7th Heaven " and " Party of Five , " at gunpoint and forced him to chauffeur them around the city .
" The gunman forced London to drive to various locations throughout the city , purchase alcohol and use illicit drugs , " police said in the statement .
The illicit substance was " dope , " crack cocaine or amphetamines , reports Radar Online .
The act is particularly egregious considering that London is a recovering drug addict .
After nearly 12 hours of captivity , London escaped ( how he escaped is still unknown ) and contacted police about 2:35 a.m. the next morning .
London 's car was found in a Palm Springs development called Gateway Estates , with an arrest made later that day -- 26 - year - old Brandon Adams , who has been charged with kidnapping , robbery and vehicle theft .
" Thankfully , Jeremy London survived his terrorizing ordeal in Palm Springs last week -- although understandably shaken and scared , he is currently working closely with law enforcement as they investigate the horrific turn of events , " a rep for London told E !
News .
" Jeremy is spending quality time in an undisclosed location with family and friends , and appreciates the overwhelming support from his fans . "
In September 2009 , London checked into rehab to treat an addiction to prescription drugs .
" There were times I did n't care if I died , " he told People magazine of his addiction .
" I felt like I was losing everything . "

Do you like to be one of the first people to board a plane , avoiding crowded aisles and getting your pick of overhead bin space ?
There 's a fee for that .
American Airlines has introduced the " Boarding and Flexibility Package , " which allows passengers who buy tickets on the carrier 's website also to purchase perks that include being among the first to board a flight .
The " introductory price " for the package ranges from $ 9 to $ 19 one way and varies based on the market and routing .
The package also includes a $ 75 discount off the regular $ 150 fee charged on many fares if you need to change your itinerary and allows you to be on standby for an earlier flight for free .
This summer , American will offer early boarding as a stand - alone option for a flat fee of $ 10 each way .
Air travelers will be able to buy the perk at self - service check - in kiosks up to one hour before their flight is scheduled to leave .
The airline is emphasizing the package gives air travelers the flexibility to customize their trip based on their needs .
" If customers feel confident they will not have to or likely will not wish to make any changes to their low - fare itinerary , they will likely decide not to purchase this particular offering , " said American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith in an e-mail .
But at least one consumer travel expert was n't impressed , especially by the discounts offered by the " Boarding and Flexibility Package . "
" American is allowing you to pay a fee to avoid paying a fee , " wrote Christopher Elliott , a travel columnist and National Geographic Traveler magazine 's reader advocate .
" This is as bizarre a move as charging for the first bag , which American Airlines pioneered . "
Passengers who pay the early boarding fee wo n't be the very first on the plane .
That privilege will still be reserved for American 's elite status members .
And as always , passengers with special needs will be allowed to board early without paying anything extra , Smith said .
Other airlines have introduced similar fees .
United Airlines offers a " Premier Line " service starting at $ 19 , which gives passengers priority boarding .
Southwest Airlines charges $ 10 for its " Early Bird Check - in , " which promises air travelers " a better boarding position . "
Europe 's Ryanair , which is famous for its low prices and variety of fees , charges 4 euro ( about $ 5 ) for priority boarding .
A new mathematical analysis of team tactics predicts a Spanish win in Sunday 's FIFA World Cup final and also sheds some light on why England were trashed by Germany .
Mathematicians and football supporters Dr Javier López Peña and Dr Hugo Touchette from Queen Mary , University of London have collected ball passing data from all of the FIFA World Cup games and analysed it to reveal the nations ' different styles of play .
Using the mathematical technique called graph theory , they have revealed the gaping holes in England 's tactics against Germany and made predictions about the Netherlands - Spain final that may just rival the psychic octopus .
The Netherlands - Spain prediction
For each national side , López Peña and Touchette have drawn up a network of passes between players throughout the tournament and analysed how these networks compare between teams .
Touchette explains : " Each player in the network is given a score called , which measures how vital they are to the network .
The higher the centrality score , the bigger the impact if that player was n't there .
This method is most commonly used to make computer networks more robust , but it can also be used to plan football strategy . "
The networks reveal that Spanish players have made a strikingly high number of passes in this tournament , almost 40 % more than Germany and twice as many as the Dutch .
" The team relies on swift passes that are well distributed among all players , especially between those playing mid-field , " said López Peña .
David Villa ( number 7 ) , the tournament 's highest goal scorer , has received an average of 37 passes per game , more than any other forward from all the teams .
López Peña said : " Villa 's performance has been impressive compared with Fernando Torres ( number 9 ) , who has not scored any goals this tournament .
This was reflected in the successful Spanish tactics , with Torres only receiving an average of 13 passes per match , and 37 to Villa . "
Conversely , the Dutch game play is clearly offensive , involving a very low number of passes between players , most of which are aimed at the strikers .
López Peña said : " The low number of passes shows the Dutch prefer quick attacks and counterstrikes rather than intricate playing .
Their goals are often scored from set pieces such as free kicks and they use their physical presence to beat their opponents . "
The England - Germany match
The analysis shows the English squad to have a balanced line - up with no single player more important than the team as a whole .
López Peña said : " The good midfield work of Frank Lampard ( number 8 ) , Steven Gerrard ( number 4 ) and Gareth Barry ( number 14 ) does n't appear to transfer very well to the forwards , with Wayne Rooney ( number 10 ) receiving on average three times more passes than Jermain Defoe ( number 19 ) .
This makes the English attack very predictable and easily stoppable by blocking Rooney , who is usually forced to give the ball back to Gerrard . "
The German network appears even more balanced than the English one , with a higher number of passes , suggesting more circulation of the ball .
" Particularly relevant are the passes between Philipp Lahm ( number 16 ) and Bastian Schweinsteiger ( number 7 ) and most of the German attacks are built up from the defenders .
Mesut Oezil ( number 8 ) makes good work connecting both sides of the field on the attack , making the German offensive game very effective and hard to defend against .
The key player in the German strategy remains Schweinsteiger , who was effectively blocked by the Spanish midfielders ' characteristic fast circulation in their semi-final defeat , " said López Peña .

Senate Democrats believe they 've found a surefire way to force Republicans to support a sweeping climate and energy bill that directly addresses greenhouse gas emissions .
Now all they need is the actual legislation .
Democrats admitted yesterday that they have yet to rally around any of the legislative proposals currently on the table but now believe they know how to use the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to secure the necessary Republican votes once they do .
According to a staff - written summary of yesterday 's closed - door caucus meeting obtained by E&E , senators discussed a legislative strategy " more akin to the financial regulatory legislation than of health care , with Democrats bringing to the floor an impenetrable package that Republicans could not roadblock . "
Democratic senators declined to discuss the exact details of their strategy after emerging from the hourlong talks .
But its basic thrust appears to be a plan to anchor the climate and energy effort to widely popular legislation that would overhaul offshore drilling regulations in the wake of the Gulf spill , and then dare Republicans to vote against it .
" We 're going to challenge some of our Republican colleagues to do what I know they know is the right and necessary thing for America , and we 're going to get 60 votes or more , " Sen . Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) told reporters .
On the financial reform bill , Senate Democrats harnessed public outrage at big business to force Republicans to the table .
Four Republicans joined all but two Democrats to pass the bill that is currently in conference with the House .
At the same time , there are likely very few GOP swing votes , meaning Democrats would still need to capitalize on what they say is a renewed sense of unity within their caucus to cobble together compromise legislation capable of appeasing the party 's full spectrum .
In order to do so , they may employ a proposal Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) floated yesterday , which would create a special group made up of 10 or so Democrats who would hammer out a piece of compromise legislation and perhaps serve as de facto whips to keep their caucus in line when the bill reaches the floor .
Democrats used such as group during the health care debate , which eventually passed with no Republican support .
A spokesman for Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) declined to comment on the strategy , but Democrats were not shy about touting the oil spill response legislation as a key pillar of their energy plans .
" Whatever form it takes , we 're going to move forward , " Reid said directly after yesterday 's meeting .
" We agree we must deal with the catastrophe in the Gulf , we must create millions of new jobs , we must cut pollution , and we must strengthen our national security and energy independence . "
Democrats have been attempting to tie the need for sweeping energy and climate legislation to the ongoing BP PLC oil leak since it began , but the new plan appears to go a step further .
By including drilling safety reform in the bill , they hope to make the case that a vote against the package is a vote for BP and " Big Oil . "
" It will be an opportunity for senators to vote for oil safety , " Lieberman said .
But Republicans are unlikely to sit idly by and allow Democrats to execute their plan , and a number are already girding for what some see as nothing more than a political ploy .
" Our initiative , our imperative right now should be to provide the help and the assistance to those in the Gulf , " Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) said earlier this week .
" And if there is an effort that ties relief to the victims of the Deepwater Horizon disaster to an energy bill that simply does not stand a chance at passage , then we are not doing justice by those who have been harmed by the disaster . "
Asked whether she would advocate passing an oil bill before an energy bill , Murkowski said , " Yep , definitely , yep . "
Sen. John Barrasso ( R - Wyo. ) said yesterday that efforts to package oil spill response language with climate provisions would be a nonstarter regardless of public pressure to reform offshore drilling .
" That 's not going to work for me , " he said .
That stance was echoed by conservative strategists and industry advocates off Capitol Hill .
" I do n't think that will work , " said Andrew Wheeler , a former Republican staff director for the Environment and Public Works Committee who now works for B &D Consulting , adding that " if they try to load it with other things , it could kill it . "
" Everyone agrees that the oil spill is a tragedy , " said Scott Segal , an industry attorney at Bracewell & Giuliani .
" But if you try to make that rage bear too much legislative freight it may well be seen by the public as a cynical attempt to push an unrelated agenda . "
Gang of 10 ?
After yesterday 's afternoon meeting , nearly every Democrat who spoke to reporters stressed the newfound unity within their caucus to pass energy and climate legislation this year .
" As we said , we had a revival , " said Sen. Kay Hagan ( D - N.C. ) .
" There was this atmosphere of a lot of people coming together on the need now to move forward . "
But while Democrats appeared to rally around the general idea of energy and climate legislation -- complete with what Lieberman and Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) vaguely called " polluter pays " language -- they failed to find consensus on the bill 's details .
That could be where Schumer 's commission comes in .
A number of lawmakers said that they would be open to the idea of creating a special panel of senators to recommend what should ultimately be in the final draft .
" I 'm fine with that , I was one of the 10 on the health care bill , " said Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) .
" I 'm willing to try to do anything . "
Schumer mentioned the idea near the end of the energy caucus yesterday , according to several Democrats , who cautioned that it was not something that had been finalized .
" I do n't know that Senator Reid has embraced it or is going to move forward on it , " said Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) .
Schumer declined to comment .
" I do n't talk about what happened in the caucus , " he told reporters .
In 2008 , a short - lived " Gang of 15 " ( later 16 ) , comprised of moderate Democrats from the Midwest , Rust Belt and West , launched out of dissatisfaction with a cap - and - trade bill that failed on the Senate floor ( E&E Daily , Oct. 3 , 2008 ) .
Sen . Tom Carper ( D - Del. ) , who also served in the group of 10 health care negotiators , said he would not rule out the possibility of a Democratic commission for energy and climate .
" I thought it was of value , " Carper said of the health care panel .
" I 'd say that doing that again is not likely , but it was an interesting idea . "

Pelosi : Train Station Receiving $ 35 Million From Stimulus A " Small Price To Pay "
Nancy Pelosi said a $ 35 million train station in St. Paul , Minnesota funded by the stimulus is " a small price to pay for taking this region into the future . "
The train station is not expected to open to Amtrak services until September 2012 and will not be fully operational until 2014 .
When did the Presidents of the United States stop being our Commander in chiefs and become the figureheads they are today ?
Obama is simply a figurehead while it is the Corporations that actually run our government .
The vote from the Supreme Court regarding the roles of corporations in election funding should have solidified this thought in many people 's mind .
In 2008 , a suit brought before the Supreme Court , Davis v. Federal Election Commission , which in essence set aside the Millionaires Amendment as unconstitutional .
A prime example of the wealthy taking more control in the election process .
And again in January 2010 , Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , the Supreme Court decided in the favor of corporations and their ability to promote one political party and / or candidate over another , therefore using its power and money to play a major role in determining the outcome of elections .
In a history making decision 5 - 4 , the argument placed before the Justices was that " the prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on freedom of speech backed by criminal statutes . "
Apparently the 5 of the Justices in their infinite wisdom agreed and overturned a lower courts ' ruling in the matter .
While this author is not a constitutional expert by any means , I find it rather interesting that on one hand a corporation by definition is a legal entity existing separately from its owners for the purpose of limiting liability of said owners , yet it was determined by the Supreme court that corporations ' ( an entity ) right to freedom of speech was being violated .
So what are corporations ?
Are they an individual citizen or a legal entity that is formed to protect individual owners / citizens ?
Looks like the corporations get their cake and eat it too .
What these two cases show is further control of our political system and the selection of our leaders by the wealthy , and the corporation 's ( both domestic and foreign ) .
It also makes the case for the further erosion of the ability of " we the people " to elect individuals that will represent our interests .
While President Obama called it a " major victory for big oil , wall street banks , health insurance companies , and other powerful interests . "
There is absolutely nothing he can do about it .
After all look who is really responsible for placing the Justices to the Supreme Court that made these decisions .
Not the people , but those with corporate interests .
If this is n't enough to wake up the citizens of this country , take a look at who received the bailouts in the recent near collapse of our economy .
Corporate entities were deemed too big to fail and received billions of dollars to keep them from failing .
And to add insult to injury , these same corporations continued on with many of the very same practices that created the need for the bail out in the first place .
Executives received huge bonuses , went on lavish junkets , shareholders receive record dividends all on the backs of the working class .
I do n't know about you but if one cannot manage their business then they should lose their business .
That 's the way it works for the small business community .
Yet another example

House Democrats have won seven special elections in a row , including four since Obama was inaugurated .
Their opponents all had one big overriding issue in common :
New York 20th , March 31 , 2009
Republican Jim Tedisco 's platform ?
Nancy Pelosi is scary .
“ I think he ’s Nancy Pelosi ’s worst nightmare , ” said State Senator Roy McDonald , who until this year represented other parts of Saratoga County in the Assembly .
“ He ’s not going to remain silent and take orders . ”
Fred Thomspon :
America is waking up to the flawed thinking and outright dangerous schemes of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid ’s Congress and the Obama Administration .
Opposition is building every day .
If Jim Tedisco wins this seat , it will be a very public repudiation .
A Tedisco victory will start the process of building an effective opposition to the Obama - Pelosi agenda , and send a clear message : conservatives are n’t going to let the extremist left in Washington strip us of our rights and freedoms .
Giuliani :
" I 'm calling to ask you to join me in supporting Jim Tedisco for congress this Tuesday March 31 , " reads the script .
" This congressional race could come down to a few hundred votes and yours could be the difference between victory and defeat .
Jim Tedisco 's victory will ensure that we have a voice in Congress that will stand up to Nancy Pelosi , and all her plans to hike taxes and spending by trillions of dollars .
Please join me , Rudy Giuliani , in support Jim Tedisco this Tuesday . "
California 10th , November 3 , 2009
Republican David Harmer 's platform ?
Nancy Pelosi is scary .
Conservatives criticized [ Democratic opponent John ]
Garamendi's support for a government - run insurance plan in health care reform legislation in Congress and sent out mailers linking him with Pelosi , D - San Francisco .
Now , Harmer has decided to target Rep. Jerry McNerney in the neighboring CA - 11th , and thinks the same message will somehow yield different results :
" Jerry McNerney claims to be a moderate Democrat , but his voting record is well to left of his district .
On every significant vote , he supports the liberal agenda of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
New York 23rd , November 3 , 2009
Conservative Doug Hoffman 's platform ?
Nancy Pelosi is scary .
Conservative party candidate Doug Hoffman is up with a new ad blasting Democrat Bill Owens as a lackey of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ Nancy Pelosi hand - picked Bill Owens for Congress and bankrolls his campaign .
You know what that means , ” the ad says .
“ So when Pelosi wants Owens ’ vote for her massive energy taxes , government - run medicine and a trillion dollar deficit , where would Bill Owens stand : With you or with her ? ”
Hoffman did n't get the hint with his loss , and he continues to run on his anti-Pelosi platform .
Pennsylvania 12th , yesterday :
Republican Tim Burns ' platform ?
Nancy Pelosi is scary .
Burns made the race about Pelosi and often featured her in his TV commercials .
If " Nancy Pelosi 's values are your values , then Mark Critz is your candidate , " Burns said in a TV ad .
More :
In a new ad supporting Republican Tim Burns , who 's running for the seat vacated by the late Rep. Jack Murtha ( D - PA ) , the group RightChange.com depicts an animated Nancy Pelosi as a cross between Frankenstein 's monster and Godzilla .
Obama and Harry Reid play the roles of mad scientists .
As they flip switches for bailouts and taxes , Pelosi is zapped and grows to terrifying size .
Then she stomps on a factory , a home and goes berserk on a suburban street .
The only thing that can stop her ?
Laser - like beams fired from Tim Burns campaign pins .
The result of these elections ?
Democrats won .
Apparently , Nancy Pelosi just is n't that scary .
But these crazies listen to their Pelosi - obsessed base and convince themselves that their hatred will translate to the rest of the electorate .
It wo n't .
People do n't hate Pelosi .
And given the choice between a campaign talking issues , and a campaign screaming about Pelosi , the voters are making the same choice every single time -- even in districts ( like NY - 23 ) in which Democrats had n't represented since the 1850s , or in a McCain district like PA - 12 .
It turns out that Pelosi sucks as a boogeyman .
She 's terrible at it !
But as long as the GOP does n't figure that out , their hopes for massive gains will definitely come up short .

Mr Gombert loves to fish , hike and ski .
Also , since both of his children have taken up golf , he selflessly plays with them at weekends .
There is a lot of space in Boise .
A 25 - mile green belt runs through the city .
The nearby foothills are latticed with biking trails .
At 3,000 people per square mile , the population density is less than a twentieth of Manhattan's .
Yet although Boise is remote — the nearest big city is 340 miles away — it is no backwater .
Since 1978 it has been home to Micron , a large semiconductor firm .

It is easier to keep up with the latest ideas if you keep bumping into other people who work in the same field .
As Alfred Marshall , an English economist , wrote in 1890 : in industrial clusters “ the mysteries of the trade become no mystery , but are , as it were , in the air . ”
That is why geeks flock to Silicon Valley and financiers converge on New York .
But such clusters can become victims of their own success .
When a hotspot gets too hot , it becomes expensive to live there , which spurs some brainy people — especially those with children — to migrate to places that are not quite so hot but more liveable .
The population of the Boise - Nampa metro area has nearly doubled in the past two decades , sparking a property bubble .
Yet housing is still laughably cheap : $ 150,000 buys you a spacious house with a garden .
In the nice parts of Palo Alto , it buys you a poky flat .
The internet lets people compare cities and neighbourhoods by whatever criteria matter to them , from house prices to commuting times .
That gives a boost to remote but agreeable locales .
Also thanks to the internet , people can now live far from the madding crowd and yet remain abreast of its ignoble strife .
“ What Karl Marx called ‘ the idiocy of rural life ' no longer applies , ” writes Joel Kotkin , a demographer , in a book called “ The Next Hundred Million : America in 2050 ” .
A brain worker in Boise has the same access to technical and market information as her rival in San Francisco .

America 's hinterland is often mocked .
Cosmopolitans dismiss it as “ flyover country ” .
Many assume that nothing interesting happens there .
Yet as America 's population expands , much of the growth will occur where there is space .
Mr Kotkin predicts a resurgence of the heartland , as Americans move away from the coasts in search of more room .
The same forces will attract immigrants to places that have traditionally been lily - white .
The Boise metro area already has a population that is 17 % ethnic minority , mostly Hispanic or Asian .
Restaurants serve Japanese cuisine with an Idaho twist : huge portions .
“ Life is easy here , ” says Jinye Huo , a software engineer at Balihoo , whose home in Boise is four times larger than her old flat in Beijing .
Others are less bullish about America 's wide open spaces .
Many greens would prefer it if everyone lived in tiny energy - efficient urban apartments .
Some go further .
Deborah and Frank Popper , two academics from the north - east , once proposed emptying much of the Great Plains and creating a national park for buffalo .
More pragmatically , Edward Glaeser of Harvard University argues that improvements in transport and communications technology will make “ idea - producing ” cities even denser .
When new ideas can easily be sold around the world , he argues , the rewards for generating them rise , and brainy people will be lured to Boston and New York with ever - fatter pay packets .
Different strokes
Both Mr Kotkin and Mr Glaeser could be right .
Some of the next 100 m Americans will choose to live in towering mega-cities .
Others will crave backyards big enough to play softball in .
Who lives where will depend on public policy ( zoning rules , petrol taxes , etc ) , on natural constraints ( water , energy ) and on individual tastes .
But however birth rates and migration patterns change , America 's geographical size will be a huge advantage .
It means that Americans can keep reproducing and welcoming immigrants without their country ever feeling crowded .
If the population doubled , it would still be only a quarter as crowded as Britain is today , and less than a hundredth as crowded as Singapore .
Vast swathes of land are almost empty .
David Bieter , the mayor of Boise , says his city could easily double in size again .
Wide open spaces and the struggle to settle them are the keys to American culture , argued Frederick Jackson Turner , a historian , a century ago .
The practical skills and rugged individualism of the frontiersfolk made the country prosperous , decentralised and democratic .
Turner overstated his case , but America is far more decentralised than other rich countries .
In Britain “ there 's London , London and London , ” says Mr Kotkin .
In America there are scores of hubs .
There is also a libertarian streak in America 's most sparsely - populated states .
Only 10 % of Idahoans trust the federal government , says Greg Hill , a professor at Boise State University .
Butch Otter , the state 's governor , rebelled against both Obamacare and George Bush 's Patriot Act .
“ Do n't tread on me ” was one of the first slogans of the American revolutionaries ; and in the open spaces , no one needs to tread on anyone else .

The Woodlice ( Isopods )
Woodlice ( Isopods , or animals of the Order Isopoda ) are among the most familiar of animals .
They have featured prominently throughout history , in recipes ( Holt 1885 , included a recipe for woodlouse sauce ) , in the poetry of Sir John Betjeman , the novels of Jean Paul Sartre , the paintings of Paul Klee – and have even provided the inspiration for a sermon .
In the past , wood lice were often carried in a small pouch attached to a cord around the neck .
These were swallowed as a cure for stomach aches and other minor ailments .
It is possible that the calcium carbonate in their exoskeletons is able to neutralise stomach acids – although I confess I have not had the courage to test this theory !
The beneficial effects of woodlice far outweigh any damage that they do .
However , woodlice have an ill - deserved reputation as pests ; mainly because they wander into houses at night ( usually to escape supersaturation with water during wet weather ) .
Wood lice may travel considerable distances during these nocturnal rambles .
I have found some isopod specimens trapped inside a light shade of a bedroom , on the first floor of a building .
In the garden , woodlice rarely attack living plants , preferring to eat vegetation which has begun to decompose .
In glasshouses , woodlice may occasionally nibble seedlings but they rarely do any significant economic damage .
In the litter layer of deciduous woods , and on compost heaps , wood lice perform a vital role .
They chew dead plants into small fragments and deposit these as faecal pellets , which decompose rapidly .
Isopods may also graze fungal hyphae from leaves ( Gunnarson , 1987 ) or their own faecal pellets ( Hassall and Rushton ) ) and this may form an important source of nutrients , when the only food available is of poor quality .
Deposition of faecal pellets , containing fungal spores in deep moist leaf litter by woodlice , may be important in stimulating decomposition in woodlands .
Thus , the feeding activities of woodlice speed up the decomposition process and help to return essential nutrients to the soil .
All British woodlice are predominantly vegetarian .
However , there are some foreign species that have a more varied diet .
In New Zealand , the main food of the sand beach woodlouse Scyphax ornatus is drowned honeybees .
In the US , woodlice are used by museum workers to clean the flesh from delicate vertebrate skeletons .
Order Isopoda : Evolution , Distribution and Ecology
Woodlice are members of the class Crustacea , which also includes crabs , shrimps and lobsters .
Most crustaceans are aquatic .
Only two orders contain species which are able to live their whole life cycle away from water .
These are the Isopoda ( which includes the woodlice ) and the Amphipoda .
In the British Isles , there is only one species of terrestrial Amphipod , Arcitalitrus dorrieni , that can live permanently on land .
This was introduced to Britain from Australia – and is now quite widespread in Cornwall and South Devon ( Harding and Sutton , 1988 ) .
It has been discovered recently in several other areas of Britain , including Kew Gardens .
The order Isopoda contains more than 10,000 species of Isopod worldwide ; most of which are marine .
About 3,500 species of wood lice ( Suborder Oniscidea ) have been described , but there are probably at least as many waiting to be discovered – especially in tropical rain forests .
Isopods evolved in the sea and are thought to have made the transition to land via the seashore .
Species such as the common sea slater , Ligia oceanica , are still restricted to the coast .
Successive Isopoda species became increasingly resistant to the rigours of a terrestrial existence – and probably colonised the land via moist leaf litter of pteridophytes ( horsetails and ferns ) during the Carboniferous ( Piearce , 1989 ) .
Two key features likely helped ‘ pre- adapted ’ marine isopods to colonise the land .
First , the dorso - ventral flattening of the body gave them an extremely stable ‘ squat ’ posture when walking .
Second , retention of the young in a fluid - filled brood pouch protected them from drying out in the first few weeks after hatching from the egg .
All isopods have seven pairs of legs , which are usually of similar structure ( hence the name iso - pod from the Greek isos meaning ‘ equal ’ and podes meaning feet ) .
Traditionally , woodlouse have been regarded as poorly adapted to life on land .
However , research conducted in recent years has shown that woodlice have evolved several sophisticated physiological and behavioural mechanisms to control water loss .
These include the modification of the pleopods , to form lungs ; and a capillary conducting system which allows nitrogenous waste to be excreted as ammonia gas ( without significant loss of water – Hoese , 1984 ) .
Indeed , the Dutch word for woodlice ‘ pissebed ’ is probably derived from the smell of urine that large aggregations of woodlice give off .
Wood lice have colonised some of the most extreme environments on earth , including deserts in Israel and North Africa – and hypersaline pools in Australia via fully terrestrial forms .
The desert species Hemilepistus reaumuri occurs in burrows at densities of greater than 100 per square metre .
This remarkable woodlouse pairs for life and is able to relocate its burrow , using the position of the sun in the sky .
The juveniles help to maintain the burrow .
Thus , this species is the nearest we have to true social behaviour ( eusociality ) in woodlice .
Individual Hemilepistus are able to walk several kilometres in a few days , quite a feat in the rigorous desert environment .
The only animals known to prey exclusively on woodlice are spiders of the genus Dysdera .
Many other animals will , however , eat them ; and toads can be reared to adulthood on a diet that consists entirely of woodlice .
In terms of impact of predation on numbers , centipedes consume about 40 % of all woodlice that are eaten .
The great majority of woodlice that fall victim to predators are immature ( Sunderland and Sutton , 1980 ) .
All woodlouse have six pairs of legs when released from the brood pouch of the female .
At this stage , they are called ‘ mancas ’ .
After the first moult , which occurs within 24 hours of release , the 7th leg bearing segment appears ; and after another moult , they gain their full complement of seven pairs of legs and are juveniles .
Juveniles moult at regular intervals until they reach sexual maturity , usually within a year , when they become adults .
The moulting process continues after maturity ( although with less frequency ) and involves shedding the exoskeleton in two parts .
The posterior part ( pleon and pereon segments 5,6 and 7 ) is shed a few days before the anterior part ( head and pereon segments 1,2,3 , and 4 ) .
Life Cycle
Few woodlice live for more than two or three years .
The life cycles of woodlice are quite variable between species , and different geographical areas .
The common pill woodlouse , Armadillidium vulgare , for example , lives for 4 years in California ( where it was introduced at the turn of the century ) and females have 3 or 4 broods in a lifetime .
At Spurn Head in Yorkshire , however , females of the same species have only 2 broods ; whilst at Lakenheath in Suffolk they have only one ( Sutton et al. , 1984 ) .
The common striped woodlouse , Philoscia muscorum , on dune grassland exhibits a clear example of ‘ year class splitting ’ .
Individuals born in one season differentiate into two forms ; one of which grows to maturity in one year , the other in two ( Grundy and Sutton , 1989 ) .
Such flexibility is one of the reasons why woodlice are so successful in colonising disturbed environments .
Only 37 species of wood lice are known to breed out of doors in the British Isles ( another ten or so have been recorded only in glasshouses ) .
They range from 2 mm to 30 mm in length .
Two species , Oniscus asellus and Porcellio scaber , are particularly common around buildings and are ideal animals with which to conduct simple laboratory experiments .
There is even one species , Platyarthrus hoffmannseggi , which is nearly always found associated with ants .
Recent discoveries on parasites ; the structure and function of the digestive system ; and the accumulation of metal pollutants by woodlice , have shown that there is much that remains to be discovered about the biology and distribution of these fascinating and ( dare I say it ) endearing creatures .
What Does A Woodlouse Eat ?
Philoscia muscorum lives almost entirely on rotting leaves and occupies a similar habitat in both summer and winter .
However , other species such as Trichoniscus pusillus ( Common Pygmy Woodlouse ) , which share the leaf litter with it during the winter , change their habitat during the summer and live almost entirely on and in rotting wood .
While Porcellio scaber , which lives at the bases of trees during the winter , moves higher up into the trees in summer .
Not all Wood lice live in woods or Grasslands ; Hemilepistus reaumuri lives in arid areas of North Africa and the Middle East , where it survives in small family groups in holes dug in the ground ( these are 5 - 6 cms wide and can be over 30 cms deep )
Digging is stimulated by high temperatures ( over 35 C ) so if the bottom of the hole gets too hot , they dig it a bit deeper .
Even stranger than this are Platyarthrus hoffmannseggi ( Ant Woodlouse ) a blind , eyeless , white woodlice found in Britain and Europe ; and Trichoniscus commensalis a pale coloured , but still eyed , species from New Zealand .
Both of these live primarily in ant nests , feeding on ant droppings and fungi .
Mating
Mating in Isopods occurs at night , and is therefore hard to see .
The male climbs onto a receptive female , licks her head and drums on her back with his legs for about five minutes .
He then shifts to a diagonal position on the female ’s back and passes sperm to her left side genital opening from his right hand stylets .
He then changes his position to the opposite diagonal – and deposits sperm in her right hand genital opening from his left hand stylet .
Sperm transfer takes about 5 minutes for each side .
In some species , such as Philoscia muscorum and Armadillidium vulgare , breeding is synchronised within a colony – so that all breed at the same time .
Most Isopod species have one brood per year in Britain , though some such as P. muscorum have two in the South .
The exception to this is the small triploid ( having three sets of chromosomes ) Trichoniscus pusillus , which has two broods all over Britain .
The number of eggs produced by a female of any given species increases with an increase in the size of the female ; one female Armadillidium vulgare is recorded as having had a brood of 267 young .
The eggs take from 3 to 9 weeks to hatch and spend from 3 to 9 nine days in the brood pouch .
Predators and Parasites
Though many spiders find
Wood lice distasteful , a few species will eat them , i.e. Tegenaria gigantea and T. domestica .
While some species , like Dysdera crocata and D. erythrina have jaws specially developed to deal with Woodlice and live almost entirely on them .
Armadillidium klugii from Dalmatia is a spider mimic and looks like the poisonous Laterodectes mactans , especially when young .
The only parasites of Woodlice in Britain are 7 flies of the family Rhinophorinae .
Porcellio scaber is the most heavily parasitised , with 14 % of those checked by Dr S.L.Sutton being attacked by 6 of the 7 species ; 68 % of these were attacked by Parafeburia maculata , 17 % by Styloneuria discrepans , 9 % by Melanophora roralis , 3.7 % by Rhinophora lepida , 1.6 % of Frauenfeldia rubricosa and 0.08 % by Phyto melanocephala .
Oniscus asellus is attacked by Parafeburia maculata and Styloneuria discrepans though not as heavily as P. scaber ; less than 1 % of those checked were parasitised .
Armadillidium vulgare is also attacked by Phyto melanocephala while Trachelipus rathkei is attacked by Stevenia atramentaria .
None of the other 7 species of Woodlice he checked had any parasitised individuals at all .
Woodlice are also consumed readily by many small mammals such as shrews , which may easily consume over 100 per day if they can find them , as well as by many small birds .
Final Thoughts
Well , I hope this has been an interesting glimpse into the wonderful world of Order Isopoda !

Though woodlice are some of my favourite creatures , I have not written this page .
Instead I am grateful ( and you are fortunate ) that Stephen Hopkin , who knows far more about Isopods than ever I will , has allowed me to use his introduction to “ A Key to the Woodlice of Britain and Ireland ” ( Aidgap Key No 204 ) .
White House : Undoubtedly Worst Oil Spill in U.S. History Day 36 of the Gulf Coast oil spill with no end in sight .
May 25 , 2010  --
The oil leak that has spewed millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico will undoubtedly become the worst in U.S. history , the White House said today .
" I do n't think there is any doubt , unfortunately , " Carol Browner , assistant to the president for energy and climate change , told George Stephanopoulos on " Good Morning America " this morning .
BP is expected to try another solution Wednesday , called the " top kill , " to stop the leaking well head .
BP said there is a 60 to 70 percent chance of success , but Browner declined to put " odds " on the planned attempt .
" We are doing everything in our power to try and make it work , " Browner said .
" GMA's " Sam Champion went diving with oceanographer Philippe Cousteau Jr. in the Gulf of Mexico and got a firsthand look at the toxic soup of oil and chemical dispersant that formed large underwater plumes as deep as 25 feet .
Champion reported that the mixture appeared to be breaking into small droplets that are capable of passing through the flesh of fish and birds and being picked up ocean currents .
" [ It is ] just this cloud of granular oil , " Cousteau said .
" And you can see it dispersing deeper and deeper into the water column .
And , you know , what we 're hearing is that there are plumes of oil like this beneath this surface like this at various different depths than can go for 10 or more miles . "
Cousteau called it a " nightmare . "
CLICK HERE to see Sam Champion 's underwater dive in the Gulf of Mexico .
The Environmental Protection Agency last week ordered BP to use a less toxic chemical dispersant but the company failed to comply .
There are fewer dispersants being manufactured in the quantities needed , Browner said , and scientists are continuing to examine how the particular dispersant interacts with the environment .
In response to questions being raised about whether BP will follow orders given by the administration , Browner said that BP will " absolutely comply " and is already complying with Monday 's order .
" We have the mechanisms to ensure they comply and we will use those mechanisms , " Browner said .
Gov. Bobby Jindal : Stop Spill or Get Out of the Way
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told the White House and BP Monday to either stop the oil spill or get out of his way .
Jindal has publicly expressed his frustration and wants the federal government to provide millions of feet of boom , in addition to approving an emergency permit for a state plan to dredge and build new barrier islands to keep the oil from reaching the marshes and wetlands .
Today Browner said officials are examining that proposal " very carefully . "
" But I think it is important for people to note even by the governor 's own estimation some of those things would not be in place for six to nine months , " Browner said .
" We need to make sure that what we are doing is going to work today .
That is what we are committed to for those communities and we will continue to work with the governors to ensure that will happen . "
The Republican governor is so desperate for the islands that he has said he 'll build them even if it lands him in jail .
" We 've been frustrated with the disjointed effort to date that has too often meant too little , too late for the oil hitting our coast , " Jindal said Monday .
Oil Along Shoreline
The oil has already hit more than 65 miles of shoreline , and the slick is now as big as Maryland and Delaware combined .
In Port Fourchon , people are already knee - deep in oil .
Teams of cleanup crews have descended on the beach , sopping up and bagging countless gallons of crude .
There is so much oil in the water that layers of boom designed to soak it up have to be replaced continuously .
" It 's absorbed a good amount of oil , " said Lt. Michelle Curry , who oversees the beach battle for the U.S. Coast Guard .
It 's easy to see what 's at stake .
While beaches can be cleaned up , the marshes cannot , and marshes make up the majority of Louisiana 's coastline .
BP Spill : Oil Reaches Deep into Marshes
Many marshes have already been lost .
Jindal said that oil has seeped as far as 10 miles into some of the state 's fragile marshlands , areas teeming with wildlife .
In Port Fourchon , crews will try to keep up with what can seem to be a futile fight .
They 're fighting an enemy that grows every day , gushing far more oil than anyone can mop up .
" It is heartbreaking , " said Curry , who lives in the same region that she 's now trying to save .
" I do hear [ the community 's ] stories and I feel for them .
And I 'm just as frustrated as they are , and we 're all doing our best to try to get this thing manageable and cleaned up . "

Kirill Kabanov ’s free fall ( Photo © cyberpresse.ca )
Many pages have been inked about the once thought to be one of the prime candidates for the 2010 Entry Draft # 1 overall pick , Russian , as he has experienced a serious downhill fall after his departure to Canada this fall .
During the 2008 - 09 season the talented winger got the first taste of pro hockey experience skating in a bunch of regular season and playoff games ( and getting knocked out by a hit from former NHL defenseman Vitaly Vishnevsky ) with Spartak Moscow , then scored eleven points in the 2009 U18 WJC , being thus outscored by and Evgeny Kuznetsov .
Getting to America
He was then picked up in the 2009 CHL Import Draft by the Moncton Wildcats , and the first controversy arose .
As Salavat Yulaev bought his KHL rights from Spartak Moscow for a sum reported to be around a million dollars , Kabanov simply refused reporting to the team coached by Vyacheslav Bykov , as he did n’t want to sign a contract without an NHL out clause .
“ In principle , I would already play there because I want to play in the QMJHL , and I ’m ready for that ” , Kabanov declared to allhockey .ru in August 2009 .
Once he was cleared to play in Canada by the IIHF , Kirill Kabanov did n’t start tearing the QMJHL up , but he had to miss three months of play as he had to undergo a wrist injury , thus missing the WJC .
He then returned to ice and scored 23 points in 22 regular season games in the QMJHL regular season with the Wildcats .
Good numbers , but probably not what people were expecting from a guy thought to be a top ten pick candidate .
Most importantly , if we exclude some reported late buses , some missed practices and some interviews in which Kabanov did n’t talk well of WJC Team Russia coach Vladimir Plyuschev , he was n’t at the center of any major scandal .
Not yet , at least …
Playoff scandal
As soon as the playoffs started , Kabanov had a very bad game .
It can happen , but he went well beyond that .
He was benched midway in the second period and did n’t come back on the ice in the third one .
He was yelled at by two teammates on two different occasions .
He took a bad penalty in the first while Moncton was on the PP .
He jumped on the ice when he was n’t supposed to be playing .
In the second period , another bad penalty when his team had just made it an even game and it cost a goal .
He left the penalty box and one of his teammates gave him an earful .
Kabanov was n’t back with the team in the final stanza , they were losing 3 - 2 .
They scored 4 goals in the third period and won 6 - 3 , as reported by C. Fortier .
After the first playoff game , Moncton ’s head coach Danny Flynn announced that the talented winger would n’t play in game two .
He was then released “ so to be able to prepare to skate in the U18 WJC with Team Russia ” .
“ I have the feeling that we are better without him , than with him ” , Flynn declared later .
Wildcats ’ head coach also admitted that Kabanov “ is 17 , he ’s coming from a different culture and a different background .
He has some things that he has to learn about how we want to play here in Moncton . ”
But after this , both the Cats and Kabanov tried to make things better .
“ The Wildcats believe that Kirill could benefit from this experience for his long - term hockey development , ” said Flynn .
“ Unfortunately , as result of his lengthy injury , he ’s only been able to play one third of our games this season .
I ’m confident this world hockey experience will help his continued development . ”
Back in Russia
And after being kicked by the Wildcats , Kabanov had to face another kick not later than in two weeks , when U18 WJC Team Russia coach Mikhail Vasiliev decided to exclude Kabanov and Ivan Telegin from the team .
“ I removed him from the team because we thought Kabanov would help us , but he brought only confusion to the team , ” Vasiliev told Sovietsky Sport .
“ Kabanov came and thought ‘ Here I am , a star from Canada , who will save all . ’
But it ’s the team that wins rather than an individual player . ”
He also added that “ Kabanov does n’t know how to behave ” , and that “ Kavanov ’s main problem is discipline .
He does whatever he wants and not what coaches ask him ” .
Draft talks
The once highly touted Russian is now slipping in the pre-draft rankings .
He was ranked as # 4 by the ISS not later than November , but in the final rankings he was out of the top 30 .
After the U18 WJC cut Kabanov tried to get back to Moncton , but he did n’t manage to make the team .
He was then working out in Calgary as preparation for the Draft .
In Calgary he tried to get back some consideration through an interview , trying once again to get some leverage through PR .
“ I made a mistake .
I recognize that now .
I ’m learning from it ” – Kabanov told Globe and Mail .
At the draft combine Kabanov had good tests , with many teams looking impressed by him , especially the Boston Bruins .
Kabanov sometimes has also made bold statements just to tell the opposite later .
“ I ’m a patriot .
I ’m always ready to play for my country ” , stated through allhockey .ru in August 2009 .
But recently he decided to make a U - turn : “ I can you tell one thing : I will stay in North America forever , ” Kabanov told NHL.com .
“ CHL , AHL , NHL , I do n’t want to go back to Russia . ”
He even went as far as saying that he ’s considering giving up his Russian citizenship , as reported by NHL.com draft and prospect insider Adam Kimelman .
He went even beyond , maybe hurting a bit his stock ( again ) declaring through the Russian press that he wants to play “ somewhere warm .
Los Angeles and Florida would be a good fit . ”
The Panthers hold the third overall pick , and it ’s extremely unlikely that they are going to use such a high pick on Kabanov .
The Kings will pick 19th , but once again , it should be a bit high , considering his current position in the rankings .
Recently Kimelman confirmed both aspects of Kirill Kabanov ‘s season in a recent interview with NashvillePredators.com .
“ Something happened in Moncton in the playoffs – or late in the regular season – where he had an issue with the coach or something and he decided he ’d leave Moncton to go back to Russia to get ready for the World Under - 18 Tournament .
Then he got booted off the Russian team for disciplinary reasons .
So there are a lot of red flags with this kid off the ice , but on the ice he has Top - 10 talent .
It ’s a question of maturity and commitment with him . ”
When an agent leaves
If this was n’t enough , on June 6th agent JP Barry left Kabanov .
“ I wish Kirill all the best ” , Barry told The Hockey News .
“ It just was n’t a fit .
We advised him to seek other representation . ”
Before Barry there were three agents with whom Kabanov had parted ways , Don Meehan ( and his Russian representative Sergei Isakov ) , Jay Grossman and Scott Greenspun ( Alexei Kovalev ’s agent ) .
One of his former agents , Ilya Moliver , shared his thoughts in an interview that was published here at RussianHockey Fans , in which he pointed the finger at Kabanov ’s father for Kirill ’s insuccess .
“ Kirill is n’t to be blamed .
It ’s hard to find a common language with his father .
He does n’t understand the role of the agent . ”
He also added that “ Sergei Kabanov believes that an agent is a player ’s servant .
He does n’t know how to communicate with people .
In view of this , he incorrectly educates Kirill . “
It ’s hard to think that he wo n’t be picked at all , but the # 1 overall selection is just a blurred dream from two years ago .
Kabanov might well be one of the next big NHL stars , but first he has to get some discipline and avoid getting on the headers with such a frequency .
That being said , during the upcoming NHL Entry Draft , more than one team will be surely interested in gambling on him with a high pick , but there is a good question about where he ’ll spend the 2010 - 11 season .
He ’s not ready yet for the NHL , does n’t have a good reputation with Moncton or in the QMJHL in general and ruled out playing in Russia himself .

It ’s time everyone else does the same .
For the healthy , in all age groups , it seems almost everyone recovers .
Should people remain vigilant and be safe ?
Sure .
Wash your hands and the like , but this virus and the fear that comes with it is over . "

Amens A Failure to Interpose
Watch as police officers fail to do their duty before God to interpose on behalf of those having their God - given rights taken away by edict .
Bank of America and Citigroup incorrectly accounted for billions of dollars in debt over the past three years , according to a report from the Wall Street Journal .
The report highlights a form of corporate borrowing increasingly under scrutiny since the financial crisis began .
The loans , known as " repos , " or short - term repurchase agreements , allow banks to increase the amount of risk they can take in securities trading .
Both BofA and Citigroup disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they have over the last three years accidentally classified some repos as sales when they should have been classified as borrowings , the newspaper reported .
The amounts involved were small for the banks , though they totaled billions .
It is illegal under federal securities rules to intentionally conceal debt and mislead investors .
Bank of America and Citigroup claim the accounting flaws were purely accidental and represent minute portions of their overall operations .
Bank of America , in addressing errors that reached up to $ 10.7 billion per quarter , noted that the flaws ” represented substantially less than 1 percent of our total assets , " the Wall Street Journal reports .
One of the most important features of President Obama ’s health reform law is that it begins to make health care more affordable for retirees and seniors .
Several important reforms will undo some of the harm caused by Republican policies in the George W. Bush era .
In remarks during a nationwide town hall meeting with seniors via telephone , Internet , and television , President Obama described Medicare as more than simply an “ entitlement program . ”
He said , “ It ’s something that you ’ve worked a lifetime for , having the security of knowing that Medicare will be there when you need it .
It ’s a sacred and inviolable trust between you and your country . ”
In just a few days , millions of seniors will receive checks from the federal government to cover the additional insurance costs in the so - called donut - hole .
Those higher costs were created by Republicans and George w .
Bush when they changed the Medicare program to provide added benefits and profits for insurance companies .
New regulations will gradually close the donut hole each year until it is eliminated in 2020 .
In addition , Medicare beneficiaries will get free preventive services such as colorectal cancer screenings , mammograms and a free annual wellness visit .
New investments in community health centers will ensure seniors have better access to care in their local communities .
As these new investments are distributed and community centers built and improved , seniors , as well as the millions of other working families who use these facilities , will find high quality care close to home .
One of the most important changes the President ’s health reform law does is to end the Medicare Advantage scam .
In 2003 the Republicans essentially turned tens of billions in taxpayer dollars and premium payments over to private insurance companies through the Medicare Advantage program – without providing any additional benefit to beneficiaries of the program .
The Republican scam paid about $ 1,000 per person to private insurers over the cost of traditional Medicare .
In addition to taxpayer dollars , Medicare recipients paid higher premiums to cover this handout to the insurance companies .
The Obama reforms eliminate the Medicare Advantage program gradually , saving $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion each year and ensuring that each Medicare beneficiary has the same high quality coverage as before .
In fact , if private companies want to participate in Medicare they will be prohibited from charging higher out - of - pocket prices coverage .
In addition to these savings , new revenues will com from slightly higher premiums for the richest Medicare beneficiaries .
Retiree couples earning more than $ 170,000 annually will see a 2 percent rise in their premiums .
According to government data , this rise will impact about 2 percent of Medicare recipients .
The savings and new revenues , according to government analysis , should extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by nine years .
By 2018 , most seniors will save an estimated $ 200 per year in premiums and as much or more in insurance co-pays per year .
Launching a new campaign this week against fraud and waste , the White House warned seniors to be wary of scam artists trying to take advantage of the changes in the law .
President Obama said , “ I want to send a notice to all who would swindle and steal from seniors and the Medicare system :
We are going to find you , we will prosecute you , and we will ultimately prevent those crimes from happening ever again . ”
He directed the Department of Health and Human Services to warn insurance companies against raising their rates just to pad their profits .
He promised that his administration will work closely with state attorneys general to prosecute fraud and abuse .
The administration also launched a multi-faceted campaign to communicate with seniors and Medicare recipients about their new benefits and rights under the new law .
“ The more we can work together to educate the American people about ways to protect themselves and the health care system from fraud and scams , the better chance we have to protect taxpayer dollars and the Medicare Trust Funds , ” said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .
“ In addition to this outreach and education media campaign , we are working with organizations across the country to ensure seniors know where to turn to get information about the new law and their Medicare benefits . ”

Part of an ongoing series on the environmental impacts of the Gulf oil spill .
Oil seeps detected near the Deepwater Horizon wellhead , the source of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , are most likely related to another nearby well and are not an indication that BP 's newly installed containment cap is unstable , U.S. officials said yesterday .
The announcement comes after days of debate over whether the seep was a sign that the cap might be forcing oil to escape elsewhere on the seafloor — or if it was simply a natural leak .
Although the recently detected seeps apparently are n't natural , they highlight the difficulties in separating the effects of the spill from the background flow of oil that has existed in the Gulf since before the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank in April .
In the oil - rich Gulf ( map ) , there 's " nothing unusual " about natural seeps , said Tad Patzek , chair of the department of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas , Austin .
Natural seeps occur when oil — which is lighter than water — escapes into the water column from highly pressurized seafloor rock , Patzek said .
In fact , more than 1,300 barrels of oil a day seep naturally into the Gulf of Mexico , according to a 2002 report by the U.S. National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences .
What makes the BP spill exceptional is that it accounts for a volume of oil that 's unprecedented in the Gulf — even with natural seeps , noted Christopher Reddy , a marine chemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts .
Imagine " thousands of little leaky faucets compared to a fire hydrant that is flying out , " he said .
" You need to put that in context . "
3 - D Surveys Reveal Gulf Oil Leaks
On July 15 the joint industry - federal response team announced that a new cap had fully sealed the oil gushing from the mile - deep ( 1.6 kilometer - deep ) wellhead , the first time the flow had stopped since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sank in late April .
( See pictures : " New Cap Stops Gulf Oil Spill , BP Says . " )
But a few days later the response - team leader , U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , reported the discovery of a seep " a distance from the well . "
At a Wednesday press briefing Allen added that bubbles had been discovered near the damaged Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer .
The blowout preventer has " been down there a long time under a lot of stress .
And just like any other piece of equipment , we 're starting to see some small leaks around it , " Allen said of the bubbles .
Figuring out the nature of the roughly mile - deep ( 1.6 - kilometer - deep ) seep , meanwhile , presented a unique set of challenges .
For one , UT Austin 's Patzek noted , there 's a " somewhat confusing " phenomenon in the Gulf that occurs when warm water underneath the surface rises up and decomposes methane hydrates , gases usually trapped in ice in the seafloor .
This creates gas bubbles that look just like oil seeps .
Gulf seeps are also difficult to monitor , due to their remote and deep locations .
" The only way to tell whether the seeps are natural or not is to run a 3 - D seismic survey over an area surrounding the failed well , " Patzek said .
The survey involves laying out an imaginary grid on the water 's surface and towing a series of air guns and microphones to collect seismic data , which can reveal changes in acoustic signals caused by oil seepages , he said .
" In our science , nothing is clear - cut and on the table , " Patzek added .
" You ca n't go to something that is ... miles deep , take it in your hands , and disassemble it . "
After the cap had been put in place , Allen 's team sent a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel to the site to do such surveys — revealing that the seep was occurring near another well .
Though the team 's attention is focused on the Deepwater Horizon wellhead , that seep could also spell problems for the separate well , which is still unidentified .
" We do not like to have any seeps from a properly completed well , just like you do not want to have oil dripping from your engine and oil pan , " Patzek said .
" Any seep is bad and may be a harbinger of more serious problems to come . "
Gulf Wellhead Oil Leaks Not Yet Cause for Concern
Based on the most recent review , officials do n't think the leaks around the capped BP wellhead are cause for concern — yet .
The pressure at the wellhead as of Tuesday was a relatively stable 6,834 pounds per square inch ( psi ) ( 47 million pascals ) , but it continues to slide very slowly by about one to two pounds ( 6,900 to 13,800 pascals ) an hour , according to the Coast Guard 's Allen .
If the pressure drops to around 6,000 psi ( 41 million pascals ) , that may mean too much pressure has built up inside the well , forcing oil to leak through the surrounding sea floor , where the rock is very loose and unconsolidated .
" I would say the biggest indicator is the pressure , " said David Rensink , incoming president of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists .
" If the well is maintaining pressure and stable , whatever leaks [ there are ] appear to be small . "
The Coast Guard 's Allen said Wednesday that the wellhead is currently " following a chart or a pattern that would indicate that the well has integrity .
But the low - pressure readings have created the dilemma whether or not we have a well - depletion issue or there is a leak down there . "
The NOAA vessel will continue to send back seismic data , Allen said Tuesday .
If the seismic data later reveal a big leak near the wellhead , " that is a serious concern , " UT Austin 's Patzek said .
Bigger leaks may impact the response team 's " static kill " plan to flood the well with mud and cap it with cement — a temporary plug until a relief well stanches the oil flow , hopefully for good .

HealthDay Reporter
MONDAY , June 7 ( HealthDay News ) --
When compared to teens of the same age , adolescents raised by lesbian parents are doing just fine socially , psychologically and academically , new research finds .
Not only that , they have fewer social problems , and less aggressive and rule - breaking behaviors than other teens .
The nearly 20 - year study has followed 78 teens since their lesbian mothers were planning their pregnancies , and concluded that these children " demonstrate healthy psychological adjustment . "
These findings stand in contrast to what some vocal opponents of gay or lesbian parents might have expected .
" One of the things that opponents of the equalities of gays and lesbians -- in marriage , parenting , adoption and foster care -- often bring up is the so - called gold standard of parenting , which defined by them is the traditional family where children are conceived in traditional ways and not through insemination or surrogates .
But , when we compared the adolescents in our study to the so - called gold standard , we found the teens with lesbian mothers were actually doing better , " said study author Dr. Nanette Gartrell , the Williams Distinguished Scholar at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law .
As to why these teens are doing better , Gartrell said , " Moms in the lesbian family are very committed , very involved parents . "
Gartrell said she expects that these findings would also translate to the children of gay male parents as well .
" Gay male parents are another group of very committed parents , and really , [ among gay male couples ] only economically privileged gay men have access to the opportunity to become parents right now , " she said .
Family therapist Andrew Roffman , at the New York University Langone Medical Center , was n't surprised by the findings and agreed that such results would likely be similar for gay male parents .
" Good parenting makes for healthier children , regardless of your sexual orientation .
Whether you 're gay , straight or lesbian , good parenting is good parenting , " said Roffman .
Results of Gartrell 's study will be published in the July issue of Pediatrics .
Between 1986 and 1992 , Gartrell and her colleague , Henry Bos , recruited 154 prospective lesbian mothers as they were considering artificial insemination , or once they were already pregnant .
As the children have grown , the researchers have been periodically checking in on them , and the latest follow - up included questionnaires completed by 78 children when they were 10 and again when they were 17 .
The study also included an interview with one of each child 's mothers to assess the child 's psychological well - being .
The results were then compared to a group of age - matched children from traditional families .
Compared to the traditionally reared teens , adolescents with lesbian parents rated significantly higher in social , academic and total competence , according to the study .
The teens with lesbian parents also rated significantly lower when it came to social problems , rule - breaking and aggressive behavior than teens raised in more traditional families .
Even in homes where the lesbian parents had split up , the researchers found that those teens still fared better than teens from more traditional families .
Just over four in 10 of the teens raised by lesbian parents reported that they had been stigmatized at some point because of their parents ' sexual orientation , said Gartrell .
But , when the researchers compared those who had been stigmatized to those who had n't , they found no significant psychological differences .
" These young people seem to have done well ; they have some resilience , " she said .
Roffman said there 's likely a resilience factor at play .
And , he said , it may come from the lesbian parents thinking ahead of time about what the child 's experiences might be and talking with the children before anything happens .
" Probably the most effective thing to do is to prepare kids ahead of time .
Let them know that there is still a cultural stigma and that they may encounter children and adults who are insensitive .
Having these kinds of talks is relationship - building for both parents and children , " said Roffman
" The outcomes here were very clear .
These are families in which the mothers were very committed , involved and loving .
The 17 - year - old adolescents are healthy , happy and high - functioning , " said Gartrell .

“ The current European debt crisis likely will not end until the euro collapses as a currency and takes the entire European Union with it . ”
~ Dennis Gartman , hedge fund manager and writer of The Gartman Letter
I was just in Greece , where the stupidity and venality of the political class are in full view .
The coming repudiation of Greek debt and the credit contagion that will spread among the weaker members of the European Union , including the UK , will ultimately slop over onto the U.S.
But while we wait , the process will bring us the answer to a long - simmering question .
Will the European Union be a supra-state ruling the formerly independent nations of Europe or will it be a confederation of quasi- independent sovereign nations ?
The Eurocrat elites want a union of European nations with one central bank , one currency and just one flag that really matters , all molded to fit the American model .
I believe Europe would be far better off as a confederation of sovereign states that allows competition among individual national currencies .
Some countries might even revert to backing their national currency with gold .
It ’s amazing how responsible institutions become when they ’re forced to compete .
Even with national currencies , there still would be room for the euro , which the European Central Bank might make convertible into gold .
Remember , Germany knows more about the catastrophe of runaway sovereign debt and currency collapse than any other nation in the West , and today they lead Europe and the European Union .
Although the euro has lost 16 % of its value in the last 120 days , I expect it to survive the sovereign debt crisis .
But the euro zone may shrink as Greece and the other fiscally weak governments replace the euro with national currencies that they can inflate whenever convenient .
That would leave the euro as the currency of choice for a few strong , wealthy and fiscally conservative nations like Germany — the countries most likely to welcome a gold - backed currency .
We are now living through the violent end of the age of fiat paper money and thoughtless government debt .
In the future , the desire for a secure store of value and medium of exchange is going to force currency competition .
Even the U.S. dollar , following hyperinflation and a run on our American national debt , could be reborn as a gold - backed currency .
But the transition will be full of hazards that could touch you in a very painful way .
Where will bankrupt Washington get the gold to provide a credible cushion for a new currency following a hyperinflationary collapse ?
The special hazard for American citizens is that the government will get the gold it needs by taking it from them .
But between now and then , prepare for some tough times , and expect periods of dollar strength vs. the euro and even the Swiss franc .
There is no official link between the franc and the euro , but the euro tugs on the decisions of the Swiss National Bank , since Switzerland trades predominately with the EU countries .
The Swiss franc wo n’t move as violently down and up as the euro ’s big swings , but it will track the general direction .
Americans should use their recently stronger dollars to add to holdings of Swiss francs , of securely stored offshore gold and of mining shares , along with some Asian investments .
With trillions in unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare , Washington ’s debt load is far greater than the burden that is now crushing the governments of Greece and the other PIIGS countries .
The dollar ’s current strength will prove transient .
Eventually the sovereign debt crisis will also come to the U.K. and then to the U.S. , with disastrous results .
The tragedy in Greece today is just a glimpse of what will happen to the sovereign debt of the United States .
It will come to America , and it will come on its own schedule , so be prepared .

What do spore - launching mushrooms have in common with highly water - repellent surfaces ?
According to Duke University engineers , the answer is " jumping " water droplets .
As it turns out , the same phenomenon that occurs when it 's time for certain mushrooms to eject spores also occurs when dew droplets skitter across a surface that is highly water repellent , or superhydrophobic .
Using a specially designed high - speed camera and microscope set - up , the engineers for the first time captured the actions of tiny water droplets on a man-made superhydrophobic surface , and to their surprise found that the droplets literally jumped straight up and off the surface .
Simply put , when two tiny water droplets -- whether on a mushroom 's spore or on a water - repellent surface -- meet to form a larger drop , enough energy is released in the formation of the new droplet to cause it to " jump " off the surface .
" This spontaneous jumping is powered by the surface energy released when droplets coalesce , " said Jonathan Boreyko , a third - year graduate student at Duke 's Pratt School of Engineering , who works in the laboratory of Assistant Professor Chuan - Hua Chen .
" Because this process involves very tiny droplets at high speeds , no one had captured this phenomenon before . "
The results of the team 's experiments were published early online in the journal Physics Review Letters .

" A similar phenomenon occurs with the ejection of spores , known as ballistospores , from certain kinds of mushrooms , " Boreyko said .
" When a drop of water condensate at the base of the spore comes into contact with the wetted spore , it triggers the propulsion of the spore into the air . "
Chen and Boreyko's research is the first known engineering reproduction of the ballistospore ejection process .
The work also has immediate applications in energy harvesting and thermal management , Chen said .
For example , the spontaneous jumping motion offers an internal mechanism , independent of gravity , to remove condensate from the condensers in power plants .
The superhydrophobic surface used by the researchers is characterized by rows and rows of tiny bumps , covered with even tinier hairs projecting upward .
When a water droplet lands on this type of surface , it only touches the ends of the tiny hairs .
This creates pockets of air underneath the droplet that keeps it from touching the surface .
This cushion of air keeping the droplet aloft is much like a puck in an air - hockey game .
The same principle allows water striders to skim along the surface of ponds without falling into the water , Chen said .
" When two of these condensate drops coalesce into one , they jump at very high speeds , " Boreyko said .
" They move as fast as one meter per second .
By taking a side view of the phenomenon , we can plainly see the droplets jump .
You would n't see it looking down on the surface . "
Interestingly , the researchers found that the mechanism used to eject ballistospores is almost identical .
The critical size of the droplet on the spore for the jumping to occur is the same as that on the man -made superhydrophobic surface , and spores " jump " off the mushroom at about the same speed .

Chen said knowing how superhydrophobic surfaces are able to repel condensate drops could lead to improvements in many types of systems where heat needs to be removed through condensation .
" Smaller water droplets are much more efficient at transferring heat , " Chen explained .
" With the jumping mechanism , the average droplet size is about one hundred times smaller .
" In conventional cooling systems , as in big industrial plants , condensate must be removed using external forces for continuous operation , " Chen said .
" One of the main benefits of this superhydrophobic surface is that it needs no external energy -- the coalescing of the droplets provides all the energy needed to remove the condensate . "
Chen 's research is supported by the National Science Foundation .
Jonathan Boreyko is supported by the Pratt - Gardner Fellowship .

The Hipster Kitty artist Craig Wheat later expressed his approval and embraced the meme that was inspired out of his artwork in another Tumblr post in June 2010 :
Essentially the internet ate a piece of my art and turned it into a ever collaborating beast .
here is the piece entitled “ Allison ” collage , acrylic ink , spray paint .

Back in 2007 , the Christian apologetics organization Institute for Creation Research set up shop in Texas in order to teach a master ’s level science education course from “ a Biblical scientific creationist viewpoint . ”
To be recognized , it needed the state of Texas to grant it accreditation .
But the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board turned down the application for a “ certificate of authority ” to offer the degree .
As Raymund Paredes , the Texas commissioner of higher education , wrote , “ It seemed clear to me upon reading the various evaluation documents that the central issue of whether the proposed program met appropriate standards of science education had been insufficiently addressed . ”
In 2008 , ICR cried not fair and filed suit against the state , essentially saying on one hand it ’s not right for a bunch of science educators to tell them what ’s science .
And on the other hand , the denial amounts to religious discrimination and a violation of the First Amendment .
I love it how these folks are always trying to have it both ways .
By the way , to quote York Daily Record columnist Mike Argento , I intend to start a course that “ teaches that cows think in Spanish . ”
On Friday , the U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks agreed with Paredes and granted summary judgment to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and threw out ICR ’s case .
Sparks wrote , “ Essentially , the panel reasoned much of the course content was outside the realm of science and lacked potential to help students understand the nature of science and the history and nature of the natural world . ”

Bieber , 16 , will compete in the best new artist category and was nominated for the awards alongside such prominent black performers as rapper Jay - Z , who led the field with five nominations , and his wife Beyonce , who scored four .
The BET Awards typically honor black singers , actors , actresses and athletes , but officials described Bieber as a cross -over artist .
“ Bieber has crossed the color boundaries the same way that hip - hop has crossed the boundaries the other way for a number of years , ” said Stephen Hill , BET ’s President of Music Programing and Specials .
The awards will be held on Los Angeles on June 27 .
Jay - Z’s five nominations included nods for best male hip hop artist , best collaboration and viewers ’ choice as well as two nominations for video of the year .
Tied with Beyonce with four nominations were singers Alicia Keys , Trey Songz and Canadian Melanie Fiona , who will compete with Bieber and rapper Drake ’s group Young Money in the best new artist category .
Bieber was signed to a music label with the help of Usher , who drew a nomination for best male rhythm and blues artist .
“ He ’s had rhythm in his music , ” said Hill .
“ He makes the type of music our audience likes . ”
Bieber , who hails from a small Canadian town , has become a global sensation after his mother posted videos of him singing on YouTube .
His latest album , “ My World 2.0 , ” debuted at No.1 on the Billboard charts in March .
A division of Viacom , BET is the leading television network for African - American audiences .
Today , Judge
Martin Feldman , a U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern
District of Louisiana , sided with a drilling company which had argued
that the Obama administration ’s blanket ,
6 - month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was
illegal .
The drilling company , Hornbeck Offshore Services of Covington ,
LA , claimed financial distress from the imposition of the moratorium .
In the ruling handed down this afternoon , Judge Feldman agreed , writing
that the administration made an “ arbitrary
and capricious ” decision that would have an “ immeasurable effect on
the plaintiffs , the local economy , the Gulf region , and the critical
present - day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this
country . ”
Like many judges presiding in the Gulf region , Feldman owns
lots of energy stocks , including Transocean , Halliburton , and two of
BP ’s largest U.S. private shareholders — BlackRock ( 7.1 % ) and JP Morgan
Chase ( 28.3 % ) .
Here ’s a
list of Feldman ’s income in 2008 ( amounts listed unless under
$ 1,000 ) :
In his opinion today , Feldman wrote , “ Oil and gas production is quite
simply elemental to Gulf communities . ”
Indeed , it is so elemental
that the justice system is invested in the oil and gas industry .
As TP’s
Ian Millhiser has written , “ Industry ties among federal judges are so
widespread that they are beginning to endanger the courts ’ ability
to conduct routine business .
Last month , so many members of the
right - wing Fifth Circuit were forced to recuse themselves from an appeal
against various energy and chemical companies that there were n’t enough
untainted judges left to allow the court to hear the case . ”
2019 UPDATE :
Redfern - Waterloo
Tour of Beauty is part of the H ow t he City Cares exhibition , part of the Big Anxiety Festival , at Custom House , Sydney .
Redfern Waterloo
Tour of Beauty , 2005 -
This project consisted of a bus ( or bike ) tour of the inner Sydney suburbs of Redfern and Waterloo .
The tour highlighted particular sites which were threatened by the Redfern Waterloo Authority ’s plan to “ revitalise ” the area .
Each tour lasted 4 - 5 hours , and tourists were addressed by various representatives of the local community – for example , from the Aboriginal Housing Company , the local Indigenous Women ’s Centre , the Settlement Community Centre , the REDWatch activist group , architects , designers , and the Indigenous Social Justice Association .
Each speaker presented their perspective on the rapidly gentrifying suburb .
The tour asked : what was to be lost and what was to be gained by the process of urban transformation ?
How could it be done better ?
And how would it affect people on the ground ?
About 15 tours were run during the period 2005 - 2009 .
The Tour of Beauty operated as a piece of aesthetic activism , providing a complex but concrete experience of urban social and architectural dynamics .
The Tour was a plug - in for various conferences , exhibitions and visiting study groups .
It was the catalyst for meetings between Indigenous and non-indigenous activists in Sydney , and led to many spin off projects , the most visible being the large - scale exhibition event There Goes the Neighbourhood ( 2009 ) .
The tour was offered in conjunction with numerous exhibitions , festivals and conferences including :
Disobedience , Ivan Dougherty Gallery , curated by Zanny Begg and David McNeill , 2005 ;

New Hybrid Cars
Hybrid vehicles are the perfect answer to the problems that are being faced by the world in the present day when in comes to the environment .
Hybrid vehicles are perfectly environmentally safe and should be used preferentially over other vehicles to make the environment safe and in order to reduce carbon footprints .
Reduction of the global carbon footprint is a very important consequence of using hybrid vehicles .
Hybrid vehicles can guarantee a perfectly safe environment if the use of hybrid vehicles is combined with other practices that will result in the production of a cleaner and greener environment .
Hybrid vehicles are the perfect answer to noxious fume emitting petrol guzzling steel machines that we call cars in the present day .
Air pollution has become a menace in the present day .
Pollution is basically defined as “ the deposition of substances in excess amount causing various harmful effects and this primarily occurs due to anthropogenic ( that is , induced by man ) activities ” .
So what exactly are pollutants that cause pollution ?
Pollutants are basically defined as “ substances which adversely alter the environment by changing the growth rate of a species , by interfering with the food chain , health , and in the process prove toxic to mankind . ”
There are five primary air pollutants namely carbon dioxide , oxides of nitrogen , sleuthed dioxide , suspended particulate matter , and proxy acetyl nitrate ( PAN ) .
Carbon dioxide causes global warming and is a green house gas .
Carbon dioxide emission can be controlled by the reduction in the levels of industrial and automobile emission and also by increase of forest cover .
Air quality and standards have to be maintained when it comes to ambient air quality standard maintenance .
Air quality and standards have to be maintained to control the levels of air pollution , and to do this a strict check has to be kept on automobile emission in the form of pollution control of automobiles as well as legal implications in case of violation of the pollution control norms as and when applicable .
Pollution prevention can be brought about by less generation of effluents in the air .
Air pollution prevention is brought about by bacilli three methods .
The first method is to use raw material that is less polluting .
Low suppurated fuel , better quality petroleum mixture like power fuel , bio diesel and etcetera are examples of this method .
The second method is to use better processes and equipments so that pollution generation is less .
Better quality boiler , multi point fuel injection system , and catalytic converter in automobiles reduce harmful emission .
The second method is to treat the pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere .
Volatilization of acid vapors , use of scrubbers , electrostatic precipitators and clone separators are some such methods .
So now we come to the harmful effect of emission of noxious fumes from car exhaust .
A number of physiological ailments might arise as a result of this .
Human health might be adversely affected as a result of inhalation of poisonous fumes that arise as a result of complete or incomplete combustion of petroleum or gasoline that might result in the production of carbon monoxide as well as carbon dioxide gas which can be detrimental to human health .
Hybrid vehicles can cause efficient reduction in the emission of exhaust fumes or can completely eliminate it .
They are a perfectly safe alternative to other non hybrid vehicles .
As of 2010 a number of hybrid vehicles have been produced in the world by routed motor car companies .
These new hybrid cars are better and much more fuel efficient than their predecessors of yesteryears .
The new hybrid vehicles have been made with much beater technology and are undoubtedly better than the other existing hybrid cars of the present day that they will definitely phase out .
A list of the new hybrid cars of 2010 as produced by the main motor car companies have been provided below :
2010 Dodge Durango Hybrid
2010 Mercedes Benz S Class Hybrid
Although other hybrid cars have made their appearance in 2010 these are the most predominant as they have been produced by the leading automobile makers in the world today and boast of cutting edge design and technology in car design .
In terms of emery efficiency these cars are the bet in hybrid cars .
Apart from fuel efficiency and reducing c argon footprints and automobile exhaust emissions , these cars have been graded on the following parameters , namely - key dimensions , engine parameters like engine displacement , valves or OHC , max power , max torque , transmission , and other parameters like wheel size , wheel type ( radial or tubeless ) , suspension ( both front and rear ) , brakes ( both front and rear ) , steering and other fuel utilization parameters .
The 2010 BMW ACTIVE HYBRID X6 has a turbo compressor , and its body style is a classic sports utility vehicle ( SUV ) and it also has a powerful 4.4 liter engine .
The 2010 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER HYBRID has a hybrid synergy drive system and like the BMW ACTIVE HYBRID it is also an SUV .
The LEXUS GS450H is basically a sedan which boasts of a redefined look and appearance that is spanking new and it also has a great deal of luxury features in it .
The new Mercedes Benz S class hybrid version is extremely ecologically friendly as it is made from carbon neutral plastic which is biodegradable and is helpful to reduce the carbon footprint .
The passenger compartment is made from this particular plastic and thus is extremely energy efficient .
Hybrid engines can go a long way to reduce emissions and is thus a great way to save the environment from the menace of gasoline guzzling machines which would emit noxious fumes .

ASTRONOMERS and police say a full - scale alien invasion of the Northern Territory has begun .
They say the flares seen across a 360 km - long stretch of the Top End coast were probably caused by a meteor shower .
But highly - qualified UFO - ologists said they believed the bright lights were space ships on a pre-attack scouting mission .
Darwin - based UFO expert Alan Ferguson said the flares were obviously aliens .
" This all sounds like UFO activity , " he said .
Have aliens hijacked Voyager 2
" Meteors usually just flash across the sky and leave a tail .
" But UFOs will stay in the same spot and wobble up and down and side to side .
Fast movements .
" That 's how they work . "
Do you believe in UFOs ?
- leave your comment below
Mr Ferguson said UFOs , like Swedish backpackers and Canberra politicians , nearly always came to the Top End during the dry season .
" It may be just that there are less clouds and we can see better , " he said .
" Or it maybe that we 're outside more during the Dry .
" Or maybe the UFOs are interested in our military activity .
There are always more of them about during ( Operation ) Pitch Black . "
Superintendent Bruce Porter said police received many calls about the flares at about 9 pm on Tuesday .
Police feared a boat was in distress and launched a search .
" We took this seriously , but the indications are that nobody is missing , " they said .
Just last month the NT News reported on how one Territory town 's invasion by UFOs had been recorded in the world 's most famous museum for extraterrestrial life .
The tiny community of Marlinja came to a standstill in June 2008 when UFOs reportedly descended on the town .
Now the event has been recorded at the International UFO Museum in Roswell .
Roswell in New Mexico is home to arguably the most famous UFO incident of all time .
On July 8 , 1947 , it was reported that US Army personnel had recovered a crashed flying disc from a ranch near Roswell .
Supt Porter believes the flares were probably a meteor shower .
For those who do n't believe the NT is being invaded by Martians , meteors are pieces of debris that burn up when entering the earth 's atmosphere .
If they hit the ground , they become meteorites .
A friend of mine who works in the intelligence community brought this jewel to my attention .
In January 1944 , the Office of Strategic Services created a secret document entitled “ Simple Sabotage Field Manual ” ( available here as a free audio book ) to assist operatives in disrupting the Axis war effort .
It contains the expected stuff about starting fires and shorting electrical systems .
But the most enlightening stuff comes at pages 28 - 31 , in a section entitled “ General Interference with Organizations and Production . ”
There , we learn that our secret weapon against the Nazi war machine was . . . bureaucracy .
Note these ingenious plots :
( a) Organizations and Conferences
(1) Insist on doing everything through “ channels . ”
Never permit short - cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions .
* * *
(3) When possible , refer all matters to committees , for “ further study and consideration . ”
Attempt to make the committees as large as possible –never less than five .
(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible .
(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications , minutes , resolutions .
(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision .
(7) Advocate “ caution . ”
Be “ reasonable ” and urge your fellow - conferees to be “ reasonable ” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on .
(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision–raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon .
More nuggets after the jump .
In other words , the war would have ended a year earlier if we could have just parachuted the Executive Secretariat of some executive agencies behind enemy lines in 1942 .
But probably the paperwork was n’t in order .
I do n’t want to oversell the point that the Manual basically recommended being bureaucratic ; there are parts of the Manual that advocate conduct that bureaucracies do not actually encourage , such as “ Work slowly , ” “ Act stupid , ” “ Cry and sob hysterically at every occasion , ” and my personal favorite , “ Be as irritable and quarrelsome as possible without getting yourself into trouble . ”
But it is at least mildly amusing that such readily identifiable bureaucratic behavior as “ insist[ing ] on doing everything through ‘ channels ’ ” used to be regarded as destructive behavior .
This apparently has been the source of mirth among CIA types for two years .
Now you can share the comedy secrets of our intelligence services .
Some other good tidbits :
The Spanish defender Carles Puyol should have been the first player to be sent off by the referee Howard Webb , according to Arjen Robben after his Holland side lost the World Cup final 1 - 0 against Spain .
Puyol , already booked in the first half , committed a foul on the Dutch winger with 10 minutes remaining when he sped past him but Robben stayed on his feet and was denied by goalkeeper Iker Casillas .
" When I got my second chance the referee should have given us a free kick and Puyol a second yellow card , " Robben said .
" He gave the advantage but there was none as I could hardly move and the goalkeeper was too close already . "
After beating Brazil in the quarter - final , Robben was widely criticised for diving but in the final he stood firm instead of making clear to the referee that he had been fouled .
" As a player you always want to go on and especially 10 minutes before time in a World Cup final when you are heading towards the goal , " he added .
The Dutch said they were less than impressed with the referee 's performance during the final .
Webb showed eight Holland players yellow cards and sent off their defender John Heitinga in the first half of extra time .
" When you play a World Cup final you need also a world class referee and – I have to be careful what I say – this was not the case for this match , " Robben said .
However , the winger was lucky himself not to be dismissed after deliberately playing on after the whistle had blown for an infringement .
It would have been his second yellow card but Webb simply admonished him .
Webb , however , was today hailed for his performance by his wife , Kay .
She said she thought the 38 - year - old Yorkshireman was " brilliant " and added : " I have every confidence in him . "
The Holland captain , Giovanni van Bronckhorst , chose not to criticise Webb and said that his players should be proud of what they achieved at the World Cup .
Van Bronckhorst , the former Arsenal , Rangers and Barcelona defender , was playing his final game for his country before joining the coaching staff at Feyenoord .
" To give up a goal four minutes from the end means we were so close but still so far away , " said the 35 - year - old .
" But I 'm glad that I achieved this [ playing in a World Cup final ] but the disappointment at the way the tournament ended makes it difficult right now .
But we can be proud of what we have done .
" If we had scored first it could have been a different ending .
You do n't get many chances against Spain and it was disappointing not to have scored from at least one of the two chances we had . "

" WE HOPE YOU ARE NOT USING THIS HOTEL BED FOR FORNICATION OR WITCHCRAFT "
If Rocky Raccoon had found a copy of " Blood Meridian " instead of only finding Gideon 's Bible in that hotel room , he might not have collapsed in that corner , shot by Dan .
I found myself in a hotel room this weekend , kicking back and drinking complimentary hotel coffee with my mates after we played a pretty good show in Boston .
I love hotel rooms .
I love how they provide luxury by attempting to ascertain a traveler 's needs and then providing for them in advance , packing every square inch of a small room with intuitive frills .
I like how they seem to say that human emotional problems can all be solved by creatively - folded towels and ample air conditioning .
Maybe they can !

Shall I put a gun in my mouth ?
" ANSWER : ( rummage rummage rummage ) ... the Bible ?
This Bible placed here by The Gideons ?
Oh shit !
KABLAM !*** As much as I love hotel rooms , I feel that this specific problem -- the problem of depression , alienation , and destablization that hotels create -- is not being sufficiently addressed by the hotel industry itself .
The only book available to read inside hotel rooms should not be the Holy Bible .
The Holy Bible is a depressing book that makes people insane .
It promises hope , but instead provides gruesome stories of death , sacrifice , malice , and insanity .
There may be a little bit of hope toward the end , but who reads the end of a book first ?
I 'm not AGAINST the Bible per se , but letting a group of crazed evangelical Christians leave their scat behind in your hotels says that you tacitly agree with their beliefs , giving people perhaps the wrong idea about your hotel chain organization .
Additionally , you are crushing desperate people with one last hellish glacier by only providing them with a Bible when they are frantically opening your drawers looking for peace and distraction .
So many evangelical conversion narratives begin with people who have worked themselves into psychotic frenzy looking for answers somewhere , anywhere , and only finding the Bible in the last desperate throes of their existential panic .
They , of course , then decide to base their whole life on its simple wisdom .
But what if they had stumbled upon a copy of " American Gods , " " The Shining , " or " All Creatures Great and Small " instead ?
I do n't think the solution is to remove these Bibles or ban them .
I think the solution is to add more voices to America 's temporary nighttables .
If hotels want to cut back on the amount of suicide and suffering that occurs within their gleaming white walls , they ought to let another concerned group of citizens -- citizens who are as directly engaged with ministering to the human condition as last century 's angry evangelicals -- have access to Ideal Bedrooms .
I think there ought to be novels in every hotel room .
Any novel .
Stacked on top of every Gideon Bible across America , there also ought to be some cheap , frivolous used paperback .
People need options .*** From wikipedia : " Gideons International ( also known as Gideon 's Bible ) is an evangelical Christian organization dedicated to distributing copies of the Bible in over 80 languages and 190 countries of the world to those who might not otherwise encounter it , most famously in hotel and motel rooms .
The organization was founded in 1899 in Boscobel , Wisconsin , as an early American parachurch organization dedicated to Christian evangelism .
It began distributing free Bibles , the work it is chiefly known for , in 1908 , when the first Bibles were placed in the rooms of the Superior Hotel in Superior , Montana . "
" The Gideons draw their volunteer members from many ( although not all ) Christian denominations , as described in Article 3 of the Gideon Constitution : " Article 3 . - Membership .
"
The membership shall consist of business and professional men , except clerÃ Â­gymen , who believe in the Bible as the inspired Word of God , believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God , have received Him as their perÃ Â­sonal Saviour , endeavor to follow Him in their daily life , and who are members in good standing of an evangelical or Protestant church , congregation or assembly .
"
*** DEAR HOTEL MANAGERS OF THE WORLD , If you run a hotel , and you are interested in doing things a little differently here in the early 21st century , the Fiction Circus is making you an offer .
Tell us how many rooms you have , and we will dig up that number of books for you and send them to you .
We will stamp them with a " This Novel Placed Here by the Fiction Circus , " and maybe our website URL .
If you think theft will be a problem , we will also draft a little note for the inside cover of the book encouraging people not to steal the book , but to instead leave it for the next guest .
All we are asking for is equal treatment .
Equal representation .
We will do all the work , but obviously we can't put books in EVERY hotel room in America yet .
First come , first serve .
The first hotel that gets in touch with us will get : A ) .
Publicity ! B ) .
A reputation for strange , progressive values ! C ) .
Free books !
Come on about it !
Anyway , we think this is a good idea , and more than mere whimsy .*** A piece of fiction is better than an expertly - folded towel or free continental breakfast .
One piece of unexpected personalization allowed within the confines of the manicured , antiseptic hotel space might just save lives and mend hearts .
I want to run to the bedside nighttable first thing when I enter a hotel room and see what novel is there waiting for me .
It would be like opening a fortune cookie .*** We want to do this , but we think you should too .
If you finish your novel while you are on vacation , leave it behind in your hotel room .
Scrawl a little message in the cover .
" This novel placed here by Jack Torrance to be read and shared .
" You could hoard your finished novel , you could sell it for a dollar , you could donate it to prisoners ( also a good idea ) , you could donate it to children , or you could leave it behind for a thousand random strangers to read ... to help them get through a lonely night of anguish or malice ... to help promote a writer you like and to help hotels not be so damn cold and inhumane .
What would you rather reach for when you are at your lowest , your most depressed , and your most suggestible ?
King James ?
Or Stephen King ?
Rush Limbaugh and his bride , Kathryn , have tied the knot .
We were n't invited to the exclusive event this evening .
But , as you can see above , we were there in spirit !
The winner of our plane - banner contest — and 15 runners - up — below .
We received many , many excellent and creative submissions on how best to congratulate Rush on his special day .
You went all out and for that we thank you .
After much debate , we went with Oryx 's suggestion , a very simple message of congratulations for Rush on his special 4th wedding day — as one commenter put it , very likely the 4th happiest day of his life .
So why did we go with this one ?
Well , there were a bunch of considerations .
Many of the messages we liked were too controversial for the pilot we hired to fly the banner over Palm Beach .
( He lives there and has a business to run , and he was skittish about pissing off everyone in town . )
Many others referenced Limbaugh 's years - old prescription drug arrest , which seemed like a bit of a cheap shot no matter how clever they were , or how much he might deserve it .
There were quite a few good political ones , too , touching on gay marriage and the oil spill .
But we 'll leave staging protests at weddings to the Westboro Baptist Church .
In the end , Oryx came up with a simple , straightforward message that made us laugh when we imagined it flying over Rush Limbaugh 's wedding .
And it was one we think was enjoyed by all who had gathered again to celebrate the sacred , everlasting union between Limbaugh and yet another woman .
Well , everyone except this Twitter user .
( To ensure no one missed it , we also had the pilot fly over Rush 's estate this evening as well . )
Thanks to all who participated !
For everyone upset that their message was n't chosen , there 's always number 5 .
Here are the 15 entries — in no particular order !— that we selected as runners - up .
For your creative genius , we 're giving you each a selection of Elton John 's greatest hits .
( CD or iTunes — your choice .
Get in touch so we can get it to you . )
Congrats !

Help Us Congratulate Rush Limbaugh on His Wedding Day
Quite unannounced , the Rudd Government has imposed fines totalling thousands of dollars as a result of raids on adult shops , forcing some out of business and sending the proprietor of a retailer in Sydney 's Oxford Street to prison for three months .
The sentence was imposed by a Sydney Magistrate for selling blue movies and confirmed on appeal .
The proprietor Daryl Cohen began his sentence last month .
He is , as far as can be established , the first person to go to prison for the victimless crime of pornography for more than 60 years .
Cohen 's shop sold sex toys and erotic videos on Sydney 's gay mile .
His shop was raided under the auspices of the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor by police who seized his stock of an estimated 4,000 DVD 's , combed through them and singled out 43 as the basis of a charge of selling pornography .
It is not illegal to possess X - rated DVD 's but in the states it is illegal to sell them .
Cohen 's stock had not been classified , which costs $ 850 , depending on running time , for each DVD .
The police submitted the 43 most graphic of the confiscated films to the Australian Classification Board paid the classification fee and were informed that 38 were acceptable for import into Australia under the X - classification , but that five should be assigned to the category of Refused Classification , because they depicted homosexual bondage and sado - masochistic acts .
A magistrate thereupon sentenced Cohen to three months imprisonment .
He appealed to the District Court , where a judge decided that Cohen would be unable to pay a fine of $ 11,000 a video , totalling perhaps $ 500,000 .
He was broke , and living at home with his aunt .
The magistrate therefore confirmed the sentence of three months imprisonment , which Cohen is now serving , believed to be the first jailing of a censorship offender since 1945 , when Robert Close was imprisoned for writing a novel entitled " Love Me Sailor " .
His friends have told the Eros Association , which is the industry body , that Cohen is taking it badly and has already lost 15 kilos .
The sentence on Close produced extensive media coverage , and prompted a reaction against legal wowserism .
The pendulum , which had resulted in the banning of two notable works of fiction , DH Lawrence 's Lady Chatterley 's Lover , and James Joyce 's Ulysses , not only in Australia but elsewhere in the world , began to swing back .
Redeeming Literary Merit became a defence , and censorship crumbled in the Western world .
Retailers began selling erotic DVD's in the states , capturing the mail - order market that operated out of the ACT and the Northern Territory .
The police ignored this " crime " and got on with hunting down drug deals and keeping a watch for terrorists .
And then it changed .
The Rudd Government moved the censors to Canberra gave them a new name , the Australian Classification Board , and an investigatory arm with a doublespeak title , the Classification Licensing Service .
Two public servants were assigned to visit retailers selling erotic DVD's .
When they found something they did not like they wrote to the police on Attorney - General letterhead , prompting police to initiate prosecutions .
There were fines , escalating from perhaps $ 1,000 to $ 50,000 .
Then police found the hapless Cohen , who has been ruined by the seizure of his stock .
It was back to the bad old days of Arthur Calwell and Bob Menzies , who imposed sales tax on contraceptives , presided over book - banning , and tried to ban the Communist Party , but with an important difference .
The jailing of Robert Close drew intensive media coverage .
The jailing of Daryl Cohen , with the exception of a paragraph or two in the gay press , has drawn none .
He has disappeared behind bars without a trace .
No fuss .
No outcry .
No questioning of the principle of censorship , which in its fundamental says that some of us are entitled to read and see all published material , and then to rule that the rest of us cannot .
Nobody asked the question : who has suffered loss because Cohen sold blue movies , either as damage to property or personal injury .
As with Close 's imprisonment , we are back in the days of " crimes " without victims , " crimes " which do no harm to anyone .
There are no longer members of parliament like Lionel Murphy , Gareth Evans and Don Chipp prepared to put up a fight for the rights of individuals and for freedom of speech .
Instead , since the days of Paul Keating we are looking for ways to tighten the purity laws , with none more zealous than the Communications Minister Stephen Conroy , who when he is not engaged in destroying Telstra is combing the internet for images he finds offensive .
In NSW Kristina Kenealy has announced that redeeming artistic merit is to be removed as a defence against prosecution .
This is not an issue that affects only people with shops in Oxford Street selling DVD 's without , it must be conceded , not a lot of redeeming artistic merit .
The Rudd government added a new question to the customs declaration form that returning travellers must fill out at airports .
Are you carrying firearms , drugs and now , for the first time , pornography , for which there is no legal definition .
Is Playboy porn .
Or Deep Throat , or those jokes that circulate on the internet ?
Already there are instances where people have had their lap - tops seized , regardless of the files , correspondence , diary entries and financial accounts that are nobody 's business but that of the owner of the lap - top , and whose loss can have a severe impact on the owner 's work .
Australia is a live - and - let - live country , except at the top .
On the basis of the polls , we do not support banning erotic videos .
There is no demand for a return to wowserism , which has nevertheless crept back into our lives , like a metastasising cancer , with nobody on either side of the federal parliament prepared to speak up , as Lionel Murphy , Gareth Evens and Don Chipp once did , and in the NSW State Parliament , with only the Greens prepared to have a go .
Close , an acclaimed writer of sea stories , spent most of the rest of his life in France .
He died in 1995 .
An embarrassed Customs service , now that their new question to returning holiday makers has been publicised , is looking for an alternative form of words that does not sweep up the two million people who buy blue movies .

If you ’ve ever wanted to own a real lightsaber , your dream has come true .
But safety officials have warned that the product is no toy and could cause serious injury or worse .
The Spyder III Pro Arctic is sold by Shanghai - based firm Wicked Lasers and costs US $ 197.97 , shipping to 70 countries .
It takes the direct blue laser diode used in extremely powerful home theater projectors and turns it into a 1W beam .
That might not sound much , but bear in mind that a standard laser pointer of the type used by idiots to piss off other crowd members at sports and entertainment events has the same power as sunlight on the skin .
This device has 1,000 times that level of power .
The manufacturer admits that at close range the beam will cause “ immediate and irreversible retinal damage ” and could set fire to skin .
But a laser safety expert told Britain ’s Sky News that was , if anything , an understatement , noting that pointed in the wrong direction it could cause a deadly car or even plane crash .
The device comes with eye protectors and buyers must read and agree to a hazard acknowledgement form before purchasing one .
But safety experts warn that the device is for responsible industrial use only and should not be sold openly to the public , particularly online .
10 Real - Life Reasons
Why the Primal Blueprint Works for Me
There ’s been a lot more talk in the mainstream recently about “ caveman ” diets and barefoot training .
Primal / Paleo / Evo seems to be gaining in popularity and may be nearing the critical mass needed to garner mainstream appreciation .
John Durant appeared on Stephen Colbert last week , Art De Vany was featured in Der Spiegel , Born to Run is a NYT Bestseller and my book recently made the top ten Health and Fitness titles on Amazon .
Even so , we Primal types still get those occasional looks of derision or incomprehension when we show up at the gym with our Fives on and a bag of homemade jerky hanging off our belt to do a quick 15 minute HIIT session .
I think there ’s a sense among outsiders that the Grok fairy tale trumps the science within the Primal crowd – that the notion of living like a caveman is a cute ideal but irrelevant in a 21st century high - tech context .
Of course , it ’s not true ; science always leads the way here at MDA and on most Primal / Paleo / Evo sites .
But even with the science completely supporting the idea that we ought to emulate our hunter - gatherer ancestors in many aspects of life , I still hear things like , “ I trust my doctor too much to give up the statins and start eating fats . ”
Or “ I ’m lazy , undisciplined , and I love good food too much to be able to change this late in my life . ”
Hey , me too !
So for those of you who are looking for more detailed rationale why living Primal is best for everyone ( including your doubting spouse and your parents ) , here are my 10 Real - Life Reasons Why the Primal Blueprint Works for Me .
1. I ’m lazy .
Ironically , I spent 25 years of my life pursuing high level fitness and peak health through hard work , discipline , sacrifice and misery .
That did n’t work out for me .
I ’m over it .
Now I just want the best results with the least amount of pain , suffering , and sacrifice .
I jokingly tell my ex-triathlete buddies , “ I ’d rather look fit than be fit . ”
Of course , the irony is that when you actually do what it takes to look fit ( eat right , cut the Chronic Cardio , sprint a bit now and then and lift intensely two or three times a week ) you become VERY fit .
And healthy .
And happy .
And more productive .
The best part of Primal Blueprint living is that you can get appreciably better results with significantly less time , less effort and less sacrifice .
Instead of the old 20 - 30 hours a week I used to put in training , I now train less than three hours total a week .
I try to play the rest of the time .
2. I love good food .
Some people mistakenly think the Primal Blueprint requires giving up eating good food .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
When I was a college endurance athlete , my buddies nicknamed me “ Arnold , ” after Arnold Ziffle , the pig on Green Acres .
I could eat more than just about anyone in school ( including the football linemen ) .
I ate everything and enjoyed it all .
But I became a slave to the carbs and to the hunger that they generated every three hours of my life .
Later , when I retired and researched the damage I was doing eating grains , sugars , hydrogenated oils and all the other stuff I consumed to fuel my massive cardio efforts , I feared I might have to suffer a lifetime dearth of gustatory delights if I wanted to keep my boyish figure .
Never happened .
Primal eating reprograms the genes in a way that takes the edge off hunger , while assuring more - than - adequate energy and stable blood glucose levels .
Now , I eat as much as I want , whenever I want from a list of fabulously tasty foods .
I just avoid eating most things from that other list .
Hunger does n’t drive my life the way it used to .
When I sit in a restaurant with a rare 20 - ounce rib eye steak , a bowl of butter - sautéed mushrooms and a glass of fine Cabernet in front of me , I never feel sorry for myself that I did n’t order pasta or that I wo n’t be having the bread or potatoes or rice .
And for dessert , if I ’m still hungry , I ’d really rather have another lamb chop or a bowl of berries than a slice of cardboard cake or mucous - inducing ice cream .
Worst case , I can have a small taste of the latter and be satisfied .
3 . I like to play .
I spent a fair amount of my life training for grueling endurance contests ( marathons , Ironman triathlons , 24 - hour relay running events ) .
Only just recently did it occur to me that I NEVER really had fun while I was competing or while I was training .
Admittedly , I could sometimes get into “ the zone , ” but that ’s really only a temporary zone of less pain .
I did appreciate the valiance of my efforts and certainly felt pride in my accomplishments , but from the time the gun went off until I crossed the finish line , I never once could truthfully say , “ Is n’t this fun ? ”
In contrast , today I plan most of my ( minimal ) training around being able to participate in fun activities later .
And while I do n’t necessarily see play as “ workout time , ” it is most assuredly contributing to my fitness .
Primal Blueprint training gives me the functional strength and endurance to jump into an aggressive Ultimate Frisbee game , stand - up paddle and surf for two hours , take a 90 - minute trail hike with sprints thrown in , play a round of golf , or snowboard for five days in a row .
I stay fit so I can play at stuff I find FUN .
4 . I like to sleep .
I used to feel guilty if I slept too much .
As if I were missing out on something that might be taking place while the lights were still on somewhere .
Now I get at least eight hours every night and embrace the idea that I am NOT wasting time , but am recharging the batteries and will probably live longer as a result .
I think most people would prefer to get adequate sleep , but feel like it ’s a sign of weakness that they “ need ” eight or nine hours .
It ’s not .
Sleep is integral to health .
5 . I do n’t like being sick .
No one does .
At the peak of my endurance career , I got colds and flus five to seven times a year .
I also had severe seasonal grass pollen allergies .
The nature of Chronic Cardio training ( all that cortisol ) and the obligate high carbohydrate diet ( all that sugar ) kept my immune system so trashed that anything that was going around was going to take me down with it .
And stuff is always going around .
The Primal Blueprint works because everything about it is contemplated to support or boost the immune system and not trash it .
My allergies have long since disappeared .
I rarely get any kind of cold or flu now and , if I do , it ’s with no real down time and over quickly .
Many people argue that this benefit alone is worth the switch to Primal .
6 . I ’m vain ( I want to look good naked ) .
The Primal Blueprint exercise laws are designed to sculpt a lean , muscled and balanced look without being overly “ huge ” or disproportional the way bodybuilders can get .
It works perfectly for both men and women .
I often say here that 80 % of your body composition is determined by how you eat .
The remaining 20 % is a combination of genetics and exercise .
If you dial the eating in properly , it does n’t take very much exercise to optimize muscle size and strength , and to cut the last few percentage points in body fat .
Notice I said optimize and not maximize .
Think Calvin Klein underwear and SI Swimsuit models as opposed to swollen Muscle & Fitness or WWF cover models .
7 . I like to be tan ( vain part 2 ) .
Sorry , I never understood the porcelain skin thing .
I notice the dramatic effect a lack of sun has on my disposition as much as I notice it on my skin if I skip a few weeks ( winter sucks – except for snowboarding ) .
Getting adequate sunlight daily is an integral part of the PB as it has been for humans for millions of years .
Vitamin D is critical to maintaining good health .
As I say in my book , I honestly believe we ’ve seen an increase in overall cancer incidence as a result of ( ironically ) heeding the advice of doctors to stay out of the sun .
I think everyone would rather be outside for a while every day if they knew it was not only NOT harmful , but beneficial .
A slight tan just looks good , and it ’s indicative of a healthy Vitamin D status .
Getting sun also improves mood and productivity as numerous studies continue to show .
8 . I ’m not organized .
If you saw my desk you ’d probably cringe .
Stuff all over it everywhere .
Same goes with my training style these days , and I love it .
I almost never train with anyone , because I like being able to head out the door on a whim and go sprint or hike or bang off a few hundred pushups .
I hate having a set training schedule or the idea of having to meet someone at such and such a time to work out together .
Do n’t get me wrong , I do train with friends once in a while , but the Primal Blueprint training outline fits my fractal , sporadic , random , intermittent , flakey and spontaneous nature .
If I do n’t feel like training today , the PB says “ take the day off – you ’ll be stronger and more focused tomorrow . ”
Not to be outdone , the Primal Blueprint eating style is also unorganized .
Not set meal times , no regimentation , no calorie - counting or portion control .
Eat when you want and as much – or not – as you want .
Of course , none of this is to say you HAVE to be disorganized to benefit from the PB .
If you ’re organized , it works that much better .
But for those who eschew schedules , the PB is perfect .
9 . I want to stay uninjured .
Downtime from injury sucks .
As I said earlier , I want to get more play time now as I get older .
I recognize that my body does n’t recover from workouts as easily as it used to .
I also notice that I have to pay attention to potential soreness a bit more .
PB fitness provides a set of guidelines and workout styles that foster balanced , functional strength .
It actually focuses on injury prevention and avoidance , while building muscle and burning fat .
10 . I like certainty .
I ’m a skeptic at heart ( OK , I ’m actually a cynic ) .
I hate investing my precious time , money , energy or emotion in anything I do n’t feel confident will yield dividends .
It has to be based in science , rational thought and real results .
Conversely , I hate thinking that some of my choices in exercise , diet and health may have been wrong ( as they were so egregiously when I followed Conventional Wisdom ) .
I need to have confidence that my choices are good ones .
The research backing the PB is the most solid there is .
Evolutionary biology and modern genetic – and epigenetic – science are proving that we have remarkable influence over how our genes express themselves throughout our lives .
Stuff we do and things we eat turn genes on or off .
It ’s that simple .
Intervals and Tabata work have been proven over and over to be more effective at increasing speed and stamina than Chronic Cardio .
The dietary science of low - carb is nearly irrefutable now , as more and more researchers and docs begin to understand the true nature of insulin and they rethink the cholesterol hypothesis .
Look , there is no right or wrong here .
You can eat Twinkies and smoke cigarettes for the rest of your life and you still might reach 90 or 100 .
But I have never in my life been more certain of anything than I am that the Primal Blueprint way of eating , exercising and living is the optimal way to have the most energy , the most fun , look the best and live the longest .
And I know I can do this for the rest of my life .

This past week various news events once again made it abundantly clear that our foreign policy is an abject failure .
Unfortunately , in spite of this , the administration is determined to stay on this destructive course , despite any past promises to change it .
For Afghanistan especially , if ever there was an opportunity to admit shortcomings and change strategies along with leaders , this past week was it .
There really is nothing for us to win in Afghanistan .
Our mission has morphed from apprehending those who attacked us , to apprehending those who threaten or dislike us for invading their country , to remaking an entire political system and even a culture .
I remain highly skeptical that , as foreign occupiers , we can ever impose Western - style democracy on another country .
Our troops have debilitating restrictions on defending themselves against enemies , which are so often indistinguishable from civilians .
They also face dire setbacks in winning hearts and minds when innocents are mistakenly harmed , which happens all the time .
We can never make friends this way ; the tactic never works .
This is an expensive , bloody , endless exercise in futility .
Not everyone is willing to admit this just yet .
But every second they spend in denial has real costs in lives and livelihoods .
Many of us can agree on one thing , however .
Our military spending in general has grown way out of control .
This is largely because fiscal accountability in military budgeting is seen , by many , as weak on defense .
This is absolutely wrong and a dangerous way to think .
It is certainly possible for the military to waste money , or to spend money counterproductively , and indeed it has .
But out of political correctness , the military has been getting blank checks from the administrations and Congress for far too long .
It is important to defend our soil , but let us defend our own soil instead of defending Europe ’s soil .
Our willingness to defend Europe enables their lavish social spending at our expense , while they criticize our model of capitalism .
It is time they allocated the money for their own defense .
The same goes for Korea , Japan , and other countries like Egypt and Israel .
It is also important that while our troops are in combat , our soldiers have what they need to do the best they can , even if we disagree with why they are there .
It is an embarrassment that some soldiers and families have had to buy body armor at their own expense when billions are awarded to politically well - connected defense contractors for weapon systems that do n’t work , are over - budget , and are past deadline .
This is the kind of waste that needs to end .
I firmly believe that there is enough waste in the military budget that we can both save money overall and at the same time be safer .
Of course , the obvious way to save money and be safer is to stop meddling in the affairs of foreign countries and just bring our troops home .
This will happen eventually if our empire , like every other fallen empire , insists on spending itself into collapse .
If we want to avoid this , we must look into ways to bring our costs under control .
Military budgets must be on the chopping block along with everything else .
Probing the weird quantum world ( Image : Hiroshi Watanabe / Getty )
Quantum theory is our most successful theory of physics .
There is not one shred of experimental evidence that does n’t fit with its predictions .
So why , if it ai n’t broke , is a growing number of researchers expressing a desire to fix it ?
“ Everything depends on whether you believe quantum mechanics is going to go on describing the physical world perfectly to whatever level you push it , ” says Nobel laureate Anthony Leggett , who studies the quantum world at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
Leggett thinks it wo n’t , that there are too many issues with quantum theory to think it anything more than an approximation of reality .
“ I ’m inclined to put my money on the idea that if we push quantum mechanics hard enough it will break down and something else will take over – something we ca n’t envisage at the moment , ” he says .
The question is , how hard can we push it ?
Experiments have never had the sensitivity to pinpoint a weak spot in quantum mechanics .
But thanks to a breakthrough earlier this year , that might be about to change .
A new swathe of experiments is coming onto the scene that should be up to the job .
Welcome to the dawn of the quantum machines .
Such machines are promising to patch a gaping hole in every experiment that has ever been used to back up our view of the quantum world .
Take the simple process of measuring a photon ’s spin .
Thanks to the strange nature of the quantum world , it can actually be spinning in two directions at once , a phenomenon known as superposition . …
DETROIT – Twenty thousand people attending the second U.S. Social Forum here this week have staged a peaceful takeover of a city in crisis .
Leaders of people ’s movements , together with thousands from across the nation and this city , are in charge of the streets , where they are staging colorful marches and rallies that give voice to movements for jobs , health , education , the environment and respect for human rights .
“ There ’s a tale of two cities going on right now , ” said Karlos Gauna Schmieder , communications chair for the Social Forum , as he talked about this event that has temporarily transformed the downtown section of the nation ’s biggest rustbelt city into a neighborhood teeming with people full of ideas .
“ There ’s another city that has brought together , not this kind of crowd , but international leaders – many of whom are isolated from their people , to discuss free market solutions to the current free market crisis , ” Schmieder said , “ and you can see the difference in the streets of these two cities . ” .
He was referring to Toronto where , at a gathering of leaders of the G - 20 nations , a reported $ 1 billion has been spent on security and police out of fear of demonstrators opposed to measures being enacted there to deal with the world economic crisis .
Here in Detroit , right - wing commentators in some of the local press had warned that the thousands of “ assorted leftists ” arriving for the Social Forum could disrupt life in Detroit .
One claimed that the attendees would provide no benefit to the local economy and that “ Obama would be among them as a community organizer were he not in the White House . ”
The reality is far different .
One of the few policemen visible anywhere Thursday was directing traffic in and out of a downtown garage to allow marchers to pass .
“ We ’re glad everyone ’s here , ” he said , “ having a good time and helping boost the economy . ”
Demonstrators in Toronto , including labor leaders who have also gathered in that city , are concerned about what global leaders will do regarding bank taxes , trade balances , budget cuts and austerity measures .
The heavy police presence in Toronto has already been visible at dozens of protests there against what the protesters see as policies that make the rich wealthier at the expense of women , children and working class people around the world .
Here , many of the participants in U.S. Social Forum opening march Tuesday carried banners and signs echoing the concerns of the Toronto marchers .
The message was that what happens in Detroit , the “ ground zero ” of a failed economy in the U.S. , is connected to what happens around the world .
Alejandro Villamar , a Mexican participant at the Social Forum , said , “ The G - 20 ’s empty promises have exhausted their credibility and moral authority before the people of the world .
The global crisis requires real , just and timely solutions .
Their rhetoric does not stop the climate crisis , it does not stop the voracity of financial speculators , and it does not stop the hunger of millions of people .
Instead , we need immediate solutions that meet our demands for social justice . ”
“ Our fight in Mexico is part of the same fight you have here in Detroit , ” he said .
The thousands gathered here are struggling to hammer out some of the immediate solutions Villamar said are needed .
There are over 1,000 workshops , 50 People ’s Movements Assemblies , art galleries and a youth space full of young people grappling with the business of transforming the world .
Participation from the labor movement is much greater than at the first U.S. Social Forum in Atlanta in 2007 .
“ This is important , ” Schmeider said , “ because labor and the groups represented here are natural allies – we succeed if we work together . ”
The AFL - CIO , the United Auto Workers , the Steelworkers , the Service Employees International Union , the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees and others are here in an official capacity .
Among the huge variety of organizations present are the Communist Party USA and the Young Communist League , both of which held several public events and maintained one of the hundreds of tables set up by different organizations .
At a workshop run by the party , Sam Webb , its national chair , discussed the importance of all groups coming together to fight the extreme right and he discussed the need to strengthen and build upon the coalition that elected President Obama .
For the long range , Webb said , socialism is in the cards and is necessary for the building of the new world sought by the thousands gathered in Detroit .

In the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Photo ( STEP ) carbon capture process , the sun ’s visible light and heat are used to capture large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it to solid carbon for storage or carbon monoxide for fuel generation .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
By using the sun 's visible light and heat to power an electrolysis cell that captures and converts carbon dioxide from the air , a new technique could impressively clean the atmosphere and produce fuel feedstock at the same time .
The key advantage of the new solar carbon capture process is that it simultaneously uses the solar visible and solar thermal components , whereas the latter is usually regarded as detrimental due to the degradation that heat causes to photovoltaic materials .
However , the new method uses the sun ’s heat to convert more solar energy into carbon than either photovoltaic or solar thermal processes alone .
The new process , called Solar Thermal Electrochemical Photo ( STEP ) carbon capture , was recently suggested theoretically by a team of scientists from George Washington University and Howard University , both in Washington , DC .
Now , in a paper just published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters , the scientists have experimentally demonstrated the STEP process for the first time .
“ The significance of the study is twofold , ” Stuart Licht , a chemistry professor at George Washington University , told PhysOrg.com .
“ Carbon dioxide , a non-reactive and normally difficult - to - remove compound , can be easily captured with solar energy using our new low - energy , lithium carbonate electrolysis STEP process , and with scale - up , sufficient resources exist for STEP to decrease carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels within 10 years . ”
As the scientists explain , the process uses visible sunlight to power an electrolysis cell for splitting carbon dioxide , and also uses solar thermal energy to heat the cell in order to decrease the energy required for this conversion process .
The electrolysis cell splits carbon dioxide into either solid carbon ( when the reaction occurs at temperatures between 750 °C and 850°C ) or carbon monoxide ( when the reaction occurs at temperatures above 950 °C ) .
These kinds of temperatures are much higher than those typically used for carbon - splitting electrolysis reactions ( e.g. , 25 °C ) , but the advantage of reactions at higher temperatures is that they require less energy to power the reaction than at lower temperatures .
The STEP process is the first and only method that incorporates both visible and thermal energy from the sun for carbon capture .
Radiation from the full solar spectrum - including heat - is not usually considered an advantage in solar technologies due to heat ’s damage to photovoltaics .
Even in the best solar cells , a large part of sunlight is discarded as intrinsically insufficient to drive solar cells as it is sub- bandgap , and so it is lost as waste heat .
By showing how to take advantage of both the sun ’s heat and light for capturing and splitting carbon dioxide , the STEP process is fundamentally capable of converting more solar energy than either photovoltaic or solar thermal processes alone .
The experiments in this study showed that the technique could capture carbon dioxide and convert it into carbon with a solar efficiency from 34 % to 50 % , depending on the thermal component .
While carbon could be stored , the production of carbon monoxide could later be used to synthesize jet , kerosene , and diesel fuels , with the help of hydrogen generated by STEP water splitting .
“ We are exploring the STEP generation of synthetic jet fuel and synthetic diesel , ” Licht said , “ and in addition to carbon capture , we are developing STEP processes to generate the staples predicted in our original theory , such as a variety of metals and bleach . "

Movie titles do n't tell you much .

In July , we asked you to show us what some Hollywood blockbusters might have been called if they really told you what you were getting , and more recently asked for honest Oscar movie titles .
The winners are below , but first the runners up ...

ICCF US Olympiad 18 Team Qualifies for the Finals !
The ICCF - US Olympiad team has qualified for the 18th Olympiad Final .
The team of GM Dan Fleetwood , SIM Jerry Weisskohl , SIM Keith Holzmueller , SIM Michael Proof , IM Bill Boucher , and SIM Tim Murray scored +9-2=36 with one game remaining .
The Team Captain was Franklin Campbell .
With only two teams qualifying in each Prelim section , ICCF - US maintains a record of qualifying for all Olympiad Finals , 13 to 18 .
Michael Proof strikes gold !
Michael Proof won his section with +3-0=5 .
GAME OF THE MONTH
Michael Proof turns in a mini-masterpiece with this positional attacking game .
The Black King is always the main target as White appears to be striking only at the squares around him in this exciting King hunt with no checks .
SICILIAN DEFENSE ( B90 )

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6 .Be3 e5 7.Nb3 Be6 8.f3 Be7 9.Qd2 h5 10.0 –0–0
Modern theory seems divided between the attacking continuation with 10 .
000 and the positional treatment with 10 .
Be2 Nbd7 11 . Nd5 Bxd5 12 . exd5 as in Mamedon - Vilmaz , Athens 2009
10 ... Nbd7 11.Kb1
In Tilburg 1998 , Anand tried the innocuous 11 . g3 against Sadler .
11...Rc8 12.Bd3
Also popular here is 12 .
h3 to control g4 so that White may play f4 without allowing ... Ng4 .
12...Nc5 13.Nxc5 dxc5 14.Qf2
This is an improvement over Shabalov - Zhang Zhong , US - China 2001 where Shabalov played 14 .
Qe2
14 ...Qc7 15.Be2
The d5 square is the key square here .
15...b5 16.f4 0 –0
Oltean - Orsolic , corres .
2007 continued 14 ... Qa5 15 . Be2 00 16 . Nd5 +=
17.f5 Bd7 18.Nd5
White plays for a sound positional advantage rather than continuing the attack with 18 .
Bg5
18 ... Nxd5 19.exd5 c4 20.d6 !
Deflecting the Bishop after which White plants a killer Pawn on f6 .
20 ... Bxd6 21.f6 g6
Without hope is 21 ... gxf6 22 . Qxf6
22.g4 !
While 22 . Bxh5 !? is strong , 22 . g4 ! leaves the Black King without resource .
22...c3
Black counterpunches well but remains one punch behind .
23.b3 Qa5 24.gxh5 Bf5 25 .
Bf3 Qa3 26.Bc1 Qb4 27.Qg2 e4 28.hxg6 fxg6 29.Bg4 Kf7
Not 29 ... Rxf6 ? 30 . Bxf5
30.Rd5 !
White would unduly rush things with 30 .
Bxf5 gxf5 31 . Qg7 + Ke6 and White lacks a good continuation .
Instead
White continues to effectively dominate the d-file .
30 ... Bxg4 31.Qxg4 Rcd8 32.Rg1 1-
0
A little finesse -- after 32 ... Rg8 33 . Rgd1 e3 34 . R1d4 ends the game .

REMINDER : The quest continues Tuesday , July 20th !
After a year and four months , many times pulling near - all - nighters to update on time , this month ’s schedule is proving too busy , so I ’ll have to take a break for two weeks ( equaling 3 comic updates total ) .
Edmund Finney ’s quest will resume as usual Tuesday , July 20th .
But fear not !
You will still have comics !
Ever take a look at The Rejection Collection ?
Those are ( mostly ) comics of mine rejected by various publishers ( mostly MAD Magazine ) .
I made a comic a few years ago called Belfry Meadows for possible newspaper syndication that was rejected , and I ’ll run those comics in this blog area during this break , so you ’ll still have comickery to see !
Here ’s a teaser image :
And you can use this time to make your entry ( ies ) for the NEW CONTEST !
Multiple entries are allowed !
Okay , you got me .
I love Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson 's " Beasts of Burden . "
You know this by now .
It 's been firmly established .
I 've done my best to justify my ongoing affection for today 's newly - released " Beasts of Burden : Animal Rites " hardcover and now I want to pass some of it on to you .
Thankfully , Dark Horse Comics is happy to oblige my ongoing frenzied advocacy with a 22 page preview culled from their own eComic library .
If you 've never sampled the first two BoB shorts " Stray " and " The Unfamiliar , " ( from " The Dark Horse Book of Hauntings " and " The Dark Horse Book of Witchcraft , " respectively ) then now is the time .
The two tales quickly establish the book 's suburban setting in Burden Hill , introduce its unwitting canine and feline defenders and lets loose all the horror , heart and hilarity that will leave you hooked .
Read both stories in full after the jump .
Stray
The Unfamiliar
WASHINGTON — The NBA Finals have thrown the nation 's basketball fans into a state of angry confusion this week , as the bitter debate over whether they despise the Celtics or Lakers more rages on .
" Kobe is such an egotistical prick that it 's really easy to detest the Lakers , especially with that clenched - jaw face he makes , but come on — you have to hate the Celtics because the Big Three are so much more fucking annoying , " said Jeff Connor , a St. Louis native .
" I 'll admit that I can't stand Pau Gasol , just because the guy rubs me the wrong way , maybe due to his disgusting greasy hair .
Phil Jackson is a pretty huge asshole with all that loud whistling he does , but Rondo is the most irritating little shit , and I loathe that fat sweaty hog Glen Davis .
Ray Allen is actually okay .
That dick Kevin Garnett , though , is a chest - pounding idiot . "
After much discussion , a consensus appears to be near , as Americans are agreeing to hate the Lakers and Celtics equally .

Image caption Iranian officials have published a guide to " appropriate " men 's hairstyles
In the Islamic Republic of Iran , the personal is political .
No more so than in the issue of personal appearance .
The imposition of headscarves is deeply resented by more liberal - minded women .
Now the government is tightening up on men's hair as well .
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has published a guide to men's hairstyles .
Short , neat hair is approved ; ponytails are definitely not .
The styles are to be showcased in a " modesty and veil " conference later this month .
On the streets of Tehran , you often see young men with the most extravagant , outrageous , hairstyles .
Image caption Barbers will have to follow the rules while going about their work
Huge bouffant quiffs that must take hours of loving care .
They are clearly intended as an unspoken act of rebellion against a government that bans many of the pleasures young people enjoy , including public displays of affection or Western pop music .
By contrast , men who support the government , particularly members of the feared basij militia , are characterised by a thick stubble on their chins that marks out their interpretation of Islam , a growth that always mysteriously appears two days old , but never matures into a full beard .
Many young women also defy the government by wearing the compulsory headscarf so far back it is almost in the neighbouring country .
The compulsory outer garment , the roupoosh , that is supposed to hide those seductive curves , can be adapted into a garment that only adds to the female allure .
' Naked women '
Since the disputed election last summer , the issue of clothing and personal appearance has become even more political .
Strangely , it is the hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who has been arguing that it is not the government 's job to crack down on people 's style of dress .
For this he has been criticised by various conservative ayatollahs and politicians , who thunder against " naked ' or " half - naked " women roaming the streets .
Their version of naked usually means a headscarf slightly out of place .
Image caption Iranian women manage to look fashionable , despite the restrictions
Before his first election victory in 2005 , Mr Ahmadinejad insisted he would not crack down on such personal issues .
Nevertheless , during his first term in office the police announced repeated drives on the dress code .
Women would be pulled aside and warned if their clothing was deemed inappropriate .
If they argued the point , they were liable to be taken down to the local police station .
Now some Iranians are worried that the pressure on political freedom that followed Mr Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election last year will extend to personal dress and appearance as well .
But there also seems to be a faction amongst the hardliners , particularly the revolutionary guards , who are trying to offer an unspoken deal .
Do n't challenge our political power and we will leave you alone in your private lives appears to be the suggestion .
Artists arrested
It is difficult to get a clear picture , but there are sporadic reports of a degree of liberalisation .
The regulations concerning art galleries , for example , have been relaxed a little .
Though any sense of greater freedom has been removed by the arrest of so many of Iran 's leading artists and creative talents , such as the film director Jafar Panahi .
If there really is a debate about the dress code going on among the ruling elite , it is a fascinating glimpse into the divisions that have sprung up since the election .
One leading commentator has described the regulations on clothing and appearance as one of the pillars of the Islamic republic .
Even in last summer 's unprecedented mass demonstrations , few if any women took the radical step of throwing off the headscarf .
If they did , in numbers , the foundations of the system would surely begin to shake .

Andrew Hudson , whose recent article on BFS over at ARSTechnica intrigued us , shares with us some thoughts on the state of apps on Haiku .
It turns out there are several repositories with a vast array of applications ready - to - go for your new Haiku install .
Where Are the Haiku Applications ?
As more Haiku new - comers install the Alpha 1 or Alpha 2 versions we hear the same complaint , â€ œI just installed Haiku , but there are no applications and there ’s nothing to doâ€ 
Many Haiku users have the mistaken impression that few applications run on Haiku and then go away after having a bad out - of - box
experience .
Haiku has literally thousands of BeOS applications to run , but we have n’t organized them in a way that makes them easily accessible .
The Superior Haiku Applications Group sets out to change this .
A Better Experience With SHAG
Our # 1 Goal is to increase the Haiku user experience .
And so we created a list of the first and best apps you should download after installing Haiku .
In the process we also looked at apps that we really wanted to run but could n’t , and apps that do n’t exist in Haiku yet but really should .
Promiscuous Testing Criteria
We looked far and wide for BeOS apps .
We put out a call for people to list
their favorite BeOS apps .
We also went through old BeOS literature , read old reviews , and emailed old developers .
We were and still are looking for cool , fun , and useful BeOS applications .
This list is still evolving .
We know we missed some apps so please keep your recommendations coming .
Or better yet , join our testing on Haikuware .
We searched through application download sites : bebits.com , haikufire.com , beemulated .net , darkwyrm downloads , zeta-games.com , haikuware.com , and did a lot of googling .
Haikuware was chosen as the central repository because it has 2640 + applications to download .
It also has a rating system , user forums , a built in email system , and a way to leave comments for each app .
We used promiscuous testing criteria : Install it on Alpha 2 .
Open it .
Try a few operations .
Report the results .
We try as hard as we can to â€œrule inâ€  any app , and find work - arounds for simple problems .
If it kind of or mostly runs , we added it to our list .
Different Levels of Haiku Compatibility
In the process of testing we found that BeOS applications fall into the following categories :
Runs on Haiku with little or no modification
Requires some work - around ( e.g. needs BeOS compatibility
optional package )
optional package )
Requires hybrid
GCC4libs
GCC4libs Requires an updated HaikuPorts lib
Requires development
work ( e.g. does n’t run yet )
How to Install an Application on Haiku
If you see an application you really want to run , how do you install it ?
Open your WebPositive web browser
from the Applications menu
from the Applications menu Go to Haikuware.com
Download the application you want by clicking on Download
Launch the Expander by clicking on the Open button after
download completes
download completes
Change the install path from / boot / home / Desktop to
/ boot / apps
/ boot / apps Click Expand
To run your new application â€ “ right click on your file
system icon ( upper left corner ) , then select the apps folder , then your
application ’s folder .
Some applications have an additional setup script or
setup instructions .
Look for a README file .
If the application is downloaded as a .pkg file , open Terminal from the Applications menu and run PackageInstaller from the command line .
Use the PackageInstaller to
complete the installation .
Some applications or libraries can be installed using the installoptionalpackage utility .
Open Terminal and type installoptionalpackage â€“l to list packages or libraries
that are available to install or update

Enough ca n’t be said about GOBE Productive .
It ’s so good
that some people still run V2.02 on Haiku .
GOBE
Software is still in business and will consider working with the Haiku team to port V3 to Haiku .
As far as I am concerned , GOBE Productive is the closest thing we have to a killer app for
Haiku .

This List Is Just A Start !
The list of applications that are tested on Haiku is just a start .
We only tested about 65 applications .
That leaves about 2475 applications that still need to be tested on Haikuware !
Please take a little time and install an application or two and leave some feedback .
Or pick an application that does n’t work and help port it .
Special Thanks
Special thanks to Karl Van Dorff who has hosted haikuware.com for years and who personally retrieved and saved thousands
of classic BeOS applications for posterity .
Also thanks to Pistooli , Streakx , MaxOS , DarkWyrm , and Michael V Oliveira for testing and porting .

( take 8 ( david- edgar - liebke ) )
David Edgar Liebke is a prolific writer of Clojure source codes .
His project Incanter is a rocket - powered statistical environment based on R with beautiful visualization capabilities ( and then some ) .
David is also a major data geek and is not afraid to talk about it on his Data Sorcery blog .
As a founding member of Clojure / core , David flys to - and - fro in the Clojure - jet fighting against the enemies of concision , simplicity , and bad statistics .
He was gracious enough to take some time to answer a few of my questions .
( take … is an on - going series of micro-interviews focused on interesting Clojurians .
What is the genesis of Incanter ?
Incanter is the result of a project I was working on with my Ph.D advisor before leaving grad school to pursue Clojure / core .
The goal was to develop a standalone application for building specific kinds of statistical models that are used in the social sciences .
My early prototypes were built with R , which I love , but it has limitations as a platform for building standalone applications .
So I searched for alternatives that would give me R ’s interactive development cycle , it ’s core statistical and linear algebra functions , its basic data visualization capabilities , but that would be better suited for general - purpose application development .
That ’s when I found Clojure .
I spent a fair amount of time using Lisp for AI programming as an undergrad , and then had the opportunity to spend more time with it a couple years ago learning to write automated theorem provers .
I had always loved its minimalist syntax , the emphasis on using only a few data structures , the mind - melting awesomeness of recursion and macros , and of course the REPL .
So , I had always kept an eye out for opportunities to return to Lisp .
After a few preliminary experiments with Clojure , and a couple different Java numeric libraries , I had basic statistical and linear algebra functionality .
Then one evening I threw JFreeChart into the mix , giving me basic data visualizations .
I was able to very quickly build an environment that had some of the key features of R that I depended on the most , just by combining Clojure with a couple Java libraries , I was hooked and have never looked back .
Incanter took on a life of its own .
What was once built as the underlying framework for a specific data modeling application became a general purpose statistical computing environment .
Are you a music - while - programming kind of guy ?
I do n’t usually listen to music when I ’m working alone or remote pairing , but I definitely like the energy it provides when I ’m working down at Relevance HQ — although with the competing musical tastes of 20 different people ( not to mention Aaron Bedra ’s perverse love of mashups ) , it ’s an eclectic mix to be sure .
Do programmers stink at statistics ?
Almost everybody stinks at statistics .
However , programmers have an edge now that programming has become an important part of statistics .
Unfortunately , they may have no choice but to become better at it because statistics has become an important part of computer science .
Vi , Emacs , or other ?
Both .
I started life in Emacs , switched to vi/vim because I spent a lot of time doing system administration .
I developed much of Incanter with vim and a command line REPL , but I finally found my way back to Emacs for Clojure development because of the power duo of Slime and Paredit , but I still use vim for for everything else .
Aside from Clojure , what programming languages do you hold in high esteem ?
I love R despite , or perhaps because of , its quirks ; I love the purity of Scheme , and I ’ve always appreciated Ruby , and after spending time at Relevance with some of the best Ruby programmers anywhere , that appreciation has grown .
Why did you give up the life of celebrity and riches to join Clojure / core ?
I gave up a pretty awesome job , working with some of the best people in the bioinformatics world , a great environment , and a bit of free time .
In return I get to work with some of the best Clojurists in the world ( including Stuart Halloway , Stuart Sierra , and the man himself , Rich Hickey ) .
I get a front row seat to the development of one of the most interesting programming languages around , and I get to participate in the early stages of a growing community , full of incredibly bright and enthusiastic people .
It was an opportunity I could n’t resist .
Can you provide a picture summarizing your feelings about Clojure / core ?
I think this pretty much sums up my feelings .
Why should anyone care about Clojure / core and Clojure in general ?
Well , I think the goals of Clojure / core are pretty cool
Help fund the further development of Clojure Help improve the Clojure ecosystem and community
Help those that do n’t understand the benefits of Clojure ’s approach to see the value
Help those that already understand the value to build systems
And I think the combination of in - depth knowledge of the Clojure language and Relevance ’s well known expertise in agile development is pretty fantastic .
I consider Lisp the first agile programming language .
Later languages could n’t match its power and fast development cycle .
Eventually features like dynamic typing , interactive development with a REPL , and meta - programming made their way to newer languages .
In time leading to Ruby , and now Clojure brings it back full circle .
He may still be more popular in Britain than he is in America , but these days the Brits have a new message for President Obama .
Back off .
As the Obama administration has joined the chorus of U.S. politicians lambasting BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , a plume of anger is rising across the Atlantic at what many see as an unfair castigation of a British icon .
U.S. officials have demanded that BP suspend dividend payments for the time being , and Obama has said he would have fired Chief Executive Tony Hayward if Hayward worked for him .
Grandstanding and buck - passing , say many British politicians , pundits and pensioners , hitting back at what they see as intimidation tactics directed at a company that has brought immense value to the British — and global — economy .
The protectiveness toward BP is especially acute because the company ’s dividends provide a significant share of income for British pension funds .
While acknowledging the enormity of the unfolding ecological disaster , British critics say the Obama administration has gone overboard in its criticism and is now endangering the savings of millions of shareholders who have watched BP ’s plunge in the stock market .
BP ’s stock has lost close to half its value since the spill occurred , though it was up by $ 1.19 to $ 33.97 on Friday .
“ The president should make it clear that he has no desire to destroy a great global company , ” Malcolm Rifkind , a former Cabinet minister , warned Friday .
“ The future of its chief executive is for the company to decide and not for the White House .
While he might , as he has said , wish to ‘ kick ass , ’ he should concentrate his energies on more productive activity . ”
Rifkind was writing in the Times of London , which also published a cartoon titled “ USA v. England , ” depicting Obama in a soccer outfit stamped with the words “ Sponsored by Midterm Elections Inc. ” and kicking a soccer ball labeled “ BP . ” The U.S. is scheduled to play England in the World Cup on Saturday .
The cartoon was mild compared with an extraordinary open letter to Obama this week from John Napier , chairman of British insurance giant RSA .
“ Your comments towards BP and its CEO … are coming across as somewhat prejudicial and personal , ” said Napier , who accused the U.S. of “ double standards ” in its attitude toward BP and toward the damage caused by “ the irresponsible , unchecked greed and avarice ” of American banks .
“ There is a sense here that these attacks are being made because BP is British , ” Napier complained .
In truth , whether intemperate or not , little of the American criticism of BP could be said to slam Britain itself , the British government or the British people .
Those who level that accusation here mostly point to Obama ’s referring to BP by its old name , British Petroleum , which the company dropped in favor of just the initials more than a decade ago .
Officials on both sides of the Atlantic have hastened to try to mask disagreements , emphasizing that the oil spill , though an environmental emergency , is not a diplomatic one .
Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron are scheduled to speak by telephone this weekend .
Cameron ’s office said Friday that it expected the conversation to be statesmanlike and workmanlike , and repeated Cameron ’s comments this week that he understood the frustration and anger in the U.S. over the oil spill .
P.J. Crowley , a spokesman for the U.S. State Department , said Thursday that “ BP is a private company .
This is not about the relationship between the United States and its closest ally . ”
But Cameron ’s measured response brought some opprobrium his way from more nationalistic quarters .
The Daily Mail , usually a good barometer of popular opinion , chastised the prime minister for failing to adequately defend British interests .
“ Stand Up For Your Country , Mr. Cameron ” blared its front page .
But there is also a quieter pushback against the populist politics being played in the U.S. , where the Gulf of Mexico spill has been spun into a morality play in which the fat cat oil company executives are the villains .
The anxiety of the British underscores that the issue is more nuanced :
Those BP dividends are what keep aged pensioners warm in the winter , they say , noting that millions of Americans are also BP shareholders ..
This is not the first time since Obama became president that some Britons have felt that they or one of their beloved institutions was being unfairly maligned across the Atlantic .
Last summer , during the healthcare debate in the U.S. , people here were outraged when some Americans portrayed Britain ’s socialized healthcare system as incompetent , inefficient and a virtual death sentence for those with cancer .
Twitter campaigns , politicians and media commentators all sprang to the National Health Service ’s defense .
The NHS affects nearly everyone in this country , far more than the estimated 18 million Brits with some kind of financial stake in BP , many of them through their pension funds .
Public outrage over Yankee criticism soon faded , and U.S. - British ties emerged unscathed .

Because of that , I ’ve been on the search for something smaller , lighter and stylish but that still offers enough protection for my equipment .
I recently was given a BJX camera bag from Pentax as a gift .
For what it ’s worth , it is n’t perfect but it sure works better than my messenger bags .
In this bag I can fit :
– Canon 5D Mk II with Battery Grip attached .
– 80-200 mm F2.8 L or my 24-105 mm F4 L IS or the 85 mm F1.8 with the 50 mm F1.8 on top of it
– Canon 7D with Sun Sniper strap attached .
Or I can put the Battery Grip for the 5D Mk II in the same slot .
They have to be vertical of course , not horizontal .
The 7D is a bit of a tight squeeze .
But the rest is n’t .
– USB cables
– Canon 430 EX II
– Memory Cards
The bag has the look of being a one strap backpack but I ’ve worn it like a messenger bag .
It ’s just more convenient that was as it allows for quicker access to my lenses and accessories if they ’re needed .
Weatherproofing is a huge issue for most photographers .
When you ’ve got to go from one location to another in pouring rain and need to keep everything dry and functioning well , you need your bag to be reliable .
While it has n’t rained here yet in NYC while the bag has been on me , it has resisted my sweat — and when I ’ve got that much gear on me and walk around in 92° weather , I sweat a lot .
Other bags I ’ve used have actually soaked up my sweat but still kept what ’s inside dry .
The BJX seems to have some sort of weatherproof coating on the outside to keep that moisture out .
That ’s very reassuring for the working photographer in the summer when we need to go from event to event .
Though the material will keep your items safe , it does n’t feel very nice .
My Domke and messenger bags have a nice feeling to them texturally .
This feels very rough .
That is n’t a bad thing really .
Why ?
Well , let ’s say one of NYC ’s many pigeons happens to bless you .
The material allows for easier cleaning on the pot with paper towels , soap , water , or even a tide stick .
The latter is something I always keep on me because of how important presentation is here .
To be fair , being sweaty does n’t help either .
For that reason , keeping handkerchiefs in your bag is always useful .
The bag has plenty of space and pockets for that on top of spaces for lens cloths .
For most cases , this may just be my new go to bag .
The reason is because of the level of protection that it can provide coupled with the stylish look and the fact that it can carry enough gear that I need for most shoots .
A 5D Mk II with two prime lenses can cover most situations .
The unfortunate problem is that even though this bag is fairly sexy and very usable , it makes you sweat .
The padding is thick , so that will not allow for your shirt to breathe around the strap or the back .
If you ’re shooting in Central Park on the hottest day of the summer , then you ’re going to end up looking like you just took a swim in the lake .
This even happens when you carry it around more like a messenger bag than a backpack .
Luckily , the bag has space to store some extra necessities : a small can of Axe , eye drops , Purel Hand Lotion , and a Tide Stain Remover Stick .
Overall , I highly recommend that you purchase this bag if you do n’t need the Domke F2 .

Antenea Jimenez .
Antenea Jimenez interviewed by Susan Spronk and Jeffery R. Webber
June 13 , 2010 -- The Bullet --
We met with Antenea Jimenez , a former militant with the student movement who is now working with a national network of activists who are trying to build and strengthen the comunas [ communes ] .
The comunas are community organisations promoted since 2006 by the government of Venezuela 's President Hugo Chávez government as a way to consolidate a new form of state based upon production at the local level .
She told us about the important advances in the process , as well as the significant challenges that remain in the struggle to build a new form of popular power from below .
Can you tell us about the barrio where you live and the comuna ?
I live in a barrio [ neighbourhood ] in the north part of Caracas and work in a national network that is building comunas .
Currently we operate in seven states ; the majority of the comunas are situated outside Caracas .
We are working with the comunas to construct a political space in participatory way .
It is a new experience in Venezuela .
Above all , the comuna is a political space , not like the state or a parish ; it is created by the people for the people .
Currently there are many comunas in construction in the rural areas , where they are the strongest .
Every comuna has its own reality depending on political culture and the form of production in the specific locale .
For example , on the coastal zone the community is dedicated to fishing , while in a rural zone the production is based on the land .
We are working to discover which elements and principles unite these different experiences , which elements are the same despite the fact that the methods of production and cultures may be different .
We organise national meetings where the comunas from north , south , east and west can share their experiences and learn from each other –- the errors as well as the successes .
What is the main aim of the comunas ?
The aims of the comunas are diverse , and take different forms .
Before the comuna existed there were all kinds of community organisations where people would participate looking for solutions to their problems , their neighbourhood association , the municipal government , etc .
The goal of the comunas is to build on these processes and consolidate them by organising on the basis of territory where people live .
For us the comuna is a territorial space , but also a political space where the aim is to build socialism on a permanent basis , where the people take charge of their own education and political formation .
We teach about convivencia [ living together well ] and elaborate a plan for a particular territory .
What is new about the process is that the people are also elaborating their own plan of formation .
The people are very creative ; the most advanced work with the other neighbours in this process to create a permanent space of formation .
Civil servants , working for the state , who went to these spaces , quickly learned that the people were elaborating their own plan by and for themselves .
Obviously some comunas are more advanced than other ones .
It is much more difficult to build a comuna in urban areas , for example , because they have no experience with [ different forms ] of production ; for example , they have no experience with [ non- capitalist ] social relations with the land .
There is a dynamic in the city that is very capitalist .
But in the rural areas they have conserved many elements of what is “ ours ” , from our ancestors , the Indigenous communities , the Afro- Venezuelan communities .
These values are still there .
For this reason it is easier in the rural areas than in the urban areas .
While there are fewer people in the countryside , the quality of the compañeros is very high .
Sometimes there is not one person who did not vote for Chávez ; this is less common in the urban areas .
Can you describe your personal political formation ?
How did you get involved in the comunas ?
I was a student activist in University .
I was active in political movements before Chávez , but there was no relationship between the social movements and political parties .
In 1992 , when Chávez was released from prison , things began to change .
We have always been involved in the grassroots of the popular movement ; there were few political spaces to participate in before [ Chávez ’s release ] so you would get involved instead in your neighbourhood , in your popular organisation , in your cultural group .
But since Chávez was released [ and began to build a political movement for the 1998 elections ] things changed .
I got involved ; it was our responsibility to help build the process and the movement in Caracas .
I was involved in the Popular Coordinator of Caracas , and afterwards the initiative to create the comunas .
Now we are a group that works on the comunas .
There are a lot of different ideas about the comunas , for example , between our network of activists and what Chávez has suggested .
There are various ideas .
We are building it from the people , not the government .
We have had extraordinary advances ; but the strongest advances have come when the people have been convinced that this is the path , when they have become active in their own neighbourhood .
How do the comunas work ?
Historically there were diverse organisations that came together to resolve the problems of the neighbourhoods .
Our idea was to bring these organisations together to start to participate with concrete issues .
We organise workshops .
Let 's say that a community does not have water .
We will organise a meeting about water .
The people say , “ Ah see !
We can solve our own problems ” .
We look for a socialist solution to the problem .
Not just to hire a private company to fix something , but to work with the government and the people to fix the problem .
Working first from the basic needs of the people will inspire them to participate .
We also work with them to think more about the future , how we can improve things over the long term .
Step by step we work together toward solving simple things , like living together .
Things that just require norms , a little bit of effort that helps us live together better .
The community might decide that “ We ca n’t drink in the streets ” , for example .
Other people see these small changes and then join the struggle when they see the results .
They see that collective organisation is possible .
There is a network of promoters of the comunas that coordinates , but the participation of the people is fundamental .
There are people of all kinds that participate in the comuna : people from the left , people from the right , people that do n’t care about anything .
The people get involved with a problem that touches their family , the school for example because it involves their children .
Not everyone is socialist .
Actually , a minority of participants in the comunas are socialists .
We have to attend to the issues that matter to them .
This can only be done through practice , and this is the way people get involved .
What are some of the main problems that you face trying to build socialism from the neighbourhoods up to higher levels ?
There is one factor that impedes our work which is the electoral dynamic , which is very exhausting .
Constantly being in campaigns does not permit us to consolidate the organic process at the neighbourhood level .
It is difficult to deal with the problems in the community when we have to focus on issues like the constituent assembly , then the referendum , general elections , then presidential elections , then elections for governor , etc .
Currently we are in elections for municipal councillors .
This constant electoral dynamic weakens the organic process at the local level because it distracts us from confronting the daily issues that people confront in their neighbourhoods .
What are the main demands in the north zone of Caracas where you live ?
The main problem in this area is unplanned urbanisation .
Most of the land is in the hands of a very small bourgeoisie and so the common people have had to build their houses on the hillsides near the canyon , areas that were originally left vacant [ because of the precarious conditions ] .
There are 29 rivers in the area of Caracas , and every time it rains heavily the people who live in these areas are at great risk .
Their houses get washed away .
Many people die .
For example in 1999 there was a disaster in which many people were killed .
People want a resolution of this problem .
The other theme is physical security or insecurity .
It is difficult to find a place to meet because people are afraid .
It is a real problem .
But the right - wing opposition and the media has exaggerated the issue , and made it the problem in the barrios .
I think that there are more serious problems .
Security is the issue of the opposition , the press covers it , so there is debate about this problem .
How has the quality of people ’s lives changed since the beginning of the Bolivarian revolution ?
One of the main changes is in the area of education with the missions , Mission Sucre , for example .
Now anyone who wants to go to university can go .
Before only 7 % of the students in the UCV were poor people like me .
And perhaps only 2 % of the students in Simón Bolívar were poor .
Now everybody is studying at night .
In fact , sometimes it is difficult to find a time to meet because everybody is studying !
We can only hold meetings during the weekends .
Another fundamental thing that has changed is that before 1998 , there was no political debate in the barrios .
I was part of a small vanguard that was resisting this , trying to raise political debate in the university .
In the 1980s , it was only the students who would mobilise , come out on the streets .
But now people are talking about politics everywhere , on the bus and in the bars .
It is rare that two people having beers are not talking about politics .
Another important success is that people talk about socialism .
Maybe they do not talk about socialism in a “ scientific ” way , like about what Marx or Lenin said .
But they talk about socialism with familiarity .
There is still some fear , but way less than before .
For example , once we showed a film about socialism in a barrio in the 1980s or 1990s .
People just repeated what they heard from the press , that the socialists will torture you and that all socialists are dictators .
Now people associate socialism with democracy .
Indeed , the very concept of democracy has changed .
If Chávez was assassinated , which is a real possibility because there have been many plans to assassinate him , there would be a civil war .
But no matter what happens , the advance of participatory democracy is irreversible .
We can not go back to representative democracy .
There could be another kind of left , but now the people always have to participate ; participatory democracy is a fundamental part of this revolution .
The people understand the importance of it , demand it , and want to do it .
And they notice the difference in how politics works .
Before the political reality was centered on what happened in Miraflores [ the presidential palace ] .
Now there is a lot of political activity , there are important social movements .
There is possibility , there is hope .
Now people do more than just wait every five years to participate in elections .
We have 7 million people who are militants in the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) .
There are millions of people participating in the communal councils .
This does not mean that everybody has a developed political consciousness or political experience ; it is still a process in transition .
There can be no revolutionary party without revolutionary militants .
And the commitment to forming revolutionaries remains underdeveloped .
There are still problems in the Bolivarian process .
There have been important economic improvements , for example , less unemployment , higher minimum salary , better pensions , but there is still a low level of political consciousness .
People have to be able to handle political and economic theories if we are to advance further , like in Cuba , where the average person on the street has an analysis of what is going on in the country , in the world .
In Cuba there is a high level of political consciousness .
This level of [ revolutionary ] consciousness is still lacking in Venezuela .
It is dangerous for the revolution .
We have come a long way but we can still do more .
What does participatory democracy mean in the comunas ?
There is a saying here that suggests that participatory democracy is not about what we are doing but about how we are going to do it .
It means that we all build together that which we want to do , we decide what we want to contribute , our projects for improving our lives .
Participation has to be for everyone whether they are with the government , against the government , from the left , from the right .
The only one who has authority is the assembly of citizens .
It is the assembly , not an elected group ... no , it is the assembly that decides on the development plan in each comuna .
When there are debates we try to reach a consensus , and if we do n’t , we keep debating .
When there is no agreement we break the issue down bit by bit to reach agreement on smaller parts .
Participation for us is in the formulation of politics ; we also participate in the execution of the project .
For example , a community wants an aqueduct .
The state says , “ Ok .
Here is the money .
Now build it , execute the funds . ”
But we do not participate in the formulation of national policy , not directly .
The policy of the ministers is not decided by a participatory process .
We have said , “ But we should participate ! ”
We participate at the local level , but socialism is not something that happens only at the local level .
We need to weave together a web that brings together the local spaces , the territories and the comunas , because the national and international levels have an impact on what ’s happening at the local level .
We ca n’t just be a socialist comuna , a little island in a sea of capitalism .
After all , who are we going to exchange with ?
There is a Ministry of Popular Power for the Comunas and Social Protection but there are no participatory mechanisms to set its policy .
Right now this is happening with the Indigenous communities .
There is a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs and the communities are participating , they decide .
They have a national council that makes policy .
We have put forward a proposal to have more control over the Ministry for the Comunas , but it has not yet been approved .
There is a lot of resistance .
You have to understand one thing .
The comunas are a space of power .
There are comunas that have executed more resources than some municipal governments .
So , the comunas are constituted spaces of power ; a majority of the comunas are formally part of the PSUV , but often Chavista officials at the local levels do not really want to share power .
Instead , there is a confrontation between the comunas and the Chavista mayors and governors .
Although we all stand with our arms together in the photo with Chávez , in practice there is a real confrontation .
The governors do not understand this dynamic because the governors do not want to lose power .
The governors and mayors think that they are going to build socialism from their municipality , from their leadership .
But we say , if a communal state is not born , socialism will not be possible .
At the moment there is no perfect socialist comuna , where everything is debated , where there is an alternative , socialist , economic plan , where the teachers are also from the comuna , giving classes to the youth .
This might be possible one day , but not now when there is another level of government that is deciding the overall budget .
The project is to connect all these comunas at the national level ; at the moment this is not viable because in most places we do not even participate in deciding the budget of the municipality .
We participate in small projects , and the local government continues independently as if we were not in a socialist transition .
I only know of two isolated cases where this [ participatory budgeting with the involvement of the comuna ] takes place in reality : in the city of Torres in the state of Lara , and in Bolívar city in the state of Falcón .
This is the case because in these municipalities the comrades [ the mayors ] are really from the left .
The majority of the governors are not from the left .
In most cases , the state is a bourgeois state and taking apart this state is the focus of continual conflict .
This is taking a lot of political energy .
The president is aware of these contradictions but I do n’t think that he has found a way to overcome the problem .
It is not simple .
On the one hand you have people who are organized and making proposals and on the other hand people from the same party who are consolidating the bourgeois state .
What is the role of women in the comunas ?
The majority of the people who participate in the comunas are women .
I think that when we are talking about the advances of the process , this is a very important one .
Right now there is a lot of participation by women and the grassroots level .
But it ends there .
When it is time to hold elections for positions with more responsibility , then it is men who are the candidates .
The president has put forward a number of initiatives to counter this tendency , and there have been many advances .
In the party , for example , 50 % of the candidates must be women .
And when you go to the communities , the majority of those who are participating are women , and the majority of people who are studying in the missions are women .
Historically in Venezuela and in Latin America , the societies have been very sexist and it has often been difficult for women to even leave the house .
Before Chávez came to office , women ’s participation was really rare .
Women from the left –- from the vanguard –- have always participated in social and political life .
But now it is more widespread .
I think that in the higher levels of the process , there are a number of valuable women doing incredible things .
There are some things that still need to change .
Like the laws .
For example , if I get pregnant I have six months of rest but my husband does not even get a day .
One of the things that we have asked for is equality on this issue .
I think that we will win on this issue .
Another limitation is that women are responsible for the children in Venezuela .
It is difficult for women to participate , in the communal council , for example , because they have to leave their kids somewhere .
This influences women ’s decisions not to take political positions with more responsibility , especially if the position involves travel .
This is a real barrier , although the level of participation in the communities is really high .
What is the long term vision for promoting participatory democracy from below through the comunas ?
Here I have a different vision from the government .
The vision of the government is that I show up in a community , starting from zero , and within half a week give workshops on politics .
As I mentioned above , the level of political consciousness in Venezuela is still weak .
The process of building political consciousness cannot be instantaneous .
It is not like you can go to a school for a week and get a certificate .
It has to be permanent .
If you have a team constituted by the same people from the communal council raising the consciousness of people in their community , this is the way to create facilitators .
It is a long process to learn about all of the different categories : anarchism , socialism and its various currents .
It takes at least fifteen years .
It is not just theory ; it is also learned in practice .
You learn in practice , but also through reading and reflecting .
It takes a long time to figure out that certain social and political practices belong to socialism , while other ones are capitalist .
Some communal councils have higher levels of political formation than others .
These organisations understand that the communal council is not just a space to receive resources .
They understand that the council is a new “ civil association ” .
It is a political space and a political exercise .
Honestly , the majority of the councils do not understand it this way .
We are still working with the councils to work on the idea that “ hey , we can solve this problem in a capitalist way or a socialist way ” .
We want to solve the problems , but do so in a new way .
But it is difficult when the companies that provide the services , for example , produce the materials for a house , are still capitalist .
Housing is a good example because the problem of housing continues to be serious .
Maybe we are making the blocks , but we have to buy the cement from a capitalist company .
And then hiring the person to lay the blocks ...
It is not just solving the problem , but how we solve the problem ... to build socialism rather than strengthen capitalism .
We have 500 years of colonialism and exploitation , so this is a big challenge , to rebuild all of the socio- economic system .
Building a new state is a big challenge .
For example , in some cases we have increased agricultural production .
But the rice has been sent to a company that processes and packages the rice and sells it back at ten times the price .
It makes me laugh , it does n’t make sense .
We have to take over the plants , take over the companies .
But it is not easy to do .
And the communal councils are not necessarily ready to take on all these tasks .
We find ourselves in a bit of a vicious circle .
The only way to overcome this is to create relations between the communal councils , public institutions and the state .
The councils are in the process of becoming stronger but it will take a lot to move to the next step .
What is the idea over the long term ?
Will the comunas continue to exist alongside the bourgeois state , or will they eventually replace it with new forms of self - governance ?
This question makes me think because the revolutionary process has taken place through many kinds of organisations that got stuck on the path .
The president mentioned once that the nucleus of endogenous development did not function well .
The people often ask , “ What kind of organisation do we need , which is the adequate tool to help bring us what we want ... a comuna , a cooperative ? ”
And I explain what a cooperative is , a company of social property .
The comuna is something else .
We are doing everything to try to make sure that the comuna becomes the main instrument of social change because we are Marxists ... it is the only way to build socialism , from below .
In addition , in Venezuela there are historical experiences with comunas .
This is our original form of organisation .
It is not strange for us .
Of course , because of colonialism all of this changed .
But the original form in “ Our America ” was this one .
This is the political form through which people collectively governed their lives .
We have also seen other forms of socialism that were constructed by the state , like the Soviet Union .
When that state collapsed , everything was destroyed .
So , something happened there .
Did the people really feel like they were a part of this process ?
There were some successes but people did not really feel part of it .
The experience of all the revolutions of the past , in Russia , in Cuba , in the other countries of the global South , show that if the people do not really participate , the bourgeois state simply continues .
Such a conception of socialism is not viable , because the bourgeois state is not of the people .
We are working now to build alternative systems , of solidarity exchange and barter .
The idea is that the comuna also starts to run the community radio stations , the TV stations .
We are discussing how the comunas will be structured .
What will be the relations of forces , which powers will the comunas be in charge of –- judicial , executive , etc .
All that exists now is the assembly for debate .
But authentically socialist comuna does not yet exist ; we are still constructing the comunas .
We are in comuna when we govern ourselves , when we do not need a judge to tell us , “ This house is not yours . ”
Or let ’s say you live in a neighbourhood and you need a letter that proves your place of residence .
You have to go to an institution that says this .
The comuna could do this .
Your neighbor can verify where you live .
Capitalism created a layer of people who are the owners of peoples ' lives .
If you do not have a residence card , there are many things that you ca n’t do .
Why do we need resident cards ?
The bourgeois state has created this class of administrators that we do not need , who pretend they know things .
The popular layers of community at the bottom have to wait until they solve the problems .
But the comuna can do all of these things , decide all of these things .
Before the Spanish came , this is how we lived .
But it is a long process to raise the consciousness of the people so that they can take charge of their lives .
It is also not an “ anarchist thing ” where anyone can do whatever they want .
There are norms of living together that one has to respect .
There are norms that regulate working life that also have to be respected .
People have to respect these laws out of consciousness rather than because there is a law that represses them .
Ultimately , whether President Chávez is here or not , the process depends on the people .
At the moment , the process as a whole is too dependent on the president .
He is seen as the guarantee that this process will go forward , and for this reason the reactionaries want to get rid of him .
If another government replaces Chávez it may no longer be possible to meet politically in the streets .
With the right - wing governments of the past , you only had to have a single book by Marx , Che Guevara , or Fidel Castro , to be persecuted .

Rousseau ’s wish to free the current majority from all restrictions , to dissolve the people into a homogeneous mass , abolish decentralization , and remove representative institutions could not be in sharper contrast to American traditions of constitutionalism , federalism , localism , and representation .
~ Claes G. Ryn , America the Virtuous , p. 73
In his important book , America the Virtuous , Professor Claes Ryn of Catholic University makes the compelling case that Rousseau is the ideological inspiration for the neoconservative movement , which he calls the new Jacobinism .
Rousseau conjectured that some nebulous " general will " of the people was always right , and therefore government should have absolute power over a highly centralized and militarized state , all in the name of promoting if not imposing " democracy . "
It is not at all surprising , then , that another of the neocons ’ American idols is Alexander Hamilton , whom historian Cecelia Kenyon labeled " the Rousseau of the Right " ( Cecelia Kenyon , " Alexander Hamilton , Rousseau of the Right , " Political Science Quarterly , June 1958 , pp. 161—178 ) .
The neocon love affair with " the Rousseau of the Right " was on display recently in a Sunday , April 25 New York Times book review of a new biography of Hamilton ( Alexander Hamilton , by Ron Chernow ) by Times op - ed columnist and house neocon David Brooks .
Brooks is just wild about Hamilton , crediting him with nothing less than " creating capitalism . "
( He also seems gratified that the Chernow book supposedly does a " devastating destruction job on Thomas Jefferson " ) .
Now , Alexander Hamilton can and should be admired for many things .
But the one thing that Brooks says was his " greatest achievement " — his role as Treasury Secretary — should not be .
Hamilton was a mercantilist .
This was the corrupt system of political patronage and special privilege held into place by economic superstition in the Europe of Hamilton ’s day ( and before ) .
As such , he championed protectionism , corporate welfare , central banking , excessive excise and property taxation , and government debt .
Adam Smith ’s Wealth of Nations was a critique and repudiation of mercantilism and a defense of capitalism .
Brooks and Chernow have it all backwards when they write that these policies were capitalistic .
In fact , they were just the opposite .
As Larry Schweikart writes in The Entrepreneurial Adventure : A History of Business in the United States ( p. 63 ) , Hamilton ’s central bank , the Bank of the United States ( BUS ) " brought out the mercantilist Hamilton " and " fit perfectly with the mercantilist view of using business in the service of government . "
( This was also the view of the Italian and German governments during the 1920s and u201830s ) .
The BUS was thankfully disbanded by President Andrew Jackson after several decades of corruption , inflation , and political mischief making .
It did serve , nevertheless , as a precursor of the Fed .
Far from being a champion of capitalism , Hamilton was a champion of economic interventionism .
Historians have long thought of him as " among the most eloquent defenders of state activism in the economy , " writes Schweikart ( p. 61 ) .
Hamilton championed and did more than anyone to create the national debt , arguing successfully that it should be created as a means of taking over the state debts that were incurred to finance the Revolution .
( Brooks praises this has having " bound the states together " and centralized more power in the nation ’s capital ) .
The reason Hamilton gave for the national debt , however , was that making property - owning taxpayers " reliant on the federal government for redemption of the debts they held would generate greater future support for federal taxation and centralization of financial policy .
. . he wanted to make the wealthy dependent on the government so that in the future he could take more of their wealth ! " ( Schweikart , p. 61 ) .
He was a scheming plunderer , in other words , and the public debt was an integral part of his statist scheming .
Hamilton popularized the " infant industry " argument for protectionism , arguing that young industries needed to be protected from competition .
Well , it turns out that industrial infants never grow up .
Hamilton ’s protectionism has only led to the permanent infantilization of industry .
For example , the 1861 Morrill Tariff was vigorously promoted by steel manufacturers and congressmen Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Justin Morrill of Vermont because it " protected " steel from international competition .
In keeping with the Republican Party ’s big - government roots , one of the first things President George W. Bush did upon taking office 140 years later , almost to the day , was to place 50 percent tariffs on steel , which he apparently believed had not yet grown up .
The Hamilton / neocon notion that the national debt is a " blessing " repudiates the thinking of most of the other founders on the issue .
Government debt has always been an underhanded means of disguising the true costs of government to the public by forcing future generations to pay for government spending that benefits only the current population .
It allows politicians to plausibly promise the public something for nothing by deferring the tax bill to future generations of taxpayers .
If you think Hamilton ’s idea of a national debt is a blessing , consider this : according to recent news reports the total U.S. federal debt is $ 7.2 trillion .
In the past year alone , the Hamilton / Lincoln - loving neocon cabal that runs the Bush administration has increased the national debt by $ 700 billion , which equates to almost $ 100,000 for every second of every eight - hour working day according to financial advisor Sean Corrigan .
This is more debt than was run up in the first 200 years after the Declaration of Independence .
Some blessing .
Hamilton did as much as anyone to destroy his own political party , the Federalist Party , with his excessive taxation schemes .
He persuaded Congress to impose the hated Whiskey Tax ( to help pay for the states ’ debts , which the central government had assumed ) , which led to the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania .
The Official View of the Whiskey rebellion used to be that it was a successful example of the putting down of a rebellion or insurrection by George Washington himself , and therefore cemented into place the taxing power of the central government .
But this view is now recognized as fallacious .
In fact , virtually no whiskey taxes were ever collected , and despite Washington ’s show of force , no tax rebels were punished ; all were given amnesty .
Furthermore , the entire episode fueled the anti-tax mentality that was so prevalent during the Revolution , and helped elect Thomas Jefferson president in 1800 .
Jefferson abolished all of the hated federal excise taxes .
( See Murray Rothbard , " The Whiskey Rebellion : A Model for Our Time . " )
Hamilton created another tax rebellion with his national property tax .
This time the rebellion was in Massachusetts .
When some of the tax rebels were imprisoned a man named John Fries organized a march on the courthouse and freed the tax protesters .
Fries was imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged for treason .
President John Adams pardoned him despite the strongest of protests by Hamilton , who was the leading proponent of hanging Fries .
( See Charles Adams , Those Dirty Rotten Taxes : The Tax Revolts that Built America , pp. 70 -72 ) .
Early Americans despised taxation with representation as much as taxation without representation .
Hamilton ’s tax - raising " activism " led directly to the death of the Federalist Party and the success of the Jeffersonians .
David Brooks also credits Hamilton with literally creating " the fluid capital markets that are today the engine of world capitalism . "
Well , not exactly .
As Nathan Rosenberg and L.E. Birdzell , Jr. write in their treatise , How the West Grew Rich : The Economic Transformation of the Industrial World ( p. 220 ) : " The earlier stock exchanges . . . trace their origins to . . . the Amsterdam market , formed at the beginning of the seventeenth century , " though there were also precedents in " Italy , France Spain , the Hanseatic towns , and . . . in German mines at the Leipzig fair as early as the fifteenth century . "
" In London , securities traders formed their own exchange in 1773 .
In New York , systematic trading was conducted on the street ( literally ) , beginning in 1792 . "
Moreover , the large - scale trading of stocks in industrial corporations that Americans think of today was not invented by any one man , even a man as brilliant as Alexander Hamilton , but " traces its origins to trading in the trust certificates issued by the trusts of the 1880s " ( Rosenberg and Birdzell , p. 223 ) .
The hated late nineteenth - century " trusts " invented the large - scale trading of stocks , not " the Rousseau of the Right . "
Such fantasies are typical of the neocons or neo-Jacobins , as Claes Ryn would call them .
They seem unaware of or unwilling to accept the fundamental idea that the civil society is the result of the peaceful efforts of many individuals who collaborate and cooperate for their own mutual benefit .
It is not created by any one Great Central Planner .
" Democracy " cannot be created by political fiat ; the institutions of democracy evolved over many centuries .
The same is true of the institutions of capitalism , as Rosenberg and Birdzell explain in painstaking detail .
David Brooks does hit the nail right on the head with regard to one point that he makes in his New York Times review .
Hamiltonian mercantilism , which he confusingly labels the " activist , pro-market Hamiltonian tradition , " was " later embraced by Henry Clay and the Whig Party , by the early Republicans in the age of Lincoln , and by Theodore Roosevelt - style progressives . "
This of course is one of the main themes of my book , The Real Lincoln : The North ’s victory in the War to Prevent Southern Independence was , among other things , a Triumph of Hamiltonian Mercantilism that led inevitably to so much government corruption that historian Mark W. Summers wrote an entire book about the period entitled The Era of Good Stealings !

The nation 's hope of ending the scourge of spilling oil in the Gulf rests in the hands of a Houston man who must hit a 7 - inch bull 's - eye under a mile of water and more than two miles of rock , using a drill bit not much bigger than his two clenched fists .
John Wright is the lead engineer behind BP 's critical last chance at slaying the monstrous Macondo with a relief well , and the man steadying the scope for the final kill .
Heading up BP 's well intersection team , Wright , 56 , is considered the world 's pre-eminent oil well assassin , a black hat with a peerless record of quietly snuffing out troublesome wells after all other remedies have failed .
With the U.S. offshore oil business , the livelihoods of countless coastal residents and the Gulf of Mexico itself seemingly in the balance , Wright , senior vice president of technology at well control company Boots & Coots , faces the highest - profile and most daunting assignment of his career : intersecting the Macondo and quickly flooding it with mud and cement to stop the torrent of oil .
His margin of error : 3 ½ inches .
" If there is anxiety , it is created by the expectation you have to do it on the first try and the whole world knowing about it , " Wright , who is aboard the Development Driller III rig in the Gulf , told the Houston Chronicle in an e-mail .
" If you make it , you 're a hero .
If you miss , I would expect it to be like missing the winning field goal in the Super Bowl .
Either way , it will be something you will play over and over the rest of your life , " Wright said .
" I got an e-mail this morning telling me that I will be personally responsible for the next move up in the stock market if the intersection and kill is successful on the first try .
Las Vegas will be booking odds next . "
A graduate of Sam Houston High School , Wright got a degree in mechanical engineering and metallurgy at Texas A&M University .
There , he was inspired by a lab professor who told him most published technical papers were rubbish " because they did not properly assess the system uncertainties in the variables upon which they draw their conclusions . "
Wright , in fact , confesses an obsession with uncertainty .
He said it led him to specialize in the vagaries of wellbore hole positions early in his career , experience he is now drawing on to hunt down the Macondo two and a half miles underground .
One of ' only a handful '
Described by friends and colleagues as deeply intelligent , creative , somewhat quiet and even predictable , Wright is among an elite group of highly specialized well intervention engineers , whose high - tech handiwork is little known outside equally small industry circles .
" There are only a handful of people around the world that are experienced and knowledgeable about relief wells , " said Rahn Pitzer , president of New York - based Vector Magnetics , a small relief well technology company currently involved in helping BP identify the exact subterranean coordinates of the Macondo .
Compared to their surface blowout counterparts and the firefighters who square off against epic infernos like the Kuwaiti oil fires of the first Gulf War , a relief well driller 's work is usually unknown to all but the oil field operator in need of his services .
And the work is scarce .
Fewer completed relief wells have been drilled to kill blowouts than the number of space shuttle missions , and a good number of those wells were drilled by Wright , said Jim Woodruff , a veteran relief well engineer and friend of Wright 's who 's drilled more than 20 projects at his side .
Normally , other surface methods of extinguishing a blowout succeed before relief wells drill to their target .
" He 's business .
That 's what he is , " Woodruff said of Wright .
Wright 's reputation , technical acumen and flawless record , backed now by a dream team of drilling experts assembled for the task by BP , make him the odds - on favorite for finally ending the nightmare in the Gulf , industry experts said .
" If I were drilling a relief well , I 'd want John Wright drilling it , " said Colin Leach , a principal with Argonauta Drilling Services , an industry consultant in Houston .
No one says the Macondo is without challenges , and Wright himself has said that despite his prior successes , he always has concerns about the next job .
Still , most colleagues consider him the best , said Gene Beck , an associate professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M : " He definitely is capable of successfully drilling the relief well and killing the blowout . "
And on and on go the accolades .
Perfect record
The votes of confidence rest on a 25 - year track record and work on 83 relief well projects around the world , including the North Sea 's infamous Piper Alpha Platform , which exploded in 1988 and killed 167 men .
Of those projects , Wright personally designed and managed 40 .
Sixteen of them involved blowouts , in places like Brunei and Syria , but also California and Texas .
All of his wells were successful .
He hopes his Macondo work will make it 41 .
" The procedure is similar to playing golf , you keep getting closer with each shot and eventually you putt into the hole .
Obviously the more practice you have the less shots it takes , " Wright said .
Wright started his career in 1979 at Schlumberger , before joining Eastman Christensen , where he managed relief well operations .
In 1986 , he met and befriended Boots Hansen , founding partner of Boots & Coots , while working on a blowout in Venezuela 's Lake Mara­caibo .
Three years later , with Hansen 's encouragement , he struck out on his own with The John Wright Co .
Along the way , he also helped hone the tools and technology for ranging - the process of navigating a relief well drill to its target — and developed sophisticated hydraulic modeling software and new drilling techniques for relief wells .
Boots & Coots took notice , and last year bought Wright 's 20 - person company .
" There is nobody on this planet better at drilling a relief well than that guy , " said Jerry Winchester , CEO at Boots & Coots .
" John had taken that to the next level , and we felt that complemented what we do very well . "
Halliburton said in April it planned to buy Boots & Coots ; the sale is still pending .
Cool head in a hot zone
What distinguishes Wright from other drilling engineers , according to Pitzer , is his ability to integrate the various technologies that usually only come together in a relief well .
Among them : directional drilling , measurement - while - drilling , gyroscopic wellbore surveying , electromagnetic ranging and hydraulic well kill monitoring , planning and mud pumping .
Beyond all that , his solid , unflappable demeanor also comes in handy .
" He 's very analytical , he 's very patient , he 's very focused , " said Pitzer , who has worked closely with Wright over many years .
" He 's also good with handling all the politics involved .
As you can imagine with something like this , personalities can be pretty extreme .
Working with customers that have a well blowing out can be very nerve - wracking and stressful . "

If it were built ( at an estimated cost of $ 400 million ) , 10 MW could pay off its energy debt in 20 years .
Extra juice feeds the municipal grid , and other sources in the area would adjust for the tower 's output .
The building could house offices or residences or both , says designer Robert Ferry , 35 , who helms the Dubai architecture firm Studied Impact with his wife , Elizabeth Monoian .
The pair became interested in energy - generating skyscrapers on moving to the United Arab Emirates , where there are superstructures in spades but few that are any greener than their brochures .
With the 10MW
Tower , they hope to someday create a power plant you can live in .
It may sound fantastic , but , Ferry says , " it 's only a matter of time before something like this is built . "
On the day that President Shimon Peres urged Hamas to abandon terror , to free Gaza from the blockade and put an end to the need for flotillas , it seems now more than ever , these calls fall on deaf ears .
An official from the Palestinian organization , Mahmoud al - Zahar on Sunday urged the Palestinian Authority to instruct its staff to stop pursuing terror organizations and allow them to fire rockets at Israel from the West Bank .
In an interview to Palestinian paper al - Quds , al - Zahar said the Gaza Strip has been liberated , " and the PA 's security apparatus should free our hands .
In order to liberate Jerusalem and the West Bank , rockets must be fired from the West Bank .
Why should this fire come only from the Strip ? "
Al - Zahar said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and their security apparatus are fighting the " resistance " in the West Bank , but stressed , " We will not change our policies even after we win the coming elections .
These are our policies , and we will not waive our rights , even if they continue with the siege .
If we were willing to give up on our rights , I would have been in Washington right now . "
The Hamas official added , " Resistance is the solution , as the international community has given the PA nothing , and Israel does not care about the Arab Peace Initiative . "
He noted that several western and Arab countries have refused to accept the results of the 2006 elections , which were won by Hamas .
" There are Arab countries that accept American legitimization , but not the Palestinian legitimization that was created after the elections we held , which were the most fair in the Arab world . "
Al - Zahar claimed that the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 was meant to prevent a similar takeover by Fatah , " which has already taken over the West Bank with Israel 's help , despite us taking power after the elections . "
Like previous Battlefield games , you can choose from four different classes ,
each having its own pro’s and con’s .
Today ’s Assault guide will lay the ground work for
what you will be doing as a member of the Battlefield 3 Assault class .
The Assault class has been merged with the medic in Battlefield 3 ,
allowing for a player to be just as effective defensively through healing as they are offensively .
The Assault class features droppable medic bags that will heal nearby players ,
as well as the player who dropped the med pack as well .
Also featured are the classic Battlefield series sock paddles , which you can use
to revive fallen team mates .
It is possibly to revive someone over and over again as they die ,
so keep those shock paddles handy , you might just be able to help win a fight by keeping your warriors alive !
The Assaulter can use underbarrel weapons such as grenade launchers ,
which can do incredible damage in very small , tight spaces .
At longer distances , you will want to stick it out with a longer range scope and semi-auto fire modes only .
When playing the medic role , players who are injured have a small + sign above them ,
indicating that they are wounded and possibly near death .
It is up to you to determine whether or not you can risk
the sprint to them to drop a med pack down for them .
If they are lucky , you are right there with them and can keep them alive .
When groups of players are bunched up in a choke point , you can earn mega points and props
from fellow players by constantly dropping med packs into the group of players .
As they are injured , your med packs will constantly be healing them , which means big points for you .
On the topic of extremely long range engagements like those found on Caspian Border ,
you will want the best scope possible for distance shooting , and should fire in single shot only .
Anything above single shots above a few hundred meters will possibly hit the target , but definitely suppress them …
Which is great if you are n’t the only one shooting at them , as you will receive suppression points as a result
of your suppressing fire .
The key to remember as a player using the assault class is that you have the power to keep your team mates alive and well .
Even if they die , you can still bring them back to keep the fight going using
your shock paddles .
Playing as a team player will make you the most popular medic on your team , by far !
Beating Google Caffeine : Detailed Analysis With Better Future Of SMM , SEO And Rankings
It ’s high time to release the article on steps to beat the heat when the most hyped Google project – caffeine – is finally out and live officially .
With this official launch , Google team claims to give the online world 50 % fresher and faster results .
Let ’s start with what Google Caffeine is !
One of Google team ’s member at official Google blog says ,
“ Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index , and it ’s the largest collection of web content we ’ve offered .
Whether it ’s a news story , a blog or a forum post , you can now find links to relevant content much sooner after it is published than was possible ever before . ”
So , the statement openly favours regular updated blogs , social bookmarking sites , and active forums .
Let ’s go in details on who will have favour from Big daddy caffeine ?
1. Regularly updated blogs
Google loved fresh content and frequent updates from always but Google caffeine will now help bloggers earn more with the special favor to the content as soon as they publish .
This fresh content will not only be indexed in seconds to minutes but also will stay in Google ’s fresh database for longer durations if you ’re connected with social media sites .
How to get best out of this favor ?
Bloggers can earn more and more with their blogposts if they get more and more comments to the posts .
It means , the content is getting popularity and as the page is updated with a comment ( few fresh content ) , it stays longer as well as higher in search engine rankings in the niche .
Social bookmarking sites should be used more and more to get popularity , comments and favor to your recently published content making spider crawl your page again and again pushing it to higher rankings .
2. Social Bookmarking websites and portals
These social sites have already achieved huge popularity over last 3 years .
From Digg , reddit to twitter and facebook , Google simply loved them for the real - time user interface and interactive features .
But now they will be 10 times more popular because
a) These are loaded with fresh content and news every minute
b ) These will have more users than before after caffeine launch and open love to actively updated places and sites .
3.Forums
These will be second most popular places after blogs and social sites .
Because people are genuinely active in various forums with specific questions , discussions and topics , there will be more and more inclination to forums now .
One can join forums ’ active discussions or open new , sensible and relevant threads to get valuable links .
Rest be assured that Google will indexes these posts , thus your links , before you imagine .
This will lead to most forum owners to be concerned about quality and changing their policies and rules .
Forums owners will get more business and popularity ; people will get quickly indexed links and easier rankings .
What will happen to the static sites and ecommerce businesses ?
There are millions of people who are running their profitable service or product based business websites on static platform .
Will they lose the rankings ?
Well , many of them already lost it .
Because these are not updated frequently , Google did n’t prefer them for relevant results .
We can assume that keyword density and other factors could be taken as secondary criteria for rankings and freshness with absolute relevancy being the first and foremost now .
Solution to higher rankings for static sites
Such business websites can have an integrated blog like http://www.ABC.com/blog .
These blog updates can be set up on homepage of main website from sidebar to bottom anywhere using codes .
Now , your website is actually getting updated frequently because it is directly connected to a regular updated blog with posts links on homepage .
.
These blog updates can be set up on homepage of main website from sidebar to bottom anywhere using codes .
Now , your website is actually getting updated frequently because it is directly connected to a regular updated blog with posts links on homepage .
Another additional option can be minor changes / additions on website content on regular intervals .
If it is a product based website , make sure you are adding good product descriptions .
Adding widgets and social bookmarking buttons would help them get connected to frequently updated sites and social media .
Some well - thought assumptions about Caffeine , Users and SEO
With more user oriented approach , caffeine targets not only the user retention with fresher , faster and more relevant content but also the surging growth of Mobile searches .
This would ( has already infact ) lead to factors like page load speed dominate the searches .
In short , Google caffeine would prefer quick loading sites and pages .
When Google says , the results are 50 % faster , it means page load time has become extremely important now .
There are no rules as such but 3 - 5 seconds time may be near to standard one .
The site owners and designers can work out quick page loads with server compression and fixing the CSS files as well as javascripts .
Interestingly , flash sites may face some disastrous effects of Google Caffeine with lesser favor in real time search as well as mobile browsing because most of the phones do not support flash except few Android phones .
Backlinks from frequently updated and niche related sites would count more to secure the place in caffeine ’s most fresher and relevant results .
That means , linking to social bookmarking sites , news sites , forums and niche industry blogs will help if you can manage to get links from them as they ’ll have a greater attention from Google ’s spiders .
For SEO and marketing companies , features like diggs , prop up and down at propeller , like and dislike at facebook , reddits will contribute to Google favour for better and stable rankings .
Now in real manner , page relevance , quality and people ’s vote will dominate .
As Google is going to prefer picking up recently published and relevant content , on - site optimization and meta - tags will play equally important roles as off - site optimization .
In other words , there will be 50:50 ratio when it comes to search engine rankings responsibility .
Now when Google says it will prefer fresher content , so can we assume the so called sandbox effect or new site boost effect is no more ?
Whether the site is old or brand new , it ’d be favored by Google as long as it offers relevant , unique , and fresh content .
Because caffeine is real - time search based algo , it ’d favor all new videos , news and media .
Consequently , the pages with fresh content supported with media and video will be preferred ?
Well , I think YES .
Go web 2.0 Go !
Most article directories and similar sites will gain trust from Google caffeine if they add social bookmarking buttons and other widgets that makes them either regularly updated portal or connect them with sites that are regularly updated .
So more user interaction and link popularity .
For link builders , SEO companies and internet marketers , the value of link exchanges and paid links from static pages will be almost zero .
Fresh content based link building methods like contextual blogposts from genuine blogs , unique article marketing , optimized web 2.0 pages will work far better for link popularity and top rankings achievement .
With so many above written points , it ’d be interesting to see the fear of penalties and filters seem to be lifted in Google caffeine .
Because spiders are going to index web faster and deeper , it ’s better to re-structure the sitemaps and navigation to have deeper pages lesser clicks away and at good positions .
It ’s obvious that spiders are not going to waste time on complicated , clumsy sites and pages .
The pagerank will have a substantial impact .
This has already been effect for a while recently .
The new sites with fresh and original content will get a better pagerank without much or no link building .
Even if the site has been favored by certain blog directories and social sites , that would be enough for Google caffeine to recommend the site for a decent pagerank .
This assumption will somehow affect paid links for SEO .
Get text links on hot and preferably top positions of a page with good tag to have more , better and quicker chances of getting indexed .
On Thursday , 40 Senate Republicans and one Democrat ( Ben Nelson , of course ) successfully filibustered a cautious attempt at extending widely agreed - upon tax cuts and necessary unemployment benefits .
This , despite having voted to extend similar tax cuts for years .
What gives ?
What a heartwarming , come - from - behind victory for those plucky Republicans !
Despite being vastly outnumbered by Democrats , GOP senators used a magical power known as " the threat of a filibuster " to prevent the government from taking slightly less money from its citizens in the hopes that those citizens might spend that money on things .
American things !
The " jobs bill , " as it was called ( because literally everything has to have the words " the jobs " in The Jobs D.C. right now ) consisted mostly of deficit - financed benefit extensions , tax cuts , and infusions to state Medicaid accounts .
It would have helped the economy by preventing layoffs and keeping money circulating while people search for employment .
Democrats had reduced its price tag to the relative bargain of $ 30 billion .
And yet , Republicans voted against it — even though they 'd voted for deficit - financed tax cuts and emergency stimulus spending several times in the past .
Now , why would they go and do a thing like that ?
They genuinely do n't want to finance tax cuts with deficit spending , out of principle .
LOL .
LOL .
They are intentionally sabotaging the economy .
This is Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow 's position — that Republicans are venal scum ( go on , I 'm listening ) who want to take out the economy while Democrats are in charge and then lay the blame at the Democrats ' feet .
Devious !

Devious !
It 's not the economy they want to fail , but the government .
Greg Sargent suggests that the GOP really does n't give a shit about the economy — they just want to " prove " that the government sucks at helping people by , uh , specifically causing it to suck at helping people .

They actually have a principled opposition to deficit spending — they just did n't have it till now .
Both Ezra Klein and Jonathan Chait think that Republicans have convinced themselves that deficit spending is bad , despite formerly supporting it , because they see that opposing it could put them back in power .

They have a different definition of the word " fail . "
Former Gawker writer Alex Pareene , now covering the appletini beat for Salon , writes that Republicans " literally do n't give a shit about the poor and unemployed , " and are basically happy with a stratified economic system featuring high structural unemployment .
I like Alex 's theory because it has a curse in it .
So take your pick !
Our Senate is full of craven political assholes , principled idiot assholes , or just plain old assholes .
Either way , millions of people wo n't get their unemployment benefits extended , thousands will be laid off , and the economy will remain as sluggish as before , and probably more so .
But at least we did n't increase the trillion - dollar deficit just to help a few lazies and poors !

BP has been accused by a senior US politician of lying to Congress to reduce its liabilities , after an internal company document showed that the oil giant 's own worst - case assessment of the size of the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico was 20 times its public estimate .
In the document , BP attempts to put a figure on the rate of oil spewing into the ocean .
It notes that if the condition of the well bore deteriorates to the extent that crucial parts fall off , the rate could reach 100,000 barrels a day .
When the company handed the document to Congress , it was claiming the leak was only 5,000 barrels a day , and that at very worst the figure could rise to 60,000 .
The document was circulated by Ed Markey , the Democratic head of the House sub -committee on energy and the environment .
In a statement , he said : " This document raises very troubling questions about what BP knew and when they knew it .
It is clear that , from the beginning , BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill . "
The congressman , who has hounded BP on its handling of the crisis , said on Sunday 's Meet the Press on NBC : " First they said it was 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels , now we are up to 100,000 barrels . "
From the beginning BP had either been lying to limit their liability or were " grossly incompetent " , delaying a " full response to the magnitude of this disaster " .
The document makes clear that the likelihood of the crucial bits of equipment — the blow - out preventer and wellhead — being removed from the well was low .
But the fact that BP itself estimated the worst possible leak in the Gulf at 100,000 barrels a day , in contrast to its own lower public estimates , adds to the growing sense in Washington that the company has not been fully transparent over the scale of the disaster .
The renewed pressure on BP came as US rig operators and other offshore oil services companies prepared to go to court tomorrow to try to overturn President Barack Obama 's moratorium on deepwater drilling .
The companies claim that the ban will result in more economic damage to the region , as rigs and jobs move overseas .
The US government has said that it will not lift the ban until more is known about the causes of the accident , and the industry 's safety procedures are reviewed .
It emerged this month that BP 's disaster response plan was so inadequate that it listed a wildlife expert who had died in 2005 .
It outlined how walruses would be affected by a spill , even though they do not live in the Gulf .
Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron and Shell used the same firm to prepare their disaster plans , which are identical in huge chunks .
US politicians said that the companies were just as unprepared as BP to handle a spill in the Gulf , accusing them of " Xeroxing " their disaster plans .
BP sought to downplay American anger at BP chief executive Tony Hayward going yachting on the Isle of Wight at the weekend .
Photographs of Hayward on board his 52ft yacht , Bob , racing around the Isle of Wight provoked uproar in Washington .
The White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , joked to ABC's This Week that " He 's got his life back , as he would say , " a reference to Hayward 's much lamented comment .
" I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting , " he added .
US media accused Hayward of " turning his back " on the Gulf , reporting that the US BP executive Bob Dudley had taken control of the oil response effort .
Hayward will spend more time running the rest of the BP business in the UK and around the world .
But Hayward will still spend more than half his time in the US and will continue to oversee the effort , according to company sources .
Caller : “ I want to know why my gas bill is so high . ”
Me : “ Okay , well , looking at your account history I can see we have billed you accurate readings which show very high daily consumption .
How many hours is your central heating in use per day ? ”
Caller : “ I never use my heating since my boiler started smelling of gas . ”
Me : “ It sounds like you may have a gas leak in the property .
I need you to call the gas emergency helpline as soon as you finish this call .
Please extinguish any naked flames and try to turn off your electrical appliances if it is safe to do so . ”
Caller : “ Is the leak causing my high bill ? ”
Me : “ How long have you been smelling gas ? ”
Caller : “ About five months . ”
Me : “ Sir , that is a very dangerous amount of time to leave a gas leak unattended .
Why did you not query this earlier ? ”
Caller : “ It did n’t seem important . ”
Me : “ I can not stress enough how important it is for you to call the emergency helpline straight away . ”
Caller : “ Ca n’t we talk about my bill first ? ”

Put your martial arts skills to the test against masses of bloodthirsty enemies in this no-holds - barred action brawler ripped from the pages of the popular manga classic .
A ravaged Earth struggles to survive after a nuclear holocaust has left the world in ruins .
Survivors band together in communities and villages , living off what little resources remain .
In the wastelands beyond , vicious gangs prey on the survivors for their resources , or sometimes merely for sport .
A mysterious martial artist named Ken , a man with seven scars on his chest and the chosen successor of the legendary assassin ’s art Hokuto Shinken ( 北斗神拳 , The Divine Fist of the North Star ) has sworn to protect the weak and innocent from the malicious gangs roaming the scorched planet .
The thing about habits is that for good and bad they require no thinking .
An established habit , whether getting ready for work in the morning or having a whiskey after , is a pattern of behavior we ’ve adopted — we stick to it regardless of whether it made sense when we initially adopted it , and whether it makes sense to continue with it years later .
From a human irrationality perspective this means that something we do “ just once ” can wind up becoming a habit and part of our activities for a longer time than we envisioned .
To get some insight into this process , consider the following experiment :
We asked a large number of people to write the last two digits of their Social Security number at the top of a page , and then asked them to translate their number into dollars ( 79 became $ 79 ) , and to indicate if in general they ’d buy various bottles of wine and computer accessories for that much money .
Then we moved to the main part of the experiment and we let them actually bid on the products in an auction .
After we found the highest bidders , took their money and gave them the products we calculated the relationship between their two digits and how much they were willing to pay for these products .
Lo and behold , what we found is that people who had lower ending Social Security numbers ( for example 32 ) , ended up paying much less than people who had higher ending Social Security numbers ( for example 79 ) .
This is basically the power of our first decisions : if people first consider a low price decision ( would I pay $ 32 for this bottle of 1998 Cote du Rhone ? ) they end up only willing to pay a low amount for it , but if they first consider a high price decision ( would I pay $ 79 for this bottle of 1998 Cote du Rhone ? ) they end up willing to pay a lot more .
So this is the double - edged sword of habits , they can save us time , energy and unpleasant thinking , but on the other hand , it ’s all too easy to start down an unwholesome path .
Now onto “ The 7 Habits Of Highly Ineffective People ” …
1 ) Procrastination .
Joys untold attend this particular bad habit .
And it ’s one people indulge in all the time , exercise , projects at work , calling the family , doing paperwork , and so on .
Each time we face a decision between completing a slightly annoying task now and putting it off for later , battle for self - control ensues .
If we surrender , procrastination wins .
There ’s nothing inherently wrong with delaying unpleasant tasks at work from time to time in order to watch a ( crucial ) football game at the pub with friends .
But , the problem is that as we get close to our deadline we start thinking differently about the whole decision .
As we stay up all night to finish a task on time we start wondering what were we thinking when we succumbed to the temptation of the football game , and why did n’t we start on the task a week earlier .
Moreover , as with all habits one procrastination leads to another and soon we get used to watching deadlines as they zoom by .
2 ) The planning fallacy .
This is more or less what it sounds like ; it ’s our tendency to vastly underestimate the amount of time we ’ll require to complete a task .
This hardly needs illustration , but for the sake of clarity , recall the last time you delegated time to a complex task .
Cleaning your flat from top to bottom ( could n’t take more than two hours right ?
Wrong . ) ; finishing the paper or project at hand ( who knew the people in department X could be so impossibly slow ? ) .
The problem is that even if we try to plan for delays , we ca n’t imagine them all .
What if the person you ’re working out a deal with gets hospitalized ?
What if an important document gets deleted or lost ?
There are infinite possible delays ( procrastination of course being one of them ) , and because there are so many , we end up not taking them into account .
3 ) Texting while driving .
Let me start by saying that in my class of 200 Master ’s students , 197 admitted not only to doing this regularly , but also to having made driving mistakes while doing so .
Also , one of the three abstainers in the class was physically blind , so we should not really count him as a saint , and who knows maybe the other two were liars .
Texting while driving is clearly very stupid .
If we were not intimately familiar with our own Texting behavior , we might think that it ’s insane to think that anyone would knowingly increase their chances of dying 10 fold rather than waiting a few minutes to check email , but this is the reality .
Moreover , the issue here is not just Texting , it is much more general than this particular bad habit .
The basic issue has to do with succumbing to short - term desires and foregoing long - term benefits .
Across many areas in our life , when temptation strikes we very often succumb to it ( think about your commitment to always wearing a condom when you are not aroused and when you are ) .
And we do this over and over and over .
4 ) Checking email too much .
If it seems that there ’s too much about email on this list , I assure you , there is n’t .
Checking email is addictive in the same way gambling is .
You see , years back the famous psychologist B.F. Skinner discovered that rats would work much harder if the rewards were unpredictable ( rather than a treat every 5 times they pressed a bar , one would come after 4 , then 13 , etc ) .
This is the same as email , most of it is junk , but every so often , it ’s fantastic : an email from the woman you ’ve been chasing for instance .
So we distract ourselves from work by constantly checking and checking and waiting to hit the email jackpot .
And to be perfectly honest , I ’ve checked my email at least 30 times since starting writing this article .
5 ) Relativity in salary .
The fatter a sea lion is , the more sea lionesses he has in his harem .
He does n’t need to be immense , just slightly bigger than the others ( too fat and he wo n’t make it out of the water ) .
As it turns out , it ’s the same for salaries ; we do n’t figure out how much we need to be satisfied , we just want to make more than the people around us .
More than our co-workers , more than our neighbors , and more than our wife ’s sister ’s husband .
The first sad thing about our desire to compare is that our happiness depends less on us , and more on the people around us .
The second sad thing is that we often make decisions that make it harder for us to be happy with our comparisons :
Would you prefer to get a 50,000 pound salary where salaries range from 40,000 - 50,000 or a 55,000 pound salary where they ’re between 55,000 - 65,000 ?
If you ’re like almost everyone , you ’d realize that you would be happier with the 50,000 pound salary , but you would pick the 55,000 .
6 ) Overoptimism .
Everyone , except for the very depressed , overestimates their chances when it comes to good things like getting a raise , not getting a divorce , parking illegally without getting a ticket .
It ’s natural — no one gets married thinking “ I am so going to be divorced in 4 years ” , and yet a large number of people end up getting divorced .
Like other bad habits , overoptimism is not all bad .
It helps us take risks like opening a business ( even though the vast majority fail ) or working to develop new medicines ( which take many years and usually do n’t pan out ) .
Ironically overoptimism often tends to work out well for society ( new restaurants , cures for disease ) while endangering the individuals who take them ( financial ruin , stress - induced insanity ) .
Sadly we are often overoptimistic – my most recent example of this was just a few hours ago when I sat down to write an essay entitled : “ The 7 Habits Of Highly Ineffective People . ”
If I only did n’t go out last night …..

Here 's a timely one for you trivia buffs : What Hockey Hall of Famer won Cups for both the Flyers and the Blackhawks ?
Answer below .
Come to think of it , the answer to my admittedly trick question is above , in the title .
" Mr. Goalie " , Glenn Hall , led the Edmonton Flyers to two President 's Cups ( Western Hockey League champions ) in the mid-50s , before graduating to the NHL where he won the Stanley Cup with the 1960 - 61 Chicago Blackhawks .
His is a great story well worth telling .
Let 's start right here in Edmonton , where Hall starred for three years .
Those Flyers were the top farm club of the reigning NHL dynasty Detroit Red Wings , and were quite a powerhouse in their own right .
Glenn
Hall was a prime example of a talented player choked in the pipeline , held down by the presence of Terry Sawchuk on the parent club .
In those days of the six - team league and the one - goalie system , getting a starting gig in the bigs was hella tough .
Glenn
Hall played with some pretty famous hockey names in this city , especially on that awesome 1954 - 55 squad which duplicated the parent Red Wings by winning the Double , copping both regular season and playoff titles in their respective leagues .
So a Double Double for the organization , an exceedingly rare feat matched ( actually , doubled ! ) by the 1975 - 77 Montreal Canadiens / Nova Scotia Voyageurs .
If you 're old enough to remember how that organization loomed like a colossus over the game , it 's not much of a stretch to see the 1955 Red Wings / Flyers in a similar light .
The funny part is that the graduates of that Edmonton team probably did more for the Philadelphia Flyers than they did for the Red Wings .
And for the Blackhawks , as we shall see .
By then Glenn Hall was 23 , a First Team All - Star , and probably too good for his league .
Among his young teammates were fellow Hall of Famers Norm Ullman and John Bucyk .
In fact the latter was getting his first go - round on a line with Bronco Horvath and Vic Stasiuk , later renowned as Boston 's Uke Line .
( Kinda figures they 're all from around here . )
It appeared that the Wings were locked and loaded for several more years of dominance .
But the winds of change were blowing that year of my birth , 1955 .
Philadelphia
Flyers fans of a certain age will recognize up to five of the names on the , ahem , original Flyers , especially player - coach Bud Poile , whose own story is fascinating .
In a sentence , Poile was a high - level hockey vagabond for six decades , played for five of the Original Six , spent several years as a player coach in various minor leagues including both the Oilers ( Tulsa ) and Edmonton ( the Flyers , where he enjoyed his greatest success ) , morphed to full - time coach , became the first GM of the PFlyers , later oversaw the expansionist Vancouver Canucks before winding up his career in the upper echelons of the league offices of the World Hockey Association , the Central League , and finally the International League , ultimately getting elected to the HHoF as a builder .
[ deep breath ] .
Oh yeah , along the way he found time to father and presumably mentor David Poile , the current GM of the Nashville Predators that gave Chicago the most trouble of any 2010 playoff opponent to date .
Among the defencemen on the team was Keith Allen , who in 1967 would be Poile 's first choice as PFlyers coach , and who would later succeed Poile as the team 's GM , a post he would hold for a decade and a half .
Allen would be the mastermind of the Broad Street Bullies and win two Stanley Cups in Philadelphia .
Allen too is a member of the HHoF in the builder 's category .
Stasiuk would also serve a term as Philly coach , before being replaced by Fred Shero .
Defender Larry Zeidel was an original Philly Flyer a dozen years later who became notorious for his stick fight with Eddie Shack , an incident that started the Flyers on the road to perdition .
Young forward Gerry Melnyk never played in Philly but became perhaps the highest - regarded scout in the game , as the former Flyer scoured western Canadian bushes for future Flyers , famously Bobby Clarke who plays a major role in the Philly organization to this day .
There are Edmonton - Edmonton connections as well .
The club also included the first ever coach of the Edmonton Alberta Oilers , Ray Kinasewich , as well as the Oilers ' own future superscout in Lorne Davis .
Norm Ullman would bookend his own Hall of Fame career as a member of the WHA Oilers , devoid of speed but a masterful thinker of the game .
Yet a sixth member of the 1955 Flyers who is in the Hall , Al Arbour would go on to win three Stanley Cups as a player and four more as a coach , the last of them against Edmonton .
This was a minor league team in name only , stacked to the gills as it was with talent , experience , and smarts .
" If there ever was a good reason for NHL expansion , that Edmonton team was it . " -- Max McNab , 1954 - 55 WHL MVP with the New Westminster Royals , from The Fabulous Flyers by James Vantour
Unbelievably , " Trader " Jack Adams wound up squandering nearly all of that talent , much to the delight of his many mortal enemies as well as hockey fans in Chicago and Boston .
Who did Jack have but Harry Lumley ,
no slouch in anyone 's eyes , and then that other kid
they 'd signed on a whim , what 's - his - name Hall
he'd have to dump the pond hockey stance
but he was quick and called you sir .
Another pussycat , you 'd have to think .
* * * I do n't need her clock to know the time .
I shift the arm again , but can't shake something
someone said last night --
" Hey that kid out there
in Edmonton , that gaping hole between his legs ,
but man , he 's got the corners covered .
Ukey Ukey watch your ass . " -- excerpts from Night Work : The Sawchuk Poems by Randall Maggs
Adams ' first move was to make room for Hall , who had impressed during two cups of coffee ( 8 GP , 6 - 1 - 1 , 1.50 ) when he had been called up from the Flyers to fill in for an injured Terry Sawchuk .
Adams decided he was ready , so traded off his perennial All - Star Sawchuk to the Bruins in a multi-player deal that also saw the departure of Stasiuk and Davis and returned little of note .
Stasiuk scored 120 goals over the next five seasons , seventh in the NHL over that period and more than any Red Wing other than Gordie Howe ; Adams essentially admitted his mistake (s ) years later when he made separate , costly deals to retrieve Sawchuk ( for Bucyk ) and Stasiuk for the Red Wings .
Meanwhile , in an unrelated bad trade that dreadful summer of ' 55 , Adams was gifting Horvath to the New York Rangers , and he too would score over 100 goals the next five years ... none of them for Detroit .
Hall was ensconced as Detroit 's new # 1 in that fall of ' 55 , charged with replacing the man widely considered by observers of the day the greatest of his time if not all time .
Glenn answered the bell in a big way , playing all 70 games , leading the league in shutouts with 12 , winning the Calder Trophy , and being named to the second All - Star team .
Still , the season ended in failure as Detroit fell out of first place for the first time in eight years , then lost the Stanley Cup Finals to the same Montreal Canadiens squad that Sawchuk had bested in Game Seven in the two previous years .
I honestly do n't think Hall or Sawchuk or Hasek for that matter could have made the difference -- this was The Changing Of The Guard -- but Hall 's timing was lousy .
Glenn did n't dump the " pond hockey stance " but used it to great effect .
His innovative inverted - V ( or simply " V " ) style with his legs splayed to either post made him an early pioneer of the butterfly style of goaltending that dominates modern hockey .
Shooters did n't know quite what to make of it when he broke in , and never seemed to solve the problem thereafter .
Hall was as good as he was unorthodox .
One thing Hall was n't , though , was a pussycat .
After his great rookie season , he had to fight tooth and nail to get a measly $ 500 raise from his NHL - minimum $ 7500 rookie contract .
Told by Adams not to tell anybody about the raise , Hall reportedly shot back with a classic rejoinder : " Do n't worry , Mr. Adams , I wo n't .
I 'm ashamed of it too . "
Adams , a negotiating bully accustomed to having his way on contractual matters , had already alienated yet another of his star players , and the relationship proceeded south from there .
Hall had a strong sophomore year with the Wings , leading them back to first place while being promoted to the first All - Star team .
But the Wings crashed and burned in a 5 - game first round upset by Stasiuk and the Bruins , and just like that Adams had , I suspect , seen enough of Glenn Hall 's five - hole , not to mention Glenn Hall 's pie-hole .
An impatient man even when winning , Adams pulled the plug on two extremely bad trades that cost the Red Wings two former Edmonton Flyers and future Hall of Famers .
First he retrieved Sawchuk from Boston at the very high cost of Johnny Bucyk , which triggered the swap of Glenn Hall to Chicago along with Ted Lindsay for not very much .
This was a vindictive trade to punish Lindsay for his involvement in the first players ' association .
Adams could have punished him a lot worse by not including an all - star goalie in the package , especially one that extracted a return that could charitably be described as minimal .
An awful , awful trade .
Two awful trades .
Bucyk , Hall , both gone .
" I can suggest a couple reasons why I was traded .
Number one is they did n't think I could play well enough to be good over the long haul .
The other is that you should never tell your general manager to go fuck himself . " --
Hall , from Glenn Hall : The Man They Call Mr. Goalie by Tom Adrahtas
It was n't an awful trade from Chicago 's standpoint , that 's for sure .
The Hawks were perennial cellar dwellers when Hall arrived , having finished in last place 4 seasons in a row and 7 out of 8 .
In Hall 's first year in Chicago , the Blackhawks shaved their GA by a third of a goal a game , went from 16 wins to 24 , and stepped up to 5th place .
Traded from a powerhouse to a doormat , Hall never missed a beat on his new team and was once again named to the first All - Star team .
Of course Chicago had other good things happening , as Bobby Hull , Stan Mikita and Pierre Pilote were also blossoming into stars .
By the next year the Hawks were in the playoffs where they became a fixture for the next decade , most of which featured Glenn Hall between the pipes .
Indeed ,
Hall was a fixture in his own right , setting one of the most remarkable endurance records in the history of team sports .
For more than seven seasons from the start of his career , Hall never missed a single minute of action ( besides goalie pulls I suppose , which are n't recorded ) .
He passed Georges Vezina 's old record of 328 straight games midway in his 5th season and just carried on to 500 and beyond .
The streak finally came to an end early in game # 503 , ironically because he tweaked his back putting his gear on before the game rather than through anything that happened on the ice .
The guy was bare - faced the whole time , but never once got knocked out of a game , let alone the next game .
By this time Hall was popularly known in Chicago as " Mr. Goalie " , in fact the Chicago Stadium public address announcer introduced him as such every game .
At one point Clarence Campbell decided to crack down on that practice , and the standing joke of the day was that the PA dude did n't actually know Hall 's real name and would wind up guessing wrong in front of 16,666 increasingly rabid fans .
Mr. Goalie was ( and remains ) famous for one other quirk , his practice of puking before every single game .
He attributed it to a fear of bad performance and considered it a strength that he was able to bring himself to such an edge before each and every performance .
Somehow it focused him for the task at hand .
Did I mention that Hall was a goalie ?
Hall celebrates his cup with Chicago .
Hall 's greatest moments in Chicago would come in the spring of 1961 .
This was his sixth year in the league , and in his time no team but the Montreal Canadiens had won the Cup .
After ruining his rookie season in Detroit , Jacques Plante and the Habs knocked Hall 's Hawks out in the semis in both 1959 and 1960 .
When they again met in 1961 the team had matured while the Montreal dynasty was showing signs of age .
The Hawks prevailed over the first place Habs in six hard - fought games , with Hall recording back - to - back shutouts in Games Five and Six to finally smite the dragon .
After five consecutive Cup wins and ten ( 10 ! ) straight trips to the Finals , the mighty Canadiens had finally been toppled .
Detroit had pulled a similar upset over Toronto in the other series , so like this year 's Flyers in the conference finals , the Hawks found themselves as one of two surprise survivors , starting at home against a weaker opponent that they might have expected .
With both Canadian teams out of the running for the first time in over a decade , it was a rare opportunity for an American - based squad to finish the job .
If Hall needed any further incentive , the chance to beat Jack Adams surely did the trick .
The Hawks won the series in six games , with Hall allowing just 12 goals in the process .
The last game , a 5 - 1 blowout of the Wings right in the Detroit Olympia , had to be a sweet , sweet moment .
Four seasons after he was sent to the NHL 's dumping grounds , Glenn Hall had led the Blackhawks from the proverbial outhouse to penthouse .
Jack Adams , meanwhile , was still on the outside looking in .
The next season the Hawks repeated their semi-final upset of the Canadiens , with Hall pitching another shutout in the clinching sixth game .
This time , however , the rising power that was the Toronto Maple Leafs awaited , and the Leafs were able to defeat the defending champs in a spirited six - game series .
The Stanley Cup headed back north of the border where it would remain for the next eight seasons .
Chicago , it turned out , was one and done .
I started following hockey the next season , and the Hawks were always an exciting group to watch with their cast of All - Stars and their somewhat suspect team play .
As a young wannabe netminder I was particularly fascinated by their charismatic goaltender with his unique V style , his capacity for making spectacular emergency saves , and by the sheer concentration that marked his unmasked features in times of high tension .
Hall 's face was ( with exceptions ) not directly involved in making the stop , but was every bit as fascinating to watch as that of a great musician focusing on his craft .
It 's an aspect that the modern game sorely misses , even as the concept of bare - faced goaltenders and bare - headed players seems both quaint and absurd .
Some of the humanity of the game is almost beyond reach .
The Hawks were a perennial contender that somehow fired blanks in the playoffs , winning just one series in the five pre-expansion postseasons from 1963 - 67 , making it to the Finals in ' 65 before losing in seven games to the Habs .
In the 1966 - 67 season they finally broke through and won the Prince of Wales Trophy for finishing first overall , in the process breaking the 40 - year - old Curse of Muldoon .
But the playoffs brought more disappointment and failure , with a six - game first - round ouster at the hands of Terry Sawchuk and the Maple Leafs .
And with that Hall 's career in Chicago was done .
While he and Denis DeJordy had shared the Vezina Trophy ( best GAA in those days ) in that last season , at the expansion draft Chicago decided to protect the younger man .
Hall was immediately snapped up by the St. Louis Blues , perhaps the key move that gave the Blues the edge among the six incoming teams .
( Hiring Scotty Bowman as coach early in their first season was another . )
Now 36 , Mr. Goalie promply showed how much game he had left by carrying the Blues through the Western Division playoffs .
Hall kicked off the first series with a 1 - 0 win in the Philadelphia Spectrum over Bernie Parent and the first - place Flyers , then sealed that series by winning another goaltender 's duel on Philly ice in Game Seven .
Another tense seven - game series against the Minnesota North Stars followed , with the Blues finally prevailing 2 - 1 in double overtime to become the first expansion team in the Stanley Cup Finals .
Across the hockey world there was mortal dread that the newcomers would be slaughtered by the old guard , represented ( natch ! ) by the Montreal Canadiens .
Instead ,
Hall 's brilliant display of netminding became the story of a series which Montreal ultimately swept but in four one - goal games , two of which needed overtime .
It was remarkably compelling hockey with a number of interesting storylines woven through it , but Hall generated the headlines and ultimately the Conn Smythe Trophy , presumably for saving his team and his league from the embarrassment many of us had feared .
" Well we won the Cup in late May [ 1973 ] and my son was born on the 28th of June , a month that was an exciting time for our family .
First Stanley Cup as a coach ... we kidded around , and we named him Stanley Glenn , actually after Glenn Hall , our goalie in St. Louis , when I was there for the first four years of the Blues .
I owe an awful lot of my coaching career to Glenn Hall , he was a fantastic goalie and a fantastic person , in fact he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as people can recall in the ' 68 playoffs .
We never won a game in the Finals but he made it a series for us , he was just a wonderful goalie . " -- Scotty Bowman , on the naming of his son Stan , GM of today 's Chicago Blackhawks ( TSN interview , May 31 )
Aww , is n't that sweet ?
Scotty Bowman is sentimental , who knew ?
Glenn Hall receives the Edmonton Flyers team MVP award , 1955 .
In 1968 - 69 , Hall 's old adversary Jacques Plante emerged from a three - year retirement to join the Blues .
The pair of galtending greats enjoyed a fabulous renaissance season together , sharing a Vezina Trophy and leading the Blues to a Western Division title .
Plante led the league in GAA , while Hall , still the apple of the media 's eye , was named to the first All - Star team for the seventh time , still a record for a goalie .
In all it was his 11th All - Star selection over the then - 14 year span of his remarkable career .
Perhaps not so coincidentally , Hall finally donned a mask early in that first season with Plante .
Not too happily , judging from his first game wearing the facial protection : beaten on the first shot , Mr. Goalie got ejected 2 minutes into the first period for beaking off the referee .
Surely the only game of his career with a .000 Sv % !
Somewhat ironically , Plante came in to finish up the game in the same building ( MSG ) where he himself had pioneered the modern goalie mask nine Novembers earlier , beating the Rangers by the same 3 - 1 score in both .
An interesting detail from the linked summary is that the Blues actually used 3 netminders in this one , a rarely - seen but legal wrinkle back in the day .
Gives an idea as to Bowman 's advanced thinking on the management of his aging goalies :
Plante relaxing in the press box while Robbie Irons caddies on the bench with no expectation of going in , but when the unexpected happens , Plante quickly dresses and takes over .
A further sidenote is those 3 NHL minutes were all Robbie Irons ever got in a 14 - year professional career - sandwiched between two of the all - time greats of his position .
Hall and Plante led the Blues back to the SCF in each of 1969 and 1970 , but were swept in each case by the Canadiens , then the Bruins .
Both series were much less interesting than 1968 ; the gap between the established and expansionist clubs seemed to be growing if anything .
Hall 's last moment in the spotlight occurred when he was posterized by Bobby Orr in the high - flying goal that won the 1970 Cup in overtime .
This time it would be Hall 's old Edmonton Flyers teammate , Johnny Bucyk , receiving the Cup as the Bruins venerated captain .
Bucyk would win a second Cup two years later , while Hall only ever got the one despite seven trips to the Finals .
Meanwhile , Norm Ullman , the only EFlyer who delivered much of value to the Red Wings , never got a sniff of the chalice .
What an opportunity wasted by Jack Adams .
After years of ( pick one ) threatening to retire / harvesting the crops / negotiating long distance / painting the barn / avoiding training camp , Hall finally did hang up the pads in 1971 , the year I moved back to Edmonton .
While I never got to see him in a live game , I did meet the man at an Edmonton Minor Hockey Association coaching clinic just a couple years later .
Even the experienced coaches seemed in awe of the man with the famous face , and this 16 - year - old wannabe assistant coach probably resembled a tongue - tied tot on Christmas Eve .
But it took Glenn
Hall about 45 seconds to put all of us completely at ease .
A real gentleman , but no pussycat .
Boy , did he have a couple of good stories .
* * *
Glenn
Hall 's legacy as one of the greatest ever to don the pads is secure .
I hesitate to compare him or anyone across eras , but it 's instructive to comp him with two of his contemporaries from the Golden Age of Goaltending , Jacques Plante and Terry Sawchuk .
Hall Plante Sawchuk GP 906 837 971 GAA 2.49 2.38 2.51 Pts % 0.545 0.615 0.562 Playoff GP 115 112 106 Playoff GAA 2.78 2.14 2.54 Playoff Win % 0.430 0.664 0.529 Stanley Cup 1 6 4 Conn Smythe 1 0 0 Hart 0 1 0 Vezina 3 7 4 Calder 1 0 1 First All - Star 7 3 3 Second All - Star 4 4 4 THN Top 100 rank 16 13 9
You can practically throw a blanket over all three of them .
The experts of the day , primarily hockey writers , saw fit to award Hall with 16 individual honours , Plante 15 , Sawchuk 12 .
Hall might have a slight edge in longevity and consistency , although it 's close .
On the other hand , his performance in the playoffs is the least impressive of the three , with just the one Cup and a significant drop - off in personal stats .
All of which is deeply entangled in team effects of course , Hall never got to roll with a dynasty quite like the other two did , and I deeply doubt that is on him personally .
The Hawks were missing a key element , and great goaltending was n't it .
Let 's jam out and just say all three of them are the greatest goalies of the greatest goaltending era in history , each well worth writing about !
Of them all , Glenn Hall 's story has the happiest ending , a full life and a retirement to a place he loves .
He kept a foot in the game , and would win one last Stanley Cup while serving as goaltending coach of the Calgary Flames in 1989 .
Now 78 , Hall is rooting for the Hawks to end the 49 - year drought .
In his own unique way , of course .
One of the most powerful lobbying groups , Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) , announced on Tuesday that Business Roundtable President John Castellani will become the group ’s new leader .
Castellani joins PhRMA , which represents the country ’s leading pharmaceutical research and biotechnology companies , after nine years as the president and chief executive officer of the Business Roundtable , an association of CEOs from the top American corporations .
According to a Center for Responsive Politics review of campaign finance records , Castellani has given $ 60,000 to federal candidates , parties and committees since 1994 .
His wife ,
Therese , whose occupation is listed as retired in recent filings , has given an additional $ 5,500 .
Overall , 84 percent of their campaign contributions have benefited Republicans .
This election cycle , the Castellanis have contributed $ 18,900 to federal candidates , parties and committees .
Just $ 1,000 of that went to a Democrat — Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , one of the most conservative members of the Democratic caucus .
Throwing his weight into the 2010 midterm elections , Castellani has donated $ 2,000 to Republican candidate Carly Fiorina , who is challenging incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) and $ 2,400 to former Bush Cabinet official and former Rep. Rob Portman ( R- Ohio. ) , who is running for an open Senate seat .
Castellani has also given $ 1,000 a piece to Rep. Michael Castle ( R - Del. ) and New Hampshire ’s Republican Attorney General Kelly Ayotte , who are both running for open Senate seats .
Their top beneficiaries over the years have been Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , to whom the Castellanis have given $ 4,500 since 2007 , and House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , to whom they ’ve given the same amount since 2001 .
In 2006 , Castellani donated $ 1,000 to the Republican National Committee .
That same year , he donated $ 1,000 to the failed Senate campaign of Michael Steele , now the chairman of the RNC .
Castellani ’s first known campaign contribution was $ 350 to the failed Senate bid of Ronna Romney , the sister - in - law of former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
During the 2008 presidential campaign , the Castellanis gave $ 3,300 in support of Romney ’s bid .
Castellani also contributed $ 1,000 to Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , the ultimate GOP nominee .
After joining the Business Roundtable in 2001 , the Castellanis rapidly increased their political contributions .
Castellani contributed only $ 2,000 to federal candidates , parties and committees during the 2002 election cycle .
By the 2004 election cycle , that amount had nearly doubled to $ 10,000 — with both of the Castellanis giving $ 2,000 in support of President George W. Bush ’s reelection efforts .
By the 2008 election cycle , that amount had doubled again , to $ 20,850 , the Center found .
At PhRMA , Castellani will succeed Billy Tauzin , the notable Louisiana Democrat - turned - Republican congressman - turned - lobbyist .
Tauzin led PhRMA for five years , and he famously cut a multi-billion dollar deal with President Barack Obama that helped pave the way for Obama ’s ambitious health care overhaul , to the chagrin of some corporations .
In Febuary , the New York Times suggested that Tauzin was leaving PhRMA “ amid complaints from drug makers that he bargained away their profits too cheaply , spent too much in his $ 150 million advertising campaign to sell the overhaul and miscalculated in his assessment that the passage of the legislation was all but inevitable . ”
Obama and congressional Democrats ultimately prevailed in passing their health insurance reform legislation , but public opinion significantly soured on the plan and Republicans across the country have proposed scaling it back or repealing it completely .
Under Castellani , the Business Roundtable was the second biggest business association lobbying the federal government for years — behind only the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The Financial Times has called the Business Roundtable “ the most influential chief executive lobbying group in the United States . ”
In 2009 , the Business Round table spent more than $ 13.4 million dollars on lobbying expenditures , and it spent more than $ 2.3 million on lobbying in the first three months of 2010 .
PhRMA itself spent more than $ 26 million lobbying federal officials and lawmakers in 2009 .
The trade group is showing no signs of slowing either — spending more than $ 7 million in the first three months of 2010 .
Furthermore , in the first quarter of 2010 , PhRMA ’s PAC has contributed more than $ 89,000 to federal candidates .
Castellani is viewed inside PhRMA as an apolitical pick who is lauded for navigating the Business Roundtable through the healthcare reform debates while building strong ties on both sides of the aisle , without alienating either party , Politico reports .
PhRMA stressed a similar message in their praise of Castellani .
“ His experience in coalition building and strong reputation of working across the political divide set him apart , ” David Brennan , president of drug company AstraZeneca and the head of PhRMA ’s search committee said in a press release .
“ He will contribute mightily to our mission in a time of dynamic change . ”

The Roth IRA vs traditional IRA – they ’re basically the same plan , right ?
Not exactly .
While they do share some similarities , there are enough distinct differences between the two where they can just as easily qualify as completely separate and distinct retirement plans .
To clear up the confusion between the two , let ’s look at where Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs are similar , and where they ’re different .
Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA – Where They ’re Similar
Roth IRA vs traditional IRA – they ’re similar only in the most basic ways .
This is what often leads to confusion between the two plans , and even a lack of awareness of the very specific benefits of each .
Plan Eligibility
Virtually anyone can contribute to an IRA , Roth or traditional .
The most basic requirement is that you have earned income .
Earned income is from salary and wages , contract work , or self - employment .
Unearned income – such as interest and dividends , pensions and Social Security , capital gains and rental income – are not eligible income sources .
Even minors can make contributions to either a Roth or traditional IRA .
Though they ca n’t legally own an account , an IRA can be set up as a custodial account .
The account is in the name of the minor but is technically owned and managed by a parent or guardian .
Upon reaching the age of majority – 18 or 21 , depending on your state – ownership of the account transfers to the minor .
Either plan is an excellent choice , particularly if you are not covered by an employer - sponsored retirement plan .
It ’s also the most basic type of retirement plan , which makes it very easy to open and manage .
In the normal course , you do n’t even need to file any additional tax or reporting documents with the IRS .
There is one relatively minor difference between Roth IRA vs traditional IRA .
When you reach age 70 ½ you are no longer eligible to make contributions to a traditional IRA , even if you have earned income .
You can however continue contributing to a Roth IRA , virtually for the rest of your working life .
With both IRAs , the IRS has announced some 2020 changes that could benefit you .
Contribution Limits
The two plans have identical contribution limits .
For 2020 , IRS regulations allow you to make an annual contribution of $ 6,000 .
If you are age 50 or older , there is a “ catch - up contribution ” of $ 1,000 per year , in which case your total contribution will be $ 7,000 per year .
There ’s a secondary contribution limit that does n’t apply to most taxpayers .
However , it could affect high income taxpayers who are covered by an employer plan .
The maximum contribution to all retirement plans in 2020 is $ 57,000 , and $ 63,500 if you are 50 or older .
That includes contributions to an employer - sponsored 401( k ) , 403 ( b ) , 457 plan , or the federal government TSP plan .
It also includes contributions made to self - employment plans , such as a Solo 401 ( k ) , or a SEP or SIMPLE IRA .
The combination of your contributions – including employer matching contributions – to any of these plans , including an IRA , cannot exceed these thresholds .
If you ’re participating in either an employer - sponsored plan or a self - employment plan , with contributions totaling $ 54,000 , your IRA contribution will be limited to $ 3,000 ( $ 57,000 less $ 54,000 ) .
If your total contributions reach $ 57,000 to the other plans , you wo n’t be able to make an IRA contribution at all .
Tax - deferral of Investment Earnings
Both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA enable your funds to accumulate investment income on a tax - deferred basis .
This is a powerful investment advantage since it enables you to invest without regard for tax consequences .
It means you get the full benefit of investment earnings , and the extra compounding they provide .
Even if your contributions are not tax - deductible , the investment income earned will still be tax - deferred .
This is the kind of advantage that can result in a 10 % return on investment in an IRA account , compared to say , 7.5 % in a taxable account ( assuming a 25 % tax rate ) .
Now if you ’re already familiar with how a Roth IRA works , you ’re probably thinking he ’s wrong , Roth IRA investment income is n’t tax - deferred , it ’s tax - free – he ’s wrong !
That ’s partially true , and we ’ll get to that in a little bit .
But technically speaking , Roth IRA investment earnings are also only tax - deferred .
You must be at least 59 ½ years old , and have been in the plan for at least five years to be able to withdraw investment earnings tax - free .
If you withdraw money sooner , investment income will be fully taxable .
So yeah , Roth IRA investment income is also tax - deferred , at least during the accumulation phase .
Investment Options
This is one of the biggest advantages to IRA plans , both Roth and traditional .
As the owner of an IRA account , you ’re free to invest anyway you like .
You can choose the trustee , which can include any of the following :
Banks
Investment brokers
Mutual fund companies
Professionally managed accounts
Robo-advisors
In fact , just about anywhere that you can invest money , you can set up an IRA account .
For example , peer - to - peer lending platforms , like Lending Club and Prosper , allow IRA accounts .
You can invest in personal loans through an IRA by doing this .
Within many of these accounts , you also have nearly unlimited investment options .
This includes stocks , bonds , mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , futures and options , commodities , government securities and real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) .
The IRS has a very short list of prohibited IRA investments .
Those include :
Artwork ,
Rugs ,
Antiques ,
Metals – with exceptions for certain kinds of bullion ,
Gems ,
Stamps ,
Coins – ( but there are exceptions for certain coins ) ,
Alcoholic beverages , and
Certain other tangible personal property .
Virtually everything else is fair game !
And it makes no difference if it ’s a Roth or traditional IRA .
Early Withdrawal Rules – Basically the Same
This is where the comparison between the Roth IRA vs traditional IRA gets a bit technical .
Both plans provide for eligible withdrawals beginning at age 59 ½.
If you take withdrawals sooner , they ’ll be subject to ordinary income tax in the year of withdrawal , plus a 10 % early withdrawal penalty tax .
Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA difference :
There ’s an exception here with the Roth IRA .
Income tax and the penalty will only apply to the amount of investment earnings withdrawn before turning 59 ½.
The contributions themselves will not be taxable , nor will they be subject to a penalty .
There are exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty , but not ordinary income tax .
Even if an early withdrawal qualifies for an exception , you will still have to pay ordinary income tax on the amount of the withdrawal .
Only the penalty is waived .
The IRS has a list of exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty .
Two of the more common exceptions are qualified education expenses , and up to $ 10,000 toward a first - time home purchase .
Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA – Where They ’re Different
So far , we ’ve covered how the Roth IRA and traditional IRA are similar .
Now let ’s move on to where they ’re different .
And in many cases – very different !
Tax Deductibility of Contributions
We do n’t need to spend a lot of time on this one .
The difference here simple :
Contributions to a traditional IRA are usually deductible .
Contributions to a Roth IRA are never deductible .
The one wrinkle in a simple formula is the word usually with the traditional IRA .
Contributions are fully deductible if neither you nor your spouse are covered by an employer - sponsored retirement plan .
But if one or both are , then the contributions are either non-deductible , or only partially deductible .
Which leads nicely into the next difference …
Income Limits for Contributions
The IRS has income limits , beyond which you are not eligible to make a Roth IRA contribution at all .
The income limits for 2020 for Roth IRA contributions are as follows , and based on adjusted gross income ( AGI ) :
Married filing jointly , permitted to $ 196,000 , phased out to $ 206,000 , then no contribution permitted .
Married filing separately , phased out to $ 10,000 , then no contribution permitted .
Single , head of household , or married filing separately and you did not live with your spouse at any time during the year , permitted to $ 124,000 , phased out to $ 139,000 , then no contribution permitted .
The income limits for traditional IRAs are loosely similar , but work very differently .
There are two sets of income limits .
The first applies if you are covered by a retirement plan at work .
It ’s based on modified adjusted gross income , or MAGI .
It looks like this for 2020 :
Single or head of household , fully deductible up to $ 65,000 , partially deductible to $ 75,000 , then no deduction permitted .
Married filing jointly or qualifying widower , fully deductible up to $ 104,000 , partially deductible to $ 124,000 , then no deduction permitted .
Married filing separately , partially deductible up to $ 10,000 , then no deduction permitted .
There ’s a second set of income limits , also based on MAGI , if you are not covered by an employer plan , but your spouse is :
Married filing jointly , fully deductible up to $ 196,000 , phased out up to $ 206,000 , then no deduction permitted .
Married filing separately , partial deduction up to $ 10,000 , then no deduction permitted .
If you exceed the income limits , you can still make a non-deductible traditional IRA contribution .
No contribution is permitted for a Roth IRA if you exceed the income limits .
Taxability of Non-deductible Contributions
Roth IRA contributions are not tax - deductible , so withdrawals are not taxable .
This works neatly within IRS ordering rules .
This applies specifically to Roth IRAs , and it enables you to make withdrawals based on the following priority :
IRA participant contributions Taxable conversions Non-taxable conversions Investment earnings
This means the first withdrawals made from a Roth IRA are considered contributions and are therefore not taxable upon withdrawal .
It works like this …
You have $ 50,000 in a Roth IRA account .
$ 30,000 are your contributions .
The remaining $ 20,000 is accumulated investment earnings .
You need to withdraw $ 15,000 , and you ’re under 59 ½.
Under IRS ordering rules , there will be no tax or penalties on the withdrawal .
The withdrawal amount is considered to be a return of your contributions – and not tax deductible when made – and not subject to tax .
This arrangement is unique to the Roth IRA .
No other retirement plan withdrawals , including traditional IRAs , have the same arrangement .
If you have a traditional IRA that includes non-deductible contributions , you can withdraw those funds without paying income tax on the distribution .
However , the withdrawal will be subject to IRS Pro pro-rata rules .
It works like this …
You have $ 50,000 in a traditional IRA .
It includes $ 30,000 in contributions , of which $ 5,000 were made with non-deductible funds .
( The balance is tax - deferred investment income . ) .
You withdraw $ 5,000 from your plan .
Under IRS pro-rata rules , 90 % is subject to tax and penalty .
Here ’s why : the $ 5,000 non-deductible portion is 10 % of your total plan .
According to the IRS , only 10 % of your withdrawal is non-deductible , and the remaining 90 % is fully taxable .
That means that out of the $ 5,000 you withdraw , $ 500 ( 10 % of $ 5,000 ) will not be subject to tax .
The remaining $ 4,500 will be fully taxable .
Taxability of Withdrawals
Here ’s where we get to the part about Roth IRAs that everybody loves best , including me !
Withdrawals taken from a Roth IRA are completely tax - free , as long as you are at least 59 ½ , and have been in the plan for at least five years .
This is the tax - free magic of the Roth IRA , and its biggest single advantage .
The situation is very different with traditional IRA withdrawals , which are fully tax - deferred , but not tax - free .
The only exception is the withdrawal of non-deductible contributions , which are subject to the IRS pro-rata rules discussed above .
Everything else – your tax - deductible contributions , and your accumulated investment earnings – are fully taxable upon withdrawal .
To give the simplest example possible , if you are 59 ½ , and have had a Roth IRA account for at least five years , you can withdraw $ 20,000 from the plan , and not have to pay a penny in income tax .
Under the same scenario , if you withdraw $ 20,000 from a traditional IRA , the entire amount must be included in your taxable income for the year of withdrawal ( except the pro rata percentage made up of non-deductible contributions ) .
For most people , especially those with mature IRAs , that will be incredibly small .
Required Minimum Distribution ( RMD ) Rules – Definitely Different
This is another fairly simple topic in the Roth IRA vs traditional IRA analysis .
Required minimum distributions ( RMDs ) are a technique by which the IRS forces tax - deferred retirement money out of your plan , and onto your income tax return .
They are mandatory on all retirement accounts , including traditional IRAs , beginning when you turn 70 ½.
Except for the Roth IRA .
Because distributions from a Roth IRA are not taxable , they are not subject to RMDs .
This is a big advantage because it allows you to continue accumulating money in the plan , virtually throughout your life .
You may do this either to keep yourself from outliving your money , or to leave a larger estate for your children .
Another big advantage : you ’re not forced to increase your taxable earnings with required distributions .
You can leave the money in the Roth , and let it continue to build up tax - free .
RMDs are based on your remaining life expectancy at each age .
Roughly speaking , about 4 % of your retirement plans will need to be distributed when you turn 70 ½.
The percentage will increase slightly each subsequent year , due to the fact that your life expectancy will be reduced going forward .
This is a consideration with traditional IRAs , but not with a Roth IRA .
Rollovers and Conversions
You can move funds into or out of Roth or traditional IRAs .
For example , you can move funds from a 401 ( k ) to either a traditional or Roth IRA .
With a traditional IRA , this is a rollover .
Generally speaking , it ’s a transfer of funds between two retirement accounts that have equal tax treatment .
Funds moved from a 401 ( k ) to a traditional IRA is a transfer between two tax - deferred accounts .
The transfer can take place without tax consequences , which is why it ’s a rollover .
You can similarly do a rollover from one Roth IRA account to another .
But if you ’re moving money from any other retirement plan , it ’s a transfer of funds from plans that have unequal tax treatment .
Except in the case of a Roth 401 ( k ) , Roth 403 ( b ) , or Roth 457 , you are moving funds from a tax - deferred plan , to what will ultimately be a tax - free plan .
This has tax consequences .
Roth IRA Conversion Example
Moving funds from a traditional IRA or a 401 ( k ) plan to a Roth IRA is referred to as a conversion because the rollover involves converting the funds from tax - deferred to tax - free .
In order to make the transfer , the funds coming out of a tax - deferred plan will be subject to ordinary income tax in the year of conversion .
Let ’s say you move $ 100,000 from a 401 ( k ) plan into a Roth IRA .
The 401 ( k ) is entirely tax - deductible contributions and accumulated investment earnings .
If you move the entire balance to the Roth IRA in the same year , then you will have to include $ 100,000 in your taxable income .
If you are in the 25 % tax bracket , this will result in a federal income tax of $ 25,000 .
Once the funds have been converted , and the taxes paid , it will be a Roth IRA .
Once you are in the plan for at least five years , and you are at least 59 ½ , you can begin taking tax - free withdrawals .
That last sentence describes why Roth IRA conversions are so popular , despite the immediate tax consequences .
You are exchanging a tax liability now , for tax - free income in retirement .
It ’s what makes Roth IRAs perhaps the best retirement plan available .
Final Thoughts on the Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA
So there you have it , two plans with similar names , but very little else in common .
Generally speaking , traditional IRAs are preferred if you are currently in a high tax bracket , and expect to be in a much lower one in retirement .
You ’re getting the benefit of tax deferral at a high tax rate now , in exchange for a lower rate on distributions in retirement .
The Roth IRA is preferred if you do n’t expect your tax bracket in retirement to be much lower than it is right now .
You ’re giving up tax deductibility now , in exchange for a tax - free income later .
Both plans have their virtues , but I ’ll bet on the Roth IRA in most cases !
An award - winning lawyer and activist has been jailed for three years in Syria , human rights groups say .
Mohannad al - Hassani , head of the Syrian Organisation for Human Rights , was tried for spreading false information and " weakening national morale " .
He was arrested in July last year after being repeatedly summoned by the security police for questioning .
Hassani has defended a number of pro-democracy activists and campaigned for the repeal of the law used to jail him .
In May he won the Martin Ennals Award , named after the first head of Amnesty International , for his work in defending Syrian political prisoners and the rule of law .
Crackdown
The Damascus Criminal Court sentenced Hassani , 44 , to three years in prison after convicting him of " weakening national morale " and " conveying within Syria false news that could debilitate the morale of the nation " .
That term is often used against those who challenge the Syrian government .
The Syrian Human Rights League ( SHRL ) expressed grave concern over Hassani 's sentencing , saying " none of the minimum conditions and criteria for a fair trial " were met .
The organisation called for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Syria .
Arrests of pro-democracy activists are common in Syria , where several prominent political activists and writers remain imprisoned .
The rhythmic electric fields generated by the brain during deep sleep and other periods of intensely coordinated neural activity could amplify and synchronize actions along the same neural networks that initially created those fields , according to a new study .
The finding indicates that the brain 's electric fields are not just passive by - products of neural activity — they might provide feedback that regulates how the brain functions , especially during deep , or slow - wave , sleep .
Although similar ideas have been considered for decades , this is the first direct evidence that the electric fields generated by the cerebral cortex change the behavior of the neurons that engender them .
" I think this is a very exciting new discovery , " says Ole Paulsen , a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the recent study .
" We knew that weak electric fields can impact brain activity , but what no one had really tested before was whether electric fields produced by the brain itself can influence its own activity . "
The brain is an intricate network of individual nerve cells , or neurons , that use electrical and chemical signals to communicate with one another .
Every time an electrical impulse , or action potential , races down the branch of a neuron , a tiny electric field surrounds that cell .
" A few neurons are like individuals talking to each other and having small conversations , " explains David McCormick , a neurobiologist at Yale University and co-author of the study published online July 15 in Neuron .
" But when they all fire in unison , it 's like the roar of a crowd at a sports game . "
That " roar " is the summation of all the tiny electric fields created by organized neural activity in the brain — it 's what scientists record using electroencephalography ( EEG ) , when they place a net of electrodes on a person 's scalp .
" The question going into the study , " McCormick says , " was whether electric fields generated by synchronous activity in the brain were passive consequences of that neural activity or somehow actively involved in regulating that activity . "
Investigating this question in the brain of a living animal would be ideal , but raises both ethical dilemmas and experimental difficulties because researchers need to do more than just record electrical activity in the brain — they need to manipulate it .
Instead , McCormick and colleagues created an experimental model that mimicked what might happen in the intact brain of a living animal .
First , the researchers suspended a slice of brain tissue from the visual cortex of a ferret in artificial cerebrospinal fluid .
The living cortical tissue behaved as though the ferret brain were in slow - wave ( non–rapid eye movement ) , sleep , during which the brain produces sluggish but highly synchronous waves of electrical activity .
The team 's next step was to find out what would happen to the neural activity in the brain slice when it was subjected to a weak electric field .
They surrounded the cortical sample with an electric field that approximated the size and polarity of the fields produced by an intact ferret brain during slow - wave sleep to create an exaggerated version of the exact feedback loop they were investigating .
Essentially , they enveloped the brain slice in an echo of itself .
When the team applied this electric field echo , they found it amplified and synchronized the neural activity in the brain slice .
The field did n't create disorder — it increased harmony .
The " roar " of the brain slice became louder and more regular .
" It ’s kind of like if you were cheering at a football game and someone played over the speaker the sound of the crowd cheering and you started responding to that , too , cheering along with both the real crowd and the speaker playback , " McCormick explains .
" It 's a kind of reinforcing feedback . "
Not only did the researchers show that this positive feedback facilitated the synchronous slow waves of electrical activity in the slice of ferret brain , they also showed that an electric field of the same strength , but opposite polarity , disrupted its synchronous neural activity .
In other words , they showed that they could break the amplifying feedback loop with negative feedback .
" Adding a positive feedback loop on top of what the slice produces itself increased synchronization , " Paulsen explains , " but the clever bit was to demonstrate that negative feedback reduces synchronization .
To me , it 's the negative feedback experiment that is important here , and that really demonstrates that the endogenous [ internally generated ] fields are contributing to the synchronization . "
The new study faces a couple methodological imperfections :
First , the simple and uniform electric field created by electrodes in the laboratory does not perfectly mimic the complexity of electric fields generated by a living brain .
Second , the experimental model relied on an incredibly thin slice of neural tissue — hardly the same as an intact brain .
Paulsen says these flaws are unlikely to change the general conclusions of the study , however , because the underlying mechanisms of electrical activity remain consistent enough between the lab model and a living organism .
Because the brain produces especially large electric fields during highly synchronized neural activity , like that of slow - wave sleep , the researchers suspect the feedback loop they discovered could coordinate such phases of deep sleep — which are thought to bolster memory consolidation .
" During slow - wave sleep , all your neurons march in order .
The whole cortex takes part in this activity and the electric field feedback might help keep the neurons synchronized , " McCormick says .
" I think this is really going to change how people view the brain 's electric fields . "
Right now , though , researchers can only speculate as to the exact role of this feedback loop in everyday brain function , says Joseph Francis , a physiologist at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center who has studied similar feedback in the hippocampus of a rat .
" Originally , when I was doing my thesis work , what I wanted to know was whether one part of the brain could interact with another without physical contact , " Francis explains .
" What this new study shows is that it 's possible for electric fields to have an influence on the neural activity itself without direct contact .
But now we need to determine how much it has to do with normal functioning . "
Super ethanol is on its way
The next generation of this biomass fuel could be cheaper , more plentiful and arriving sooner than you think .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) � Cellulosic ethanol , the biofuel that differs from corn - based ethanol in that it can be made from pretty much any organic matter , has made an impression among people who matter .
Alan Greenspan , the revered former chairman of the Federal Reserve with a big distaste for irrational exuberance , recently sang its praises before a Congressional hearing on energy security .
Greenspan said cellulosic ethanol is the only alternative energy source that could be produced in enough volume to make a dent in gas usage .
" You 'll get an awful lot of investments [ into this technology ] coming in , especially if the numbers make sense , which I think they do , " he said .
And last month Goldman Sachs ( Charts ) , the world 's largest investment bank , poured $ 27 million into Iogen , a Canadian - based biotech specializing in ethanol made from cellulose .
It used to be thought that this fuel , which some argue has the potential to replace more than two thirds of all gasoline used in the U.S. , was decades away from commercial viability .
But high gas prices , a touch of technical innovation , and a healthy dose of capital may move that date up .
" There are a lot of people who think the technology is there , " and could be competitive even if oil prices return to $ 30 a barrel , said Greg Bohannon , a managing partner at Greenrock Capital , a California - based private equity fund that focuses on renewable energy .
" Why would Goldman Sachs invest in a company that 's not going to be commercially viable for 10 years ? "
Chances are , they did n't .
Beyond corn
Most ethanol currently produced in the U.S. is made from corn kernels .
Its benefits have been well documented in the press , especially since gasoline prices reached a record average of $ 3.06 a gallon last September , and have n't fallen much since .
Ethanol is clean burning .
It 's renewable .
And it costs about a dollar a gallon to produce .
Existing cars can run on 10 percent ethanol with no modifications , and they 'd need only about $ 100 worth of tinkering to be 85 percent ethanol powered .
And , perhaps most importantly , it 's domestically produced .
But there are a few major problems with corn - based ethanol .
First , it takes a lot of energy to make it .
According to the Department of Energy , most studies put the ratio as low as 1:1.4 - meaning that for every one unit of energy spent , only 1.4 units of ethanol energy are created .
Indeed , there are some camps who believe producing corn - based ethanol actually results in a net loss of energy .
Second , an expensive infrastructure would need to be built if people started using mostly ethanol in their vehicles , since ethanol is water soluble and the existing pipelines and filling station equipment for gasoline are not completely water tight .
Third , there 's not enough corn available .
John Ashworth , a biomass expert at the Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory , said corn could only supply about 12 to 18 billion gallons of ethanol a year , or about 10 percent of the nation 's 140 billion gallon - a - year gasoline habit .
After that , ethanol would start to run up the price of corn , raising the cost of everything from eggs to Coca Cola .
Of course the same problem would emerge with ethanol made with sugarcane or soy or any other food crop .
Wood chips to the rescue
Cellulosic ethanol has all the advantages of corn - based ethanol - there is no difference in the ethanol , only in the way it 's produced .
But unlike corn - based ethanol , cellulosic ethanol can be made from a variety of things that might otherwise be considered waste � sewage sludge , switchgrass , plant stalks , trees � virtually anything that contains carbon .
Ashworth said there are an estimated one billion tons of such material available in the U.S. every year , enough for 100 billion gallons of ethanol .
While it 's not feasible to actually go out and collect every ounce of that one billion tons , he said it 's not unreasonable to expect ethanol to replace 40 billion gallons of gasoline in the near future .
" There 's a lot of venture capitol out there that 's willing to invest in cellulosic ethanol , " he said .
" You 're likely to see some plants built in the next 12 to 18 months . "
Entrepreneurs are in fact pressing ahead with ambitious plans .
" We know the technology is proven , " said Jim Stewart , a spokesman for Bioengineering Resources Inc. , or BRI , an Arkansas - based biofuel outfit .
" It 's at the point of commercialization . "
Stewart said BRI uses a patented bacterial culture to transform organic matter into ethanol , and can produce a gallon of it at a fourth the retail cost of a gallon of gas .
He said the company plans to have 4 plants operating commercially within the next 16 to 18 months , but some industry - watchers believe it will be at least several years before cellulosic ethanol production will become commercially viable .
Vancouver - based Syntec Biofuel uses a different process to make ethanol .
It turns the organic matter into gas and then moves the gas over a metal catalyst , which then turns it into liquid fuel .
But the end result is the same .
Syntec hopes to have a full - scale plant up and running in three years , then plans to make most of its money by selling the plant 's design to outside producers .
Company spokesman Jeff Eltom touted the efficiency of Syntec 's process , saying it plans to get 10 units of energy out of every one unit they put in .
" We 're not going to totally replace gasoline , " said Eltom .
" But we can take a big chunk out of what we import and become more energy efficient . "

Eltom 's comment reflects the conventional wisdom in the alternative energy field :
As the shift is made from fossil fuels to other options , it wo n't be any one single thing that meets the world 's energy needs , but rather a mix of sources that will do so .
Still , not everyone believes cellulose ethanol will be part of that mix in the near term .
When the U.S. Energy Information Administration released its long term world energy outlook earlier this week , it projected a surge in U.S. oil consumption over the next 25 years , mostly due to transportation needs .
The agency said it does take new technologies into account when making its predictions , but that it believes cellulose ethanol is still too expensive to compete in the market place with corn ethanol and gasoline .
" It would take a breakthrough in the costs , " said Andy Kydes , a forecaster at EIA .
" It could happen , and we have hopes for it , but right now it 's not on our radar . "
Kydes did , however , ask for the names and phone numbers of the companies mentioned in this story , saying the agency would " look into it . "
