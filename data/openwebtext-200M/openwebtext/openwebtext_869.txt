Ian Talty ’s passion was photography , and he seldom was without his camera .
“ He ’d even take it to Cub Foods , ” said his wife , Nicole Talty .
“ He was that guy . ”
On Sunday , the 30 - year - old from Woodbury died while on his weekly photo hike after rainwater poured through a tunnel along the Mississippi River in St. Paul .
Talty and a friend had been exploring and photographing the tunnel just south of the Marshall Avenue bridge when a thunderstorm erupted , filled the structure with rainwater and swept the men into the river .
His friend , Nick Breid , 29 , of Richfield , was able to make it to shore on his own .
At 10:19 a.m. , emergency crews were called and a rescue effort ensued .
A St. Paul police officer and two University of St. Thomas students from a rowing club were eventually able to bring Talty to shore .
The St. Thomas rowers happened to be across the river with boats because they were taking apart an old dock , according to St. Paul Fire Marshal Steve Zaccard .
Talty was pulled from the water , and CPR was administered .
He was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center , where he later died .
Friends and family members will remember Talty as someone who died doing what he loved .
“ He knew some of the places he went were dangerous , but at the same time , he felt amazing going to those places , ” Nicole Talty said .
“ He had been ( to the tunnel ) before .
He knew what could happen . ”
While Talty photographed a variety of subjects , including nature , he was particularly fond of graffiti .
He would often go in search of works of graffiti all over the cities , said a friend , Jacob Brown , of St. Paul , who sometimes accompanied him .
Talty hoped eventually to become a professional photographer .
Things started moving closer to that dream a few weeks ago when he was accepted to show his works at a gallery for the first time .
He and his wife had spent the past few weeks choosing photographs and picture frames for the exhibit .
In addition to his passion for photography , Talty will be remembered as a loyal friend and husband whose love was unconditional .
“ The kind of bond that we had was the kind that everyone wants , ” Nicole Talty said .
“ I just wish it could last longer . ”
Talty is survived by his wife ; stepson Cody Fox ; parents Bill and Christine Talty , of Minneapolis ; and sister Alayna Talty , of New York .

Yesterday I had dinner with my girlfriend at ( shooby dooby doo , down to ) Ruby ’s inside a local mall .
But before she met me there , I waited for her at the mall ’s Arcade , Tilt .
Right as I walked in , I was greeted by an interesting DDR / Beatmania - ish looking arcade cabinet .
Upon further inspection , I knew this was a game that anyone would instantly enjoy .
Why has n’t anyone thought of this before ?
A multi -touch screen rhythm game .
Now , hear me out .
Imagine Elite Beat Agents , on crack .
Instead of using a stylus on a Nintendo DS , you are using your fingers to play .
Also , just like Elite Beat Agents or Tap Tap Revolution , the object of the game is to stay on beat when hitting the “ notes ” across the screen .
A vertical bar goes across the top half or bottom half of the screen .
Once the bar get to one of the “ notes ” , you tap it .
Thats it .
But there are different types of notes .
For more info , photos and videos , go past the break .
[ youtube ] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q_cYXy0YrQ[/youtube]
> regular single tap notes
> notes that you must drag your finger along the given path
> notes that you must tap mutiple times
Now , if that was n’t hard enough , do n’t forget , it ’s MULTI - TOUCH .
So there will be times where one hand has to do one thing , while the other does something else .
This is a great use of multi - touch technology and I can’t wait to play again .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Under pressure from the Treasury Department , insurance giant AIG plans to scale back bonuses and compensation for some of its top- earning employees .
AIG has agreed to restructure bonus payments to its employees .
CNN obtained a letter Saturday from AIG Chairman and CEO Edward Liddy to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , in which Liddy pledges in the letter to reduce 2009 bonus payments , which AIG refers to as " retention payments , " by at least 30 percent .
Liddy also addresses steps to limit compensation in AIG Financial Products , the London - based unit responsible for issuing the risky credit default swaps , which on several occasions has brought the company to the brink of collapse .
In the letter , Liddy says the unit 's 25 highest - paid contract employees will reduce their salaries to $ 1 this year and all other officers in the unit will reduce their salaries by 10 percent .
Other " non-cash compensation " will be reduced or eliminated .
Liddy , who took the helm of the company in September after it had nearly failed , also refers to a conversation he had with Geithner last week , which the AIG chief describes as " a difficult one for me . "
Liddy says in the letter that he personally does not receive a bonus , but that some bonus payments are unavoidable , because they are binding legal obligations of the company , and " there are serious legal , as well as business consequences for not paying . "
Some of the bonus payments are due on Sunday , according to the letter .
Do n't Miss CNN / Money : Congress wants AIG answers
At the meeting Wednesday , Geithner told Liddy that millions of dollars in bonuses to senior employees were unacceptable and needed to be renegotiated , according to a senior administration official .
While the bonuses were never a secret , the official told CNN , Geithner felt giving them " was still inappropriate , given the state of the economy and the recent restructuring of the AIG agreement . "
AIG received at least $ 170 billion in federal bailout money .
Watch how declining economy affects insurance companies »
Liddy , however , makes clear that he made the changes with trepidation , saying in the letter : " I would not be doing my job if I did not directly advise you of my grave concern about the long - term consequences of the actions we are taking today , " specifying that if employees believe the company will have trouble attracting and retaining " the best and the brightest ... if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury . "
The company , which lost a record $ 62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 , has more than 74 million insurance policies issued in 130 countries around the world .

Red Cross demands halt to artillery fire after at least nine people killed
The shelling of a Sri Lankan hospital has refocused attention on the continued heavy fighting and growing humanitarian crisis gripping the country .
At least nine people died and 20 were injured when several artillery shells struck the hospital in Puthukkudiyiruppu .
The International Committee of the Red Cross demanded that both sides stop the shelling , and stated that " wounded and sick people , medical personnel and medical facilities are all protected by international humanitarian law .
Under no circumstance may they be directly attacked . "
The Sri Lankan military is trying to force the Tamil Tigers into an ever smaller patch of the north - east , leading to intense and bloody fighting and fears of a rising civilian death toll .
Analysts believe it could be the last stand of the rebels .
Western media are banned from the war zone and the government is pressurising news organisations , claiming their reporting has been too sympathetic to the rebels .
The website Tamilnet , which claims to report the Tamil point of view , says the targeting of the hospital was deliberate .
Some see Tamilnet as being close to the Tamil Tigers , who have fought a civil war with the Sri Lankan government since 1983 .
Tamilnet says the attack " was a premeditated massacre as the military was given instructions by the … defence secretary , Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , to isolate hospitals from civilian access by artillery barrage " .
Tamilnet also claims that government bombers attacked civilian refugees on Sunday in Moongkilaa 'ru , using " cluster munitions fitted to artillery shells in its indiscriminate barrage on civilian refuges " .
The website claims 13 civilian bodies were recovered in a " completely burned state , beyond identification " .
The Sri Lankan army website celebrates what it claims is the capture of a rebel training camp and haul of weapons which it says is the biggest ever .
The site says the army " captured a Black Tiger camp complex in the east of Visuamadu Saturday " , by troops " who struck a devastating blow to Tigers leaving no room for the terrorists to remove even their fellow dead bodies and sophisticated weapons " .
The army website lists the details of the arms haul : " Nine mortar launchers of five different caliber of 120 mm , 81 mm , 82 mm , 80 mm and 60 mm , six Multi Purpose Machine Guns ( MPMG ) , two thermo baric launchers , twenty pistols , three Rocket Propeller Guns ( RPG ) , seven claymore mines , one improvised claymore mine , eighteen T - 56 weapons , one sniper gun , eight Rocket Propeller Gun ( RPG ) rounds , fifty - nine hand grenades , one tripod , thirty - five Arul - type bombs , one hundred detonators , one radio set , thirty - five gas masks , forty - eight helmets , thirty - five pouches , a large stock of new LTTE uniforms and twelve LTTE dead bodies were found from inside of the camp complex . "
With the noose tightening around the Tamil Tigers , the official Sri Lankan government website reports the president 's call for the " terrorists " , as he calls them , to surrender or " face grave danger of being captured by the government armed forces " .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa's demand was made to a weekend rally , and the government website says that liberating the north from " the cruel grip of terrorism and creating of an environment where all committees could live without fear and suspicion was his foremost responsibility and obligation " .

Buckingham Palace , the main residence of British sovereigns for almost 175 years , leaks so much energy it could be a sieve .
That 's the upshot of news reports from London detailing results of an energy survey of 170 buildings .
Thermal imaging of the 775 - room palace showed heat flowing from closed , curtained windows , pouring from the roof and streaming through cracks in the walls , according to the Telegraph , the Daily Express and other news organizations .
Buckingham Palace
Renewable energy firm Navitron helped conduct the survey that also found St. James ' Palace — which is adjacent to Clarence House , the official London residence of the Prince of Wales — to be another energy offender .
It took 12th place on a list of the dozen least green buildings , according to the Telegraph .
Other energy inefficient buildings include the Department of Environment , which took second place , the Treasury , the Ministry of Defence and Portcullis House , which opened in 2001 and contains the offices for about a third of the Members of Parliament .
The Daily Express reported that the Home Office and the headquarters of MI6 are also on the list .
Then on Thursday , the Daily Mail weighed in with the entire roster of the " Dirty Dozen " as the stir over the energy survey and its results continued :
1. Buckingham Palace
2. DECC ( Defra ) [ The Department of Energy and Climate Change ( Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ) ]
3. Ministry of Defence
4. Horse Guards Barracks
5. Shell Building
6. Home Office
7. Houses of Parliament
8. Treasury
9. Portcullis House
10 . MI6 HQ
11 . Albert Hall
12 . St James ' Palace
The HSBC Tower complex at Canary Wharf was named the most energy efficient building surveyed .
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation tower block in Canary Wharf was named the most energy efficient building , according to news reports .
Balmoral , the royal family 's retreat in Scotland , is to become the first energy self - sufficient property among the royal estates .
However at Buckingham Palace , where the queen is said to have established an energy saving committee , energy bills tallied some 2.2 millions pounds ( an estimated $ 3 million ) in 2008 .
Reports of the survey emerged as Prince Charles traveled in South America to advance environmental advocacy .
He scheduled to make a major speech on climate change in Brazil on Thursday .
Australia 's biggest river is running so low that Adelaide , the country 's fifth - largest city , could run out of water in the next two years .
The Murray river is part of a network of waterways that irrigates the south - eastern corner of Australia , but after six years of severe drought , the worst dry spell ever , its slow moving waters are now almost stagnant .
Water levels in the Murray in the first three months of this year were the lowest on record and the government agency that administers the river , the Murray - Darling Basin Authority ( MDBA ) , said the next three months could be just as grim .
With meteorologists predicting another year of below - average rainfall , the MDBA , is bracing for worse to come .
" We do need to ensure that we have a range of secure water sources for Adelaide and other towns along the Murray , " agency head , Rob Freeman said .
But the MDBA faces an uphill battle , as the drought has drained water supplies across the south - eastern corner of Australia .
The Murray - Darling basin named after the two biggest rivers that join to form the south - eastern catchment area now holds just 18 % of its water capacity .
Although Freeman said he could not guarantee critical human water needs would always be secure , he added " It 's important that we do n't panic here . "
Not even torrential rains , which flooded Queensland and NSW in the past month , have managed to rejuvenate the Murray .
Instead of rolling south , the waters seeped into the flat , parched earth , scorched by the long dry spell , the most severe of which has hit in the past three years .
The Murray currently holds 940 gigalitres , of which just 350 gigalitres are needed to meet the requirements of the three states .
But the problem is that most of the water in the river is lost through evaporation and seepage before reaching urban centres .
One thousand gigalitres are needed to transport the 350 gigalitres along the river .
Now the MDBA is being forced to make hard choices .
Over the past two years the MDBA has taken drastic measures , such as cutting off wetlands in South Australia , where Adelaide is the capital .
But environmental scientists have warned the once teeming habitats may be permanently damaged .
So the MDBA has been releasing water to some of the more " iconic " flood plains , which have become tourist attractions .
Searing temperatures and stagnating flows have already begun to spawn algae outbreaks , rendering the water unsafe for drinking or recreational purposes .
Farmers are also facing more hardship as new plans are being drafted with new limits on the water they can extract from the Murray - Darling basin .
The neighbouring states of NSW and Victoria have offered to top up Adelaide 's drinking supplies .
But as they also draw water from the Murray - Darling river systems , they have made it clear that Adelaide , home to 1.1 million people , must repay the debt once the drought breaks .
But the MDBA , in its latest monthly drought update , says there 's no sign of rain on the horizon .
" Overall , the outlook for the beginning of the 2009 - 10 water year is not good , and is likely to be similar to the previous two years , " it said , adding that the drought will only break when " above average rainfall occurs for a sustained period of time " .
This page is intended to be a sort of liner notes for my contributions to Spore .
It 's a place for me to write up miscellaneous development comments about the parts of the game I worked on , while they 're still fresh in my mind .
I think the game had over 80 people working on it towards the end , and it was in development for more than 5 years , so basically everything in the game was touched by more than one person and was a team effort .
Given that , I will strive for inclusion and accuracy , and I will only talk about systems to which I made substantial contributions .
If I 've left somebody out or made a mistake , I apologize ; please email me and I 'll correct it immediately .
A Brief Note on Game Credits
This page could be seen as augmenting the game credits [ 1 ] , like what you 'd get if you could click on the names to get more information .
I think credits are very important for game developers , our industry , and the art for m [ 2 ] .
Although assigning credit is a bit tricky because large - scale game development has a lot of subtle , overlapping , and often blurry responsibilities , I still think it 's interesting to have rough descriptions and color commentary of the major things each person worked on .
This is my attempt at this for my contributions , before I forget the details .
I hope more developers put up pages like this for the games they work on .
Almost all of my contributions center around the creatures , and helping to bring them to life for players .
My favorite moment in the game is when you first attach a leg or arm or mouth to the torso in the creature editor , and your creature comes alive and turns to look at its new limb or roars with its mouth .
It 's great to watch players be delighted by something they just created .
In most cases I 'm limiting my discussions to the specific code and tools that I contributed to directly , which leaves out descriptions of a lot of the incredibly important and groundbreaking work other people did on neighboring code , whether higher level , more player facing aspects of the code , like user interface and gameplay , or lower level systems stuff like resource management , threading , rendering , and the like .
It also leaves out the contributions of the awesome artists who used the [ sometimes cantankerous ] tools and systems .
These sections are in rough chronological order of my contributions .
Creature Skin Mesh
The first thing I worked on when I started on Spore ( in October , 2003 ) was the creature skin .
Unlike games with fixed characters , like a James Bond or Lara Croft game , or games with parameterizable meshes , like the Sims or City of Heroes , Spore has to generate the entire mesh on the fly as the player makes the creature .
While a typical game 's fixed or parameterizable character mesh might be worked on for days in a 3D modeling tool like Maya by a professional game artist , Spore needs to regenerate the skin in real - time as the player deforms the torso and attaches and detaches limbs .
I chose a blobby implicit surface ( sometimes called metaballs ) to represent the skin .
Implicit surfaces are interesting because they are very topologically robust , yet they lack " local control " .
This lack of control compared to modeling with triangles directly ( called a boundary representation , or b- rep ) is one of the reasons implicit surfaces have n't really ever gained traction for regular 3D modeling — when you 're making James Bond , you want to get his nose just right .
However , the topological robustness is actually more valuable to Spore than the local control , since we have a higher level user interface on the creature creation .
We do n't let the player manipulate at the polygon level anyway , both because we would end up with an interface as complex as Maya , but also because we need to keep the " recipe " for the creature very small so we can transmit it over the wire to and from the Sporepedia .
The deltas for per-polygon editing get big , fast .
Robustness , on the other hand , is vitally important , because we let the player have so much control over the creature morphology , and the skin always needs to flow smoothly over the skeleton of the creature .
Here are some images of the first " creature " I built with the metaball skin system , showing the skin , wireframe , the metaballs , the voxelization , and a 3D print of the creature .
The incredibly awesome Henry Goffin took over this code after he joined the team and did almost all of the hard work of getting the skinning system into the creature editor and game .
Some interesting details :
We use a 4th order polynomial in the squared distance from the sample point to the center of the given metaball for the implicit surface , similar to Triquet , Meseure , and Chaillou .
They use a 2nd order polynomial , but we square the main term again to get more continuous derivatives to avoid lighting discontinuities .
The actual equation is :
is the metaball center position , is the metaball radius ( the function is defined to be 0 outside this radius ) , and is the scale factor for the metaball , affecting its goopiness .
When I started the skin work , the Marching Cubes patent was still in effect , so to work around the patent [ 3 ]
I tessellate the surface into triangles using an ear clipping algorithm .
The patent expired before we shipped , but I never went back and tested whether using Marching Cubes would have been faster or slower .
We did not have time to implement metaball groups , which means the skin is one big implicit surface .
This allows the skin on limbs to join together , forming webbing between the limbs as they move independently .
We intended to fix this , but players have used this as a feature to create bat wings , and other special effects .
Since players found it valuable and it's easy to work around while editing by simply moving the limbs apart if you do n't like the effect , we probably wo n't change the current behavior .
I sum up this slightly odd chain of events with :
Bugs +
Player Creativity = Features Random tidbit : some people internally called this the " flying squirrel bug " .
A lot of naive implicit surface tesselation algorithms generate poor quality triangle meshes with lots of slivers .
We avoid this by using the amazingly awesome technique from Compact Isocontours from Sampled Data , Moore and Warren , in Graphics Gems III .
There is a tech report version of this available online : Mesh Displacement : An Improved Contouring Method for Trivariate Data .
My friend Casey Muratori introduced me to this paper a while back , and it is the secret to high quality implicit surface tesselations .
Few people seem to know about this technique , but it 's trivial to implement and generates perfectly uniform meshes as you can see in the screenshots above — highly recommended !
We only use spherical metaballs , and we distribute them along the limbs and torso using a neat bit of math that calculates how close they need to be to form a smooth shape based on the implicit surface parameters .
I 'll write this up at some point if people are interested .
Ellipsoidal metaballs would be cool and allow a wider range of shapes , but they seem like they'd be significantly slower to evaluate because they 're orientation dependent , and evaluation speed is crucial to keeping the creature editor snappy .
We generate bone weights for the vertices based on which body parts generated which metaballs .
This works well for limbs , but sometimes big spine segments do n't generate smooth weights , and the torso on fat creatures can shear .
Fixing the torso skin vertex weights is relative easy and Henry and I prototyped a solution right before ship , but dealing with any torso - attached parts is harder , so we had to punt .
We hope to fix this at some point when we work out the details .
Creature Texturing
a.k.a. Skin Paint
Again , constrasting Spore with games that use fixed character assets is illuminating for the various challenges we faced when texturing the creatures .
All of this skin paint development was done in tight collaboration with Spore 's Art Director Ocean Quigley .
We worked closely to figure out which degrees of freedom we needed to expose to give the creatures convincing organic skin , and how we'd fit it onto existing 3D hardware .
Ocean has a detailed post about the skin paint system on his blog , and one of Andrew 's SIGGRAPH 2007 Technical Sketches discusses skin paint as well .
Texture Charting
As mentioned above , for a normal game , the character mesh is fixed early in the process , and that mesh is then charted ( also called " uv'd " in reference to the use of ' u ' and ' v' for texture coordinates ) to create texture coordinates for all the triangles in the mesh .
The final set of texture coordinates is called a texture atlas .
Intuitively , we flay the 3D mesh apart , like skinning an animal , until it lays flat on a plane .
There are mathematical theorems discussing the difficulty of doing this with minimal distortion , and the plethora of map projections [ 4 ] shows there 's no " best " way to do this , and so artists will adjust and tune the mapping while the character is being created , until they 're happy with the result .
This might take a few hours or a day .
By contrast , Spore needs to create a texture atlas almost instantly , because the player can modify the mesh and then go into the editor 's Play Mode or Paint Mode and see the results immediately .
I wrote a very simple but optimized charter that does a really crappy job compared to a professional artist , but it does the job in 10 milliseconds on our minspec platform .
Here 's an example of an atlas produced by the charter :
Notice all the individual triangles at the bottom , and the wasted space .
You can probably determine the algorithm if you look closely at the two images .
The code starts on a random uncharted triangle , then floods outward as it finds neighboring triangles facing in approximately the same cardinal direction in 3D ( meaning down the +x , - x , +y , -y , +z , or - z axes ) .
When it can't find any more uncharted triangles attached to the current group and facing the same direction , it projects the group flat onto the plane of the current axis .
This guarantees bounded distortion .
After charting all triangles , it packs the charts into the texture atlas by sorting them by bounding box size , and then packing the bounding boxes of the charts in 2D texture space in a zig zag manner .
Constrast the frog above with this Oliphant texture from Battle For Middle Earth [ 5 ] :
This texture atlas is incredibly well packed and distributed ; all of the texels are used with no wasted space .
Ocean once quipped that he'd fire any artist who made a texture atlas as bad as that frog 's map .
I replied that it was indeed a poor quality atlas , but it was maybe only 10 or a 100 times worse than a human might make , and it was created about 36,000 times faster , so my code is still ahead by a factor of 400 or so !
Plus , it 's quite difficult to squeeze a professional texture artist into each shipping game box .
That said , the poor packing does have some impact on the final result , because wasted texels means less apparent texture resolution for a given amount of texture memory used , and lots of texture seams means both slightly bigger meshes because of lack of texture coordinate sharing and potential for visible seams on the skin .
It turns out we did n't need the charter to be quite as fast as it currently is , so Henry and I mused about how to trade off a little bit of speed for better charting and packing , but it was unclear how to do this in the development time we had left .
The high end techniques in most graphics research papers about texture charting take far too long for our use case , usually on the order of seconds or minutes [ 6 ] .
The key difference between a Spore creature 's texture atlas and a fixed game character 's atlas is a human artist will paint into the latter , so it has to be made from recognizable pieces and it has to be coherent ; individually charted triangles make no sense when you 're painting into a map directly in Photoshop .
Because Spore uses a procedural paint system , only the computer ever needs to paint into the texture maps for Spore creatures , so as long as the code can figure out where things belong , it 's okay .
Lowlevel Texture Painting
At the lowest level , the paint system renders multi-channel brush textures into the creature 's 2D texture map .
The initial prototype for the skin paint system was a " 3D paint " system , allowing artists to use the mouse or graphics tablet to paint directly onto the creature mesh with a palette of brushes .
At the time I was developing this code , all the existing 3D paint applications , like Maya and ZBrush , used really clunky projections that just did n't feel right .
I took what I thought was the simple approach : raycast the mesh to find the brush 's hit location , flood fill out on the mesh using the brush size to collect all the triangles hit by the brush application , and then render into the texture using the uv coordinates as the draw coordinates , the 3D coordinates as the texture coordinates , and the brush as the texture , while the texture matrix set up the brush 's angle in 3D .
I also generated " skirt polygons " around the actual mesh triangles in both 3D and texture space , and these were added to the collection of hit triangles if necessary .
This avoided seams while painting , since a chart edge would have data beyond it when the texture resampler fetched neighboring texels for bilinear resampling [ 7 ] .
Finally , the texture was dilated so mipmaps would not show seams .
All of this was hardware accelerated , of course , so it was silky smooth .
It worked great , felt completely natural , and the artists loved it .
Since then , most of the professional paint apps have adopted similar approaches as well , thankfully .
One cool thing about our paint system is the brushes could write into multiple channels simultaneously .
In the prototype , we supported diffuse , specular exponent , gloss , emissive , and bump channels , with alpha masks for each .
The bump channel was differentiated into a normal map after every paint application .
You could have a brush that only wrote into the specular map without touching the other channels , for example , to make some parts of the skin look wet .
We used the Photoshop PSD library I wrote for the Indie Game Jam to load the multi-channel brushes directly , so you could pack all them into a single Photoshop file , which was great for workflow .
Once the 3D paint prototype was up and running , our phenomenal artist John Cimino did a bunch of testing with it to prove out the system .
This last one is a creature called the Intestisaur , created by intern Michael Chang in an early version of the creature editor , and painted by John .
I 've put a high res version with alpha here .
Particle Paint
After the 3D paint prototype proved out the core technology , we needed to make it procedural , since we could n't figure out a way to ship Ocean and John with each copy of the game .
The lingua franca for data - driven procedural systems at Maxis is Andrew Willmott 's Swarm effects / particle system .
I wrote a plugin for Swarm that hooked up the paint system to the particle behavior , so Ocean and the other effects artists could write scripts to try to paint creatures .
This hookup was interesting because I exposed the 2D mesh surface to the effects system as a constraint surface , and the particles were actually simulated in barycentric coordinates on the mesh itself .
This allowed the particles to move arbitrarily fast , and they would zip right around the mesh with no gaps .
Here 's a video of the skinpaint system at work in the prototype on a test mesh :
As you can read about in Ocean 's blog post , this system proved out the concept , but more work was necessary .
Henry took it from here , and replaced the Swarm hookup with a custom system that allowed the scripts to reason about the morphology of the creature , doing things like giving the particles limb - relative coordinate systems , etc .
Henry also ported all the lowlevel paint code from the OpenGL prototype to the RenderWare / Direct3D game engine , and made it run in the background , a thankless and difficult task !
Creature Animation
I 've written and lectured a lot about the creature animation system , so I 'll just point to those resources here :
Real - time Motion Retargeting to Highly Varied User - Created Morphologies , the SIGGRAPH 2008 Technical Paper about the Spore Animation System .
Very detailed and technical .
Includes videos of Spasm , the animation tool .
I tried to include a cute video of an animation John Cimino did of Spore creatures singing the Mahna Mahna song , but YouTube flagged it as copyright infringing .
Damn you , DSP algorithms !
Behavior Tree AI
Early in production we were running into trouble with our existing Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) system for creatures , so Tom Bui , Lauren McHugh , and I did a bunch of research and decided to switch to a Halo - style Behavior Tree ( BT ) system .
Damian Isla documented Bungie 's system at GDC 2005 , and it was reprinted on Gamasutra .
I spent a lot of time talking with Damian , Max Dyckhoff , and Chris Butcher about their system , what worked , what did n't , and how they 'd change it , and ended up creating our BT system as a kind of " version 1.5 " of theirs .
I 'm trying to get permission to release it to the public domain , but for now , here is the main chunk of the documentation , which can be read as a sequel to Damian 's article linked above .
/ Spore Behavior Tree Docs
The first part of a kind of pseudo - literate - program describing how our system works .
Lauren gave a lecture at the 2008 GDC on our system as well , but I believe only the audio is available right now .
What are Behavior Trees ?
Various people have asked me where I think Behavior Trees fit into the taxonomy of game AI techniques .
I characterize them as still firmly in the Finite State Machine category .
The magic of Behavior Trees is not that they 're a new technique , but that they have such good development process properties — meaning the friction for using them is very low — that they allow you to scale your AI complexity far beyond the other FSM representation methods I 've seen , including switch statements , objects for states , graphical node editors , etc .
In effect , they allow you to put off the ( inevitable ? ) transition to real planning with all of its implementation and debugging issues , by allowing you to continue to use FSMs for more and more advanced AI .
BTs have limits as well , and I do think game AI will be planning based in the future , but putting off dealing with an opaque planner is a good thing .
I liken it to hotloading data files : hotloading is just a process improvement ; it does n't change your data or code much ; it does n't directly make your game better .
But , it 's such a massive process improvement it becomes a revolution in productivity by allowing you to iterate faster .
BTs are the same kind of thing for AI .
They 're so simple to use and debug , and have such good scalability characteristics ( avoiding the issue as mentioned in the docs , etc. ) , that they allow you to vastly increase your AI 's complexity without running into a wall .
Design
Early in Spore 's development I was involved in prototyping designs for the creature game , and eventually ended up co-leading the creature team for a year or so with Alex Hutchinson , before giving that up to focus on the animation system for the last year and half of the project .
Most of the prototyping work was centered around finding cool ways to use the creature animation system .
Here 's a fun video of an early prototype :
Cute vs. Science
Since it just seems to keep reanimating like a really bad zombie movie , even though it 's been called nonsense by me , Executive Producer Lucy Bradshaw , and Will Wright , I will simply state clearly that at no point did I try to steer the game towards a simplistic , shallow , or casual design .
Sigh .
Conclusion
Helping to make Spore was a blast , and I 'm really proud of our work on the project .
The number of problems we had to solve that cut across design , aesthetics , user interface , and technology was unprecedented in the history of game development , I think .
This page is really long , but it only covers the stuff I touched , and so even in spite of its length , it represents a small subset of all the amazing problems the team as a whole solved .
Keep an eye on Ocean 's blog as he digs up more stuff from his development archive , and we 're constantly releasing new stuff at spore.com as well .
And , of course , the best way to look into these technologies is to play Spore or download the free Creature Creator and make some creatures !
There have been zillions of amazing creatures created in Spore , and I 've used many of them in my lectures around the world , but here is my all - time favorite creature , made very early on by a contributor to the Something Awful Forums .
When you 're making games , and struggling with technology and design and people and all the rest , it 's things like this that make it all worth while .
Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have found a way to maintain the pain - killing qualities of morphine over an extended period of time , thus providing a solution for the problem of having to administer increasing dosages of the drug in order to retain its effectiveness .
One of the limitations in long - term use of morphine for pain relief is the rapid development of tolerance .
The effectiveness of morphine declines quickly , and one must increase the dosage in order to preserve effective pain relief .
However , the increased dosage also increases negative side effects .
The Hebrew University researchers , Prof. Yehuda Shavit and his graduate student Gilly Wolf of the Psychology Department , found that administration of morphine causes a substance called interleukin - 1 to be released .
Under normal circumstances , interleukin - 1 plays an important role in survival .
In case of tissue damage , nerve injury , or inflammatory reaction , inteleukin - 1 is released and sets off a process which increases the sensitivity to pain in the injured area .
This pain serves as a warning signal , telling the body that there is a problem that should be attended to .
In case of chronic pain , morphine is still the drug of choice for pain relief .
However , since prolonged administration of morphine raises the level of interleukin - 1 , thereby enhancing pain sensitivity , the effectiveness of morphine as a pain killer is steadily reduced , requiring greater dosages with accompanying negative side effects .
The Hebrew University researchers were able to show in animal experiments that administering morphine together with another drug that blocks the activity of interleukin - 1 provides more effective pain relief over the long term without having to increase the dosage .
Shavit , who is the Leon and Clara Sznajderman Professor of Psychology at the Hebrew University and whose specialty is psychoneuroimmunology , expressed hope that this research will make it possible for clinicians to make use of morphine , together with substances that block interluekin - 1 , in order to bring about better pain relief with lower dosages and with minimized side effects .
The research will be presented at a conference on pain research on May 3 on the Mount Scopus campus of the university .
The conference is open to journalists and to people in the field .
For some inexplicable reason COBOL does n't get much love from LtU .
But COBOL turns 50 some time this year and we owe a tip of the hat to this venerable language behind so many large institutions .
The Guardian understands .
According to Michael Coughlan , a lecturer at the University of Limerick , one of Cobol 's perceived drawbacks is its verbosity .
But he reckons that 's also one of its strengths .
" It 's not just a write - only language , " he says .
" You can come back years later and understand the code . "
This opinion is shared by Mike Gilpin , of Forrester , who is an ex-Cobol programmer .
" Cobol is one of the few languages written in the last 50 years that 's readable and understandable , " he says .
And he 's scathing about the readability of more fashionable languages , such as PHP and Java : " Modern programming languages are ridiculously hard to understand . "

Editorial : Bilderbergers Are Criminals , Traitors According to U.S. Law ALL AMERICANS WHO PARTICIPATE in secret Bilderberg meetings are criminals and traitors .
The Logan Act expressly forbids U.S. citizens to negotiate public policy with representatives of foreign governments .
Thus , American officials and private citizens who participate are lawbreaking criminals .
U.S. and foreign government officials who attend are virtually all traitors because they put their world government goal ahead of the interests of their own nations .
They scorn “ nationalism ” and work for “ transnationalism . ”
All Bilderberg “ regulars ” must support these goals or be ostracized .
More than 100 of the 120 or so attendees are “ regulars , ” invited every year .
Typically , five or so participants are first - timers .
A potential president is likely to be invited once but tossed aside when his political star dims , as former Vice President Dan Quayle can attest .
But you have to support Bilderberg ’s global agenda to survive .
Infrequently , one refuses and is drummed out .
In 1989 , The Spotlight ( AFP ’s inspiration ) reported that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attended for the first time , had little to say but objected to demands that she surrender sovereignty to the European Union .
Bilderberg ordered her ouster and Lady Thatcher was replaced as prime minister by a member of her own Conservative Party , a trapeze artist ’s son named John Major .
AFP ’s Jim Tucker discussed this with Lady Thatcher in June , 1995 .
“ It is an honor to be denounced by Bilderberg , ” Lady Thatcher told Tucker .
“ Anyone who would surrender the sovereignty of their country . . . ” her voice trailed off as she shook her head in disgust .
“ They are a stuck - up set , ” she added .
Lady
Thatcher expressed optimism that Bilderberg would fail to meet its goal of a world government by 2002 , a deadline that had been set back from the original target year of 2000 .
Although she is now in the dimness of Alzheimer ’s disease , Lady Thatcher ’s optimism proved justified .
“ They said , ‘ nationhood should be suppressed , ’ but there will never be a new world order , ” she added .
There have probably been a few other lesser - known Bilderbergers ousted for nationalism over the years .
But all Bilderberg “ regulars ” are traitors to their own countries .
And American participants are criminals , too .

To look at the economics of open source software , you have to start with the economics of software as a category , both proprietary and open source .
Note : it should be perfectly obvious to everyone that open source software works , and works quite well for some things .
This article is more about understanding the how and they why .
Just to avoid any confusion …
If you look at software as a product , it has a couple of defining characteristics :
It ’s difficult to keep people from sharing it .
Not impossible , but not easy , either .
It was already doable in the days of floppy disks , but with the rise of the internet , it has become nearly effortless .
This means , in terms of economics , that it ’s “ non excludable ” – it ’s difficult to keep everyone from enjoying it once you ’ve created it and started to distribute it .
If you give a copy of a program to a friend , it in no way detracts from your own use of the program .
Quite the contrary , it may even make your use of it better , if , say , your friend discovers how to use a cool feature , or writes a handy extension .
This is different from traditional goods like bicycles .
If you loan me your bicycle , you ca n’t use it to get around .
In economics , things like software ( or radio or over the air TV ) are called ‘ non rivalrous ’ goods – many people can take advantage of them without ruining them .
What do you get when you combine something that ’s “ non excludable ” and “ non rivalrous ” ?
In economics , these are known as “ public goods ” :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good – read the whole thing if you have a few minutes , it ’s what I ’ll be talking about .
As per the article , “ The Problem ” as it were , is the free rider problem .
Let ’s stop and look at a contrived example :
Bob is an ex-dentist and really knows what it would take to write a great program for managing a dentist ’s office ( or pick your own example … it ’s contrived , do n’t quibble about the details ) .
He ’s also a good programmer , with the skills necessary to implement the program .
He talks to a few of his dentist friends , and they ’re enthusiastic about the whole thing .
Let ’s look at a few scenarios of how things might play out :
Bob values his time at 10 dollars an hour , and it will take him 100 hours to complete the project , meaning the whole project would cost about 1000 dollars .
One way things could work is that he could find a dentist friend who needs this program , and bill him 1000 $ for his time and services , bang out the code , and release it as open source software .
Bob gets his money , the dentist gets his code … and all the other dentists in town get it for free , which is bound to make the dentist who shelled out the money a bit irritated , given that he ’s a human , not a homo - economus , and does n’t like paying and see others get the same thing for free .
Let ’s introduce another variable : the software is only really worth 200 $ to the dentist – any more than that and yeah , it ’s helpful , but not worth that much money ( And please stay with me , I know it ’s contrived , but keep in mind that the situation is possible , even if the numbers might be different ) .
That means that if Bob wants 1000 $ for his time , but the dentist will only pay 200 $ , then no transaction will occur !
The software wo n’t get written , Bob wo n’t get any money , and the dentist will be worse off because he wo n’t have the nice program , and neither will his dentist colleagues .
One way things might still work is if the dentist rounds up some friends and they all contribute a bit , however , that ’s kind of a pain in the neck for everyone concerned – the dentist does n’t want to get into the software business and spend a bunch of time trying to chase his friends for money , and even if 10 dentists contribute , the ideal position to be in his the 11th guy , who pays nothing , and still gets the software for free .
So it ’s in everyone ’s interests to not return the dentist ’s calls in the hope of being the 11th guy .
Also , none of them gets the software until they ’re all on board .
So , how to resolve this problem ?
The wikipedia page talks about introducing an exclusion mechanism , which in this case would be a copyright system so that Bob can sell a copy of his software for 100 $ and be sure that it wo n’t be open to everyone to use .
This way , the dentists get the software for 100 $ less than they value it at ( 200 $ ) , and as soon as Bob signs up an 11th dentist , he ’s making more than his time / materials costs , and is therefore coming out ahead !
The dentists all know that they ’re paying the same price , so have no reason to grumble about free riders .
In short , everyone is pretty happy .
Of course , in the real world , things do n’t play out like that all the time .
There are problems with the simplified example above , some of which are very evident : the cost of enforcing copyright laws , in an age when copying is extremely easy , is very high and potentially very intrusive .
However , “ intellectual property ” is , by and large , a compromise solution that has had positive aspects , especially when you ignore the outliers like Microsoft , and look at all kinds of niche software vendors , who make a nice living , create good products , and have happy , satisfied customers .
If you look at the other solutions to the free rider problem listed on the wikipedia page , we can see how they might be applied to the world of software .
Dominant assurance contracts
Assurance contracts are contracts in which participants make a binding pledge to contribute to a contract for building a public good , contingent on a quorum of a predetermined size being reached .
Otherwise their money is refunded .
A dominant assurance contract is a variation in which an entrepreneur creates the contract and refunds the initial pledge plus an additional sum of money if the quorum is not reached .
In game theory terms this makes pledging to build the public good a dominant strategy : the best move is to pledge to the contract regardless of the actions of others .
This means that Bob goes out and gets a number of dentists to pledge 100 $ to his dentist program , and if he does n’t raise at least 1000 $ , he ’ll give them each back 110 $ .
So it ’s a clever solution that works out for everyone , but is still a lot fiddlier than the copyright system – Bob has to go sell the contracts and explain how things work to a bunch of people before he can get started .
This might be doable with 10 dentists , but for a more mass - market sort of program , it would not be feasible .
Coasian solution a mechanism by which potential beneficiaries of a public good band together and pool their resources based on their willingness to pay to create the public good .
Coase ( 1960 ) argued that if the transaction costs between potential beneficiaries of a public good are sufficiently low , and it is therefore easy for beneficiaries to find each other and pool their money based on the public good ’s value to them , then an adequate level of public goods production can occur even under competitive free market conditions .
That sounds an awful lot like open source software , especially the kind espoused by groups like the Apache Software Foundation , where making free software is not a moral imperative , but a good way of producing something that is not necessarily a key business component .
This has proven to work very well for infrastructure type code , as well as lots of developer tools .
It is less proven as a way to develop end - user software – in the example above , it ’s not like Bob needs help to develop his system , or that the dentists really want to contribute – they just want a working program and do n’t want to get involved in its production .
Government provision
This would mean that the government would be responsible for funding the production of open source software .
I ’m no free - market zealot , but I think the idea of the government being responsible for software products is not one I am entirely comfortable with .
Of course , I do think the government has a role with places like universities , where people can do “ research ” in the sense of hacking on cool systems just to see what can be done , without necessarily having to be thinking of how to make a profit in the short to medium term .
Software like BSD , Tcl , and plenty of other great stuff has come out of universities , meaning that in part it is ultimately funded by the government and taxes .
The problem , though , is the process of refining those things down into something people are willing to buy .
Would Bob go to a local government official to get a grant to produce his software ?
Why should Bob get the contract and not some other guy ?
Does the government official know enough about code or dentists to determine who should write the program ?
Subsidies
Subsidies might work to encourage software production , but would probably simply be abused .
It ’s probably not as relevant as other potential solutions .
What form would it take ?
1 $ off your taxes per line of code written ?
It would be difficult to place a value on anything , and might be quite difficult to implement .
Privileged group
This , as the wikipedia page says , is an incomplete solution , and is less generally applicable .
In terms of Bob , it might mean that instead of valuing his code at 200 $ , his wealthy dentist friend with a large practice really needs the code – it ’s worth 2000 $ to him , and can pay Bob the full 1000 $ to develop it out of pocket and still come out ahead , and he does n’t really care that much about the free riders because he ’s getting what he needs and the rest does n’t matter too much .
Social norms
If Bob and the dentists live in a small town , and are all good friends , perhaps Bob could still release the software , and even though the other dentists could copy and use it for free , they do n’t , because they feel an obligation to Bob to help him out for the work he ’s done .
Even though they could take advantage of it for free , they would feel bad about doing so , and so each chip in 100 $ , which after enough people contribute , is enough to cover Bob ’s costs .
It ’s likely that anything distributed on a larger scale , however , will see more free - riding , and “ please pay ! ” might not work out .
And it ’s probably fairly distressful for a developer to make that jump , knowing he’s at the mercy of other people ’s good will .
None of these solutions is perfect , and all , including exclusion in the form of intellectual property laws , or simply doing nothing at all , have problems of their own .
Due to the very nature of software , this is somewhat inevitable , and the best we can do is come up with good compromises , and continue to reevaluate them as technology and society change ( this is something that needs to happen with IP laws , for instance ) .
A few times a each month we revisit some of our reader ’s favorite posts from throughout the history of Vectortuts +.
This tutorial by Jonathan was first published on February 24th 2009 .
This tutorial is perfect for the advanced beginner who wants to take her skills to the next level .
We 'll explore how to create 3D text and use depth - of - field to enhance a design .
Want access to the full Vector Source files and downloadable copies of every tutorial , including this one ?
Join VECTORTUTS PLUS for just 9 / month .
Step 1
Start by typing each letter separate so you can adjust the angle and 3D qualities of each .
I 'm using a font called Futura Bold .
I 'd recommend using a font that is not thin and delicate .
The more weight the font has the better .
Also , use a grey or light color so when you proceed to the next step you 'll be able to see what your 3D text looks like .
Step 2
Go to Effect > 3D > Extrude & Bevel ...
Enter variables where I 've highlighted below to achieve the look indicated .
Step 3
Even after you apply 3D effects that you would like your letter to have you can also continue to rotate the letter to whatever angle you like , as I 've done below .
Just use the Selection Tool ( V ) to rotate the letter .
Click on a color and the shading will automatically be applied to the different faces of the letter .
Step 4
Use the same technique on the other letters .
Use the Swatches Palette to quickly pick a range of vibrant colors and apply them to each letter .
Step 5
Create a depth - of - field ( the appearance of objects being closer and farther away ) by going to Effect > Blur > Gaussian Blur ...
Enter the variable below and click OK .
Note :
Make sure your letter will not need to be scaled larger or smaller after you apply the blur , as blur effects do not scale regardless of any preferences you have designated in Adobe Illustrator .
Step 6
To create an even wider focal range , you can give different letters a unique blur amount .
Observe how the angle , scale , blur and color all factor into how the entire word is perceived .
Each letter has a random quality about it .
The scale is varied to suggest distance .
Again , the blur reinforces the depth and the colors are all bright and not repeated next to each other .
Step 7
Type the rest of the phrase .
The font I 'm using is Bickham Script .
As you can see , the font is very different from the font that the word " Playful " is written in .
This creates a nice range and contrast between the two .
Do the same for your layout .
Step 8
Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool to draw a rectangle as shown below .
Note :
You can adjust the curvature of the corners by holding the up or down arrow while you draw the shape .
Step 9
Fill the rectangle with a 3 - point gradient .
The right - most green color helps create a slightly darker green that will frame the rectangle even more .
Step 10
Move the text over the background .
In order to apply a gradient to the text you will first need to turn it into outlines .
Go to Type > Create Outlines .
Now , select the text and give it a subtle grey to white gradient .
Step 11
To make the text look even more 3D add an Inner Glow by going to Effect > Stylize > Inner Glow ... Select Screen , in the Mode drop down .
Enter about 75 for Opacity and set the blur to your liking .
Step 12
Now that the letter looks somewhat rounded we 'll take it a step further and add a drop shadow .
Go to Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow ...
Set the Mode to Multiply ( so the shadow blends nicely with the background ) .
Set your Opacity to about 20 and give it a blur of your choosing .
Step 13
This is what your design should look like right now .
Step 14
We 'll give certain faces of each letter an enhanced look by giving them gradients .
First , make a copy of the letter .
Select the copy and go to Object > Expand Appearance .
Now go to Object > Ungroup .
Continue to Ungroup the object until you can select the face of the object .
Step 15
Select the face of the letter and give it a moderate red to dark - red gradient .
Step 16
You can now delete the leftover parts of the letter that you did not apply a gradient to .
Place the face of the letter over the letter with the 3D effects applied to it .
Step 17
Use this same technique to create depth on any other letters that need it .
For instances where the letters are blurred simply apply the same blur to the face of that letter .
To see how much blur a letter has double - click on that effect in the Appearance Palette .
Step 18
Next we 'll give the background a random circle pattern .
Draw a circle using the Ellipse Tool ( L ) .
For the purposes of this tutorial I 've used a black circle but your circle should be white , or whatever color you want your pattern to be .
Drag the circle into the Brushes Palette .
The dialog in the next step will open ...
Step 19
Select New Scatter Brush and click OK ...
Step 20
Select Random for Size , Spacing and Scatter .
Next , drag the small triangles to both sides of the slider for all three options .
This will ensure the circle pattern is varied and not too repetitive .
Click OK .
Step 21
In the Brushes Palette select the circle brush you just created .
Select the Paintbrush Tool ( B ) and draw an arbitrary line .
Your line will be replaced by a circle pattern similar to the one below .
If your circles are not as random as you like , just double - click on the circle in the Brushes Palette to change the parameters .
Step 22
Place the circles on their own layer behind the letters .
Feel free to draw more lines or copy and paste the other circle pattern to build a mass of circles .
Step 23
Using the Ellipse Tool draw a circle and give it a Radial fill with a 3 - point gradient .
Using 3 - points will allow you to give the circle an extra highlight that will add to its realism .
Copy and paste this shape a few other times throughout the layout .
Step 24
You can create other brushes using different shapes like squares , triangles and outlined versions of each shape to keep things interesting .
Step 25
Using the Pencil Tool ( N ) draw some erratic shapes that will function as moss or general greenery on the letters .
When you 're drawing with the Pencil Tool it 's sometimes difficult to close the shape .
The easiest way to close a shape is to hold down the Option key when you are nearing the starting point of the shape .
This will automatically close the shape .
Step 26
Add other assorted shapes and give them a green to dark - green gradient .
Step 27
To make vines I 've simply used one of the alternate characters that was included with the font Bickham Script .
If your font does not have alternate characters you can try using parts of other letters , like an S for example .
Otherwise you will need to draw some curly shapes the old fashioned way ... using a Wacom Tablet and the Pen Tool .
Step 28
Create a leaf shape in much the same manner that you did for the moss shapes .
You 'll get better at drawing shapes the more you practice .
Step 29
To amplify the look of the leaf give it an Inner Glow by going to Effect > Stylize > Inner Glow ...
Step 30
This is what your layout should look like right now .
Step 31
We 'll give the background a bit of motion by using the Pen Tool ( P ) to draw a shape similar to the one below .
Step 32
Duplicate the shape a couple times and adjust the Opacity to lessen the appearance of the shape .
Give some of the shapes a tenuous blur to again create the illusion of some of the swooshes being farther away .
Step 33
Using the Rectangle Tool , draw a rectangle and give it a 4 - point gradient with white being on both ends .
Step 34
Place the gradient over the background and give it a blur .
In the Transparency Palette set the shape to Multiply , so it blends well with the background .
Feel free to also adjust the Opacity if need be .

We ’ve all heard the expression that “ it is better to give than to receive . ”
I firmly believe in the principle of sowing and reaping .
You reap what you sow .
Money is n’t just valuable when you hoard it and hold onto it with a clinched first , but rather when you give it away .
When we think of savvy finances , we rarely think that giving money away is the smartest thing to do .
After all , should n’t you be using that money for something else – like building wealth ?
The reality , though , is that well - rounded finances include an aspect of giving .
And , believe it or not , giving your money away can be good for your pocketbook .
Giving Forces
You to Get Your Finances in Order
One of the consequences of prioritizing your charitable efforts is that it forces you to get your own finances in order .
If you want to be able to help your loved ones , pay your tithing , or give to a cause you believe in , you need to be financial stable .
If you make giving a priority , chances are that you will need to look at your income and expenses , and acknowledge your cash flow situation .
Just as you need to plan in order to meet goals like funding a retirement , buying a house , paying down debt , and saving for your child ’s college , you need to plan if you want to become involved in charitable giving .
If giving really is important to you , you ’ll create a spending plan that allows you to meet your charity goals .
Giving Makes You Happy
It ’s hard to make the right spending choices when your judgment is affected by negative emotions .
Few of us are truly happy with the way we use our money .
That can change , however , if you decide to give .
Studies indicate that spending money on others can make us happier than spending money on ourselves .
So , if you want to improve how you feel about your finances , you can try getting them in order and giving to others .
When you take some of your money and spend it on others , you ’ll feel more satisfied with the way you are using your financial resources .
Your life will be happier , and you are likely to make decisions based on positive emotions .
Giving Has a Way of Coming Back to You
One of the great things about giving is that it has a way of coming back to you .
For the religious , giving has the potential to open up blessings .
Many major world religions include the concept of giving .
If you are a believer , then chances are you have blessings coming your way when you give .
You might not always receive great worldly riches , but many religious believers feel as though their needs are met when they take the effort to give generously .
You do n’t have to be religious to feel the benefits of giving , however .
Many of those who do n’t ascribe to religious beliefs feel amply repaid when they give .
The positive mindset that results in giving often leads to other benefits .
When you are in a giving mindset , there is a good chance that you are in a place where you recognize opportunities and are prepared to grasp them .
The organization required in having the resources to give often means that you are on your toes , looking for the right networking and career chances that can lead to improved finances .
Giving Generously is a Blessing
Here are some simple things to remind you before you give .
You ’re Blessed – I probably do n’t know you personally , but I ’m confident that you ’re blessed .
You probably woke up this morning with a roof over your head , food in the kitchen , and running water to shower and brush your teeth .
Congratulations .
You ’re in the minority .
Most people around the world did n’t have that luxury this morning .

If you think your minimum - wage paycheck is bad , this will open your eyes .
People Have Given To You –
Once again , I may not know you personally , but I ’m sure there have been people that have given to you .
Maybe it was a family member , a friend , or even some random stranger who reached out to help you .
No one in history ever makes the journey of life alone .
People come into our lives at various moments and help us along the way .
Therefore , you should do the same for others .
Giving Provides A Better Return On Your Money – Regardless of how the market is doing or whether your investments are up or down , giving generously to those in need always provides a good return .
Not to sound cheesy or corny , but you really ca n’t put a price on that feeling .
Smart Steps in Supporting a Charity
For several years now , my husband and I have been putting money aside each month for charitable gifts .
It ’s been a great way to know that we can make a difference — no matter how small — for our favorite charities .
However , once you have started giving to charity , you will find yourself solicited over and over by various organizations .
How do you know who deserves your donation ?
While there are illegitimate charities and scams posing as charities out there , most of the charitable organizations are real and do need your help .
Here are some ways to make the most of your donation and feel good knowing that your money truly is going to help a good cause .
Make sure you choose which charity gets your money
I ’ll admit that most of my charitable giving throughout the years was in reaction to a solicitation .
Someone called , mailed , emailed , stopped me outside the library , knocked on my door , or even requested my help on TV , and I got out my checkbook .
While there is not necessarily anything wrong with giving money because of a solicitation , you want to make sure you really know whom you are giving your money to .
A way to avoid feeling flat - footed is to be proactive and find the charities you are most interested in before someone is asking you for money .
That way you have the time to really investigate the charity and you can honestly tell the earnest solicitor that you do n’t donate money over the phone / door - to - door / outside the library .
A great resource for finding out more about charities is www.charitynavigator.org.
This website rates charities based on their financial health .
Only donate to organizations with 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status
This tax - exempt status is granted by the IRS to nine types of charitable organizations : those committed to religious , charitable , educational , scientific or literary purposes , those committed to testing for public safety , those fostering amateur sports , those promoting the arts , and those committed to preventing cruelty to children or animals .
Not only does the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status reassure you that the organization fits the IRS ’s basic requirements for a charitable organization ( although that is clearly not all you should use to evaluate a charity ) , it also grants you a tax deduction on your charitable donation .
Opt out of having your name circulated
Many charities have a donor privacy policy that will keep your name and contact information private from other charities .
However , even charities with such a policy may require you to opt out of having your information shared .
Tell your favorite charities to keep your name off of circulating lists , and you ’ll have fewer solicitations to wade through in your mailbox .
Choose one or two charities to support and stick with them
Once you ’ve done your homework , go ahead and limit your giving to no more than a handful of charities .
Not only does that make it easier for you to say no to solicitations , but it also helps you build a relationship with a cause you care about , and it means that you can see more good done with the money you can afford to donate .
And if you have a long - term relationship with a charity , that means that the organization can spend less on solicitation since it will know it can count on a donation from you .
If everyone gave money this way , then charities could focus more attention on their causes and less on trying to get more funds .
Giving to charity is one of my favorite parts of being on a budget — I now have the money set aside to help make the world a better place .
Get that same feeling by giving to a charity that you believe in .
Creative Ways to Give to Charity without Breaking the Bank
One of the best ways to keep your finances on the right track is to give to charity .
Giving money away can be a great way to ensure that you have well - rounded finances .
However , you do n’t have to just send money to your favorite legitimate charity .
There are a number of creative ways to give to charity .
Here are some of the more interesting ways that you can help a good cause without breaking the bank :
I ’ve recently started doing my ordering via AmazonSmile .
Amazon will donate a small percentage of your eligible purchases to a charity you can get behind .
However , it ’s important to note that the amount given is rather small .
You would have to spend $ 10,000 on Amazon in order for it to amount to a $ 50 gift .
I like using AmazonSmile because I can shop as normal , and the charity gets a little boost .
However , I know that using AmazonSmile is no substitute for giving my time or money to a worthwhile cause .
So I do n’t let AmazonSmile replace my charitable giving efforts ; I let it enhance them a little bit .
GIVmobile
One way you can save money on your cell phone bill is to sign up with a no - contract plan .
There are a number of companies out there that offer this plans , and one of them is GIVmobile , which is associated with PTEL Mobile .
A portion of your monthly plan payment goes to charity , and you do n’t have to do anything special .
Along with AmazonSmile , this is part of a movement toward “ slacktivism , ” which provides you with a way to feel warm and fuzzy about your ability to give , without actually requiring you to do anything extra .
As with AmazonSmile , it ’s important to realize that GIVmobile is more about enhancing your efforts ( without costing you more ) , rather than replacing your current charitable giving efforts .
Aside from the fact that you can help a charity , GIVmobile also offers low - cost “ unlimited everything ” plans and some promos on great smart phones .
So it ’s worth looking into to save money at the same time .
Donate Credit Card Rewards
Rather than use your credit card rewards yourself , you might be able to donate them to charity .
This is a great way to put your credit card rewards to work for a good cause .
Your donated credit card rewards can provide cash , merchandise , travel , or other perks to a charity that might need them .
Find out whether or not this is an option , and consider donating credit card rewards .
Company Match
There are some companies that will match your charitable contributions .
This is one of the best ways to make the most of a charitable contribution , since it doubles your own giving , up to a certain amount .
Talk to your company ’s HR department about the possibility of a company match .
You might be surprised to find that you can increase the effectiveness of your donation by getting your company to match it .
Click to Donate
There are some sites , like Care2 , that are set up so that sponsors donate when you click on their ads .
If you do n’t mind looking at ads , and clicking around a little bit , your Internet surfing can help various causes .
Of course , like many of these other methods , the amount of good you do is somewhat limited .
But , it is one way to help out a little bit in your spare time .
Volunteer and Get Local
If you really want to see your donation efforts at work , though , you need to volunteer locally .
You do n’t even have to lay out money .
Donate your time or your goods .
If a local charity needs help advertising , and you are good with social media , do what you can to help out .
There are lots of ways that you can volunteer locally .
I also like to give to my local food bank , where I can actually see the results of my giving .
To make it easy on myself , I actually have an automatic payment made each month .
You do n’t have to give massive amounts of money all at once to be effective .
A monthly donation , or a little “ slacktivism ” on top of your current efforts can be creative ways to do a little more good .
Bottom Line
While you do n’t want to give away money that you ca n’t afford to part with , there is no reason to hoard your cash .
You can improve the world through the application of your financial resources , and you can also improve your own life .
Giving money away can help you boost your finances , improve your quality of life , and open your eyes to opportunities .
What do you think ?
Have you seen benefits from giving money away ?

For Iceland ’s voters in the election last Saturday the issues were more pragmatic than a supposed unseating of the right by the left , the trend most emphasized in news coverage .
The country ’s main problem is reckless neoliberal bank privatization and the proposed responses are not inherently left or right as such .
At issue is whether voters have become so desperate in the wake of crooks wrecking the financial system that they will seek a more stable currency ( the euro ) by joining Europe on terms that forfeit control over Iceland ’s North Atlantic fishing waters and burden taxpayers with unprecedented public debt , to compensate British , Dutch and other European bank depositors and speculators for their losses ?
Europe would not dare make such a demand on the United States for the bad packages of junk mortgages it bought and for its losses when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt .
But Iceland is a small country and may be easier and riper for plucking .
For many voters the idea of joining the European Union is an attractive fantasy – adopting the euro to solve Iceland ’s financial problems .
The alternative is for the country simply to change its destructive bank rules and reverse the giveaways made in times past to politically connected insiders .
The victorious Social Democrats favor joining Europe , the Left - Green and formerly dominant Independence Party do not , while the centrist and largely rural Progressive Party ( for many decades the second leading party ) is wary but at least is willing to discuss the terms on which EU membership might benefit Iceland .
Everyone is against the oligarchy ’s insiders who ran up the debts .
That is why their major sponsor , the Independence Party , lost one - third of its electoral support ( down to just 20 per cent from its usual 33 - 35 per cent ) , the lowest percentage of votes and seats in the parliament ( Althing ) in the 80 years since it was founded in 1930 .
The days of the kleptocracy are over – and there is scarcely more sympathy for the foreign lenders and savers who were the enablers of these insiders .
But voters are wary of the financial stance England and the rest of Europe have taken against Iceland , and of arrangements with the International Monetary Fund .
Former Independence Prime Minister ( and later head of the central bank ) David Oddsson is adamant that Iceland ’s government and people not take responsibility for these bad debts , and shares the view I found to be unanimous among Icelanders :
These crooks betrayed the country .
The myth of deregulated “ free ” enterprise has been broken , and privatization is seen to have been a euphemism for kleptocracy .
I recently returned from a week in Iceland – a week in which I met with politicians and former prime ministers , financial officials , university professors and students , film makers , TV hosts and “ just plain people . ”
The terms “ left ” and “ right ” did not arise in a single conversation .
The focus was on Iceland ’s pro-creditor practice of indexing consumer mortgages and other debts – a 17 per cent “ inflation ” premium for creditors based on the consumer price index ( in effect , the Icelandic krónur ’s exchange rate , as most consumer goods are imported ) , on top of the normal nearly 6 per cent mortgage interest , leading a number of Icelanders to tell me they had lost their home to foreclosing bankers .
Nobody can pay 23 per cent interest rates on mortgages for long while house prices are plunging , along with the economy at large .
Most families are now paying by running down their savings , trying to carry debts that are practically unpayable .
This explains the population ’s desire for a stable currency .
It would remove the onerous interest rate add - on .
Originally , wages as well as debts were indexed , Brazilian style .
But one day the wage index was dropped , keeping the financial index on the spurious rationalization that it was a “ contractual ” payment for property , and agreements with labor were less legally grounded .
In other words , big fish eat little fish .
No creditor class , regardless of how greedy and aggressive , has ever achieved anything like this law .
Yet Iceland let it happen – despite the country ’s heavy homeownership - on - credit .
Joining the euro is widely viewed as easier than changing the law to get rid of this debt fee , unique to Iceland among all countries of the world .
I find this legalistic inertia incredible , but it seems to be a testament to Iceland ’s faith in law , however crazy that may be .
The currency collapse was caused by the bankruptcy and nationalization of Iceland ’s three major banks ( Glitnir , Kaupthing and Landsbanki ) , which engaged in a wave of hubristic incompetence and outright fraud after being privatized in a series of insider dealings in 2002 - 03 .
These banks went under owing nearly $ 100 billion , but nobody knows just how much , or even who really is on the other end of many of the transactions involved .
A special prosecutor has been retained to discover the details , which are still opaque .
n fact , Iceland is in many ways like the post -Soviet kleptocracies .
But instead of emerging out of Komsomol , Red Directors and other vestiges of the Communist Party ’s bureaucracy , Iceland ’s kleptocrats emerged from the great landowners and politically powerful families that have dominated the nation for centuries , long before it achieved independence from Denmark in 1944 , at a time when Denmark was overrun by the Nazis and independence represented a pro-Allied position .
Privatization of Iceland ’s fishing grounds and their licenses
When the North Atlantic became free of German U - boats after the war , British trawlers competed with Icelandic fishing boats for the rich cod and other fish .
After a series of showdowns extending into the 1970s , Iceland became the leader in establishing the 200 - mile limit to define international sea rights – thanks largely to U.S. support , which Iceland has reciprocated politically ever since .
The Law of the Sea treaty deals with the issue of to whom the natural resources of the seas belong .
To maintain the fish population ( at least , that is the stated logic ) , Iceland issued licenses representing a specified proportion of the annual permitted catch , whose magnitude was set each year based on the estimated fish population .
In contrast to classical economic practice , these licenses were not auctioned off each year by the government so as to recover fair value for the nation ’s natural resource in the sea .
Rather , the licenses were issued much like taxicab licenses in New York City : once issued , they became permanent , and naturally have risen in market price over time .
The initial holders – the leading political insiders a century ago – have bequeathed them to their heirs , to be rented out to the actual fishermen or simply kept them in the family .
Iceland ’s Treasury receives no benefit from harvest the seas .
Licenses simply have become a rent - extraction fee , a payment to the former insiders and their successors .
Under competitive bidding , the potential licensee would calculate the market value of whatever resources they reckon can be extracted , calculate their costs of extraction and their targeted profit margin .
The sea legally belongs to the Icelandic people , and the government would receive the proceeds .
But today , the heirs or others who obtained the quota licenses from the original insiders from the 1980s receive this money .
So it is no surprise that many Icelanders are so disgusted at the privatization of fishing licenses that they may not care if Iceland loses its fishing rights .
After all , under the current rent - extracting system , the losers would be the owners of these artificially designed licenses , not the Icelandic people .
But this attitude loses sight of a highly desirable alternative – one that should appeal on free market grounds to the two traditional centrist parties as well as to the “ left ” because it is so economically fair :
Auction off the fishing quotas each year , with the benefit going to the Icelandic people as part of the public budget , as should be the case with natural resources including the land itself .
It is not necessary to join Europe , give its insiders fishing rights and its bankers the rights to create credit ( which should be viewed as a public utility ) to achieve fiscal efficiency .
The Icesave tangle with Britain
The other conflict with Britain concerns the Landsbanki ’s Icesave branches , which paid high enough interest rates to convince the Labour government to direct its local neighborhood councils to show “ fiduciary responsibility ” by placing their savings where rates were highest .
It was as if high interest premiums were not a compensation for risk .
And because Icesave took the form of local branches of Icelandic banks , Britain took no role in regulation or oversight of its own .
I find this typical British economic incompetence , but it is in the character of incompetent governments to try to blame whomever else they can .
So they reimbursed their depositors in full , and demanded that Iceland ’s government tax its own people as if these deposits were public loans !
To force the issue , Britain froze the accounts of all its Icelandic bank branches , including those of Kaupthing on the Isle of Man .
This prevented them from remitting funds out of the country , forcing the head offices back in Iceland into insolvency .
The only law at hand for this financial grab was emergency anti-terrorist legislation , presumably against Irish and Arab groups .
Britain branded Iceland as a terrorist country , while acting in a financially violent way itself .
Icelanders naturally found it unreasonable that after having taken high interest charges , Britain should insist that its depositors not suffer any capital loss at all – in contrast to the huge losses they suffered in the U.S. and other foreign markets ( not to mention Northern Rock and other reckless domestic mortgage lenders ) .
But with some Icelanders thinking of bank debts as “ our ” debts , why not make as large demands as possible , despite the double standard obviously at work ?
( Imagine what the response would be if , say , Germany would accuse America of being a terrorist economy in order to seize U.S. assets to compensate for the losses that banks in Düsseldorf and Saxony suffered on U.S. subprime mortgages . )
Many U.S. newspaper reporters played along by calling Iceland “ Vikings ” and preferring to “ Viking finance ” to the more politically sensitive “ oligarchy . ”
But the implication of a rough - and - tumble Nordic Wild West is silly .
Iceland has no standing army , and America ’s former NATO base has become Reykjavik ’s international airport ( and a long drive it is into the city proper – but pleasantly scenic through the volcanic island and the almost perpetual rainbows resulting from the fact that it always seems to be raining somewhere in the sea- laden air ) .
Iceland ’s hard - working and closely - knit population is as middle - class as one could imagine , with the world ’s highest home ownership rates , high educational standards , and typically Nordic social welfare system and communalist values .
It is a Scandinavian - type social democracy , but much more local in scale .
And that may be part of the problem .
Many Icelanders are so middle - class that they believe that paying bad bank gambles is a matter of honor , as if these were personal debts among neighbors .
But the big banks were not like most neighbors , and engaged in deep financial fraud .
This required complicity of the foreigners now demanding to be recompensed .
The IMF typically acts as a collection agent for global creditors , but in Iceland ’s case its local mission seems to feel uncomfortable in this role .
No IMF funds have yet been drawn down from the $ 10 billion line of credit recently negotiated .
I was impressed that the finance ministry was not going to draw down IMF funds to pay foreigners .
Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson heads the Green Party and is dubious about how much such borrowing – or joining the EU – can help matters by the government borrowing to stabilize today ’s inherently unstable situation .
This leaves the question of Iceland ’s krónur relative to the euro .
As long as the creditor - oriented 17 per cent foreign - exchange index is added onto mortgages , Icelandic homeowners ( about 90 per cent of the population ) understandably will want to see price stability .
But the euro will not necessarily provide this .
It would merely impose austerity , shrinking the economy to cut back imports .
The way to revive the currency is for the economy to grow , and this means getting rid of debt indexing , a free lunch that no other nation on earth has given the financial sector .
There is much confusion as to what “ joining Europe ” means in practice .
For Central and Eastern European members of the former Soviet Union , beauty was in the eye of the beholder .
They voted to join the EU in the early 1990s under the impression that the EU would take them under its protective wing to help them install a modernized Western - style industrial capitalism with rising living standards .
Instead , the EU leadership looked at these post - economies simply as markets for their own farm and industrial exports , and for its banks to make a killing by entering into a virtual partnership with the Soviet - style kleptocrats who dominated these economies .
The EU looked the other way when it saw crooks taking over and indeed , actively supporting them as long as these crooks sold to the Europeans much as a burglar sells to a fence , privatizing the public domain in insider dealings , selling off property and stock to European investors , and borrowing in foreign currency to fuel the world ’s most extreme ( and unstable ) real estate bubble .
Collapse of this false start is tearing the euro apart .
The case of Latvia and its Baltic neighbors is instructive .
Much like Iceland , they were burdened with a debt overhead far beyond their ability to pay – mortgage debts denominated in foreign currency , so that they cannot avail themselves of the time - honored policy of inflating their way out of debt .
Nor will it help for the government to borrow from the IMF and EU to pay the debts of its insolvent real estate to Swedish and other foreign banks .
Public - sector borrowing to bail out bad private - sector debts involves squeezing the money out of the domestic population by even higher taxes on labor , pricing it ( and hence , domestic industry ) out of world markets .
In this condition the economy is unable to earn enough to cover its import dependency and the debt service with which it has been burdened .
This is the problem that Iceland must avoid .
Unfortunately , the EU ’s treatment of the post - Soviet economies has shown how predatory and defensive of narrow national interests it can be .
Joaqim Almunia of the European Commission made this clear in a letter of January 26 , 2009 , to Latvia ’s Prime Minister spelling out the terms on which Europe would bail out the foreign banks operating in Latvia – at Latvia ’s own expense .
He was explicit that Latvia not use EU loans to develop its economy or to lighten the tax burden blocking new employment , but only to pay off debts to its creditors in the West ( mainly Scandinavian banks ) and to buy imports from them .
Extended assistance is to be used to avoid a balance of payments crisis , which requires … restoring confidence in the banking sector [ now entirely foreign owned ] , and bolstering the foreign reserves of the Bank of Latvia .
… financial assistance is not meant to be used to originate new loans to businesses and households .
… it is important not to raise ungrounded expectations among the general public and the social partners , and , equally , to counter misunderstandings that may arise in this respect .
Worryingly , we have witnessed some recent evidence in Latvian public debate of calls for part of the financial assistance to be used inter alia for promoting export industries or to stimulate the economy through increased spending at large .
It is important actively to stem these misperceptions .
This leaves Latvia in much the position of a nation defeated in war and having to pay reparations .
Riots broke out , and protesters stormed the Treasury .
It was a scene that has been repeated in Hungary , Ukraine and other countries recently , akin to Latin America ’s “ IMF riots ” of the 1960s and ’70s .
It does not give much hope that joining Europe would , in itself , help Iceland solve its own similar economic clean - up needs .
Instead of helping the post - Soviet nations develop self - reliant economies , the West viewed them as economic oysters to be broken open , sucked dry to extract interest charges and capital gains , and left as empty shells .
After the domestic kleptocrats , foreign banks and investors have removed their funds from the economy , the Latvian lat will be permitted to depreciate .
Foreign buyers then can come in and pick up local assets on the cheap once again .
This sounds remarkably like what Iceland has been going through .
The danger is that it might surrender to European interests seeking to appropriate its fishing rights , obtain a monopoly on private bank credit , and lend to the government to bail out European investors who speculated and lost with the now - defunct Icelandic banks .
One would hope that the Greens and Progressive Party would review the possible terms of entry into the EU and adoption of the euro , but not replace a domestic kleptocracy with foreign economic occupiers just because they are European .
This would merely replace one group of politically well - connected insiders with others , largely to the benefit of Britain .
If we apply the traditional left / right dichotomies to the results of Saturday ’s election , the pro-Europe approach seems right wing in promoting financial interests ( economic austerity to subordinate debtor to creditor interests , and debt deflation to dismantle public welfare spending ) .
Social Democratic parties throughout the world have been the most ideologically extreme privatizers , from Tony Blair ’s New Labour to Roger Douglas ’s New Zealand Labour Party and the Australian Labour Party .
Iceland ’s Social Democrats are threatening to “ fast - track ” Europe , and to hold a take - it - or - leave - it referendum on whether to join on the terms her party negotiates , without bringing the citizenry into the process .
Prime - minister elect Johanna Sigurdardottir hopes to start negotiations to join the EU within two months , and to hold a referendum on joining it by the end of next year .
As far as parliamentary democracy is concerned , this plan is similar to the Independence and Progressive party leaders agreeing to join the Coalition of the Willing in Iraq , ignoring proper procedures by not consulting the Althing .
Meanwhile , the EU and euro are in danger of breaking up as the post - Soviet economies devalue , imposing austerity without having developed their economies outside of real estate .
Yet I found little recognition of how the euro and indeed the expanded EU is being torn apart by the unstable post - Soviet economies that have no visible means of financing their structural trade deficits , now that the real estate bubble has burst and there is no more foreign - currency mortgage lending into these unfortunate countries .
Europe ’s monetary management is looking nearly as irresponsible as Iceland ’s did .
The failure of EU tutelage in the Baltics and Central Europe suggests that Iceland would do best to set about solving its own problems , pursuing its national interest while cleaning up the residue from its disastrous neoliberal experiment .
A true market reform would replace the remnants of feudal power with auctioned fishing rent rights so as to keep them as the tax base , and to restore a viable public banking system .
Ultimately at issue is Iceland ’s economic independence itself .

Mac developers intrigued by Ruby 's ease of use and simple maintainability but deterred by its turgid performance will be happy to hear that MacRuby 0.5 - aka its " experimental branch " - is remarkably snappy .
Exactly how snappy is remarkably snappy ?
A suite of low - level benchmark tests recently performed by Antonio Cangiano of Zen and the Art of Programming shows MacRuby 0.5 to be on average just under three times as fast as Ruby 1.9.1 , with some operations coming in at nearly eight times faster .
According to Cagiano : " MacRuby ... has the potential to become a game changer - at least for Mac developers .
Based on Ruby 1.9 , MacRuby ’s main aim is to provide programmers with the ability to write Mac OS X applications in Ruby , making Ruby a first - class Cocoa programming language . "
The MacRuby open - source development project is sponsored by Apple , which includes an introduction to the language on its Developer Connection website .
You can also download a free version of the most - recently qualified development version , MacRuby 0.4 , from Apple 's software vault .
MacRuby 's raison d'être is to overcome the performance limitations of RubyCocoa , which functions as a speed - robbing intercommunication bridge between the Mac OS X Objective - C runtime component and the standard Ruby interpreter .
Simply put , the MacRuby project is working to create a Ruby implementation that sits directly on top of the Objective - C runtime , eliminating the RubyCocoa bridge .
Cagiano claimed that MacRuby 0.4 - which allows a developer to deliver an application in a standard Mac OS X .app package - is both stable and effective .
However , he said that MacRuby ’s real promise lies in MacRuby 0.5 , which he called " freakishly fast . "
It appears that Mac developers may soon have another full - fledged - and either remarkably snappy or freakishly fast - Cocoa - compliant development language with which to deliver desktop applications .

I have an open question for the people who complain about the potential of advertising networks to track your behavior on the Internet :
What is a better way ?
Some might say that all behavioral targeting should simply be banned .
But if you do n’t think that showing Chevy ads to people looking for cars is equivalent to poisoning the peanut butter , we need a middle ground that explains to people what ’s going on and lets them decide what is acceptable .
This is much harder than it sounds :
Any one Web page you visit can have a dozen advertisements and invisible bits of code that each send information about you to different companies , each with different ways of using that data .
The privacy policy of the site you are looking at — not that anyone reads privacy policies — can’t even try to explain this to you , because the site owner does n’t even know what all of its advertisers are doing .
Joseph Turow
I ’m coming to the conclusion that each advertisement on a page has to speak for itself .
That ’s implicit in the approach Google is taking for its new behavioral targeting system .
It puts the phrase “ Ads by Google ” on all its advertisements .
Click that link and you ’ll get some limited information about Google ’s targeting system and an ability to adjust some of the interests that Google is tracking .
But Google ’s approach is presented in a way that glosses over what they are doing and discourages people from reading the disclosure and exercising control , says Joseph Turow , a marketing professor at the Annenberg School for Communication of the University of Pennsylvania .
Mr. Turow has developed a plan that is simpler and more comprehensive :
Put an icon on each ad that signifies that the ad collects or uses information about users .
If you click the icon , you will go to what he calls a “ privacy dashboard ” that will let you understand exactly what information was used to choose that ad for you .
And you ’ll have the opportunity to edit the information or opt out of having any targeting done at all .
“ I do n’t think ‘ Ads by Google ’ is enough , ' ” he said .
“ The problem with the whole rhetoric Google is using is that it is designed to stop you from wanting to learn more and do something . ”
In his mockup , Mr. Turow ’s icon has a T for targeting and a question mark .
I would propose a bull ’s - eye or maybe some sort of creepy eyeball .
What I like about the idea of an icon is that users can learn which ads collect data without having to do anything other than surf the way they normally would .
When they do get curious , you can click on the icon and learn more .
I asked Nicole Wong , the deputy general counsel of Google who looks after privacy issues , about Mr. Turow ’s concept .
She defended the phrase “ Ads by Google ” on the grounds of simplicity .
Anything more risks confusing users .
“ I wonder , would the user really understand what a behaviorally targeted ad is compared to a contextual ad ? ” she said , saying the company is open to changing the phrasing of the text of its notice .
The information that Google shows to people who click on the link on these ads is also similar to , but more limited than , what Mr. Turow proposes .
Mr. Turow ’s dashboard is meant to explain exactly why you are seeing a particular ad .
You will see what part of it was customized — the product , the price , the image and so on .
You will also see the data used — your surfing habits , outside data vendors , inferences from your I.P. address , etc .
You can click to learn more specifics about exactly where the data came from and to delete or modify the information used about you .
Google does n’t tell you why you saw a particular ad , nor does it promise to tell you everything it knows about you .
But it is showing you more than any other major ad network has done before :
You can see which of 600 categories it infers you might be interested in based on what sites ( that show Google ads ) you visited in the past .
It lets you add and delete items from its list of interests .
Ms. Wong said Google is trying “ to give meaningful information the user can make decisions on but not to bury them . ”
She added , “ Too much text , too many choices , becomes overwhelming . ”
In fact , most people in the Internet advertising business think that even Google is going too far .
They say that there is no evidence that many users would actually want that much information about their browsing history or have any use for actually editing the profile used to show them ads .
After all , few people on the Internet customize much of anything .
Mr. Turow agrees that most people will not use this dashboard most of the time , but they will be very glad that it is there when they need it .
“ When people begin to smell a rat with regard to their reputation or they feel they are being discriminated against , they will use it , ” he said .
I agree .
As a journalist , I ’ve learned that specifics can communicate much better and faster than the over - broad language of lawyers .
If a company puts its cards down and shows me everything it knows about me , that ’s really the best way to decide whether what it is doing is too creepy .
I ’m not concerned that most people wo n’t bother doing all this ; some will , and they ’ll tell everyone else .
Only a handful of people read all the specs and reviews for digital cameras ; the rest of us ask our geeky friends what to buy .
Mr. Turow also points out that simply forcing companies to be more transparent about the sort of data they collect , visible to activists and reporters as well as customers , will be a check on their behavior .
“ When companies realize you have the ability to see what they are doing , they treat you better , ” he said .
Guy Nirpaz , Uri Cohen and Shay Banon came up with an interesting exercise as part of the recent partner training that took place at the GigaSpaces office .
In this exercise , the students were asked to come up with a scalable design for Twitter , using Space - Based Architecture .
There are some interesting scalability lessons from this exercise , which are applicable to anyone looking to implement new - style real - time web applications such as the ones used for social networking .
In this post I 'll try to summarize the main patterns to put into place and considerations to make when designing such a scalable architecture .
Background :
For those of you who are not yet familiar with the service , Twitter is sort of a SMS - service meets discussion board .
You can post short messages ( up to 140 characters ) that can be shared with a group of subscribers that are referred to as " followers " .
The main difference between twitter and other messaging applications is that both SMS and Instant Messaging ( IM ) applications were designed primarily for one - on - one communications whereis Twitter was designed primarily for broadcast communications ( publish / subscribe , or pub / sub ) .
Another aspect that is special about Twitter is that by default anyone can follow anyone else .
In other words , it was designed for open communications , not private , as were IM and SMS .
What are Twitter 's scalability challenges ?
1. Sending a tweet ( a message on Twitter is known as a ' tweet ' ) -–
The challenge is how to handle an ever - growing volume of tweets and re-tweets and responses that can lead to a viral " message storm "
2. Reading tweets –
The challenge is how to handle a large number of concurrent users that continually “ listen ” for tweets from users ( or topics ) they follow .
Designing A Scalable Twitter
Choosing the right scalability patterns
Almost every challenge in software architecture has its roots in one of the existing patterns .
So the simplest course is to start by looking for those patterns , and choosing the right patterns to scale the application .
Looking at many other scalable architectures , we 'll begin with a partitioning pattern as the core design principle .
By partitioning our Twitter - like application we 'll spread the load across a cluster of servers and scale by simply adding more servers ( i.e. , partitions ) .
Another important architectural observation about Twitter is that it does n’t fit into the classic database - centric design that most web applications do .
On the flip side , it does n’t fit well with a messaging - centric design ( pub / sub ) either .
It is a combination of the two .
A pattern that is suitable for this type of collaborative messaging is known as a blackboard pattern .
In our design , we will use those two design patterns -- partitioning and blackboard -- as the foundation for our scalable Twitter application .
With the foundation in place , let ’s list the requirements and examine how these patterns can be used to scale the app .
Scalability Requirements
We 'll assume a relatively extreme scaling requirement :
Tweet Volume : 10 billion tweets per day
Tweet Storage : 100 Gigabytes per day ( with 10:1 compression )
Additional assumptions :
Tweets are limited to 140 characters
Tweets are immutable , i.e. , there are no updates , only inserts
Twitter limits client applications to 70 requests per hour
Now that we have the foundational patterns and clear requirements , we can design the architecture .
We 'll start first with the blackboard system .
Using an In - Memory Data Grid ( IMDG ) as a Blackboard System
The are several approaches to building a blackboard system .
To maximize performance and scalability , we 'll store the data in memory , thus avoiding disk I/O , which is often the main cause for contention .
For years , Java has provided a model for designing blackboard systems known as JavaSpaces .
More recently , distributed caching has become popular and can provide similar capabilities to those of JavaSpaces .
Let 's examine two popular distributed caching approaches for our blackboard system :
Simple read - mostly caching using memcached Read / write caching , also known as an In - Memory Data Grid ( IMDG )
Choosing between memcached and an IMDG
Memcached enables us to to store the data ( tweets ) in a distributed memory set and read it in a scalable fashion .
Having said that , be aware that memcached is not transactionally - safe and is not designed for reliability ( i.e. , it does n’t support fail - over and high availability ) .
That means that if we use memcached or something similar , we will have to use a database as the back - end .
Every tweet posted will have to be written to both memcached and the database in a synchronous fashion to ensure that no tweet will be lost .
This approach may be good enough for scaling read access , however , for writes and updates it offers limited scalability .
Unlike memcached , which was designed for simple read - mostly caching , In - Memory Data Grids are designed for handling a read / write scenario , and can therefore act as the system - of - record for both write and read operations .
We can still use a database for long - term persistence , but because the IMDG maintains its reliability purely in memory , we can write and update the database asynchronously and avoid hitting the database bottleneck .
Todd Hoff , author of highscalability .com wrote an interesting summary that covers the different products in this space in a recent post : Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing ?
Todd provide a clear explanation of how an IMDG works ( using GigaSpaces ) :
A POJO ( Plain Old Java Object ) is written through a proxy using a hash - based data routing mechanism to be stored in a partition on a Processing Unit .
Attributes of the object are used as a key .
This is straightforward hash based partitioning like you would use with memcached .
You are operating through GigaSpace 's framework / container so they can automatically handle things like messaging , sending change events , replication , failover , master - worker pattern , map - reduce , transactions , parallel processing , parallel query processing , and write - behind to databases .
Scaling is accomplished by dividing your objects into more partitions and assigning the partitions to Processing Unit instances which run on nodes -- a scale - out strategy .
Objects are kept in RAM and the objects contain both state and behavior .
A Service Grid component supports the dynamic creation and termination of Processing Units .
Back to our Twitter app : Given the scalability requirements , we will need to scale both reads and writes , and therefore , an IMDG is a more suitable approach to implementing the blackboard system .
Now let ’s examine how the use of an IMDG as the blackboard system enables us to scale both sending and reading tweets .
Let 's start by designing the partitioned cluster .
Designing a partition architecture
One of the main considerations in designing a partition cluster of any kind is determining the partition key , such as a Customer ID in a CRM application or a Trade ID in a trading application .
At first glance , it sounds like a trivial decision , but choosing the right partitioning key requires a deep understanding of the application usage patterns and data model .
In the case of Twitter , we could choose to partition the application by the data - type , the user , the tweet itself or the followers .
Our first goal is selecting a key that will that will be granular enough to enable scaling the application just by adding more partitions , while making sure that we do n't end up with a key that is too fine - grained -- making it sub-optimal for querying purposes .
If we use the timestamp key , for example , our application will be optimized for “ inserts ” ( writes ) , however , even a simple query such “ retrieve the tweets of a certain user ” will force us to execute an aggregated query against all partitions .
Alternatively , if we partition the data based on user - id , we 'll be able to easily spread the load from different users across partitions .
Retrieving the tweets of a certain user is going to be resolved in one call to a single partition .
We may encounter a problem if a single user generates a significant higher load than average , however , in the case of Twitter , we can assume that this is not very likely .
Partitioning by user - id is a good compromise .
Data capacity analysis
With such extreme requirements it is clear that storing all tweets in memory is going to require huge memory capacity .
Very quickly this will become economically prohibitive , so we need to devise a scheme in which the IMDG acts as a buffer for most of the load on the system , and then offloads the data and queries to an underlying persistent storage .
In our Twitter example , it is fair to assume that most real - time queries ( those that require fast access to the data ) will be resolved in data from the last hour or 24 hours .
Queries that require older data will need to hit the database for the initial call .
However , subsequent access to fetch new updates should be resolved purely in - memory .
Using this approach , we 'll need about 10 servers , each holding 10 GB of data in memory to accommodate 24 hours of activity .
If we also want to back up the data in memory , we will need double the amount of servers .
Choosing the right eviction policy
It 's reasonable to assume that recent data is accessed most and older data is rarely used .
To ensure that we get the maximum hit ratio on our memory front - end , let 's choose a time - based eviction policy , which always holds the most recent updates in memory .
When we will reach our memory capacity limit the oldest data will automatically get evicted from memory .
The actual window of time in which we will be able to keep in memory is obviously dependent on the size of the cluster .
With an IMDG implementation all tweets are stored in a persistent storage , which means that when tweets are evicted they are not deleted from the system .
Scaling tweet writes :
If we select user - id as the partitioning key , each user tweet will be sent to a specific partition .
Multiple users may be routed to the same partition .
Usually the algorithm to determine which partition fits a certain user is something like :
routing - key.hashCode ( ) % # of partitions
In GigaSpaces , this is done by marking the routing attribute of our tweet class with an @SpaceRouting annotation .
The web front - end application will call space .
write ( new Tweet ( .. ) , .. ) to send the tweets .
This way there is nothing in our web client code that exposes the fact that the underlying implementation interacts with a cluster of partitions ( spaces in GigaSpaces ) .
Those details are abstracted within the space proxy .
When the write method is called on the space proxy it parses the field that matches @ SpaceRouting from our Tweet ( ) object and uses this field value to calculate the partition it belongs to .
It then uses that value to route the Tweet ( .. ) object to the appropriate partition .
With this approach , the web application can be written in a very simple way and can interact with the entire cluster as if it was a single server .
The data from the memory partitions gets stored asynchronously into a persistent storage .
The persistent storage could be a database , but it could also be other things , such as an index search engine based on Compass / Lucene .
Scaling tweet reads :
To those familiar with messaging system , at first glance Twitter looks like a classic publish subscribe application .
A closer look , however , reveals that any attempt to implement Twitter with something like a JMS message queue is going to fail in achieving a scalable system .
This is especially true if you consider that the system needs to maintain a durable queue for each user .
That could easily lead to a scenario in which each tweet is published to thousands of subscribers and every re-tweet can potentially lead to a " message storm " .
As I discuss above , the right way to think about this type of application is as a blackboard pattern , just as a blackboard ( or these days , a whiteboard ) is used by a group of people ( followers , in the case of Twitter ) to share information and collaborate .
When someone writes something on the board , everyone sees it and can choose to react .
Unlike messaging ( take email for example ) , we do n’t need to send separate messages to each subscriber .
Instead everyone is looking at the same board .
Everything is also copied from the board to paper .
When the board runs out of space , we erase it .
And we can always page through the paper copy to access the board history .
In Twitter , this means that each follower that follows a group of people is basically polling for messages posted by those users from the last time he read them .
To make things more tangible we can express this type of query with the following SQL syntax :
SELECT * FROM Post WHERE UserID=< id> AND PostedOn > < from date > .
The < from date > will normally be the last few minutes , if we 're constantly looking for new messages .
But there 's a caveat .
Remember that we partitioned the application by user - id ?
This means that each user 's tweets are stored in a separate partition .
How can we read all users ' posts ?
If we poll for each user individually , we will end up with a lot of network calls .
The simplest approach would be to execute one call that looks for ALL the users we 're following and look for updates ( new tweets ) from those users .
The pattern we 'll use to perform such this task is mapreduce .
One way to do that with GigaSpaces is through the distributed task API :
The distributed task API is a modern version of the stored procedure .
The following snippet shows what such a call would look like :
AsyncFuture < Long > future = gigaSpace.execute( new GetTweetsUpdates ( ) ) ;
long result = future.get ( ) ; // result will be the number of primary spaces
The GetTweetsUpdates ( ) class contains code that will be injected in each partition and will enable us to look for updates from the users we follow in a single call .
Because the call runs in - process , and because the data is stored in - memory , executing such a task is extremely fast compared with the equivalent with database and stored procedure operations .
Execution is aggregated to the caller implicitly .
The caller can use a reducer to aggregate the results into a single result object .
Scaling the web front- end
Nothing really new here .
We 'll use a classic web front - end , which is comprised of a load - balancer and a cluster of web servers that act as a front end to our IMDG instances .
The web application will use a single cluster - aware IMDG proxy to send new tweet posts .
The IMDG proxy will be responsible for mapping the tweet with the actual partition that hosting the tweet .
That logic is kept completely out of the application code .
This allows us to keep our web tier clean and simple .
Keeping the web layer stateless to avoid session stickiness
One common pattern for keeping the web tier scalable is to use a Shared - Nothing Architecture , which basically means that the web tier will be stateless .
This requires keeping the user session state external to the web - tier .
As previously demonstrated , the IMDG can be used as high - performance , scalable data store for maintaining shared session state information .
This allows us to avoid session stickiness and to scale the web tier without being locked in to a specific server throughout the entire session , in case the server is over - loaded .
For more information on how to scale the web tier , as well as other important capabilities such as self - healing and auto - scaling , see the following tutorial : Scaling Your Web Application .
Making it simple and cost - effective using cloud computing
Twitter is yet another example for a situation in which system load is highly variable and the difference between average load and peak load can be quite significant .
In such cases , provisioning our system can be fairly hard and costly .
This is where cloud computing and SLA - driven deployments can help us scale on demand and pay only for what we use .
Once we figured out a way to partition the application , it 's going to be much simpler to package the application into self - sufficient units ( referred to in GigaSpaces as processing - units ) and scale the application simply by adding or removing these units on demand .

Final words
Scaling a real - time web application such as Twitter or Facebook introduces unique challenges that are are quite different from those of a " classic " database - centric application .
The most profound difference is the fact that unlike with traditional sites , Twitter is a heavy read / write application , and not read - mostly .
This seemingly minor difference can break most existing models for web application scalability .
Using a combination of memcached +
MySQL is not going to cut it for this type of application .
The good news is that with the right patterns and set of tools , building a scalable architecture that meets such challenges is n’t that difficult .
There are already plenty of success stories that demonstrate that , such as the following example from highscalability.com : Handle 1 Billion Events Per Day Using a Memory Grid
The proposed architecture is by no means perfect and can be further optimized to meet even better performance and latency , but that will come at the cost of simplicity .
I believe that the proposed architecture should get you pretty far as - is .
Avoid going through more advanced optimizations until the point they are an absolute must .

Our sleuthing follows the tail of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , an alleged ( and in all likelihood ) al Qaeda operative originally detained in 2001 as a material witness to the FBI 's investigation of 9/11 .
Al - Marri was arrested in Peoria , Illinois and was eventually charged with credit card fraud ; a trail date was then set for June of 2003 .
Evidence of these events can be found within a 2007 court judgment which we will be discussing later on ; I 've excerpted the relevant information below :
In February 2002 , al - Marri was charged in the Southern District of New York with the possession of unauthorized or counterfeit credit - card numbers with the intent to defraud .
A year later , in January 2003 , he was charged in a second , six - count indictment , with two counts of making a false statement to the FBI , three counts of making a false statement on a bank application , and one count of using another person 's identification for the purpose of influencing the action of a federally insured financial institution .
Al - Marri pleaded not guilty to all of these charges .
In May 2003 , a federal district court in New York dismissed the charges against al - Marri for lack of venue .
The Government then returned al - Marri to Peoria and he was reindicted in the Central District of Illinois on the same seven counts , to which he again pleaded not guilty .
The district court set a July 21 , 2003 trial date .
On Friday , June 20 , 2003 , the court scheduled a hearing on pre-trial motions , including a motion to suppress evidence against al - Marri assertedly obtained by torture .
On the following Monday , June 23 , before that hearing could be held , the Government moved ex parte to dismiss the indictment based on an order signed that morning by the President .

Before al - Marri could face his June 23rd trail , President Bush declared him an " Enemy Combatant " and initiated the process required to transfer him to the South Carolina equivalent of Guantanamo Bay .
While imprisoned in South Carolina , the Federal District Court heeded the Government 's request to dismiss all charges filed against al - Marri .
Reading further in the aforementioned 2007 judgment reveals additional details of the just described sequence of events :
In the order , President George W. Bush stated that he " DETERMINE [ D ] for the United States of America that " al - Marri : ( 1 ) is an enemy combatant ; ( 2 ) is closely associated with al Qaeda ; ( 3 ) " engaged in conduct that constituted hostile and war - like acts , including conduct in preparation for acts of international terrorism ; " ( 4 ) " possesses intelligence . . . that . . . would aid U.S. efforts to prevent attacks by al Qaeda ; " and ( 5 ) " represents a continuing , present , and grave danger to the national security of the United States . "
The President determined that al - Marri 's detention by the military was " necessary to prevent him from aiding al Qaeda " and thus ordered the Attorney General to surrender al- Marri to the Secretary of Defense , and the Secretary of Defense to " detain him as an enemy combatant . "
The federal district court in Illinois granted the Government 's motion to dismiss the criminal indictment against al- Marri .
In accordance with the President 's order , al - Marri was then transferred to military custody and brought to the Naval Consolidated Brig in South Carolina .

Al - Marri 's counsel filed a petition , on his behalf , on July 8th , 2003 seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the Illinois jurisdiction of his original arrest ; this petition was later dismissed citing a " lack of venue . "
Exactly one year later , his representation filed another similar petition in the South Carolina District Court , again requesting writ to habeas corpus .
The Government responded on September 4th by citing the Declaration of Jeffrey N. Rapp , Director of the Joint Intelligence Task Force for Combating Terrorism , as support for the President 's order to detain al - Marri as an enemy combatant .
Mr. Rapp 's declaration was 16 pages long and became known as the Rapp Declaration .
The Rapp Declaration is presented below with a few pertinent excerpts highlighted with regard to a future article :

Hanft , Case Number 2:04-2257-26 AJ , pending in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina .
3 . ( U ) Based on the information that I haw acquired in the course of my official duties , I am familiar with all the matters discussed in this Declaration .
I am also familiar with the interviews of Ali Saleh Mohamed Kahlah Al - Marri ( Al - Marri ) conducted by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by personnel of the Department of Defense ( DoD ) once the DoD took custody of Al - Marri on 23 lune 2003 after he was declared an enemy combatant by the President of the United States .
... Overview 8 . ( S//NF ) Al - Marri , also known as Abdulkareemm A. Almuslam , is currently being detained in the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston , South Carolina .
The President of the United States has determined that he is closely associated with al Qaeda , an international terrorist organization with which the United States is at war .
All detailed below , Al - Marri is an al Qaeda" sleeper " agent sent to the United States for the purpose of engaging in and facilitating terrorist activities subsequent to September 11 , 2001 .
Al - Marri currently possesses information of high intelligence value , including information about personnel activities of al Qaeda .
Prior to arriving in the United States on September 10.2001 , Al - Marri met personally with Usama Bin Laden ( Bin Laden ) and volunteered for a martyr mission or to do anything else that al Qaeda requested .
Al - Marri was assisted in his al Qaeda assignment to the United States by at least two high - level al Qaeda members : September 11 , 2001 mastermind Khalid Shaykh Muhammed ( KSM ) ; and al Qaeda financier and September 11 , 2001 moneyman Mustafa Ahmed Al - Hawsawi ( Al - Hawsawi ) .
Al Qaedasent Al - Marri to the United States to facilitate other aI Qaeda operatives in carrying out post - September 11 , 2001 terror attack .
Al Qaeda also asked Al - Marri to explore computer hacking methods and the U.S. financial system .
In addition , Al - Marri was trained by al Qaeda in the use of poisons and had detailed information concerning poisonous chemicals stored on his laptop computer .
Information about Al - Marri 's relationship with and activities on behalf of al - Qaeda has been obtained from and corroborated by multiple intelligence sources .
... 27 . ( S//NF )
In addition , Al - Marri 's laptop computer contained numerous computer programs typically utilized by computer hackers ; " proxy " computer software which can be utilized to hide a user 's origin or identity when connected to the internet ; and bookmarked lists of favorite websites apparently devoted to computer hacking .
Al Qaeda had tasked Al - Marri with exploring the possibility of hacking into the main frame computers of banks inside the U.S. to wipe out balances and otherwise wreak havoc with banking records in order to damages the U.S. economy .
Al - Marri had discussed with al Qaeda other hacking operations as well , including hacking into the computers of banks and credit card companies , obtaining credit card account numbers , and using the these numbers to book airline reservations on five or six flights .
This in accord with the belief that fulling booking flight with false reservations would result in loses to the airlines industry .
... Conclusion 35 .
( U ) In conclusion , investigation has determined that Al - Marri was an active al Qaeda operative at the time of his entry into the United States on September 10 , 2001 .
Al - Marri was sent to the United States at the behest of al Qaeda .
Upon his arrival in the United States .
Al - Marri engaged in conduct in preparation for acts of international terrorism intended to cause injury or adverse effects on the United States .
Al - Marri 's status has been subject to a rigorous review process and it has been determined that Al - Marri represents a continuing grave danger to the national security of the United States .
Al - Marri must be detained to prevent him .
from aiding al Qaeda in its efforts to attack the United States , its forces , other governmental personnel , or citizens .

Al - Marri was then permitted to respond to the Government 's evidence ; he contended that he was not an enemy combatant and moved for summary judgment .
The district court would eventually deny his motion , but the final say was delegated to a magistrate judge .
The magistrate judge eventually ruled that the Rapp Declaration provided sufficient grounds for classification as an enemy combatant ; the magistrate judge directed al - Marri to file rebuttal evidence .
In response to the magistrate judge , Al - Marri denied their assertion , but filed no rebuttal evidence citing the court 's burden to provide evidence of his guilt ; he argued that the Rapp Declaration did not suffice .
In 2006 , the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of al - Marri 's case and the district court adopted this suggestion ; al - Marri then signaled his intent to appeal .
The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit presided over al - Marri 's appeal and issued the following ruling on June 11th , 2007 .
The 4th Circuit unanimously reversed the district court 's ruling with regard to al - Marri 's habeas corpus argument .
The court did not however reach a unanimous verdict with respect to the issue of Executive power ; one of the three judges voted to uphold the district court 's ruling .
The full text of the majority ruling is presented below :
IV .
For the foregoing reasons , we reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing al - Marri 's petition for a writ of habeas corpus .
We remand the case to that court with instructions to issue a writ of habeas corpus directing the Secretary of Defense to release al - Marri from military custody within a reasonable period of time to be set by the district court .
The Government can transfer al - Marri to civilian authorities to face criminal charges , initiate deportation proceedings against him , hold him as a material witness in connection with grand jury proceedings , or detain him for a limited time pursuant to the Patriot Act .
But military detention of al - Marri must cease .

The 4th Circuit court then held an en banc rehearing on their previous ruling ; the date of the hearing was October 31 , 2007 .
On July 15th , 2008 they issued two 5 - 4 decisions ; their first ruling stated that if the Government 's allegations are in fact true , al - Marri could be held indefinitely within a military prison as an enemy combatant ; the court also ruled that al - Marri was not provided his constitutionally defined due process of law to determine whether the aforementioned allegations were in fact true .
The complete opinion of the en banc rehearing is quoted below :
ON REHEARING EN BANC ...
OPINION PER CURIAM : Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his military detention as an enemy combatant .
After the district court denied all relief , al - Marri noted this appeal .
A divided panel of this court reversed the judgment of the district court and ordered that al - Marri 's military detention cease .
See Al - Marri v. Wright , 487 F.3d 160 ( 4th Cir. 2007 ) .
Subsequently , this court vacated that judgment and considered the case en banc .
The parties present two principal issues for our consideration : ( 1 ) assuming the Government 's allegations about al - Marri are true , whether Congress has empowered the President to detain al - Marri as an enemy combatant ; and ( 2 ) assuming Congress has empowered the President to detain al - Marri as an enemy combatant provided the Government 's allegations against him are true , whether al - Marri has been afforded sufficient process to challenge his designation as an enemy combatant . *
Having considered the briefs and arguments of the parties , the en banc court now holds : ( 1 ) by a 5 to 4 vote ( Chief Judge Williams and Judges Wilkinson , Niemeyer , Traxler , and Duncan voting in the affirmative ; Judges Michael , Motz , King , and Gregory voting in the negative ) , that , if the Government 's allegations about al - Marri are true , Congress has empowered the President to detain him as an enemy combatant ; and ( 2 ) by a 5 to 4 vote ( Judges Michael , Motz , Traxler , King , and Gregory voting in the affirmative ; Chief Judge Williams and Judges Wilkinson , Niemeyer , and Duncan voting in the negative ) , that , assuming Congress has empowered the President to detain al - Marri as an enemy combatant provided the Government 's allegations against him are true , al - Marri has not been afforded sufficient process to challenge his designation as an enemy combatant .
Accordingly , the judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinions that follow .

* We deny the Government 's motion to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction .
The Government relied on section 7 of the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) of 2006 , Pub .
L. No. 109-366 , 120 Stat. 2600 , which amended the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) of 2005 , Pub . L. No. 109-148 , § 1005 ( e ) ( 1 ) , 119 Stat .
2680 , 2741 - 42 .
After we heard en banc argument in this case , the Supreme Court declared section 7 of the MCA unconstitutional .

A press release by the American Civil Liberties Union effectively describes the ramifications of the Supreme Court 's decision :
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court today vacated a lower court decision giving the president the extraordinary power to seize and indefinitely detain U.S. citizens or residents without charge or trial .
The case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , who , after being held for almost six years in military detention , was indicted last week in federal court and charged with two counts of material support for terrorism .
In July 2008 , the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in a fractured decision that the president had legal authority to imprison al - Marri indefinitely without charge .
As one judge noted in dissent , however , to accept the government 's claim of extraordinary detention power would have " disastrous consequences for the Constitution - and the country . "
The Supreme Court vacated that decision and dismissed the case as moot .
The following can be attributed to Jonathan Hafetz , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project and lead counsel in al - Marri 's case : " While we would have preferred a Supreme Court ruling that U.S. citizens and lawful residents detained in the U.S. cannot be held in military custody as ' enemy combatants ' without charges or trial , the Supreme Court nonetheless took an important step today by vacating a lower court decision that had upheld the Bush administration 's authority to designate al - Marri as an 'enemy combatant . '
Congress never granted the president that authority and the Constitution does not permit it .
We trust that the Obama administration will not repeat the abuses of the Bush administration having now chosen to prosecute Mr. al - Marri in federal court rather than defend the Bush administration 's actions in this case . "

Obama appears to be taking the necessary steps , at least in the eyes of public opinion , to limit his own power , but the legal door has yet to be closed .
Noah Feldman of Harvard University wrote an interesting and very informed op - ed in Thursday 's edition of the New York Times that discussed the entire al - Marri debacle as it relates to President Obama .
Prof. Feldman places Obama within the precipice of the legal doorway , unable , or perhaps unwilling to make an immediate or definitive decision with regard to his Executive power .
Desperate times call for desperate measures , and Obama 's inherited power could help alleviate the current angst on Wall Street ; we 'll provide further analysis later in the week .

Environmentalists say the measure was narrowly crafted to give citizens the unusual standing to sue the U.S. government as a way to force action on curbing emissions .
But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sees a new cottage industry for lawyers .
“ You could be spawning lawsuits at almost any place [ climate - change modeling ] computers place at harm 's risk , ” said Bill Kovacs , energy lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The bill was written by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman , California Democrat , and Rep. Edward J. Markey , Massachusetts Democrat .
Both lawmakers declined repeated requests for comment .
The Waxman - Markey blueprint , including the lawsuit provision , has just been released , and the Senate is drafting its own energy bill .
But Mr. Waxman has set an accelerated schedule for passing the bill through his committee by Memorial Day and President Obama lists an energy overhaul bill as one of his top priorities .
David Doniger , senior counsel with the Natural Resources Defense Council , said the measure is similar to a landmark environmental ruling from the Supreme Court allowing states to sue the federal government for damages from climate change - largely on the basis of lost shorelines from rising sea levels - but did not set grounds for people to file lawsuits .
“ The [ Chamber of Commerce ] is trying to say the global - warming legislation is scarier than global warming itself , ” Mr. Doniger said .
“ It 's part of a menu of scare tactics they are compiling . ”
Under the House bill , if a judge rules against the government , new rules would have to be drafted to alleviate the problems associated with climate change .
If a judge rules against a company , the company would have to purchase additional “ carbon emission allowances ” through a cap - and - trade program that is to be created by Congress .
The measure sets grounds for anyone “ who has suffered , or reasonably expects to suffer , a harm attributable , in whole or in part , ” to government inaction to file a “ citizen suit . ”
The term “ harm ” is broadly defined as “ any effect of air pollution ( including climate change ) , currently occurring or at risk of occurring . ”
It would allow citizens to seek up to $ 75,000 in damages from the government each year , but would cap the total amount paid out each year at $ 1.5 million , committee staff said .
It is unclear whether the provision would actually cap damages at $ 75,000 per person , because the U.S. law referenced does not establish payouts by the government .
The $ 1.5 million cap reflects a compromise reached with House Republicans in a 2007 version of the measure introduced by Mr. Waxman , committee staff said .
Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey wrote the measure into a broader climate plan introduced last week , although it was left out of a bill summary that committee staff provided at the time .
Republican committee staff said the measure has the potential to muddle the judicial system .
“ Perhaps a more accurate title of the bill would be ' The Lawyer Full - Employment and As - Seen - on - TV Global Warming Act of 2009 , ' ” said Larry Neal , deputy Republican staff director for the House committee .
Democratic staffers said the measure provides guidance to the courts on how to apply existing Clean Air Act provisions .
Private citizens can sue the government based on harm caused by pollutants currently regulated under the Clean Air Act - including nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide - but they lack standing to sue for damages resulting from climate change .
Regulating carbon dioxide has been a hard slog for environmentalists , and some energy analysts say that the Waxman - Markey bill and parallel efforts by the Obama administration constitute a multifaceted attempt to achieve the goal by regulation if legislative attempts fail .
The “ citizen suit ” would allow people to force government action on climate change , seemingly a redundancy in a bill that would achieve that goal if passed .
But environmentalists have been cautious in their tack , arguing that many environmental protections on the books were not vigorously enforced under the Bush administration .
Environmental lawyers played down the significance of the provision .
The measure would not guarantee payouts from the government or successful lawsuits , Mr. Doniger said , but would set the bar for people seeking to force the government to act on climate change .
He likened the measure to tort laws regarding cigarette smoke or cancer - causing chemicals , in which the harmful effects are not seen for decades .
“ If this pollution is n't curbed , it is n't just today or tomorrow you have problems , it 's also 20 to 30 years from now , ” Mr. Doniger said .
Expansion of the Clean Air Act to allow “ citizen suits ” on climate change has been a goal among environmental groups and moderate to liberal Democrats for many years - although the measure has never succeeded .
But amending the Clean Air Act is “ potentially a big gamble ” because it opens other sections of the act to modification during the bill - drafting process , said a Democratic energy lobbyist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of ties to committee members .

Prozesse - Dieter vor Gericht Der Rechtsausleger
Kaum ein Deutscher quält die Gerichte so beständig wie der frühere Sportlehrer Dieter K. aus Ratingen bei Düsseldorf : Mehr als 230 - mal musste sich die Justiz bereits mit ihm beschäftigen .
Nun ist der 73 - Jährige zu einem weiteren Jahr Gefängnis verurteilt worden .
A Bedouin resident of the Negev managed to complete the inconceivable feat when he stuffed two camels into his car in order to transport them to the West Bank Judea .
The camels ' reality is a lot less funny than the punch line of a joke starting with that same question is meant to be .
They are being brought to the West Bank for slaughter , after which their meat will be sold for consumption ....
" Once , goods used to be smuggled on camels .
Now we are smuggling the camels themselves , " joked Amir Abu Jamma , a resident of Ar'ara who photographed to unusual sight .
Abu Jamma said that the car 's driver explained to him that he was smuggling the camels to the Palestinian territories to be slaughtered and sold for meat .
" It is less expensive than lamb .
For the price of four sheep , you can buy one camel , " he explained .
Abu Jamma said that he had never seen camels being transported in a car .
" This is the first time .
It is surprising that one Subaru can hold two camels , " he said .
The Border Guard spokesperson reported that it has never encountered attempted efforts to smuggle camels into the territories , but noted that eating camel meat is a known phenomenon there .
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - A jobless Taiwan man released from prison two years ago asked police to send him back so he could eat , police and local media said Tuesday , a grim sign of hard economic times on the island .
When police found the 45 - year - old convicted arsonist lying on a street in a popular Taipei shopping district , he requested a return to life behind bars , nostalgic for the 10 years he had already served , the China Post newspaper reported .
Wang had also contacted police separately with his request , a spokesman said .
Officers who found him bought him a boxed lunch but declined to send him back to prison , the police spokesman said .
“ We advised him to keep looking for work , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know why he ca n’t find a job .
Maybe employers think he ’s not suitable or that he ’s too old . ”
Taiwan is in recession , with a slump in exports leading a record economic contraction in the fourth quarter of last year .
Economists see more weakness through most of 2009 , given falling demand for Taiwan ’s electronics goods in overseas markets .
MANY countries have been afflicted by a “ resource curse ” .
Discoveries of oil or other mineral deposits are hailed as offering a way out of poverty .
But hopes are dashed as corrupt officials pocket the money or squander it on grandiose projects .
Cambodia , giddy at the prospect of an oil boom , hopes not to go the same way .
A recent report , called “ Country for Sale ” , by a London - based NGO , Global Witness , points out that amendments to a 1991 law had the effect of placing the Cambodian National Petroleum Authority ( CNPA ) , the body administering oil contracts , under the direct control of Hun Sen , the prime minister , and Sok An , his deputy .
It alleges that millions of dollars paid to the government to secure oil concessions do not show up in the official annual revenue reports .
Meanwhile , unrestrained mining exploration has seen thousands forcibly evicted from their land in the north , and has damaged six of the country 's 23 protected wildlife areas .
The discovery of oil and other minerals was a godsend to Cambodia .
Despite foreign - aid donors ' constant pleas for restraint , logging companies have largely exhausted the country 's once abundant forests .
Chevron , a California - based oil giant , at first estimated its 2005 oil discovery in the Gulf of Thailand at 400 m barrels , enough to earn about $ 1.7 billion a year , against the government 's budget last year of $ 1.2 billion .
Chevron was awarded the largest exploration contract in the block thought to be most productive .
But it has found that the oil is scattered in pockets and hard to extract .
Despite the recent fall in the oil price , the government still hopes production will start in 2012 .
It will be very welcome : aid still makes up half of the government 's budget , despite a decade of stalling on anti-corruption legislation that donors want to see .
The World Bank consistently ranks Cambodia in the bottom 10 % of all countries for controlling corruption .
Michael McWalter of the Asian Development Bank , who advises the Cambodian government on oil , argues that the CNPA is underfinanced and ill - equipped to deal with the complexities of the oil business .
In March last year the United Nations Development Programme and the Norwegian government jointly organised a conference to discuss what the government should do .
The advice included the creation of an independent , transparent oil fund .
This however , was largely based on the experience of Norway , which has an effective system of checks and balances .
Cambodia does not , and Mr Hun Sen and Mr Sok An have still not come up with a coherent plan for managing the oil revenues .
According to Global Witness , the government decided at a meeting with donors in October not to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , an international coalition that would require full disclosure of oil , gas and mining revenues .
Rather , it agreed to endorse only the principles underpinning the EITI , making its rules non-binding .
Government officials have responded to the allegations by lashing out at NGOs .
At a conference in February , Mr Hun Sen called NGOs ' criticism of his oil policies “ crazy ” .
And he has already alluded to the prospect that oil revenues may diminish the influence of aid donors — though he denies they have much anyway , since Cambodia can always turn to China , a generous donor , which , he says , despite its might , treats its partners with respect .

WASHINGTON , April 27 ( UPI ) --
Five members of Congress were arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington Monday as they demonstrated against the situation in Darfur .
Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Darfur in western Sudan in what the U.S. State Department has described as genocide .

The protesters spoke out against the general situation in Darfur and Sudan 's expulsion of outside relief agencies .
A spokesman for Rep. Donna Edwards , D - Md. , told The Hill that the five and organizers of the protest from the Save Darfur Coalition crossed a Secret Service perimeter around the embassy and ignored three warnings to leave the property .
They were expected to be fined for a misdemeanor and released .
Members of Congress arrested were Edwards ; Jim McGovern , D - Mass . ; John Lewis , D - Ga. , a veteran of the civil rights movement in the 1960s ; Keith Ellison , D - Minn. , the only Muslim member of Congress , and Lynn Woolsey , D - Calif .
Also arrested were Jerry Fowler , coalition president ; John Prendergast , co-founder of the Enough Project , and Rabbi David Saperstein , director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism .
Anticipating arrest , Edwards and her colleagues hired a defense lawyer , Laura Rhodes , before the protest , the Edwards spokesman said .
Opposition to power lines from landowners and neighbors , local officials or environmental groups , especially in rural areas , makes expansion difficult  even when the money for it is available .
And some experts argue that in the absence of a broader national effort to encourage cleaner fuels , even the smartest grid will do little to reduce consumption of fuels that contribute to climate change .
In fact , energy experts say that simply building a better grid is not enough , because that would make the cheap electricity that comes from burning coal available in more parts of the country .
That could squeeze out generators that are more expensive but cleaner , like those running on natural gas .
The solution is to put a price on emissions from dirtier fuels and incorporate that into the price of electricity , or find some other way to limit power generation from coal , these experts say .
The stimulus bill passed by the House includes $ 6.5 billion in credit to federal agencies for building power lines , presumably in remote areas where renewable energy sources are best placed , and $ 2 billion in loan guarantees to companies for power lines and renewable energy projects .
The bill also includes $ 4.4 billion for the installation of smart meters  which , administration officials say , in combination with other investments in a smart grid , would cut energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent  and $ 100 million to train workers to maintain the grid .
About 527,000 miles of high - voltage transmission lines stretch across the United States , most installed many decades ago .
Everyone agrees that more lines are needed .
But some industry experts argue that the problem of making the grid greener goes well beyond upgrading and expanding the existing power lines .
The grid , they say , was set up primarily to draw energy from nearby plants and to provide a steady flow of electricity to customers .
It was not intended to incorporate power from remote sources like solar panels and windmills , whose output fluctuates with weather conditions  variability that demands a far more flexible operation .

Barry Jennings , a key 9/11 eyewitness who was an emergency coordinator for the New York Housing Authority , passed away last August 2008 at age 53 from undisclosed circumstances .
Mr. Jennings was an eyewitness to the devastation of the World Trade center towers on September 11th 2001 .
On the morning of 911 Barry Jennings with Michael Hess , ( one of Rudy Giuliani ’s highest ranking appointed officials , New York city ’s corporation counsel ) , entered the famed Building 7 .
It was just after the first attack on the North tower , but before the second plane hit the South Tower , when Barry Jennings escorted Michael Hess to the World Trade Center Tower 7 .
Mr. Jennings recalls a large number of police officers in the lobby of WTC 7 when they arrived .
The two men went up to the 23rd floor , but could not get in , so they went back to the lobby and the police took them up in the freight elevator for a second try .
When they arrived on level 23 , at the Office of Emergency Management ( FEMA ) , ) they found it had been recently deserted , “ coffee that was on the desk , smoke was still coming off the coffee , I saw half eaten sandwiches ” .
At that point he made some phone calls , and an un-named individual told them to “ leave , and leave right away ” .
Jennings and Hess then proceeded to the stairs , and made it to level 6 , when there was an explosion , and the stairwell collapsed from under their feet , Mr. Jennings was actually hanging , and had to climb back up .
They made it back up to level 8 , where Barry Jennings had a view of the twin towers , both buildings were still standing .
This is an important detail , as many debunkers have used Mr. Jennings statements out of context to claim the damage came to WTC 7 from the towers collapsing , not the case according , to Mr. Jennings .
When they made it to the lobby , Mr. Jennings found it destroyed and littered with dead bodies .
He said it looked like , “ King Kong had came through it and stepped on it , ( it was ) so destroyed , I did n’t know where I was .
So destroyed that they had to take me out through a hole in the wall , that I believe the fire department made to get me out . ”
Shortly after he made it out , he was seen on several news channels telling his story .
Mr. Jennings was admittedly confused as to why Building 7 had to come down at all , and does not accept the official reason that the noises he heard were from a fuel oil tank , “ I know what I heard , I heard explosions ” .
Jennings testimony was recorded by Loose Change for the Final Cut version of the extremely popular documentary , but was edited out at the final stage due to Jennings misgivings about losing his job , and endangering his family .
The BBC later interviewed Jennings for a “ 911 debunking special ” and Jennings seemed to retract the testimony given to Loose Change .
Subsequently the creators of the film released the original interview to protect their own credibility .
Barry Jennings passed away shortly thereafter and coincidentally just a few days before the long awaited NIST report on Building 7 was released to the public .
It is quite possible that Jennings would have exposed the cover story of NIST , and their overall excuse that the 47 story building was the first and only skyscraper felled by fire .
He never got that chance .
New Information
Yesterday , April 15th 2009 I was contacted by “ Loose Change ” director , and narrator Dylan Avery who said that he had recently begun investigating the death of Barry Jennings , and had found some new information relating to his death .
It seems that there is a very good possibility that Jennings ’ death could have been due to foul play .
Though the investigations are on going , initial findings are somewhat alarming .
The conclusion is still forthcoming , but I was shocked by what I heard .
It seems that Dylan had hired a private investigator to look into Jennings death which remains shrouded in mystery .
His motive was simply to bring some closure to the life of Barry Jennings , and in doing so to honor the memory of this brave American .
The Investigator ended up referring the case to Law enforcement before refunding his pay , and told Dylan never to contact him again .
Very unusual to say the least .
Dylan also paid a visit to the Jennings home .
He found it vacant and for sale .
Personally , something is really beginning to stink here .
Why would a highly paid PI refuse to continue his investigation ?
Why did he refer the matter to police ?
He is not talking .
What is he afraid of .
Was he warned to cease and desist ?
If so by whom ?
These are some of the new questions revolving around the Jennings case .
In every major cover up from the JFK assassination to Iran Contra , we can see one common thread .
The untimely death of eyewitnesses .
Barry Jennings was not only an important and most credible eyewitness , but he openly refuted much of the government , and media version of events .
He was a liability .

The ultra-serious modern composer Milton Babbitt once wrote an article for High Fidelity with the title " Who Cares if You Listen ? " -- seeming to sum up the attitude of certain strand of 20th - century " classical " composers .
Babbitt , as it happens , did n't choose the title and he always said it did violence to his meaning .
But it 's also fair to say that Babbitt did n't consider getting audience members to tap their feet to be an artist 's highest calling .
The Minneapolis - based jazz trio The Bad Plus recorded a piece by Babbitt , " Semi- Simple Variations , " for their new album " For All I Care . "
( The Bad Plus are known from drawing inspiration from all sorts of non-jazz sources , to put it mildly : songs by Nirvana , Yes , and Heart also appear on " For All I Care . " )
For a low - budget video filmed in a spare , loft -y looking space , they recruited female members of the Mark Morris Dance Troupe to do more than just tap their feet : in short red , blue , and black dresses and high - heel shoes , the dancers really bring the moves .
The result is a revelation , especially if you think modern concert music is all brain and no soul .
" We 're reasonably certain , " the members of The Bad Plus modestly assert on their blog , " that celebrated twelve - tone composer Milton Babbitt 's music has never accompanied beautiful dancing girls before . "
The Bad Plus perform Babbitt , with some help

Tata 's Nano , built for functional frugality , is striking if not beautiful and does the job of people 's car admirably
Taking the world 's cheapest car out for its first public test drive by a journalist makes for a surprisingly smooth ride .
Thrifty transport is not meant to be this comfortable .
Tata 's Nano purrs from zero to 40 mph in eight seconds and its gearbox changes with ease .
The brakes are solid , bringing the car to halt smartly .
True , its 623 cc engine whines a little like a blender when pushed to its top speed of 65 mph and the body leans like the Tower of Pisa when cornering at speed .
But the wheels will give out before you can tip the car over , the Guardian was assured by Tata engineers .
Built for functional frugality , the Nano is a striking if not a beautiful car .
Flashing through the dusty streets outside the Tata plant in Pune , southern India , the Nano 's distinctive look turns heads .
Many people , especially those who are riding motorbikes , break into smiles and thrust thumbs into the air when its jellybean shape appears .
Its perky ride is partly down to the lightweight all - steel frame that keeps the car 's weight at just 600 kg .
Bumping up and down Pune 's older potholed highways proves that the car 's suspension can take on India 's decrepit infrastructure .
The Nano resembles Doctor Who 's Tardis .
Outside it is just three metres long – smaller than hatchbacks such as the Fiat Panda and the Toyota Yaris and only a tad longer than the original Mini .
Inside , the Nano is big enough for four 1.8 metre - tall ( 6ft ) adults to sit in comfort .
At 5ft 10 in , I had plenty of room .
What is amazing is the Nano 's turning circle – its tiny wheels can spin it around in the same space as a London black cab .
The car for the common man is an ode to the ordinary .
Priced at 100,000 rupees or just £ 1,350 , the Tata Nano appears on the surface the most under - engineered car for decades .
The dashboard has just a speedometer and two simple gauges for fuel and mileage .
In the Nano only the essential is allowed to exist .
Tata built the car to put the developing world on wheels – leading some to smirk that the automobile would be little more than a rickshaw with windows .
That is far from the reality .
The Nano looks and feels like a real car , remarkable given that costs less than a high - end laptop .
On the more expensive models the air conditioning provides welcome relief from the hairdryer heat of an Indian summer .
Irritatingly , to save money , the switches for the electric windows are placed at the foot of the gear stick – which means you have to reach down to bring down the glass .
Tata began with a blank piece of paper : the only taboo was that the price could not be more than 100,000 rupees .
Engineers toyed with designing a car with no doors , or a vehicle made of plastic .
These were rejected , however , and the Nano is made out of a single sheet of steel , aerodynamically moulded , with a rear - mounted engine .
The team behind the car say they went back to the drawing board with every component – cutting cost and minimising weight without sacrificing performance and comfort .
The car is being subtly re-engineered to meet US and European safety standards .
Those new versions will see airbags added as well as updates that will meet western regulations for crash protection for people inside and outside the car .
The sparseness of the Nano is in some ways a welcome counterblast to costly add - ons found in the west , where cars are becoming almost as intelligent as their drivers .
A range of increasingly sophisticated vehicles has hit the market , packed full of video screens , internet connections and adaptive cruise controls , pushing prices into the stratosphere .
The Nano is about innovation at lowest cost .
The fuel efficiency is remarkable .
It manages 67 miles a gallon ( 24 km a litre ) and emits only 101g of carbon dioxide for each kilometre driven .
Those figures make it among the cleanest , greenest automobiles in the world .
Despite this , it is hard to see how India 's already congested roads will bear what could be an extra million cars a year .
True , the Nano is designed to do for India what Ford 's Model T did for America almost a century ago .
Here in India it is not factory workers who will be its buyers but families who want to upgrade from a 125 cc motorbike to a motorcar but could not previously afford to .
Having made a dream real , Ratan Tata , the chairman of Tata group , wants to sell a European version by 2011 and an American one by 2012 .
And an electric version of the Nano is already in the pipeline .
Few would bet against Ratan Tata .
He is a man who appears to have the knack of timing .
The Nano is the right car at the right time at the right place .
Some 15 % of people seeking help over forced wedlock are male
It has emerged that 15 % of the people who seek help about being forced into wedlock are men or boys .
A man taken to Pakistan as a child and forcibly engaged to his five - year - old cousin has called for a men 's refuge .
Foreign Office minister Meg Munn said authorities must talk to those affected to " listen to their experiences " and " learn directly from them " .
We have 165 women 's refuges - what about the men ?
Imran Rehman
' Devastated ' by marriage
She said : " Generally people expect men to be able to look after themselves , to manage situations , so men subject to domestic violence , men subject to forced marriage are likely to find it much , much more difficult . "
She added " there could well be " a need for a male shelter .
The British High Commission in Pakistan said that the issue of boys and men being forced is a problem that it is aware of .
Spokesman Theepan Selparatnum said : " Sixty per cent of our case load is forced marriage work and between 10 to 15 % of that are male .
" Our workload is increasing yearly and that 's probably attributed to increased publicity and increased knowledge of what we can do . "
' Abducted '
Imran Rehman , from Derby , said his family took some extreme measures to get him back in line when he resisted the marriage , explaining that he was abducted and taken to Pakistan .
He said a relative shackled his legs together and he was imprisoned for 15 days .
Mr Rehman has now urged the government to take action .
" What I 'm calling on the government to do would be set up a male refuge , " he told BBC 5 Live .
He went on : " There are no male refuges at all for Asian men .
We have 165 women 's refuges .
What about the men ?
" We know it 's happening , and I have a caseload of 36 men .
We definitely require male refuge . "
Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui , of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain , told BBC Radio 5 Live a male refuge was a good idea .
" We have even heard of bounty hunters chasing people , " he said .
" It exists , all these things , so I think people do need solid support . "

Disparaging comments by adults about a children ’s presenter have led to an angry backlash in support of Cerrie Burnell , the 29 - year - old CBeebies host who was born missing the lower section of her right arm .
One man said that he would stop his daughter from watching the BBC children ’s channel because Burnell would give his child nightmares .
Parents even called the broadcaster to complain after Burnell , with Alex Winters , took over the channel ’s popular Do and Discover slot and The Bedtime Hour programme last month , to complain about her disability .
And some of the vitriolic comments on the “ Grown Up ” section of the channel ’s website were so nasty that they had to be removed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
“ Is it just me , or does anyone else think the new woman presenter on CBeebies may scare the kids because of her disability ? ” wrote one adult on the CBeebies website .
Other adults claimed that their children were asking difficult questions as a result .
“ I did n’t want to let my children watch the filler bits on The Bedtime Hour last night because I know it would have played on my eldest daughter ’s mind and possibly caused sleep problems , ” said one message .
The BBC received nine other complaints by phone .
While charities reacted angrily to the criticism of the children ’s presenter , calling the comments disturbing , other parents and carers labelled the remarks as disgraceful , writing in support of Burnell and setting up a “ fight disability prejudice ” page on the social networking site Facebook .
“ I think that it is great that Cerrie is on CBeebies .
She is an inspiration to children and we should not underestimate their ability to understand and accept that all of us have differences – some visible and some not , ” wrote “ Surfergirlboosmum ” .
Other websites were flooded with equally supportive comments .
“ I feel we should all post counter complaints to the BBC and I ’m sure they will receive more complaints about the fact they have even considered accepting these complaints , ” wrote Scott Tostevin on Facebook .
“ Its a disgrace that people still have such negative views against people who are ‘ different ’ , ” he added .
Burnell , who described her first television presenting role as a “ dream job ” , has also appeared in EastEnders and Holby City and has been feted for performances in the theatre while also worked as a teaching assistant at a special needs school in London .
She also has a four - year - old child .
“ I think the negative comments from those few parents are indicative of a wider problem of disabled representation in the media as a whole , which is why it ’s so important for there to be more disabled role models in every area of the media , ” she said in response yesterday .
“ The support that I ’ve received … has been truly heartening .
It ’s brilliant that parents are able to use me as a way of talking about disability with their children and for children who are similarly disabled to see what really is possible in life and for their worlds to be represented in such a positive , high profile manner . ”
Charities said that much still needed to be done to change perceptions in society .
“ In some way it is a pretty sad commentary on the way society is now and that both parents and children see few examples of disabled people .
The sooner children are exposed to disability in mainstream education the better , ” said Mark Shrimpton at Radar , the UK ’s largest disability campaigning organisation .
“ She is a role model for other disabled people . ”
Rosemary Bolinger , a trustee at Scope , a charity for people with cerebral palsy , said : “ It is disturbing that some parents have reacted in this way … Unfortunately disabled people are generally invisible in the media and wider society . ”
Some old pictures of London I found on the internet .
View in Drury Lane looking south and showing the St Mary le Strand steeple .
A 134 foot tall Maypole was erected on the site of the church in 1661 which Alfred Marks describes in ' Photographs of Old London ' .
He also notes the gabled house in this view was formerly the " **** and Magpie " tavern " a place of entertainment in the reign of Henry VII . " " These are very good specimens of the overhanging houses of the beginning of the seventeenth century .
It is only to be regretted that the extreme narrowness of the street made it impossible to give the full effect of this picturesque group " writes Alfred Marks .
He goes on to inform us that Dr.Johnson worshipped at St. Clement Danes Church which can be seen behind the old houses .
" The photograph shows the west side of Temple Bar as it was a short time before its demolition shored up with timber to counteract the effects of the excavations for the New Law Courts ... The Bar as we saw it till it was replaced by the ' Memorial ' and its famous ' Griffin ' was built from Wren 's designs in 1670 ...
The statues on the west side shown in our photograph were of Charles I and Charles II in Roman habits .
"
" The Hall is said to have been built not later than 1450 but as we now see it it has of course undergone much alteration .
It is remarkable as having preserved its louvre of lead of the time of Henry VIII in its original condition .
This is one of the few still remaining .
Even after halls were furnished with fireplaces in the side walls the practice was continued of kindling a fire on a hearth of tile or brick in the centre of the room letting the smoke escape by a hole in the roof over which was an erection to keep out the rain with open sides - the louvre . "
" One cannot help speculating as to the origin of this singular group of houses with their eight gables .
Mr.Rendle who was good enough to take pains - unfortunately fruitless - to glean something for me about the history of these houses tells me that in the early part of this century houses of this type were exceedingly common in the main thoroughfares and bye places of Southwark .
They are good specimens of the houses of the time of Elizabeth and somewhat later ; the frame of massive timber , else mere shells of lath and plaster ; but though often out of shape and leaning in all directions wonderfully durable .
"
" The introduction of the railways has greatly changed the character of these old inns .
The ' George ' alone seems now to do any considerable business in the ' receipt of travellers ' ; in other cases the business of a tavern has superseded that of an inn and the great courtyards are either being gradually encroached on by warehouses or have been taken up by railway companies as receiving offices . " " ' The Dock 'says Mr.Rendle ( p. 203 ) , 'exists in the very earliest maps ....
It was generally neglected and a nuisance and must have been very much larger than we have known it to be .
' None of the houses shown in the photograph are of any great age but altogether this is a quaint and intersting nook of old London .
The flat - headed doorway to the spectator 's left adjoining one with a round head is little as it looks like it a busy thoroughfare for pedestrians unless a low swing - door is to be understood as reserving private rights .
The passage turning to the left through the houses leads to Clink Street . "
Do n't get us wrong , we reckon all the beds we sell are fantastic .
But the following beds , whilst they might not be as elegant as either our upholstered bed or Antoinette reproduction French bed , are surely right on the cutting edge of bed design .
So please give it up for seven of the most over - the - top beds in the world ...
Off Its Rocker - Private Cloud
From our German friends ( more specifically , designer Manuel Kloker ) , we 've got the Private Cloud .
This uber - modern bed is " fun and relaxed " , although exactly how relaxing it would be to have someone sit on the end , and dump you on the floor is n't entirely clear .
That aside , there 's something rather elegant about its smooth , rounded design .
The bed does , of course , come with four chocks , allowing you to stop it from moving around .
We 're not completely sold on whether we 'd actually want one to sleep in , but you 've got to give it its dues - it'd make a great talking point !
A Load of Balls - Animi Causa
What do you get if you cross molecular science and a bedroom ?
Well , possibly this bed , by Israeli design and manufacturing house Animi Causa .
The Feel consists of a number of soft balls , held together by plastic connectors .
These allow you to sculpt it into pretty much any shape you want , be it a recliner , bed or a kind of sofa type arrangement .
We can't help thinking that as a bed , it would be pretty lumpy .
It 's cooler than a bean bag though .
Or is it ?
The 80s Contender - Sumo Omni
To the casual observer , the Omni from Sumo is just a giant beanbag shaped like a pillow .
However , it 's actually a genius piece of design .
Made from rip - proof nylon , the Omni can be a bed , seat , armchair , body - pillow , and probably a dozen more things too .
It does however carry the inherent danger of making you want to acquire other 80's related paraphernalia , so do n't be surprised if you find yourself whistling Phil Collins classics and hankering after a lava lamp .
... And From the 24th Century - Phi-Ton
Our award for ridiculously over - engineered brilliance goes to the Phi-Ton , the brainchild of designer Fried - Jan Unger .
Part sculpture , part bed , it has no sub - frame , no accessible free - moving parts , does n't jam and , we 're told , ca n't eat you alive .
The whole thing floats on two heavy metal stands , and includes an in - built massager .
Oh , and it 's completely recyclable too , which should keep the little green person inside you happy .
The Space Saving Solution - BedUP
So , you 're in your loft - style apartment , and you 're pushed for space .
The first thing to go has to be the bed .
It just takes up so much room .
Fortunately , innovation studio Decadrages has the answer .
Called BedUP , this bed lives on your ceiling .
No , really .
With the ability to raise or lower it as much as you want , this chic little puppy uses similar technology to ceiling - mounted project screens , except that it lowers a bed , instead of a screen .
Which is nice .
If Apple Made Beds - Hi-Can
What do you get the couple who 've got everything , and harbour a deep - seated love for all things Apple ?
Well , how about this ?
Called the Hi-Can , this modernist piece was designed by Edoardo Carlino , and looks like it should have been called the iBed .
It 's more advanced than your iPhone too .
With a projector , surround sound system , projector screen , DVD player and probably a swimming pool somewhere built in , it 's fair to say you 'd never leave your bed again .
Ever .
Because Legs Are SOOO Last Century - Fluttua
The final bed in our little list comes to us from Lago .
Called the Fluttua , this bed has only one leg .
Yes , that 's right .
One .
This bed somehow manages to get by with just one solitary leg in the exact centre of the bed , giving it the appearance of actually floating in thin air .
Mind you , this is the same company that thinks that what you really want in life is a flooded bedroom , so maybe , as beds go , this one is n't the best idea ever ...
Over to you ...
If you actually own any of these crazy contraptions , or any other bed that 's a bit out of the ordinary , we 'd love to hear from you , so please leave a comment below .
Korda , who died in 2001 , Mr. Casey writes , would not be able to collect royalties on his wildly ubiquitous image until 1997 , when the Castro government signed the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works , an international copyright treaty .

Although Korda ’s original photograph was not widely distributed for years , Mr. Casey says , Fidel Castro began using the image as a branding symbol for Cuba in 1967 , months before Che ’s death .
It was a clever marketing plan on Mr. Castro ’s part :
Che ’s denunciations of the Soviet Union made him popular among “ thinkers and artists of the Western European left , many of whom had lost faith in the Soviet Union , ” while his condemnation of imperialism “ sat well with young radical students in the United States and Europe , who were impatient for societal change and for whom the very word revolution was inspiring . ”
After Che was killed in Bolivia in October 1967 at 39 , at the end of a disastrous guerrilla campaign , his fame and popularity  as a martyr now  spread even more rapidly around the world : red and black posters based on Korda ’s photograph became symbols of the resistance movement during the 1968 student protests in Paris , and they surfaced , too , in America , where the revolutionary was embraced by both the Black Power movement and by hippies and antiwar activists .
In its May 17 , 1968 , issue , Time magazine observed that the Che legend had given “ rise to a cult of almost religious hero worship among radical intellectuals , workers and students ” : there were “ Guevara - style beards ” and berets in Italy , the magazine reported , and “ handkerchiefs , sweatshirts and blouses decorated with his shaggy countenance ” in “ half a dozen countries ”  all making for “ a new source of profits for composers , poster makers and book publishers . ”
It was an article that could have easily run some four decades later , on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Che ’s death .

Clearly , it ’s not what Che Guevara had in mind when he declared that “ the revolutionary idea should be diffused by means of appropriate media to the greatest depth possible , ” but in becoming one of the world ’s most iconic brand names , Che has achieved an immortality that even exceeds the predictions of the stranger he meets at the end of his “ Motorcycle Diaries , ” who tells him “ the spirit of the beehive speaks through your mouth and motivates your actions . ”
The U.S. government has been accused of using " torture - lite " or " moderate physical pressure " against detainees , persons held in custody for political reasons , typically because they pose a distinct threat to the U.S. or possess information crucial to American security .
In practical terms , what does this mean ?
Palestinian Hanging
This form of torture is sometimes referred to as " Palestinian hanging " due to its use by the Israeli government against Palestinians .
It involves binding the prisoner 's hands behind his back .
After fatigue sets in , the prisoner will inevitably fall forward , putting full body weight on his shoulders and impairing breathing .
If the prisoner is not released , death by crucifixion may eventually result .
Such was the fate of U.S. prisoner Manadel al - Jamadi in 2003 .
Psychological Torture
The number one criterion for " torture - lite " is that it must leave no physical marks .
Whether U.S. officials are threatening to execute a prisoner 's family or falsely claiming that the leader of his terror cell is dead , a steady diet of misinformation and threats can be effective .
Sensory Deprivation
It 's remarkably easy for prisoners to lose track of time when they 're locked up in cells .
Sensory deprivation involves removing all noise and light sources as well .
Guantanamo prisoners were additionally bound , blindfolded and wore earmuffs .
Whether prisoners subjected to long - term sensory deprivation can still tell fiction from reality is a matter of some debate .
Starvation and Thirst
Maslow 's hierarchy of needs identifies basic physical needs as the most fundamental , more so than religion , political ideology or community .
A prisoner may be given just enough food and water to survive .
It may take as long as a week before he appears physically thinner , but his life will come to revolve around a quest for food and he may be more inclined to divulge information in exchange for food and water .
Sleep Deprivation
Studies have shown that missing a night 's sleep temporarily drains 10 points from a person 's IQ .
Consistent sleep deprivation through harassment , exposure to bright lights and exposure to loud , jarring music and recordings can drastically impair judgment and wear down resolve .
Waterboarding
Water torture is one of the oldest and most common forms of torture .
It arrived in the U.S. with the first colonists and has cropped up many times since then .
Waterboarding is its latest incarnation .
It involves a prisoner being strapped down to a board then dunked in water .
He 's brought back to the surface and the process is then repeated until his interrogator secures the information being sought .
Forced Standing
Most common in the 1920s , forced standing involves prisoners standing in place , often overnight .
In some cases , the prisoner may face a wall , standing with his arms extended and his fingertips touching it .
Sweatboxes
Sometimes referred to as a " hot box " or simply as " the box , " the prisoner is locked up in a small , hot room which , due to lack of ventilation , essentially functions as an oven .
The prisoner is released when he cooperates .
Long used as a form of torture in the U.S. , it is particularly effective in the arid Middle East .
Sexual Assault and Humiliation
Various forms of sexual assault and humiliation documented in U.S. prison camps as forms of torture include forced nudity , forcible smearing of menstrual blood on prisoners ' faces , forced lap dances , forced transvestitism and forced homosexual acts on other prisoners .
MOSCOW ( AP )  North Korea vowed Tuesday to restart its nuclear reactor and to boycott international disarmament talks for good in retaliation for the U.N. Security Council 's condemnation of its rocket launch .
Russia , voicing regret over the move , urged Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table .
The Foreign Ministry called the U.N. statement " legitimate and well - balanced , " and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said all sides must stick to the current disarmament process .
China , the North 's main ally , appealed for calm .
In Washington , a senior U.S. official called the decision " unfortunate . "
" It will further isolate the North from the rest of the international community , and the North will have to deal with that , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
North Korea 's denunciation of the council 's " hostile " move came just hours after all 15 members , including Beijing and Moscow , unanimously agreed to condemn the April 5 launch as a violation of U.N. resolutions and to tighten sanctions against the regime .
The U.N. statement , issued eight days after the launch , was weaker than the resolution Japan and the United States had pursued but still drew an angry response from Pyongyang , which called it " unjust " and a violation of international law .
North Korea claims it sent a communications satellite into space as part of a peaceful bid to develop its space program .
The United States and others call the launch an illicit test of the technology used to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile , even one eventually destined for the United States .
A Security Council resolution passed in 2006 , days after North Korea carried out an underground nuclear test , prohibits Pyongyang from engaging in any ballistic missile - related activity — including launching rockets that use the same delivery technology as missiles mounted with warheads , Washington and other nations say .
The council on Monday demanded an end to the rocket launches and said it will expand sanctions against the communist nation .
The council also called for quick resumption of disarmament talks .
President Obama called the statement a " clear and united message " that North Korea 's action was unlawful and would result in real consequences , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
North Korea , following through on earlier threats to withdraw from international disarmament talks if the council so much as criticized the launch , announced Tuesday it would boycott the negotiations hosted by China .
" The six - party talks have lost the meaning of their existence , never to recover , " the North 's Foreign Ministry said in a statement , declaring it would never participate in the talks again and is no longer bound to previous agreements .
Since 2003 , envoys from six nations — the two Koreas , the United States , China , Russia and Japan — have been meeting in Beijing for sporadic negotiations on getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program in exchange for aid and other concessions .
Under a 2007 six - party deal , North Korea agreed to disable its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon , north of Pyongyang — a key step toward dismantlement — in return for 1 million tons of fuel oil and other concessions .
Disablement began later that year .
In June 2008 , North Korea famously blew up the cooling tower at Yongbyon in a dramatic show of its commitment to denuclearization .
But disablement came to halt a month later as Pyongyang wrangled with Washington over how to verify its 18,000 - page account of past atomic activities .
The latest round of talks , in December , failed to push the process forward .
On Tuesday , the North said it would restart nuclear facilities , an apparent reference to its plutonium - producing reactor at Yongbyon .
North Korea already is believed to have enough plutonium to produce at least about half a dozen atomic bombs .
One official at the Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency said agency inspectors remained onsite at Yongbyon .
He asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue .
Asked whether there had been any indication that the North was making good on its threats , he said only that the situation " remained status quo . "
That suggests IAEA cameras and seals remained in place at the facility and that the inspectors continued their monitoring activities .
The Russian foreign minister said all sides must continue denuclearization through the six - party talks .
" Any new international forum to discuss the situation on the Korean Peninsula should not be created , " Lavrov told a Moscow news conference .
" The negotiators of this forum have reached important agreements that impose obligations on all the parties , not only North Korea . "
Analyst Koh Yu-hwan , a North Korea expert at Seoul 's Dongguk University , called Pyongyang 's move yet another tactic in the regime 's bid to get Washington to the negotiating table outside the six - party framework .
" The U.N. statement humiliated North Korea internationally , and that 's why North Korea angrily reacted to it , " said Atsuhito Isozaki , assistant professor of North Korean politics at Keio University in Japan .
" Since China and Russia supported the statement , North Korea feels betrayed . "
However , Prof .
Yoo Ho-yeol of Korea University in Seoul said Pyongyang will find it difficult to boycott the talks entirely , since that would only serve to further isolate the impoverished country , one of the world 's poorest .
China appealed for calm .
" We hope the relevant parties will proceed from the overall interest , exercise calmness and restraint , " Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu told a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday .
South Korea , expressing " deep regret , " also decided Tuesday to fully join the U.S. - led Proliferation Security Initiative , a program launched in 2003 to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the presidential office said .

On his first day in office , President Obama took the advice of EFF and other nonprofits , ordering federal agencies to share more information with the public — particularly emphasizing openness in response to Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests .
This is a great first step , but we need your support to make sure it becomes a reality .
Over the past two and a half years , EFF has filed hundreds of FOIA requests and made thousands of pages of once - secret documents available to the public on our website .
Our FOIA work has revealed details about the FBI ’s improper use of National Security Letters , which helped prompt Senator Leahy to call for an investigation of former Attorney General Gonzales shortly before Gonzales ’ resignation .
We ’ve also uncovered the Department of Homeland Security 's internal policies on searching and interrogating travelers at the border , as well as information about the technology the government uses to wiretap cell phones .
As part of Sunshine Week , we 're posting scores of never - before seen documents on several controversial government initiatives , including the FBI ’s Investigative Data Warehouse and DCS 3000 surveillance program , and the Department of Homeland Security ’s Automated Targeting System and ADVISE data - mining project .
We 're also making all of our FOIA documents more accesssible than ever before with a new search tool that will let anyone conduct keyword searches across all the documents in our collection .
We 're also currently fighting in the courts for a broad range of additional records , including documentation of the telecom carriers ' lobbying efforts regarding their role in warrantless wiretapping , and for information about secret negotiations over international intellectual property law .
Of course , the release of these new documents is just one step in the ongoing fight for greater government transparency .
Already , despite President Obama 's memo , lawyers at the Department of Justice appear to be sticking to the Bush administration 's policy of keeping information secret .
In these situations , EFF will continue to pressure the government to remember its obligations to transparency and to the public .
Sunshine Week , celebrated March 15 - 22 , is a perfect time to support the principles of open government and freedom of information .
With your support , EFF will continue to advocate and litigate in support of a more transparent , honest government .
Donate to EFF during Sunshine Week , and help shine a light on government secrets !
It 's time to make open government a reality .

Reel Maintenance Part 1 : Spinning Reels Basic maintenance of spinning reels .
The following are some basic maintenance procedures that I perform on my spinning reels .
How often you break down your reels will depend on how often you use them and how much abuse they take with each outing as well as how finicky you are about performance .
Keep in mind that this is not meant to be an authoritative manual on reel maintenance .
While spinning reels operate on the same basic principles , each manufacturer / model may be different than what is found on my particular Daiwas .
One : Layout
It 's important to have a clean and well - lit work area .
The ideal would be a dedicated work bench but having none , I use my kitchen island .
The white tile gives a nice contrast to those little tiny parts found on fishing reels .
Also avoid working on carpeted areas for the same obvious reasons .
Two :
What you Need I lay out all of the things that I am likely going to need BEFORE I get started .
These include but are not limited to : 1 ) set of screwdrivers ( both slot and philips heads )
2 ) pliers
3 ) knife
4 ) Corrosion X ( metal protectant / light lubricant )
5 ) grease ( Cals for gears / drags and Daiwa Blue for medium lube )
6 ) reel oil ( Rocket Fuel for bearings )
7 ) white gas / Coleman Fuel ( degreasing and cleaning )
8 ) toothbrush and Q - Tips ( cleaning )
9 ) clean rag
10 ) small plastic container with lid
11 ) reel schematic diagram
12 ) small ziploc bags
It 's important to note the specific use of each lubricant .
Three or more types may seem like overkill but each performs a specific job and they do n't work well outside of the scope of their intended use .
Grease is a paste lubricant and essential for main gears .
Anything lighter will eventually drip off and provide no lubrication .
On the other end of the weight spectrum is reel oil .
This is very low viscosity stuff and is meant to seep within the seals of bearings .
Corrosion X is a general lubricant that has the great benefit of protecting metals against corrosion .
I use Corrosion X on all metal parts outside of the reel and some internal parts that I feel may experience salt intrusion .
Since I rip my reels apart on a regular basis , I do n't feel a need to coat everything in Corrosion X . Three : Cleaning the Drags Most spinning reels have drags located in the center of their spool .
The drag elements are accessed by unscrewing the spool knob off completely .
The drag washers are usually held in place with a type spring clip ( hexagonal ) .
You can remove the clip using a fingernail .
If you decide to use a screwdriver , take care that the spring does n't go flying !
As a rule , smaller spinning reels have simple two - element drag systems while larger reels may have multi-element systems .
My Daiwa Capricorn 2000 ( top ) has one black fiber washer and one metal washer .
In contrast , my Capricorn 2500 ( bottom ) has three fiber washers and three metal washers in alternating order .
Note that the middle metal washer of the 2500 has ears .
It 's a good practice to place your disassembled parts in the order that they are removed .
This is especially true of drag washers .
Get the order wrong and your drags may not function to their full potential .
Clean the area of the spool where the washers reside with a damp clothl .
Wipe the metal washers and dab the fiber washers dry .
If you are using your drags dry , let them air dry completely before reassembly .
If they are in need of cleaning , you can soak the washers in white gas to degrease them before drying .
White gas may have an adverse affect on some fibrous materials so please be cautious .
If you like wet drags , you can re-grease them ( Cal 's grease is great for drags ) after cleaning and drying .
I just dab a small amount of grease on my forefinger , rub the grease on my finger and thumb and then bad the fiber washers with my fingers .
Reinstall the washers in the proper order and reapply the spring clip carefully .
Make sure the clip is seated properly .
Give the spool a shake , the metal drag washers should be prevented from falling out of the spool but move freely enough to clink around in their enclosure .
Rear drags are more complicated but due to my lack of expertise , I can't elaborate .
Four : Cleaning the Line Roller
One of the most critical elements of a spinning reel is the line roller .
Due to its external location out there on the rotor , it can get gummed up pretty easily .
A dirty roller can cause line twist and a rough retrieve .
An inoperative roller can cause line fray and breakage .
Fortunately , it 's pretty easy to clean .
Just remove the screw that holds the roller between the bail and the bail spring mechanism .
The screw also acts as the roller axle .
The parts of the roller on a Daiwa Capricorn are ( from left to right ) : tiny metal washer , line roller , liner roller bearing and another tiny metal washer .
Many budget spinning reels lack a line roller bearing and feature a metal or plastic bushing instead .
Since the washers are so small they may be stuck to other parts due to lubricant .
Make sure these are n't lost as they are very important to the smooth operation of the line roller .
Take note of which way the roller is on before you take it off .
Most newer reels have some sort of twist - buster feature built into the roller and the proper function of this feature will be dependent upon correct orientation .
Refer to the schematic as necessary .
Dump all of the parts into a small container of white gas , stir and let sit for a while .
This will clean and degrease everything .
Clean the area of the bail in which the roller resides using a clean cloth or Q - tip , making sure that it is free of any sand particles .
Be very thorough as only a small amount of particulates in the roller can make a reel feel rough under retrieve .
You can put the bearing on a small toothpick and check its rotation .
Put a drop of reel oil on the bearing and on all of the other parts and reassemble .
Check to make sure the roller spins freely .
Five : Bail and Bail Spring Assembly
The bail itself is very simple to remove .
Once the line roller is disassemble , only one screw is left holding the bail .
Unscrew to remove the bail completely .
Important : although I 've shown the complete removal of the bail , I recommend that you work in subassemblies .
In other words , after taking the line roller apart and cleaning it , put it back together before taking off the other end of the bail .
This is always a safe strategy .
The less loose parts you have at any one time means you have fewer parts to lose and fewer reassembly steps to forget .
My reel was in pretty good shape prior to disassembly .
But you can tell from the picture below that there is still some sand that got its way into the bail attachment point .
Clean this area thoroughly and lube with a general lubricant like Daiwa Blue Grease before reassembling .
The bail spring assembly is located on the same side of the bail as the line roller .
Usually there is some sort of cover that protects the spring assembly from the elements .
Below is the reel with the bail spring cover removed but the spring assembly still in place .
This area is a real sand collector on my reels .
The cover on my reel is chrome plastic .
So instead of using white gas which may mar or distort the plastic , I simply rinse this part off in running water .
If you move the bail back and forth with the bail spring cover removed , you can see how the bail spring mechanism works .
Bail fully closed :
Bail partly open :
Bail completely open :
Notice in the above pic how the fully compressed bail spring shaft interacts with the bail trip .
Now detach the bail arm .
This assembly is spring - loaded so be careful .
The bail spring assembly should be in the position shown below .
Notice the orientation of the pin .
This pin fits into a hole in the base of the bail arm attachment .
The spring assembly itself is dumped into the white gas to clean .
This is the only way to completely remove sand that is imbedded in grease .
Once the parts are cleaned and dry , they are regreased and reassembled .
For proper reassembly , the pin must fit in the hole so you may have to compress the bail shaft spring slightly to accomplish this .
Your reel should now have a smoothly functioning bail and line roller .
Six : Bail Trip Assembly
Note :
The following has only been verified for Daiwa spinning reels ( Capricorn & Samurai ) .
Other manufacturers / models may differ .
Please refer to your reel 's schematic BEFORE messing with this assembly .
For more advanced reel - tweakers , let 's revisit the bail trip assembly .
On the a simple reel such as a Daiwa Samurai , it can be as simple as two components : the bail trip lever and the bail trip spring .
There may also be a washer or two in the mix .
Make a note of the order of each piece as you disassemble .
Note the orientation of both ends of the spring , in relation to each other and in relation to the lever .
The spring is compressed in the pic below .
Remove and clean as necessary .
The picture below shows how the bail trip spring and bail trip lever are oriented to each other prior to reassembly .
Reassembly can be a little tricky .
One good way is to hold the spring and lever together and place them partially on the shaft as shown below .
Gently guide the straight end of the spring into position .
Rotate the lever clockwise , seat the lever fully and screw it back on .
Seven : Other Tips
Another really quick maintenance fix that is commonly overlooked is the handle .
A quick shot of lubricant such as Corrosion - X between the plastic paddle and shaft it rotates on will do wonders in restoring the smoothness of your reel .
If the paddle shaft is really gunked up , dip the paddle in white gas and stir .
Remove , let dry and relubricate using Corrosion - X .
The above maintenance procedures should cover a reel that has not been dumped in the ocean and has been rinsed with fresh water after each saltwater use .
If you still have a rough - shod reel after performing the above steps , you may have to remove the rotor and / or crack the body and have a look at the main gears .
We 'll save that for next time !

When Paul Armstrong started searching for Javascript frameworks for iPhone optimized web development , he was n’t satisfied with what was available .
While the existing frameworks were good , there were a few issues that made them unattractive .
For example , the availability of - webkit - transform and –webkit - animation removed any need for an animation library .

Smoking marijuana may be a criminal offence , but Vancouver police wo n’t be looking to make arrests at a pro-pot rally on Monday that is expected to attract thousands of people .
Const .
Jana McGuinness said officers will be present at the event , which takes place in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery every April 20 .
“ As long as there is n’t a public safety issue , where things would move into the streets , then the event will be able to continue , ” she said .
Last year , about 6,000 people took part in the 420 gathering to celebrate marijuana culture .
Despite open pot use , no arrests were made .
That many people are expected to return this year and to spark up joints at 4:20 p.m .
Jodie Emery , Green party candidate for the Vancouver - Fraserview riding , said the event is a celebration of Canadians ’ “ autonomy . ”
The B.C. Green Party platform for the May 12 election includes the legalization of marijuana .
“ Millions of dollars go into enforcing marijuana laws , and this money could be used to prevent more serious problems like violent crimes or identity theft , ” she said .
Jodie Emery is married to Marc Emery , founder and president of the B.C. Marijuana Party .
He ’s facing extradition to the U.S. for selling marijuana seeds to Americans online .

The competitive edge of the United States economy has eroded sharply over the last decade , according to a new study by a nonpartisan research group .
The report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation found that the United States ranked sixth among 40 countries and regions , based on 16 indicators of innovation and competitiveness .
They included venture capital investment , scientific researchers , spending on research and educational achievement .
But the American economy placed last in terms of progress made over the last decade .
“ The trend is very troubling , ” said Robert D. Atkinson , president of the foundation .
Measuring national competitiveness and the capacity for innovation is tricky .
Definitions and methods differ , and so do the outcomes .
For example , the World Economic Forum ’s recent global competitiveness report ranked the United States first .
Much of the forum ’s report is based on opinion surveys .
The cover of " Pride and Prejudice and Zombies , " a mash - up of the literary classic by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame - Smith .
Classic stories still retain their storytelling power centuries later , and smart remakes do well to retain much of the original plot .
That 's the case in a new literary mash - up , " Pride and Prejudice and Zombies , " where Elizabeth Bennett and Darcy take time away from courtship to hone their martial arts skills on the walking dead – a twist welcomed by both critics and " Janeite " fans of British author Jane Austen .
Such fascination with stories has compelled a small group of researchers to mine theories in evolutionary biology and psychology , in hopes of finding a connection between storytelling and the evolved human mind .
Most agree that stories represent products of humanity 's highly social existence , but debate rages over whether stories themselves may have evolved as an adaptation or social byproduct .
Their early findings could help explain why the best stories endure , and why remakes can find success despite seemingly retreading old ground .
After all , Austen and other beloved storytellers may have found the sweet spot in tickling the social sensibilities of a modern mind not far removed from early Homo sapiens , let alone 19th - century British society .
Heroes and villains
Most people can easily identify the good guys and bad guys , or protagonists and antagonists , in well - known stories such as " Pride and Prejudice " or their spinoffs .
But some researchers wanted evidence that the identification pattern holds true across many different stories .
" People use the terms protagonist and antagonist , but I 'm not able to identify any essay or theoretical work that specifically focuses on protagonist and antagonist , major and minor characters , " said Joseph Carroll , an English professor at the University of Missouri - St. Louis .
Carroll helped found a movement known as Literary Darwinism , which looks at how stories reveal common evolutionary behaviors shared by all humans .
His work has strong championing from evolutionary biologists such as E.O. Wilson at Harvard University .
In this case , Carroll hypothesized that modern readers would gravitate toward protagonists who displayed pro-social tendencies or promoted group cooperation — similar to how ancestral human hunter - gatherers valued such behavior .
He joined forces with another Literary Darwinist , Jonathan Gottschall , as well as two evolutionary psychologists on the study .
Their online survey asked respondents to identify characters from classic 19th century British novels as protagonists , antagonists , or minor characters , and to rate character traits and emotional responses based on a psychological model of personality .
As predicted , people rated protagonists as displaying cooperative behavior that produced feel - good , positive responses from readers .
They rated antagonists as being motivated by desire for social dominance , which drew negative emotional responses .
The study also found strong agreement among respondents rating character traits , even if just two people responded regarding a certain character .
" Pride and Prejudice " had no lack of responses — 81 people showed a familiarity with heroine Elizabeth Bennett that might have made the Austen protagonist blush .
However , certain characters seemed to blur the line between protagonist and antagonist .
Readers found plenty to dislike about characters such as Becky Sharp in " Vanity Fair " or Catherine and Heathcliff in " Wuthering Heights , " but also empathized with the plight of those characters .
" Such exceptions are extremely interesting but do not subvert the larger pattern , " the study authors wrote .
Elizabeth 's eventual love interest also stood out as a character that readers found interesting but also disagreeable .
" He 's sort of rude , " Carroll said , describing Darcy as the kind of guy who walks into a room and immediately draws all eyes and gossip .
Darcy demonstrates this in his first " Pride and Prejudice and Zombies " appearance , when a ballroom crowd notices his haughty demeanor .
He caps off his cold behavior by insulting Elizabeth within her hearing range , and she immediately decides to slit his throat with her ankle knife — before being interrupted by party - crashing zombies .
Pride and punishment
Another researcher says such exceptions show that the protagonist - antagonist setup is too simple to explain how Becky Sharp changes for the better , or how Heathcliff changes for the worse .
" They think that characters are either protagonists or antagonists pure and simple , and they do n't see that the whole point about a Victorian novel , for example , is the extent to which characters change , " said William Flesch , an English professor at the Brandeis University .
Flesch also draws on ideas from evolutionary biology , but disagrees with Literary Darwinist ideas in his book " Comeuppance : Costly Signaling , Altruistic Punishment , and Other Biological Components of Fiction . "
Instead of suggesting that readers like reading about fictional love and violence because of inherent interest in evolutionary dramas , Flesch said that stories play into our interest in socially monitoring other people — even unknown or imaginary people — to make sure that they are behaving pro-socially .
Social monitoring helps group survival by promoting social harmony and cooperation , Flesch suggested .
That means seeing whether people are altruistically helping others through acts of justice and mercy , or cheating on their spouses , friends and society .
Social monitoring also keeps track of whether people express the appropriate approval or disapproval of certain actions .
Studies have shown that some people may even go out of their way to punish the cheaters or defectors in a group , and earning the approval of others .
These " altruistic punishers " pay a personal cost to punish but earn the social respect of others because that cost payment represents an altruistic signal .
Altruistic punishment does n't just mean destroying the cheaters , though — it 's a lesson to both the cheater and observers that such behavior cannot be tolerated .
Ultimately , altruistic punishment means to change or convert the cheater 's behavior .
" The reason we want conversion is because we can see that a lot of seemingly anti-social actions and attitudes are pro-social activities that are n't working right , " Flesch told LiveScience .
" We have a sense that they could work right , if they are rightly corrected or punished or changed . "
Readers may delight in the complexity of " Pride and Prejudice " because wrong signals and social misunderstandings keep the potential lovers apart .
Elizabeth wrongly punishes Darcy at one point by rejecting his marriage proposal ( accompanied by a kick to the face in the mash - up ) , and yet he demonstrates his worthiness and evolutionary fitness by bearing the cost of her accusation that he is ' ungentlemanlike ' with great patience .
" Now her punishment is misguided , based on false assumptions , it turns out , which is what makes it possible for Darcy to admire it without in the end being destroyed by it , " Flesch pointed out .
" And his altruism consists in his doing the right thing instead of demanding compensation for the ways he 's been wronged . "
Storytelling as adaptation
Given the complex social scenarios which good stories can deploy to tickle our brains , the Literary Darwinists and Flesch generally agree that storytelling itself encourages pro-social behavior .
" It 's also probably true that — at least I hope it is — that there 's something good about the kinds of practicing in empathy that we get out of stories , especially when they 're subtle , " Flesch noted .
Tentative evidence exists in a 2006 study by Raymond Mar and other researchers at the University of Toronto , which found higher empathy scores in bookworms .
Carroll and other Literary Darwinists even suggest that storytelling could represent an evolutionary adaptation that promoted more social cohesion within early human groups .
" As far as we can tell , humans are the only species that create and occupy imaginative worlds , use it to regulate their behavior , activate their decision - making , " Carroll said .
" It has coevolved with human capacity for greater cognitive flexibility and for forming social groups . "
That idea has powerful attraction for some evolutionary psychologists and humanities scholars , although others such as Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker have expressed skepticism .
Flesch also remains dubious .
" I do n't think [ stories are ] an adaptation : I think they 're more a reflection of our intense pro-social disposition and they appeal to that disposition , which makes them particularly appropriate for social interaction , " Flesch said .
Flesch added that the pro-social tendency could have evolved through more basic adaptations , such as costly signaling through altruistic punishment — or costly signaling through rewarding altruistic punishment .
That might explain why readers of " Pride and Prejudice and Zombies " can feel an ancient thrill upon reading of Elizabeth and Darcy bonding over their mutual warrior prowess , despite a tongue - in - cheek joke that ensues when Elizabeth gives back some ammunition with the query , " Your balls , Mr. Darcy ? "
" They belong to you , Miss Bennett , " Darcy replies .
That Voodoo That Scientists Do
When findings are debated online , as with a yet to be released paper that calls out the field of social neuroscience , who wins ?
by Jon Bardin • Posted February 23 , 2009 11:55 AM
Few endeavors have been affected more by the tools and evolution of the internet than science publishing .
Thousands of journals are available online , and an increasing number of science bloggers are acting as translators , often using lay language to convey complex findings previously read only by fellow experts within a discipline .
Now , in the wake of a new paper challenging the methodology of a young field , there is a case study for how the internet is changing the way science itself is conducted .
circa
... It is ordinarily claimed that journals play two intellectual roles : a ) to communicate research information , and b ) to validate this information for the purpose of job and grant allocation .
As I 've explained , the role of journals as communicators of information has long since been supplanted in certain fields of physics , so let 's consider their other role .
Having queried a number of colleagues concerning the criteria they use in evaluating job applicants and grant proposals , it turns out that the otherwise unqualified number of published papers is too coarse a criterion and plays essentially no role .
Researchers are typically familiar with the research in their own field , and must in any event independently evaluate it together with letters of recommendation from trusted sources .
Recent activity levels of candidates were mentioned as a criterion , but that too is independent of publication per se : " hot preprints " on a CV can be as important as any publication .
Although the arXiv is not peer - reviewed , a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions and may recategorize any that are deemed off - topic ... . . .
The lack of peer - review , while a concern to some , is not considered a hindrance to those who use the arXiv .
Many authors exercise care in what they post .
A majority of the e-prints are also submitted to journals for publication , but some work , including some very influential papers , remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer - reviewed journal .

Two groups of neuroimaging scientists , shocked by the speed with which this paper was being publicly disseminated , wrote rebuttals and posted them in the comments section of several blogs , including Begley's .
Vul followed up in kind , linking to a rebuttal of the rebuttals in the comment sections of several blogs .
This kind of scientific discourse — which typically takes place in the front matter of scholarly journals or over the course of several conferences — developed at a breakneck pace , months before the findings were officially published , and among the usual chaos of blog comments : inane banter , tangents , and valid opinions from the greater public .
The usual chaos of blog comments ?

Are blogs good or bad for the enterprise of scientific peer review ?
At present , the system relies on anonymous referees to provide " unbiased " opinions of a paper 's ( or grant 's ) merits .
For today , the discussion will focus on peer review of papers in scientific journals .
In Seed Magazine : I think science wins !
The notion that " in press " papers are off - limits to online discussion is very quaint ...
Discussing ( and citing ) such manuscripts in the " normal academic channels " is a frequent event ; why should bloggers refrain from such a practice ?
Bardin 's article begins : Really ?
Maybe that 's true for Biological and Social Sciences , but certainly not for Physics , Mathematics , Computer Science , Quantitative Biology , Quantitative Finance and Statistics ( see arXiv.org , which was started in 1991 by Paul Ginsparg ) .
Given that the field of academic physics adopted an electronic publishing model very early on , what 's the role of physics journals ?
Well , 1994 ...
But what about peer review ??
So brand new manuscripts in those fields are placed in a public archivethey are peer - reviewed .
It 's not a new idea , and it 's much more radical than discussing an already - reviewed manuscript that has been accepted for publication .
And that 's the paper we 've all come to know and love ( or hate ) : the one by Ed Vul and colleagues on PDF ) , summarized in this post .
In their article , Vul et al. claimed that over half of the fMRI studies that were surveyed used faulty statistical techniques to analyze their data .
Two rebuttals were released online shortly thereafter : one by Jabbi et al. ( in preparation , PDF ) and an invited reply by Lieberman et al. ( submitted , PDF ) .
What 's the problem here ?
It 's that bloggers were writing about it !
That authors and anonymous commenters somehow sullied their ideological purity by entering the free - wheeling , fast - moving world of the blogosphere .
But in the modern era , why wait 5 months for a paper to be " officially " published before you 're allowed to discuss it ?
And despite what the critics of Voodoo say , Vul et al . 's paper wasplastered all over the popular press ( unlike many of the Voodoo findings themselves ) .
In one of the higher - profile popular outlets , published dueling interviews with Matthew Lieberman ( left ) and Ed Vul ( right ) , with Voodoo Correlations : Have the Results of Some Brain Scanning Experiments Been Overstated ?
vs. In Defense of the Value of Social Neuroscience
The only other mainstream media exposure has been from Sharon Begley of , who covered the issue in her blog ( i.e. , The ' Voodoo ' Science of Brain Imaging and More on Brain Voodoo ) and in one of her magazine columns .
But many are dubious .
According to Seed : Hello ??
How about anonymous referees for journals ?
Are they neverguilty of reviews filled with inane banter and tangents ?
We 've all had exposure -- whether from our bosses , advisors , or colleagues or through our own experience -- to rude and nasty and ill - informed reviewers .
And many journal editors do not rein them in .
The Neurocritic has been a proponent of completely open peer review , where the identity of the authorsthe reviewers is known ( see Anonymous Peer Review Means Never Having to Say You 're Sorry Peer Review Trial and Debate at Nature , and Double - Blind Bind ) .
That way , Dr. Nasty can't hide behind the shield of anonymity when making those dumb-ass comments .
In the meantime , here 's another possible solution , from a poll by Talking Brains Back to the chaos ( and the use of loaded language ) :
Tor Wager , a Columbia University cognitive neuroscientist , whose work was not mentioned in Vul 's paper but who helped prepare one of the rebuttals , says that it was important to respond both publicly and swiftly .
" The public and the news media operate on sound bites , and the real scientific issues are quite complex . "
His complaints focus not only on the content of Vul 's paper , but also on the authors ' diction — specifically , the title , and its use of " voodoo . "
" When the conversation gets complex — and with statistics it always is — many blog readers will form opinions based on very simple things , " says Wager .
" Like words such as ' voodoo correlations . '
There 's no reason to use such loaded words when making a statistical argument .
The argument should be able to stand on its own . "
Perspectives in Psychological Science ,
• Meta-analysis work featured in The Economist ( Dec 2006 )
• Interview on NPR ’s Talk of the Nation ( with Ira Flatow , 2007 )

• Placebo work featured in article in Wired Magazine
• Placebo work featured in article in National Geographic
• News coverage of placebo work : MSNBC , BBC , LA Times , Reuters , other news services
Vul has a different take .
Once their paper had passed peer review , Vul and his colleagues argue , it was the public 's right to read about it , and respond to it , however they chose — especially given that it sought to reveal flaws in publicly funded research that gets widespread media coverage .
Comment wars
Starting January 12 , anonymous commenters on the Neurocritic 's blog posted rebuttals from Vul 's detractors ; and Vul followed with rebuttals of the rebuttals .
Nature
More researchers should engage with the blogosphere , including authors of papers in press .
Is blogging a part of science , journalism or public discourse ?
In fact it may be all of these — an ambiguity that can sometimes leave scientists feeling uncertain about the rules of the game .
And so Ed Diener , the editor ofhas stricken the offending word from the title .......... But Dr. Wager is no stranger to the media , since he has positioned his own work for widespread media coverage ... and the social neuroscientists are allowed to benefit from all the fawning press coverage that overstates their results , and from the increases in funding that follow .
But when one -- ONE -- paper dares to criticize some of the methodology , that 's dangerous .
AND IT MUST BE STOPPED !
Because we all know that bloggers influence funding decisions But ... Needless to say , I agree with this point , but I 've also publicized the rebuttals as well ( as noted in the Seed article ) : Go bloggers !
And now it 's official : declares that It 's good to blog
... but only up to a point :
The blogosphere differs from mass media and specialized media in many respects , but the same considerations apply in disseminating new scientific results there .
Authors of papers in press have the right to correct misrepresentations and to point to results that will appear in a paper .
But a full discussion should await the paper 's publication .
Nonetheless , they end on a positive note :
Indeed , researchers would do well to blog more than they do .
The experience of journals such as Cell and PLoS ONE , which allow people to comment on papers online , suggests that researchers are very reluctant to engage in such forums .
But the blogosphere tends to be less inhibited , and technical discussions there seem likely to increase .
Moreover , there are societal debates that have much to gain from the uncensored voices of researchers .
A good blogging website consumes much of the spare time of the one or several fully committed scientists that write and moderate it .
But it can make a difference to the quality and integrity of public discussion .
Many of us believe that is true .
And with that , it 's time for me to go to bed .
Business
Small business financing refers to the activity of funding a business owner with money so that he can set up a business , buy a working business or bring changes to an existing business .
According to your needs and wants , there are many ways by which your small business can be financed .
Here are some of those ways .
Assets – Mostly , small business financing is done by means of using the assets of the business owner .
In case of absence of liquid assets , leverage is an option to finance your business .
It should be fairly easy to sell out all those unnecessary possessions .
Strike good deals , and there you have it – a good amount of cash .
If possible , you can even get a home equity loan but you have to be careful with the payments .
If you fail to repay , your house can be taken away .
Angel Investors –
These are the successful business owners who are capable of financing new businesses and helping them come up .
Many famous companies have come up with the help of angel investors .
They demand a certain percentage of the business returns , since they do not provide you with a loan but simply share the business with you .
Depending on the risks involved in the business , the percentage of stake in business can go up .
So in a way , you not only share the profits of your business but also the risks regarding it .
Bank loans –
This is the most traditional form of financing a business .
For small businesses , there are many different types of loans to choose from .
However , it is not all that easy to acquire bank loans .
They have high interest rates and they aim to make money off big loans .
They can be detrimental for new businesses in case of failure to repay the loan .
Collateral and even other business assets can be seized in such a case .
Even then , with the right strategy and planning , bank loans can turn out to be helpful .
Credit cards –
Though this is the most readily available form of financing and provides for small payments at a time , there are some things you have got to be careful about .
For instance , the interest rates on the credit card climb up alarmingly high .
It may even be about four times higher than the interest rate charged by a commercial lender .
You would not want that sort of debt building up .
Unless you are capable of paying back the loan before it builds up into a mountain with all that interest , do not go for this option .

( Image : Catherine " Kate " Puzey , from her online photo album . )
I have been traveling in the Republic of Benin in West Africa for the last two weeks , and am writing this blog post now from the country 's sorthern port capital , Cotonou .
Two days ago , a 24 - year - old Peace Corps volunteer from Georgia named Catherine Puzey , who maintained a colorful and passionate personal blog , was found dead outside her home in a remote , rural village about a seven hour drive north of here .
Her death is understood to have been a murder , though neither the US nor Benin governments have officially declared it so .
By coincidence , my travel partner and I passed through that very same village , on that same day .
We spent most of the day just 10 km from Badjoudè , where the young Ms. Puzey lived and volunteered as an English teacher for the past two years , and died .
Kate , as she was known to friends , maintained a ( Blogger ) blog here , and a photo album series on Picasa , which was last updated just a few weeks ago .
Judging from both , and the comments piling up elsewhere , she was loved intensely by family , friends , and fellow volunteers — and by the Beninois community that had become her home .
This very traditional village is close to the border of Togo , in the northwestern part of Benin .
My fellow travelers and I spent most of that day in the nearby village of Alédjo - Koura , a short drive away .
The roads in this area are just rough , red , dirt .
It is absolutely not an area frequented by tourists or foreigners .
It was so strange to realize we'd been so close to the site , so randomly on that day , in such an unconnected place off the beaten path .
I heard about the incident when we were en route back to the capital a day later , long after we 'd left the area .
An AP wire item came out last night , as did one post , and then another , on an ABC News blog .
The Peace Corps and the US State Department issued statements , but without details .
An investigation is ongoing , I 'm told by a source in Cotonou familiar with the case .
As Africa goes , Benin really is a stable , peaceful , relatively safe country .
Poverty and related health problems are intense and widespread ; domestic violence is a big problem .
But I 'm told that violence of this kind in rural communities is rare , and violence against foreigners , particularly NGO workers or aid volunteers , more so .
Earlier today , I spoke to two Beninese men I know here in Cotonou who happen to be from an adjacent village .
We 'd all been traveling together on the 12th .
They said the people in Benin tend to ( their words here ) " respect foreigners , " and the incident saddened and angered them .
Translating , roughly : " It 's terrible for our community when something like this happens , because the West already thinks badly of Africa and of Africans .
One violent act like this , committed by one bad person , means the assistance and development our country so desperately needs will become more scarce , and that fewer volunteers like her , fewer means of support and change , will come . "
I realized after speaking with them that on the road back to the capital yesterday , our shared car had crossed paths with the string of vehicles carrying government investigators and Benin 's security minister up to Badjoudè .
Government vehicles , I 've learned on this trip , blare out distinctive siren sounds that distinguish them from normal police or fire vehicles .
They tend to move in squads for security .
We 'd passed similar caravans carrying Benin 's president Boni Yayi earlier in the week near the Cotonou airport , as he was coming back from a trip to India .
Ms. Puzey 's blog is a beautiful read .
Cleary , she loved this place , and many of the people of the place she called home in turn had great affection for her .
I 've just sat here for hours in a Cotonou hotel bar , reading her blog posts and poring through her photos .
Here is a snip from my favorite entry , about ambient noise in the village — something I 've been very aware of on this trip :
I realized some time ago my education here goes way beyond the local language and customs .
I 've become familiar with so many new sounds .
I now know the sound of a chicken when it 's being killed , a goat when it 's giving birth , the baby next door when it 's hungry .
I know the sound of the tonal repetitions in the local language when two close friends meet in passing ; the rumble of the flour grinder two houses down and the hum of a nearby generator ; the sound of mice and big lizards running around my ceiling at night and the ruckus that ensues when one chases the other ( I always root for the lizard ) ; the sound of the marché across the way from me carrying on well into the night ; the deep - throated grumble of cattle as they graze in front of my house ; the low clicking orders of their herder ; the whining of children versus the baying of goats , though I swear one goat sounds like he 's always saying in a deep grumpy voice " Badddddd ! "
( I 've named him Eeyore ) ; all the different bird and insect calls .
I 'm even learning to discern the voice of each student who , in passing at night , will see me cooking dinner by candlelight and holler out from the dark " Good Evening , Madame Catherine ! "
This passage , from another post ( which includes a mention of her work holding workshops on family planning , conflict resolution and women's health with village girls ) really hits home for me now , as I shift from my brief experience of village life here toward a return to Los Angeles :
Even in its calmest moments — say , the minute just before a gorgeous sunrise over the plains — [ Africa ] is vibrant and tussled , never at rest , never totally tranquil .
I think in America we sometimes overlook how many of us live in ideal magazine images of our own making .
My condolences to the friends and family of this beautiful young woman .

We 've covered the details of Asset Smart in the past , including the initial announcement of the deal , so we 're going to assume you 're familiar with the particulars of this situation and the market realities that led AMD to go " asset smart . "
If you need a refresher on the history of the company and its various products , check our earlier coverage .
Put succinctly , AMD decided to divest itself of its manufacturing assets when it became apparent that the company could no longer afford the enormous expense of attempting to match Intel 's process technology and / or manufacturing tech .
Cost curves like those above do n't lie ; fast forward five months , and here we are .
Some of the numbers and investment amounts have changed owing to the steadily deteriorating economy , and the revised deal is as follows : The Advanced Technology Investment Company ( ATIC ) has paid AMD $ 700 million for a share of the Foundry Company .
That $ 700 million goes straight to AMD 's pocket as much - needed cash — it'll almost certainly guarantee a profitable first quarter — but that 's not the only carrot AMD secured with the spin off .
The Foundry Company has assumed responsibility for about $ 1.1 billion of AMD 's debt ; the company has not released information on which debts Foundry Co assumed or whether the repayment terms / interest rates on the loans were recalculated .
Ostensibly , this should make it easier for AMD Design to turn a profit , since the smaller company wo n't be buried under a mountain of R&D or fab - related debt .
ATIC was n't the only financial group pumping money into Sunnyvale — the Mubadala Development Company of Abu Dhabi paid AMD a further $ 125 million in exchange for 58 million shares and warrants in addition to the 35 million shares AMD had previously negotiated .
I do n't claim to be a financial analyst , but this spinoff has to have made significant improvements to AMD 's balance sheet .
I 'll leave it up to you whether said improvements constitute a corporate visit to the set of Extreme Makeover or the application of lipstick to a porcine proboscis .
Any time a company can lift $ 1.1 billion off the " red " column and drop $ 825 million in the bank , it 's a good day .
AMD executives are flush with excitement ( or doing a good job of faking it ) .
" With the close of this historic transaction , AMD and its committed partners have conceived two strong industry - leading companies capable of charting future courses that will dramatically improve the technology industry , ” said Dirk Meyer , president and chief executive officer of AMD .
" We are proud of our vision , the opportunities we are creating around the world , and fortunate to have astute , committed strategic partners in Mubadala and ATIC , and we are delighted to welcome Mubadala to the board of AMD .
We are confident that this strategy and partnership will enable AMD to achieve long - term success based on designing and integrating industry - leading computing and graphics technologies that deliver compelling user experiences . "
A wise man builds his house foundry on the rock
The Foundry Co begins life with an " enterprise value " of $ 4.3 billion — which is n't at all the same thing as saying that Foundry Co has $ 4.3 billion in the bank , or even that the company 's fabs and cash on hand hit the mark .
Of that $ 4.3 billion , AMD estimates that $ 1.8 billion of it comes from " AMD 's contribution of manufacturing assets and liabilities , ( including its fabrication facilities in Dresden ) , intellectual property and employees . "
$ 1.4 billion comes from ATIC , and the last $ 1.1 billion is the value of the debt Foundry Co assumed from AMD .
The two companies will issue joint financial reports ; stockholders are split 50/50 between AMD and ATIC .
After all the hustle and bustle , the truth is that not much is going to change in the short term .
AMD Design will continue to work on its ultra - low - voltage multimedia notebooks , land OEM wins , and design microprocessors while the Foundry Co will keep on keepin ' on when it comes to building Shanghai , Deneb , Barcelona , and the older Athlon X2 series .
It will take some time for the two companies to significantly diverge ; Foundry Co will scarcely be deploying 40nm process technology on bulk silicon next month .
The corporate executives we 've spoken to at AMD have implied on several occassions that the new split would give both companies room to stretch and fund new projects and ideas that the single AMD previously could n't due to its strangling amount of debt .
The Foundry Co. will supposedly break ground in New York State by the end of this year and hopes to ramp its 32nm process by the middle of 2010 .
That sort of talk makes sense in a bullish economy , sounds odd when bears are on the prowl , and is nearly flabbergasting when it comes from AMD .
It would be easy , at this juncture , to lean back in my office chair and jaw about all the various times we 've heard this sort of talk before , whether it was AMD , Intel , or another company altogether .
It 'd be easy — but it might not be smart .
We 've discussed AMD 's need for a new approach and market plan for months .
The deal to split the company into two halves was anything but spur - of - the - moment — it took about two years to hammer out the details — and it might be premature to conclude that AMD 's talk of a resurgence is nothing but smoke .
Practically speaking , it better not be .
As we saw in our recent Phenom II performance evaluation , clockspeed alone — even by the GHz — will not allow Deneb to reach Nehalem .
Something else is necessary — hopefully it's on the drawing board .

It was a mixed bag of victory and defeat for science on Friday when the Texas Board of Education voted on their state science standards .
In a move that pleased the scientific community , the board voted to not include proposed changes that would call for the teaching of the “ strengths and weaknesses ” of scientific theories – code words for allowing creationist views into the classroom .
However , additional amendments that were voted through provide loopholes for creationist teaching .
“ It ’s as if they slammed the door shut with strengths and weaknesses , then ran around the house opening windows to let it in a bunch of other ways , ” says Dan Quinn , who was on site at the hearings .
Quinn is communications director of the Texas Freedom Network , a community watchdog organisation .
One amendment calls for students to “ analyze and evaluate scientific explanations concerning the complexity of the cell , ” phrasing that rings of intelligent design arguments .
Advertisement
Another amendment requires students to “ analyze and evaluate scientific explanations concerning any data on sudden appearance and stasis and the sequential groups in the fossil record . ”
These issues are commonly held up by creationists as arguments against evolution , even though the scientific community disagrees .
Anti-evolutionist Don McLeroy , a dentist and chair of the Texas State Board of Education , testified at Friday ’s hearing : “ I disagree with these experts .
Someone has got to stand up to experts . ”
Age of the universe
An amendment to the environmental sciences standards requires students to “ analyze and evaluate different views on the existence of global warming ” , despite overwhelming consensus within the scientific community that global warming exists .
An amendment to the Earth and space sciences curriculum requires the teaching of different theories of the origin , age and history of the universe .
The board voted to remove from the standards the statement that the universe is roughly 14 billion years old .
“ The goal here was to make science more tentative and vague so that teachers have room to tell students , ‘ This is only one explanation and the scientists are not even sure about it themselves ’ – which is , of course , utter nonsense , ” says Quinn .
School textbooks are required to comply with a state ’s science standards , so all changes to the science standards translate into changes to textbooks .
In two years , the board will meet to review the state ’s textbooks , so creationists have been eager to slip in changes to the standards ahead of time .
Influential state
Texas is one of the largest purchasers of textbooks in the US , a market publishers can’t afford to lose .
So they will likely have to water down the science in their books and add in creationist pseudo - science to appease the school board .
“ If the publishers do n’t come back with arguments against natural selection and common descent , the board is going to vote to reject those textbooks , ” Quinn says .
What ’s more , while the “ strengths and weaknesses ” language was rather vague , the new amendments provide publishers with a very specific roadmap for what they have to include in their textbooks .
“ It will be much harder for publishers to fudge , ” says Quinn .
Creating a Texas - only edition of a biology textbook would be expensive , which means other states would probably end up having to use the same scientifically inaccurate textbooks .
“ Many publishers are in dire economic straits these days , so the added expense of making a special edition for one state is not something they would be eager to take on , ” says Steven Newton of the National Center for Science Education .
“ I think it ’s likely this would affect other states . ”
“ We ’re going to be watching and we will make sure that if the textbooks include junk science , that people know about it , ” Quinn says .
“ If other states reject these books , publishers might stop publishing for Texas because it ’s so expensive . ”
Discovery ties
If that happens , other publishers more friendly to intelligent design ( ID ) might fill the breach .
The Discovery Institute , the Seattle - based headquarters of the ID movement , for example , has already published its own biology textbook entitled Explore Evolution : The arguments for and against Neo-Darwinism .
The book does not explicitly mention ID , but presents its standard arguments , arguments that are precisely in line with those adopted in the new standards .
That may be no coincidence : one of the co-authors of the book , Ralph Seelke , was chosen by McLeroy to serve as an expert curriculum reviewer for the Texas board .
So too was Stephen Meyer , director of the Discovery Institute ’s Center for Science and Culture .
The Discovery Institute ’s Casey Luskin also testified at the board meeting , saying , “ We urge you to make students aware of these scientific debates . ”
“ The Discovery Institute is in this up to their eyeballs , ” says Barbara Forrest , a philosophy professor at Southeastern Louisiana University and an expert on the history of creationism .
“ They are heavily invested in what happens in Texas . ”
In fact , McLeroy has been working with Discovery Institute fellow Walter Bradley , a Texan , since at least 2003 to promote changes to the biology textbooks .
Academic freedom
Texas creationists had already crafted a back - up plan in case Friday ’s school board vote did n’t go their way .
Republican House Representative Wayne Christian has drafted a piece of legislation ( House Bill 4224 ) that proposes to add the “ strengths and weaknesses ” language back into the standards .
What ’s more , if passed , the bill would protect students from being “ penalized in any way because he or she subscribes to a particular position on scientific theories ” and allow teachers to help students to “ understand , analyze , review and critique scientific explanations , including hypotheses and theories , as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information . ”
The bill is the latest in a series of “ academic freedom bills ” that have been proposed throughout several states in the US .
Most have failed – in Oklahoma , New Mexico and Iowa they were quickly killed off , while in Missouri , Alabama and Florida such bills are still pending .
Last year , Louisiana became the first state to sign an academic freedom bill into law .
If the same thing happens in Texas , it could be extremely detrimental to science education in that state and beyond .
‘ Subjective ’ science
“ It would essentially override the school board ’s vote to insert the ‘ strengths and weaknesses ’ language back into the standards , ” says Newton .
“ Telling a student that they ca n’t be penalized grade - wise because they subscribe to a specific opinion on science – that will be a big problem .
It opens science up to being a relative thing . ”
“ And you can imagine a teacher thinking , ‘ I ’ll have a potential lawsuit from this student if I grade them down , so I ’m not even going to touch on controversial topics like evolution , the age of the Earth , the formation of the solar system , etc. , ' ” Newton told New Scientist .
“ Everyone still has in their minds that figure of a million dollars that the Dover school district had to pay out [ in legal fees after an intelligent design trial ] , and that ’s a powerful thing . ”
The academic freedom legislation is the brainchild of the Discovery Institute and the promoters of the film Expelled , a pro-intelligent design “ documentary ” in which former Nixon speech writer Ben Stein argued that Darwin ’s theory of evolution led to the Holocaust .
‘ Pushing the legal envelope ’
Experts suspect that strategically , the Discovery Institute actually wants teachers to be prosecuted in a Dover - style court case , and that they are using the proposed Texas academic freedom bill to lure teachers into a legal trap by encouraging them to bring religious ideas into the classroom .
“ Teaching creationism or ID has been repeatedly found to be unconstitutional , ” Forrest says .
“ These bills cannot supersede the constitution and will not protect the teachers from litigation . ”
“ The Discovery Institute is pushing the legal envelope and inviting litigation because they have been shopping around for years for the right judicial district in which they could win this kind of case , ” she told New Scientist .
“ They need a district where they can control the people on the ground , as they do in Texas .
They want a ruling that conflicts with Dover in a different judicial district , because that would be the most likely scenario in which the Supreme Court would hear a case .
That is exactly what they want . ”
Insurance salesmen
Meanwhile , pro-science legislators are also doing their best to fight these actions .
Senator Rodney Ellis and House Representative Garnet Coleman – both Democrats from Houston , Texas – have introduced legislation ( Senate Bill 440 and House Bill 3382 , respectively ) that would transfer authority for textbook adoptions and curriculum approval from the Board of Education to the Texas Education Agency .
“ When you have dentists and insurance salesmen and attorneys deciding what students should learn about science in a public school classroom , you ’ve got a problem , ” says Quinn .
And elections for the members of the Board of Education will be held next year , so voters could potentially get more science advocates on the board before the textbook reviews the following year .
Science took some blows in Texas on Friday , but the battle is n’t close to over , and Quinn , for one , is optimistic that people will continue to fight the good fight .
“ When you have an elected body doing everything it can to undermine the education of your kids and making it harder for them to compete and succeed in the 21st century , ” he says , “ that ’s when people take notice and stand up . ”
Deficits ad Absurdum By Arnold Kling
Brad Setser writes ,
Facts are facts .
The US has already proved it can raise over $ 1.5 trillion in a single year [ in Treasury borrowing ]
That is a the sort of statement that could come back and haunt someone .
It is along the lines of the guy jumping out of a building from the 10th floor , passing the third floor and saying , “ It ’s all fine so far . ”
It is amazing what happens when you assume that you live in a linear world .
You say that the multiplier for government spending is 1.57 .
Really ?
Over what range ?
Think of it this way : at which level of additional government spending would the path of U.S. real GDP be the highest ?
( a) $ 100 billion in spending above the baseline
( b ) $ 1 trillion in spending above the baseline
( c ) $ 100 trillion in spending above the baseline
If you use a constant multiplier of 1.57 , the right answer is ( c ) .
Yet we know that this is not the right answer .
At $ 100 trillion in additional government spending , the United States would be operating like Zimbabwe , with similar results .
So to talk about “ the ” multiplier , as if it were linear , has to be wrong at some level .
Is the multiplier linear over the range between $ 100 billion of additional spending and $ 1 trillion of additional spending ?
I think that is unlikely .
Between , say $ 400 billion and $ 800 billion , is the incremental multiplier still in a range between 1 and 2 ?
I worry that it is much lower .
I worry that it turns negative somewhere in that range .
The Obama Administration is being populated with outstanding academics , like Larry Summers and Cass Sunstein .
It is not surprising that the academic world is expressing a lot of confidence in giving them huge amounts of power .
These are people who are more than three standard deviations higher in IQ than average , but I still suspect that this leaves them more than three standard deviations below what would be needed to justify giving these technocrats $ 10,000 from every household in America to spend at the their discretion ( I ’m adding the remainder of the TARP to the stimulus , since it is getting harder and harder to distinguish the two concepts from one another ) .
The folks working on the stimulus package are not people who have spent time in middle management in a large organization , where you see how life differs from a calculus problem or a term paper .
Right now , the typical academic cannot imagine Obama ’s team doing anything stupid .

For the first time , scientists have isolated the parasite Nosema ceranae ( Microsporidia ) from professional apiaries suffering from honey bee colony depopulation syndrome .
They then went on to treat the infection with complete success .
In a study published in the new journal from the Society for Applied Microbiology : Environmental Microbiology Reports , scientists from Spain analysed two apiaries and found evidence of honey bee colony depopulation syndrome ( also known as colony collapse disorder in the USA ) .
They found no evidence of any other cause of the disease ( such as the Varroa destructor , IAPV or pesticides ) , other than infection with Nosema ceranae .
The researchers then treated the infected surviving under- populated colonies with the antibiotic drug , flumagillin and demonstrated complete recovery of all infected colonies .
The loss of honey bees could have an enormous horticultural and economic impact worldwide .
Honeybees are important pollinators of crops , fruit and wild flowers and are indispensable for a sustainable and profitable agriculture as well as for the maintenance of the non-agricultural ecosystem .
Honeybees are attacked by numerous pathogens including viruses , bacteria , fungi and parasites .
For most of these diseases , the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood , hampering the development of new ways to prevent and combat honeybee diseases .
So , any progress made in identifying causes and subsequent treatments of honey bee colony collapse is invaluable .
There have been other hypothesis for colony collapse in Europe and the USA , but never has this bug been identified as the primary cause in professional apiaries .
" Now that we know one strain of parasite that could be responsible , we can look for signs of infection and treat any infected colonies before the infection spreads " said Dr Higes , principle researcher .
This finding could help prevent the continual decline in honey bee population which has recently been seen in Europe and the USA .

HONG KONG 
Two senior Chinese officials on Wednesday offered differing interpretations on the state of China ’s economy , one expressing optimism that the country was on the road to recovery , the other warning that it could be bumpy and slow .
The comments by a top official of China ’s central bank and the chief economist of a leading research organization illustrated how hard it is for economists anywhere to reach a consensus on whether China and other leading economies have now put the worst behind them .
A string of recent data has made most observers reasonably confident that the pace of decline has at least slowed in the United States and that China ’s economy is likely to pick up again .
China is one of the world ’s few large economies to avoid outright recession this year , although growth will be well below the double - digit rates before the global financial crisis began .
Yi Gang , a vice governor of the People ’s Bank of China , said in Beijing that a two - year stimulus package of 4 trillion yuan , or $ 585 billion that was announced in November had helped restore confidence and support a growth rate close to the official target of 8 percent this year .

Thanks !
I hope you are well .
I know you are not .
As it happens you wrote in 1973 a letter to your future self and it is high time that your future self had the decency to write back .
You declared in that letter ( reproduced in your 1997 autobiography Moab Is My Washpot ) that " everything I feel now as an adolescent is true " .
You went on to affirm that if ever you dared in later life to repudiate , deny or mock your 16 - year - old self it would be a lie , a traducing , treasonable lie , a crime against adolescence .
" This is who I am , " you wrote .
" Each day that passes I grow away from my true self .
Every inch I take towards adulthood is a betrayal . "
Oh , lord love you , Stephen .
How I admire your arrogance and rage and misery .
How pure and righteous they are and how passionately storm - drenched was your adolescence .
How filled with true feeling , fury , despair , joy , anxiety , shame , pride and above all , supremely above all , how overpowered it was by love .
My eyes fill with tears just to think of you .
Of me .
Tears splash on to my keyboard now .
I am perhaps happier now than I have ever been and yet I cannot but recognise that I would trade all that I am to be you , the eternally unhappy , nervous , wild , wondering and despairing 16 - year - old Stephen : angry , angst - ridden and awkward but alive .
Because you know how to feel , and knowing how to feel is more important than how you feel .
Deadness of soul is the only unpardonable crime , and if there is one thing happiness can do it is mask deadness of soul .
I finally know now , as I easily knew then , that the most important thing is love .
It does n't matter in the slightest whether that love is for someone of your own sex or not .
Gay issues are important and I shall come to them in a moment , but they shrivel like a salted snail when compared to the towering question of love .
Gay people sometimes believe ( to this very day , would you credit it , young Stephen ? ) that the preponderance of obstacles and terrors they encounter in their lives and relationships is intimately connected with the fact of their being gay .
As it happens at least 90 % of their problems are to do with love and love alone : the lack of it , the denial of it , the inequality of it , the missed reciprocity in it , the horrors and heartaches of it .
Love cold , love hot , love fresh , love stale , love scorned , love missed , love denied , love betrayed ... the great joke of sexuality is that these problems bedevil straight people just as much as gay .
The 10 % of extra suffering and complexity that uniquely confronts the gay person is certainly not incidental or trifling , but it must be understood that love comes first .
This is tough for straight people to work out .
Straight people are encouraged by culture and society to believe that their sexual impulses are the norm , and therefore when their affairs of the heart and loins go wrong ( as they certainly will ) , when they are flummoxed , distraught and defeated by love , they are forced to believe that it must be their fault .
We gay people at least have the advantage of being brought up to expect the world of love to be imponderably and unmanageably difficult , for we are perverted freaks and sick aberrations of nature .
They - poor normal lambs - naturally find it harder to understand why , in Lysander 's words , " the course of true love never did run smooth " .
Sexual availability , so long an impossible dream in your age , becomes the norm in the late 70s and early 80s , only to be shattered by a new disease whose horrors you cannot even imagine .
You would little believe that I can say to you now across the gap of 35 years that we are the blessed ones .
The people of Britain are happy ( or not ) because of Tolpuddle Martyrs , Chartists , infantry regiments , any number of ancestors who made the world more comfortable for them .
And we , gay people , are happy now ( or not ) in large part thanks to Stonewall rioters , Harvey Milk , Dennis Lemon , Gay News , Ian McKellen , Edwina Currie ( true ) et al , and the battered bodies of bullied , beaten and abused gay men and women who stood up to be counted and refused to apologise for the way they were .
It has given us something we never thought to have : pride .
For a thousand years , shame was our lot and now , turning on a sixpence , we have arrived at pride - without even , it seems , an intervening period of well - it 's - OK - I - suppose - would n't - have - chosen - it - but - there - you - go .
Who 'da thought it ?
I know what you are doing now , young Stephen .
It 's early 1973 .
You are in the library , cross - referencing bibliographies so that you can find more and more examples of queer people in history , art and literature against whom you can hope to validate yourself .
Leonardo , Tchaikovsky , Wilde , Barons Corvo and von Gloeden , Robin Maugham , Worsley , " an Englishman " , Jean Genet , Cavafy , Montherlant , Roger Peyrefitte , Mary Renault , Michael Campbell , Michael Davies , Angus Stewart , Gore Vidal , John Rechy , William Burroughs .
So many great spirits really do confirm that hope !
It emboldens you to know that such a number of brilliant ( if often doomed ) souls shared the same impulse and desires as you .
I know the index - card waltz of ( auto ) biographies , poems and novels you are dancing : those same names are still so close to the surface of my mind nearly four decades later .
Novels , poetry and the worlds of art and ideas are opening up in front of you almost incidentally .
You spend all your time in the library yearning to be told that you are not alone , and an unlooked for side - effect of this just happens to be a real education achieved in a private school designed for philistine bumpkins .
Being born queer has given you , by mistake , a fantastic advantage over the rugger - playing ordinaries who surround you .
But those rugger - playing ordinaries have souls too .
And you should know that .
I know you cannot believe it now .
They seem so secure , so assured , so blessedly normal .
They gave Cuthbert Worsley the Kipling - derived title of his overwhelmingly important ( to you ) autobiography The Flannelled Fool : " these are the men that have lost their soul /
The flannelled fool at he wicket /
And the muddied oaf at the goal " .
You look down at the fools almost as much as you fear them .
The ordinary people , whose path through life is guaranteed .
They wo n't have to spend their days in public libraries , public lavatories and public courts ashamed , spurned and reviled .
There is no internet .
No Gay News .
No gay chatlines .
No men- seeking - men personals .
No out - and - proud celebs .
Just a world of shame and secrecy .
Somehow , as you age , a miracle will be wrought .
You will begin by descending deeper into the depths : expulsion , crime and prison - nothing really to do with being gay , but everything to do with love and your inability to cope with it .
Yet you will , as the Regency rakes used to say , " make a recover " and find yourself at university , where it will be astonishingly easy to be open about your sexuality .
No great trick , for the university is Cambridge , long a hotbed of righteous tolerance , spiritual heavy - petting and homo hysteria .
You will emerge from Cambridge and enter a world where being " out " is no big deal , although a puzzlingly small number of your coevals will find it as easy as you to emerge from the shadows .
Before you damn anyone for failing to come out , look to their parents .
The answer almost always lies there .
Oh how lucky in that department , as in so many , you are , young Stephen .
But do n't kid yourself .
For millions of teenagers around Britain and everywhere else , it is still 1973 .
Taunts , beatings and punishment await gay people the world over in playgrounds and execution grounds ( the distance between which is measured by nothing more than political constitutions and human will ) .
Yes , you will grow to be a very , very , very , very lucky man who is able to express his nature out loud without fear of hatred or reprisal from any except the most deluded , demented and sad .
But that is a small battle won .
A whole theatre of war remains .
This theatre of war is bigger than the simple issue of being gay , just as the question of love swamps the question of mere sexuality .
For alongside sexual politics the entire achievement of the enlightenment ( which led inter alia to gay liberation ) is under threat like never before .
The cruel , hypocritical and loveless hand of religion and absolutism has fallen on the world once more .
So my message from the future is twofold .
Fear not , young Stephen , your life will unfold in richer , more accepted and happier ways than you ever dared hope .
But be wary , for the most basic tenets of rationalism , openness and freedom that nourish you now and seem so unassailable are about to be harried and besieged by malevolent , mad and medieval minds .
You poor dear , dear thing .
Look at you weltering in your misery .
The extraordinary truth is that you want to stay there .
Unlike so many of the young , you do not yearn for adulthood , pubs and car keys .
You want to stay where you are , in the Republic of Pubescence , where feeling has primacy and pain is beautiful .
And you know what ... ?
I think you are right .

The Pirate Bay founders will receive a verdict on Friday One of the founders of file - sharing website The Pirate Bay has said he anticipates victory in the court battle over alleged copyright theft .
Peter Sunde said : " We are quite confident we are going to win . "
Mr Sunde said the site would continue operating even if he and his three co-defendants were found guilty on Friday .
The Pirate Bay is the world 's most high profile file - sharing website .
In February 2009 , it reported 22 million simultaneous users .
Frederik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Carl Lundstrom and Peter Sunde founded The Pirate Bay in 2003 .
No copyright content is hosted on The Pirate Bay 's web servers ; instead the site hosts " torrent " links to TV , film and music files held on its users ' computers .
The file - sharing program BitTorrent , which is a legal piece of file - sharing software , uses the torrent links to manage the transfer of files online between those who have parts of the data and those who need parts of the data .
Representatives of the movie , music and video games industry are seeking about 115 million kronor ( 10.6 million euros ) in damages and interest for losses incurred from tens of millions of illegal downloads facilitated by the site .
Court charges
The four men are charged with " assisting making available copyright material " after a higher charge of " assisting copyright infringement " was dropped on day two of the trial .
The Pirate Bay founders have consistently said their actions are legal under Swedish law because they offer a service that can be used in both a legal and illegal manner .
Mr Sunde told BBC
News : " We still do n't think we have done anything illegal under Swedish law .
" We do n't share any files ; we just link to material . "
He said even if the four men were found guilty the website would continue operating .
" The Pirate Bay will continue .
Nothing is going to happen if we lose , for a multitude for reasons , not least because we will immediately appeal . "
Representatives of the Swedish music industry have been vocal in their criticism of The Pirate Bay .
' Tired and sick '
At the conclusion of the Pirate Bay trial , Jonas Sjostrom , chairman of the Swedish Independent Music Producers Association , said in a statement : " We are ... tired and sick of services like The Pirate Bay who have no understanding or respect for the creative community , and instead have their own financial interests at heart . "
John Kennedy , chairman of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries , representing record firms around the world , told the Swedish court that The Pirate Bay had done " significant damage to the music industry as a whole " .
A written judgement by the Stockholm court will be issued on Friday morning .
The four defendants face fines and possible imprisonment , if found guilty .

The government hopes to get alcoholics on benefits back to work Alcoholics face having their benefits docked if they do not get treatment , under government plans .
Minister James Purnell has announced a review into the idea to be carried out jointly by the Department of Health and Department for Work and Pensions .
Measures that require drug addicts to get treatment in order to keep receiving benefits are currently going through Parliament .
The Conservatives said Labour had failed to " get to grips " with welfare .
Critics - including an addiction treatment charity and reformed alcoholic - say they doubt the measures will help addicts recover .
Mr Purnell said the government wanted to help people get the assistance they needed .
Speaking on a visit to Dewsbury Moor in West Yorkshire , he said : " We have introduced a new policy that will mean heroin and crack addicts get treatment in return for benefits .
" We will actually help them rather than simply handing them money which ends up in pockets of drug dealers .
The government has had more than a decade to sort this problem out so this is too little , too late
Theresa May , shadow work and pensions secretary
Announcement ' not really new ' " But we can't abandon anyone to long periods on benefits without help to overcome problems .
" So that 's why we are going to look at the arrangements for alcoholics on benefits , just as we did for problem drug users , so that people get the help they need to get sober , to get their life back and get back to work . "
Mr Purnell has previously said that the plans to cut drug addicts ' benefits would give them the chance to " turn their lives around " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Shadow work and pensions secretary Theresa May said this latest review was " another smokescreen " to " deflect from Labour 's failure to get to grips with our welfare system " .
She added : " Under James Purnell the system has gone into meltdown with more than 100,000 people claiming benefits because they are drug addicts or alcoholics .
That 's more than doubled from 48,700 since 1997 .
" The government has had more than a decade to sort this problem out so this is too little , too late .
" The devil is always in the detail with Labour .
Mr Purnell has failed to say when this will happen , how much it will cost and who it will exactly help . "
' Fundamentally inhumane ' Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Webb said the plans were " no more than typical New Labour posturing " .
He added : " Threatening to deprive people of their basic benefits unless they recover from alcoholism is fundamentally inhumane .
HAVE YOUR SAY
How people live their lives is none of the government 's business as long as it's within the law Lee , UK " There are far too few support services for alcoholics , and there is no evidence that people who are threatened in this way are more likely to seek help . "
A spokesman for drug and alcohol treatment charity Addaction said that , historically , help for people with alcohol problems was under - funded .
" We support measures to get treatment to the people who need it , but that treatment needs proper funding to be effective , " he said .
" Stopping someone 's benefits could have a real impact on any children they may have .
It 's essential that families are taken into account when such decisions are being made . "
One reformed alcoholic - who gave her name only as Linda - said she stopped drinking 18 years ago , having sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous .
" I went onto benefits when I stopped drinking .
I was so grateful that the government paid me incapacity benefit and gave me the help I needed , " she told BBC Radio 4's PM programme .
She said alcoholism was an illness which could not be " bullied " away .
" I only stopped when the time was right for me .
I could n't be bullied or cajoled or told to stop drinking , " she added .

Bletchley Park has attracted a further £ 300,000 funding after Milton Keynes Council agreed to match English Heritage 's pledge to stump extra cash for the " essential backlog of maintenance and urgent repairs needed at the WW2 Codebreaking Centre " - if another organisation could match the figure .
Dr Simon Thurley , chief exec of English Heritage , explained : “ Bletchley Park is of enormous historical importance and played a vital role in the allies winning the Second World War .
A large part of the activity that secured the freedom that Europe now enjoys took place here , and this is why English Heritage is so keen to help .
" When we announced our initial £ 330,000 grant last year for urgent roof repairs to the Grade II listed mansion , I laid down the gauntlet by pledging another £ 100,000 each year over three years if match funding could be found .
I am delighted that Milton Keynes Council has pledged this money which will ensure urgent repairs can be made to the historic buildings on the site . "
Simon Greenish , director of the Bletchley Park Trust , said : " Not only would we like to convey enormous gratitude to Milton Keynes Council and English Heritage for their collaboration and the clear demonstration of their belief in the Trust but , equally importantly , to the people of Milton Keynes for voting to support Bletchley Park in the Milton Keynes Council Budget Consultation .
" This vital endorsement takes us one step closer to achieving our aim of creating a world - class educational and heritage site reflecting Bletchley Park ’s crucial contribution to the outcome of WW2 and the Twentieth Century . ”
Cllr Vanessa McPake , the council Cabinet Member responsible for Heritage and Culture , joined the love - in with : “ I am delighted that the residents of Milton Keynes agreed that we should support Bletchley Park .
In this time of economic downturn more people are likely to be holidaying in the UK , so Bletchley Park has a real role to play in supporting the economy of Milton Keynes , as well as educating us all with their excellent exhibits and special events . ” ®
When faced with " computer says no " moments in shops and banks , Jan Stuart is occasionally tempted to leap over the counter and bash the till in frustration .
Just like the rest of us .
But unlike the rest of us , some thumps from Stuart 's fingers could do some good .
Why ?
Because , as a Cobol programmer , she may be able to fix the problem .
The " common business - oriented language " that has provided 59 - year - old Stuart with a career through to retirement age marks its 50th birthday this year .
The day to celebrate is slippery - Cobol did n't just scroll on to a terminal one day and ask the user to hit " Compile " - but 1959 is the year that the language came into being .
And Cobol is still in business .
According to David Stephenson , the UK manager for the software provider Micro Focus , " some 70 % to 80 % of UK plc business transactions are still based on Cobol " .
Stephenson 's company is an important player in the provision of tools to manage existing Cobol systems , not to mention building new applications , so an optimistic stance is to be expected .
But are companies really relying on a half - century - old invention to handle large chunks of their dealings ?
Mike Madden , development service manager with the catalogue - shopping firm JD Williams , believes so .
Better known for its online stores , such as Simply Be and Fifty Plus , Madden says JD Williams remains highly dependent on Cobol applications .
" We have a huge commitment to Cobol , " he says .
" About 50 % of our mainframe systems use it . "
Why ?
" Simple - we have n't found anything faster than Cobol for batch - processing , " Madden says .
" We use other languages , such as Java , for customer - facing websites , but Cobol is for order processing .
The code matches business logic , unlike other languages . "
Matching underwear
So , knicker - buying Simply Be customers are greeted by a pretty - in - pink Java interface , but when the order reaches the backroom , charcoal - grey Cobol code takes over the processing grunt work .
Stuart is familiar with this set - up .
Many of her organisation 's data - processing systems remain reliant on Cobol , she says .
" When Windows arrived , our executives all wanted their computers to look that way , " says Stuart , " so front ends changed .
But behind the scenes , the Cobol systems remain . "
Stuart asked for her company not to be named , though it is a well - known financial institution .
We also contacted the major UK banks , but none would talk publicly about what technology drives their backrooms , with most citing security concerns .
However , while Cobol is evidently still at large in business , a term used repeatedly to describe such systems is " legacy " .
" Legacy code supports our business model , " says Madden .
" We have around 2,500 programs running in Cobol and 60 of the 100 staff in our department are focused on legacy systems . "
Mike Gilpin , from the market research company Forrester , says that the company 's most recent related survey found that 32 % of enterprises say they still use Cobol for development or maintenance .
But it 's worth pointing out that in the same survey , in which multiple answers were permitted and no breakdown of " development " and " maintenance " was specified , Microsoft Visual Basic , .
Net and Java top the languages - used charts , at 65 % apiece .
A lot of this maintenance and development takes place on IBM products .
The company 's software group director of product delivery and strategy , Charles Chu , says that he does n't think " legacy " is pejorative .
" Business constantly evolves , " he adds , " but there are 250bn lines of Cobol code working well worldwide .
Why would companies replace systems that are working well ? "
The impression is that Cobol is to business what the internal - combustion engine is to motoring : it 's been around for so long , and is installed in so many places , with so much supporting infrastructure , that doing something different - even if the end result could be better - would be impossibly costly .
Obviously , Cobol has n't stood still for 50 years .
Older Cobol systems have been updated to integrate with today 's modish object - oriented programming languages .
Barely a year ago , for instance , IBM updated its Enterprise Cobol to version 4.1 , and further revisions are on the way .
Is there a new generation of programmers ready to grab the Cobol cudgels ?
Michael Coughlan , a lecturer at the University of Limerick , thinks so .
The institution 's computer science student intake tailed off 10 years ago .
The course evolved and Coughlan says that around half his fourth - year students now take the elective modules where Cobol is used .
Bugs mean business
Of course , a decade ago , folks got worked up about something called the millennium bug .
The debate over how serious was the threat that seemed to detonate with a " phut " has been played out , but Cobol code was high on the offender list , resulting in a mini-boom for Cobol developers .
Then it all went quiet , the web entered the ascendant and Cobol got forgotten again .
Well , by the outside world at least .
Stuart holds that Cobol cobblers remain in demand , and she estimates that those prepared to travel can expect to earn up to £ 80,000 a year .
Moreover , despite imminent retirement , Stuart is n't about to issue the End - Perform command on her work just yet : " I 'll continue doing bits and pieces .
Cobol is just a great language for business and it is n't going away . "
And business , it appears , agrees .
Begin : drinking 99 bottles
According to Michael Coughlan , a lecturer at the University of Limerick , one of Cobol 's perceived drawbacks is its verbosity .
But he reckons that 's also one of its strengths .
" It 's not just a write - only language , " he says .
" You can come back years later and understand the code . "
This opinion is shared by Mike Gilpin , of Forrester , who is an ex-Cobol programmer .
" Cobol is one of the few languages written in the last 50 years that 's readable and understandable , " he says .
And he 's scathing about the readability of more fashionable languages , such as PHP and Java : " Modern programming languages are ridiculously hard to understand . "
True ?
Well , judge for yourself at the 99 Bottles Of Beer project website .
What began in 1994 as a geek joke to save bandwidth by turning the song lyrics into six lines of code in the Basic language has grown to versions of the program in 1,259 ( and counting ) different programming languages .

Apple retail stores are looking to move away from Windows Mobile - based handheld checkout devices in favor of iPod touches with custom accessory add - ons , with a transition expected to follow the release of iPhone 3.0 later this year .
Apple 's EasyPay terminals
Starting back in 2005 , the company 's retail outlets began using EasyPay , a specialized PDA device built by Symbol and running Windows Mobile , after a pilot program validated the practice of using employees with mobile devices to speed checkout lines .
Apple has pushed to expand the program ever since .
The company has obvious interests in replacing the EasyPay devices with its own technology , however , both to improve reliability and efficiency , as well as to show off its own devices in action .
Apple retail stores have already begin using iPod touch units running a Concierge app to triage visitors needing support and schedule appointments for them .
Internally , store management also uses a Red Zone Report application to track store sales and performance .
However , Apple 's initial positioning of its mobile technology as a smartphone has limited the company from using the iPhone to replace the more generic EasyPay devices outright .
The main barrier has been a lack of support for peripheral devices in the iPhone hardware .
EasyPay terminals need to plug into a credit card reader , something that has n't been possible on the iPhone , but will become available with the move to the new iPhone 3.0 software .
Heal thyself
While Apple could build its own point of sale ( POS ) system from scratch based on the iPhone 's technology , doing so would be an expensive undertaking just for the couple dozen devices needed by each of the 225 retail stores .
It would also result in a completely proprietary system that the company probably could n't successfully sell outside of a narrow niche of retail stores with similar needs .
Devices like the EasyPay are open enough to allow for a wide variety of customization using Microsoft 's Windows Mobile software , even if the tools and the underlying software are n't that reliable or desirable .
That specialized market is n't enormous , so it would be difficult for Apple to justify trying to compete with its own iPhone - based POS device .
Instead of introducing a dedicated POS sibling to the iPhone and iPod touch family , Apple instead worked to expand the iPhone platform to suit the needs of developers .
With iPhone 3.0 , that includes new support for working with peripheral devices over USB through the Dock Connector and wirelessly using Bluetooth .
Demand for participation in the accessory program from developers proposing new hardware devices has exploded , with insiders noting that Apple is overwhelmed with interest .
Apple itself will benefit from those platform stretching efforts .
At last year 's release of the iPhone 3G , various problems with the EasyPay Pocket PC devices ranging from unreliable hardware to buggy software resulted in frustrating delays that created long lines for buyers , particularly people trying to get the new iPhone 3G .
There 's an app for that
This year , a software app is expected to help iPhone 3.0 devices sell themselves , quite literally .
There 's already POS titles available in the App Store , including CCTerminal , which costs $ 50 and enables users to ring up purchases using a credit card merchant account .
Apple began promoting the new app in one of its latest ads showing how small businesses can ring up sales , print shipping labels , and track shipments using various iPhone apps .
Inner Fence 's CCTerminal app is an example of one of the more prominent mobile POS terminals on the App Store .
No public , no press , no United States : Bush 's first speech since presidency scheduled abroad John Byrne
Published : Friday February 13 , 2009

Not even a month after leaving office , former president George W. Bush has joined the lecture circuit .
However he has n't strayed far his from presidential style : Bush has banned the public and media from his first post - presidential speaking event , and he 's scheduled to speak in what a political science professor says is friendly territory .
That is the element that stands out : Bush wo n't be speaking in the United States .
His Mar. 17 speech , to be given before the Calgary Chamber of Commerce , a pro-business group , is expected to draw a private audience of 1,500 .
A University of Calgary political science professor told Canadian television : " I think he 's probably nervous about how he 'll be received , and so Calgary 's a safe place . "
He noted that the city is pro-American and more conservative than some other Canadian metropolises .
And yet , he said , " There is a lot of anger and there is a sense it was a failed presidency . "
" It 's our understanding it 's one of the first -- if not the first -- times he 'll speak since leaving office , " the vice - president of public and government affairs at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce , Geoff Pradella , 1 told the network .
" I imagine it 'll be a reflection on issues that arose during his time in office , and maybe drawing from that his perspectives on the way forward . "
Ticket prices were n't disclosed .
Organizers would n't say how much Bush was getting paid , but former President Clinton received a whopping $ 150,000 fee for a speech in Edmonton .
Colin Powell and Rudy Giuliani both received fees for speaking to the group in the past .
A spokesman for the Office of George W. Bush in Dallas declined to go on the record .
Invitations say Bush will ruminate on his " eight momentous years in the Oval Office " and speak about " the challenges facing the world in the 21st century . "
Bush left office Jan. 20 with an American approval rating in the low 30s .
Last June , even a Canadian newspaper decided Bush 's approval rating was news -- the Ottawa Citizen announced that the ex-president 's approval rating was the worst of any president in 28 years .
While we 're all celebrating Charter 's 60 M bps broadband access here in the US , the Korea Communications Commission is spending $ 24 billion to secure 1 G bps access by 2012 .

1 Gbps allows you to download a 120 - minute film in 12 seconds .
There 's one small catch to the commission 's plan , which is that only large cities in Korea will have access to the top tier broadband .
But surrounding smaller areas will still have access to 50 to 100 Mbps speeds ... or about 10 to 20 times the speed of what I get in my DSL - only apartment building .

Movie Review A- Crank High Voltage Director Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor Runtime 96 minutes Rating R Cast Jason Statham , Amy Smart , Dwight Yoakam
Advertisement
The joy of 2006 ’s Crank , starring Jason Statham as poisoned hitman Chev Chelios , came from its cheerful contempt for reality : Statham was completely impervious to harm , which left the movie free to go crazy with style , plot , and most importantly , a sense of humor .
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose , and plausibility feels like deadweight .
So there ’s no sense batting an eyelash at the fact that Statham died — dropped thousands of feet to the concrete — at the end of the first Crank .
High Voltage just scrapes him off the ground , literally : Asian gangsters simply scoop him up with a snow shovel and take him to a black - market operating room , where he learns his new fate .
In the first Crank , Statham needed to keep his adrenaline pumping in order to slow the poison coursing through his veins .
In this one , he ’s fitted with an artificial heart that needs constant charging — via jumper cables , a stun gun , a dog collar , and the friction generated by human skin — to maintain its battery .
And according to Statham ’s underground doctor , played expertly by Dwight Yoakam , Statham has an hour to find his actual heart and bring it in for a quick transplant .
Advertisement
From there , it ’s go - go - go : Statham chases the gangster who ’s carrying his heart in a six - pack cooler around the city , stopping only to provide comic relief via heart jumpstarts .
In the most memorable scene , Statham and girlfriend Amy Smart end up having sex in every imaginable position ( and then some ) in front of thousands of cheering fans on a racetrack , with horses zipping by .
Then it ’s off to slaughtering dozens of baddies , occasionally with the help of Efren Ramirez ( Napoleon Dynamite ’s Pedro ) , a gang of gay black bikers , and Bai Ling , a crack whore whose broken English would probably be offensive in any movie but this one .
( This one has anal rape with a lubricated shotgun , played for laughs . )
And there ’s still room for a hilarious flashback to a Jerry Springer - esque show about Statham ’s youth , a brilliantly addled Godzilla homage ( complete with giant rubber masks ) , and hundreds of naked boobs .
It ’d be silly to call Crank : High Voltage over the top :
The top is so far below that it is n’t even visible .
But at this mostly unexplored altitude — only 2007 ’s inferior Shoot ’ Em Up comes close — writer - directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have written their own set of action - comedy challenges , and they slam - dunk pretty much every one .
Added a duck timer that prevents duck spamming while running around on - ground
In -air , players are only allowed to duck once before they touch ground again
Fixed several bounding box issues with jumping , falling , and rocket jump air - walking .
Bounding box should be much more accurate there now
Increased backstab check so that Spies can side - stab again
When disguising , Spies now always start showing the primary weapon in their disguise , and can then switch it with the last - disguise key
Fixed flamethrower loophole that resulted in the flame effect being stuck on while the flamethrower was n't really firing
Fixed exploit that allowed players to circumvent the force - fire timeout on the pipebomb launcher
Fixed a bug that caused Natasha 's slow on hit effect to be inverted from 75 % to 25 %
Restored sawmill_logs.mdl file , fixing some user maps that used it
Fixed some localization issues with Scout achievement strings
Removed the " Final " phrasing in the map loading screen
Fixed a server crash on startup under Linux
Fixed a buffer overflow issue related to network string tables
Gamestats uploading is now done asynchronously .
This fixes the client timeout issues on map changes
Fixed an exploit where engineers could build a teleporter exit in an invalid area
Fixed a few bad overlay assignments and other minor issues

Walking by a crowd that had assembled in front of the Dodgers ’ clubhouse , James Loney smiled .
“ Where ’s Manny ? ” he asked , pretending to be searching for his teammate .
“ Is he here ? ”
He was n’t .
But he will be today .
The Dodgers ’ grueling , four - month negotiation with Manny Ramirez ended Wednesday when the All - Star outfielder inked his name on a new contract that ensured that Mannywood will retain its 90012 ZIP code for at least another season .
Advertisement
The contract is worth $ 45 million over two years and includes a no - trade provision and an opt - out clause that the 36 - year - old Ramirez can exercise at the end of the first year .
Ramirez ’s salary this season is $ 25 million , with $ 15 million deferred without interest .
If he declines the $ 20 - million option for 2010 , he will receive $ 5 - million payments over the next three years .
If he exercises the option , he will also receive $ 10 million in 2010 , plus $ 8.33 million in each of the three years after that .
The $ 25 - million salary makes him baseball ’s second - highest - paid player behind Alex Rodriguez at $ 32 million .
The Dodgers will pay for Ramirez to stay in a hotel suite when they ’re on the road .
Ramirez will report today to Camelback Ranch , where a locker in the back corner of the Dodgers ’ clubhouse was set aside for him .
Manager Joe Torre said Ramirez probably would n’t play in an exhibition for another week .

“ You do n’t have to speculate anymore , ” Loney said , still smiling .
“ I ’ll probably get some new questions now . ”
Asked how the addition of Ramirez could affect the National League West , Loney replied , “ He affects the whole league , I believe .
He ’s the guy that other teams do n’t want to beat them .
When he ’s on , he ’s on .
And he was on for us pretty much the whole time . ”
Ramirez became the face of the Dodgers over a breathtaking 2 1/2 - month stretch , taking them to their first National League Championship Series in two decades by hitting .396 with 17 home runs and 53 runs batted in 53 games .
His signing marked the end of a stunning turn of events over 48 hours , as Dodgers owner Frank McCourt went from saying that negotiations with Ramirez would restart from scratch to signing the All - Star outfielder to a deal almost identical in value and structure to one he offered a week before .

So what happened ?
Ramirez ’s agent , Scott Boras , picked up the phone .
Boras said he told Dodgers General Manager Ned Colletti on Sunday that he wanted to speak to McCourt , who earlier that day declared the latest round of talks dead .
The agent said he did so not because Ramirez had no other place to go -- the San Francisco Giants were the only other team that publicly acknowledged interest in Ramirez -- but because his client wanted to remain in Los Angeles .
“ Manny told me to keep working with the Dodgers to get a deal until I felt we could n’t get one done , ” Boras said .

Ramirez told The Times on Tuesday : “ I ’m happy in L.A . I like my teammates and had a great time .
The fans were so good to me ; they treated me the best anywhere in my career . ”
Boras and McCourt touched base Monday and met in person Tuesday morning at the Beverly Hills Hotel for three hours , according to the agent .
They spoke again in the afternoon over the phone for a couple of hours and talks progressed to the point where McCourt wanted to talk to Ramirez in person .
Ramirez flew to Los Angeles from Miami on Tuesday night .
Colletti and Torre left the Dodgers ’ camp for a 6 a.m. Wednesday gathering at the McCourt residence in Malibu .
Also present at that meeting were Mike Fiore , Boras ’ associate ; Rico Perdomo , Ramirez ’s close friend ; and Dennis Mannion , the Dodgers ’ chief operating officer .
Returning to Phoenix in time for their spring game against the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday , Colletti and Torre talked about the positive impression they had of the meeting .
Advertisement
“ After last year and the time he spent with us , we knew we wanted him back , ” Torre said .
“ It was about finding that common ground . ”
There was widespread speculation that McCourt wanted to speak to Ramirez to rid himself of fears that Ramirez might behave the way he did in Boston last year , when he was unhappy about his contract and forced the Red Sox to deal him to the Dodgers at the July 31 non -waiver trade deadline .
But Torre said the topic never came up .
“ I do n’t think there was any conversation in explaining what had to be done , ” Torre said .
“ That ’s what I felt good about . ”
The Dodgers announced the deal in a news release that was issued at 4:44 p.m .

Remember the controversy caused this winter by the owner ’s wife , Jamie McCourt , who asked whether fans would rather have the Dodgers sign Ramirez or pay for 50 youth fields ?
Well , it turns out they ’ll have both .
The Dodgers also announced that Ramirez has agreed to contribute $ 1 million to the Dodgers Dream Foundation to build ballparks for kids , including one in his native Dominican Republic .
So , at least for a year , both sides can call themselves winners . .

However , there is that opt - out clause after the coming season , meaning these negotiations could repeat themselves again next winter .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The vast majority of Britons want an inquiry into the 2003 invasion of Iraq and most are also unconvinced by the government ’s arguments for the conflict in Afghanistan , according to a survey on Monday .

A ComRes survey for the BBC found 72 percent thought there should be an official public inquiry into Britain ’s role in the Iraq war , as opposition parties have demanded .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has ruled out holding an inquiry until all British troops have left the country .
The remaining 4,000 or so soldiers , based near the southern city of Basra , are due to start pulling out at the end of May .
Britain ’s involvement in the invasion has always been controversial and divisive , and the government has resisted publicising official documents about decisions made in the run-up to war .
Last month , the government refused to publish public records of cabinet discussions on the legality of the military action despite being ordered to by the Information Commissioner .
Justice Secretary Jack Straw used a ministerial veto , saying the publication would damage cabinet government .
Confidential emails released last week also revealed that British intelligence officials were worried about a dossier released by then Prime Minister Tony Blair ’s government in 2002 which was used to justify military action .
The ComRes poll also showed that 60 percent of the 1,013 people questioned were not convinced by the government ’s arguments in support of keeping British troops in Afghanistan .
So far , 152 British service personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S. - led invasion to oust the Taliban , with the latest deaths coming on Sunday when two soldiers were killed in an explosion .
Earlier this month , former British SAS commander Major Sebastian Morley said the military operation in the country was “ worthless . ”
Despite the attitudes towards both conflicts , the survey found that 91 percent of respondents believed that serving in the armed forces was a job to be proud of .

Advertisement Parents have complained that a children 's TV presenter with one hand is prompting awkward questions from young children .
So how should you explain this kind of disability to a child ?
No -one comes up with wrong - footing questions quite like a young child .
And young , curious minds do n't hesitate to point out differences in people they see around them .
So when the BBC 's children 's channel CBeebies employed presenter Cerrie Burnell , who was born with only one hand , her appearance on television screens prompted a debate among parents about what they say to their children .
Online message boards on CBeebies and the BBC 's disability magazine Ouch !
were brimming with support for the employment of a person with a disability , and the way this educated children about diversity .
But a minority of parents expressed concern that Ms Burnell 's appearance was " scaring " children .
One father said he feared it would give his daughter nightmares and a mother said her two - year - old girl could not watch because she thought the presenter had been hurt .
Ms Burnell , 29 , says she does n't take this personally but these kind of comments highlight the prejudice that disabled people face .
' CHILDREN ASK COOL QUESTIONS '
Clare Johnston is a student primary school teacher , 31 , from Edinburgh , who uses a wheelchair " Children will be direct , but they do n't seem to have the assumption that it stops you doing other things , and they will tend to ask rather cooler questions like ' Can you do wheelies ? ' "
" Adults are frequently surprised to find you are able to go on with your life , work and hobbies . "
When a teacher told the class not to ask questions about her , it made matters worse , she says " Children come up to me in the street every day and say ' What 's that ? '
I would n't say they 're frightened but certainly they 're inquisitive .
" I would always take the time to explain to a child .
All they want is an explanation .
They want to know ' What 's that ? ' and ' What 's happened ? ' and ' Why are you different ? '
And then they will move on . "
She hopes that her presence can show young children what they can achieve on merit .
But what parents say is up to them .
" I 'd never comment on anyone 's parenting or the time for them to have a discussion with their child about disabilities .
" It 's a totally personal thing and people have to do it when they feel comfortable to do it .
But I would just hope that , I guess , me being on CBeebies would present an opportunity for them to do that in the comfort of their own home . "
If the child asks questions then they are old enough to understand the answer , she says , and her story is simply that she was born with one hand but it does n't stop her doing anything .
Hard - of - hearing Barbies
The problem lies with the parents , not the children , says Sir Bert Massie from the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
" I think what 's happening is a number of adults do have prejudices , do have very negative views about disabled people , and instead of admitting the views are their own , they 're projecting them on to their children and saying the children are doing this .
And of course they do n't give their names [ on message boards ] , so it 's all anonymous . "
It becomes harder for older children because they can be socially embarrassed
Child psychologist Penelope Leach Attitudes have improved over time , helped by changes in the law , a higher profile for some disabled people and more awareness of equality issues .
And children are more likely to see people with disabilities because many are now taught in mainstream schools .
Even toy makers are getting on message - turning out disability aids like wheelchairs , dark glasses and hearing aids for dolls and action figures .
Child psychologist Penelope Leach says children are faced with so much variety in the world that they do tend to accept what they see , unless someone else implies to them that something is wrong .
Tilly is a doll in a wheelchair , made by Kids Like Me " Three to four year olds can't be sure that there are n't people in the world who only ever have one arm .
There are people who have glasses , or are very tall , or have different skin .
Why should n't there be people in the world who have a different number of arms ?
" It becomes harder for older children because they can be socially embarrassed and they think ' Should I say something or not ? '
People in wheelchairs complain bitterly that older children and grown - ups do n't look at them in the eye but you do n't get that with young children . "
While young children may react badly to the sight of blood , they would not be frightened by a person with one arm , unless it triggered something that had happened in their family .
" There are a lot of answers you could give .
They wo n't say ' How did she lose her arm ? ' , they are more likely to say ' Where is her arm ? ' or ' Why has she only got one arm ? '
And the parent can just say ' I do n't know exactly , but maybe she had an accident . '
" Listen to the question you are being asked and answer the question .
I would n't suggest looking at the presenter and pointing it out but if their child asks a question or makes a comment it's a great mistake to say ' hush , hush ' .
They want to know the answer to a very sensible question . "
Ms Dilley says children relate to her better than adults
The difference in attitude between children and adults is striking , says Maddy Dilley who was struck by a debilitating condition which means she uses a wheelchair when leaving the house .
" Children are normally very positive .
In buggies they seem to love it because I 'm on the same level as them .
They tend to grin and young children on foot turn back and smile , " says the 24 - year - old from Cambridgeshire .
The odd child will hide behind their mum or dad because they 're not sure what 's going on or point or react slightly differently , but overall it tends to be very positive , open and inquisitive .
" They do n't see it as something different because it 's not bred into them .
While adults can see it in a discriminatory way , children are more innocent . "
Adults sometimes ignore her and avoid eye contact when she clearly needs help with something , she says .
On one occasion she was wheeled out of the way in a supermarket , which left her in tears .
So instead of shielding children from disability , it seems some adults should take a lead from youngsters in how to respond to it .

My four year old daughter has noticed Cerrie 's arm but is not in the least concerned .
She asked me where it had gone , so we had a good chat about people 's differences and everyone being individual .
No questions since and she thinks Cerrie is great ( especially her singing ! ) .
Well done to Cerrie for being so open .
Zoe S , High Wycombe , UK
As a primary school teacher several years ago I had a new child arrive in my class .
Part - way through the first morning she put a hand up and asked , " My arm hurts , can I take it off please ? "
She did so and lay the prosthesis on her desk .
After a day or so no - one at the school took any notice .
Rod Woodhouse , Hatfield I love that my kids are getting positive impressions of all kinds of different people from CBeebies :
Sid is great as we do n't know many black people and Cerrie is great as we do n't know many disabled people .
If my children do have questions about such differences , I 'd much rather they happen at home in front of TV than in a situation where we were encountering that difference in real life .
Andrew MacCormack , Edinburgh , UK
We 're making a huge problem out of nothing here .
I was at school with a thalidomide victim .
No - one questioned , we just accepted that her right arm ended at the elbow - I certainly can't remember anyone being scared or put off - and no parents made anything of it .
And my former classmate now has three grown up children of her own .
Get a grip and stop pandering to this kind of nonsense : accept people for what they are , not what they look like - it 's called life .
David , Halifax , West Yorks , England " Her hand was hurt in an accident very badly .
The doctor had to take it away .
No it does n't hurt anymore . "
What 's the problem ?
The parents , that 's what .
If a child is concerned that a simple cut will lead to amputation - talk to them about it .
That is the real nub of the problem here .
Parents who want to avoid talking about anything more important than " look at that fluffy bunny " .
I pity the children .
What will these parents do when Granny dies ?
Tell the child she is on holiday ?
Sandy , Derby , UK I admit that I am a bit squeamish whenever I see this presenter but that 's my own prejudices .
I do n't think children have a problem as they simply accept the world as presented to them without the baggage that adults have .
That said I do n't think the current couple are anyway near as good as Chris and Poi .
One final thought , it 's interesting that one section of the BBC is progressive enough to have a disabled presenter but Moira Stewart claims ageism forced her out of the BBC .
Richard Hitchins , Blackpool
They make it sound like there has never been disabled presenters before , Ade Adepitan springs to mind .
He was wheelchair bound , and a presenter on CBBC in the past , I do n't remember such a fuss being made over him .
Ashley , Milton Keynes I was shocked and surprised to hear of the negative opinion of Cerrie Burnell .
I am the parent of a child who watches a little of CBeebies , and I applaud the BBC for having the guts to ignore the disability and focus on the fact she is a good presenter .
The fact that Ms Burnell is disabled is strange to see on screen , but only in as much as it is unexpected .
I think the reaction to this story shows that the vast majority of people have got over the prejudices that existed in relation to the disabled , and I pity those who can't find the words to explain disability to their children without scaring them .
Graham , Stevenage
Is it really fair to say this case highlights the issue of prejudice ?
You 've only got to read the comments here to see that people are n't in the least bit bothered by it .
My own child asked once about Cerrie 's arm , but that was it - almost a " oh , okay , one arm , so what " reaction .
It 's really not a big deal , so the Beeb can rest easy and tell Cerrie she genuinely does n't need to wave it about in front of the camera anymore - we 're fine with the missing arm thing .
Move along BBC - there is no disability crusade for you to embark on here .
Darren Parkin , Stratford - upon - Avon
One of my friends only has one hand and it took my daughters over a year to notice .
When they did it was a case of " where has your hand gone ? " .
They were interested at the time but have hardly mentioned since and it has never shocked or concerned them .
Children accept as " normal " what they see around them - prejudice and fear only come when others tell them otherwise .
Stuart , Cardiff I applaud the BBC on employing someone for their credentials , irrespective of a disability .
If these parents are so negative to people who are different from them ( whether it be religion , skin colour , height , weight , disability etc ) their child is growing up in a bubble .
I have a friend who is deaf , and although none of us can use sign language we can still communicate with her and I do not consider her to be any different from any of my other friends .
Those parents should be ashamed of their behaviour .
All the best in your career Ms Burnell , hope to see you soon in other programmes .
Stephen , Cardiff
My son watches this lady on TV .
I am sure he is well aware that this lady has no arm but has never mentioned it .
He is five years old , at the age of questions , and has said nothing , he just enjoys the programme , as for the parents if they are complaining of this then they should get rid of there TVs there is so much on TV now you can not shelter your children especially for something as ridiculous as this .
Those parents should be ashamed for not raising there children better .
As for this lady , you rock girl , you keep doing what you 're doing , you are an inspiration for children more than you know .

When person sees this image for the first time he usually just automatically tags it as “ photoshopped , not a big deal ” and goes browsing further .
Well , this time we would stop for a while and see is it really that photoshopped or not .
Actually , this shot was made in Ukraine , near Odessa city .
It features the real structure , and it is not a project by some artist neither it is an artistic installation .
Those are remnants of an old Soviet times grainery on the field .
If to see at it from a decent distance , during the right time of the day and with right camera lens then you can catch it as like it is floating in the air , with just some not very firm support from one side , looking like some futuristic space ship , as they were seen in seventies .
But if come closer , the sourcery disappears , when you see all those old ladders and poles supporting it from the other side .
Here you can find a “ Story of One Photo 1 “ .
( The memo also signaled , according to a source familiar with the issue , that the agency would cooperate with the review - - a major step away from the previous eight years . )
Most notably , however , it 's unclear how much , if any , of the review will be made public : the committee will make that decision at the appropriate time , according to a source .
Hence , some mixed feelings among those who want a public investigation with criminal ramifications .
" At long last , it 's extremely good that the Intelligence Committee is going to take a long and hard look at the interrogation policies and follow the chain of command as to who made which decisions and who approved which decisions , " Center for Constitutional Rights Executive Director Vincent Warren told me in a phone interview .
His group was one of over 20 to call on Attorney General Eric Holder in February to launch a criminal investigation of the Bush administration .
But Warren says he's " very concerned " that the information gathered by the committee should be made public .
" The only reason why this harsh interrogation program , this abusive interrogation program , has been able to go on for so long is that it 's been shielded from public review , it 's been shielded from congressional oversight , and it's been shielded in the courts , " said Warren , whose group represents many detainees .
" If we 've learned any lesson in the last eight yeas , it 's that what 's happening to our clients should be made public , and that the people who were involved in these activities ... should be held accountable . "
So while Feinstein 's committee is taking that long , hard look at the CIA , it 's unlikely that the investigation will satisfy those on the left and in the civil liberties community calling for open proceedings and criminal ramifications to prove , more forcefully , the axiom " no one is above the law . "
The Democratic Congress -- and the Intelligence Committee , to be sure -- have caught criticism for not being more assertive in exercising oversight of the Bush administration .
Today 's announcement may start to alleviate those concerns , especially as Feinstein has already taken a more assertive role in reviewing the Bush administration than her predecessor on the committee , Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , but it all depends on how much faith groups like Warren 's have in Congress 's dedication to charging hard after secrets .
Whether or not the Senate Intelligence Committee is the place for punitive , public review is another matter -- and certainly the committee almost never discloses the information it gets , as a policy .
But those who have criticized Congress in the past , while happy that Feinstein is instigating this intensive oversight , likely wo n't get much quieter as a result .

Lima , Peru
STANDING in the packed courtroom annex as a Supreme Court panel this week sentenced the former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori to 25 years in prison for two massacres and two kidnappings , I had mixed emotions .
As a human rights advocate who has pressed for Mr. Fujimori to be tried , I rejoiced in this once unthinkable moment .
Sitting next to me were relatives of massacre victims , listening solemnly to a verdict that took over three hours to read .
At the same time , I worried that people would forget how we got here .
Mr. Fujimori was widely embraced for bringing order to our country .
As a Peruvian who lived in Lima during the 1990s , I once shared that sentiment .
When Mr. Fujimori was first elected in 1990 , Peru was increasingly under assault by a Maoist insurgency group , the Shining Path , and the economy was a wreck .
In April 1992 , as a teenager , I watched in disbelief the televised images of tanks rolling downtown in the Peruvian capital and congressmen being arrested .
Mr. Fujimori had shut down Congress and taken complete power .
Yet I shared in the widespread relief that someone was acting to end the chaos .
I had to take flashlights everywhere because of the frequent blackouts from when the Shining Path blew up electric transmission towers .
Many nights I heard bombs explode as the armed group inched closer to the capital .
But what we were experiencing in Lima was nothing compared with the unchecked violence in the Andes .
My family had given up traveling to the countryside out of fear that insurgents would kill us .
The blast destroyed the restaurant in the town of Jandola
At least 10 people have been killed in a suicide bombing in north - western Pakistan , local officials say .
About 20 people were also reported to have been injured in the explosion at a restaurant in the town of Jandola in South Waziristan .
Officials said a group of militants opposed to Pakistan 's top Taleban commander had been in the restaurant .
Violence in Pakistan has surged in recent months amid a wave of attacks blamed on Islamist militants .
Some of the injured were reported to be in a critical condition and officials said the number of dead could rise .
Reward
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says the bomber walked into the restaurant on Thursday morning and blew himself up , destroying the premises .
The attack targeted Turkistan Bittani , a pro-government tribal leader who is a rival of local Taleban warlord Baitullah Mehsud .
Turkistan Bittani , who has been helping the military take on Mehsud , had left the restaurant minutes before the attack .
Turkistan Bittani leads one of the " peace committees " , or pro-government armed militias , that oppose the Taleban .
The South Waziristan region is dominated by Mehsud .
Our correspondent says Mehsud is one of the most wanted Taleban militants operating on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
He is suspected of masterminding dozens of suicide attacks across Pakistan as well as attacks on Nato forces in Afghanistan .
The latest attack comes a day after a suspected US missile strike in South Waziristan killed seven Arab militants .
It also follows an announcement on Wednesday by the US state department of a $ 5 m bounty for information leading to the capture of Mehsud .
Mehsud has also been accused of plotting the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
Since 9/11 Mehsud has grown in strength and stature and is said to command about 20,000 pro-Taleban militants .
A majority belong to the Mehsud tribe .
PRAGUE ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will call for the elimination of all nuclear weapons across the globe , in remarks on Sunday he hopes will lend credibility to his message in atomic disputes with Iran and North Korea .
President Barack Obama addresses a news conference at the NATO summit in Strasbourg , April 4 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
Visiting Prague during an eight - day visit to Europe , Obama plans to deliver what his aides have billed as a major speech on weapons proliferation .
Obama , who is making his debut on the world stage , said in Strasbourg , France on Friday that he would lay out an agenda to secure the world ’s loose nuclear materials and halt the spread of illicit weapons .
He added that he wanted to offer an agenda “ to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons . ”
“ Even with the Cold War over , the spread of nuclear weapons or the theft of nuclear material could lead to the extermination of any city on the planet , ” Obama said .
Obama , a former U.S. senator who succeeded President George W. Bush in January , has long shown interest in the issue of halting weapons proliferation and wants to make it a signature foreign policy issue for his new administration .
“ The president has been very focused on these issues of proliferation for many years , ” White House Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough told reporters .
“ Tomorrow , I think you ’ll hear the president , in a very comprehensive way , outline many of the things that he ’s been talking about and working on for some time , ” McDonough said .
While in Prague , Obama will also discuss climate change and energy security with the 27 leaders of European Union countries at a summit hosted by the Czech EU presidency , undermined by a government collapse last week .
Thousands of Czechs are expected to turn up for Obama ’s speech at a square outside the medieval Prague Castle , with the panorama of the historic Czech capital in the background .
The call for renewed efforts at global nuclear disarmament is likely to be well received in Europe , where Obama is seeking to use his strong popularity to advance his agenda on issues such as Iran and the war in Afghanistan .
The proliferation speech comes after Obama met on Wednesday with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the sidelines of the Group of 20 economic summit , where the two leaders pledged to pursue a new deal to cut nuclear warheads .
The aim to is agree to a successor to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START 1 ) , which led to the biggest - ever bilateral cuts in nuclear weapons , but expires in December .
Obama is seeking support from Russia , China and other countries to pressure Iran over its disputed nuclear program and ratchet up pressure on North Korea , which has said it will send a satellite into space between April 4 and 8 .
The launch is widely seen abroad as a disguised long - range missile test .
The United States and its European allies accuse Iran of planning to build an atomic bomb .
But Iran denies this , saying its nuclear program is aimed at the peaceful purpose of generating electricity .
McDonough said Obama will urge a revival of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which was ratified in 1970 and calls on nuclear states to take steps to disarm and forbids non-nuclear states from trying to acquire them .
“ That is an age - old bargain that the president wants to reinforce and it will strengthen our hand with countries like Iran that continue to pursue an illicit nuclear technology , ” he said .
George Perkovich , a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington , said that unlike issues such as the economic downturn and the Iraq war , the proliferation agenda is not an issue he inherited from the Bush administration but one he is actively promoting .
“ This is one of the few things that is not part of his inheritance , ” Perkovich said .
The visit to the Czech Republic , a central European NATO - member country about to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the collapse of communist rule , has been marred by the collapse of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek ’s cabinet .
After losing a no -confidence vote , his government is expected to leave power soon .
The Czech government is a close U.S. ally that has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan .
Topolanek , who is chairing the European Union in the first half of this year , caused a stir last week when he described U.S. prescriptions to fix the economic crisis as a “ road to hell . ”
Topolanek plans to ask Obama about plans to build a missile defense radar southeast of Prague , a project firmly backed by the Czech government but opposed by most Czechs .
The Czech radar system and plans to site missile shield bases in Poland have angered Russia but lost pace under Obama ’s administration .
Obama has told Moscow he is willing to slow the deployment of the system in Europe if Russia helps in curbing Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .

A California lawmaker has introduced a bill that would require all virtual mapping programs to blur out schools , places of worship , government or medical buildings or face hefty fines and possible jail time .
A California lawmaker has introduced a bill that would require all virtual mapping programs to blur out schools , places of worship , government or medical buildings or face hefty fines and possible jail time .
Assemblyman Joel Anderson , a Republican , crafted the bill after it was revealed that terrorists in Israel and Mumbai used popular mapping programs to help plot their attacks .
" All I 'm trying to do is stop terrorists , " Anderson told the AP .
" I do n't want California to be helping map out future targets for terrorists . "
According to the bill text , photographs and images of schools , places of worship , government or medical buildings must be blurred .
Street - level imagery would also be banned .
Companies that violated the provisions of the bill would face fines of up to $ 250,000 for every day the illegal imagery was available online .
Top - level executives and board members at these companies , meanwhile , who knowingly let these images remain online could face up to three years in jail .
" We are happy to speak with Assemblyman Anderson regarding this legislation and hope to have a productive conversation , " a Google spokesperson said Tuesday .
" Google Maps and Google Earth provide users with a rich , immersive experience , offering useful information and enabling greater understanding of a specific location or area . "
Google made headlines earlier this year when it was revealed that images of the vice president 's home in Washington were no longer obscured after Dick Cheney moved out .
The company 's popular Street View offering provides 360 - degree , street - level images from cities around the world .
When it first debuted , bloggers had fun picking out amusing images captured by the Google camera , but Google also took some heat when some people recognized themselves in the photographs .
It later announced that it would blur peoples ' faces .
The current level of openness varies from mapping program to mapping program .
There is no set law governing how these companies must handle their images .
Much of the satellite imagery used by mapping programs comes from international companies over which U.S. agencies have no jurisdiction , Dave Burpee , a public affairs officer with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) , told PCMag.com in 2007 after the debut of Google Street View .
A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company was unable to address the issue at this time .

* nix user and group IDs are complicated , confusing , and often misused .
Look at this code snippet from the popular Ruby project , Starling :
def drop_privileges
Process .
egid = options [ : group ] if options [ : group ]
Process .
euid = options [ : user ] if options [ : user ]
end
At quick first glance , you might think this code looks OK .
But you ’d be wrong .
Let ’s take a look at 5 things you probably do n’t know about user and group IDs that can lead you to your downfall .
The difference between real , effective , and saved IDs
This is always a bit confusing , but without a solid understanding of this concept you are doomed later .
Real ID – The real ID is the ID of the process that created the current process .
So , let ’s say you log in to your box as joe , your shell is then launched with its real ID set to joe .
All processes you start from your shell will inherit the real ID joe as their real ID .
, your shell is then launched with its real ID set to .
All processes you start from your shell will inherit the real ID as their real ID .
Effective ID – The effective ID is the ID that the system uses to determine whether a process can take a particular action .
There are two popular ways to change your effective ID :
su – the su program changes your effective , real , and saved IDs to the ID of the user you are switching to .
– the program changes your effective , real , and saved IDs to the ID of the user you are switching to .
set ID upon execute ( abbreviated setuid ) –
You can mark a program ’s set uid upon execute bit so that the program runs with its effective and saved ID set to the owner of the program ( which may not necessarily be you ) .
The real ID will remain untouched .
For example , if you have a program :
rv = getresuid ( &ruid , &euid , &suid ) ;
…
printf ( " ruid %d , euid %d , suid %d
" , ruid , euid , suid ) ; = getresuid&ruid , &euid , &suid , ruid , euid , suid
If you then chown the program as root and chmod +s ( which turns on the setuid bit ) , the program will print : ruid 1000 , euid 0 , suid 0 when it is run ( assuming your user ID is 1000 ) .
so that the program runs with its effective and saved ID set to the of the program ( which may not necessarily be you ) .
The real ID will remain untouched .
For example , if you have a program : Saved ID – The saved ID is set to the effective ID when the program starts .
This exists so that a program can regain its original effective ID after it drops its effective ID to an unprivileged ID .
This use - case can cause problems ( as we ’ll see soon ) if it is not correctly managed .
If you start a program as yourself , and it does not have its set ID upon execute bit set , then the program will start running with its real , effective , and saved IDs set to your user ID .
set , then the program will start running with its real , effective , and saved IDs set to your user ID .
If you run a setuid program , your real ID remains unchanged , but your effective and saved IDs are set to the owner of the file .
su does the same as running a setuid program , but it also changes your real ID .
Do n’t use Process.euid= in Ruby ; stay as far away as possible
Process.euid= is EXTREMELY platform specific .
It might do any of the following : Set just your effective ID Set your effective , real , and saved ID .
On most recent Linux kernels , Process.euid= changes ONLY the Effective ID .
In most cases , this is NOT what you want .
Check out this sample Ruby script .
What would happen if you ran this script as root ?
.
It might do any of the following : def write_file
begin
File . open ( " / test " , " w + " ) do |f|
f. write ( " hello !
" )
f. close
end
puts " wrote test file "
rescue Errno:: EACCES
puts " could not write test file "
end
end
puts " ok , set uid to nobody "
Process .
euid = Etc. getpwnam ( " nobody " ) .
uid
puts " going to try to write to / now … "
write_file
puts " restoring back to root "
Process .
euid = 0
puts " now writing file "
write_file
This might surprise you , but the script regains root ‘s ID after it has dropped itself down to nobody .
Why does this work ?
Well as we just said , Process.euid= does n’t touch the Saved ID , only the Effective ID .
As a result , the effective ID can be set back to the saved ID at any time .
The only way to avoid this is to call a different Ruby function as we ’ll see in # 4 below .
Buggy native code running as nobody can execute arbitrary code as root in 8 bytes
Imagine a Ruby script much like the one above .
The script is run as root to do something special ( maybe bind to port 80 ) .
to do something special ( maybe bind to port 80 ) .
The process then drops privileges to nobody .
.
Afterward , your application interacts with buggy native code in the Ruby interpreter , a Ruby extension , or a Ruby gem .
If that buggy native code can be “ tricked ” into executing arbitrary code , a malicious user can elevate the process up from nobody to root in just 8 bytes .
Those 8 bytes are : \x31\xdb\x8d\x43\x17\x99\xcd\x80 – which is a binary representation of setuid(0 ) .
Those 8 bytes are : – which is a binary representation of setuid( 0 ) .
At this point , a malicious user can execute arbitrary code as the root user
Let ’s take a look at an ( abbreviated ) code snippet ( full here ) :
## we ’re using a buggy gem
require ‘ badgem ’ # do some special operations here as the privileged user
… # ok , now let ’s ( incorrectly ) drop to nobody
Process.euid = Etc.getpwnam ( " nobody " ) .uid # let ’s take some user input
s = MyModule :: GetUserInput # let ’s assume the user is malicious and supplies something like :
# " \x6a\x17\x58\x31\xdb\xcd\x80\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52 " +
# " \x68//sh\x68/bin\x89\xe3\x52\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80 "
# as the string .
# That string is x86_32 linux shellcode for running
# setuid(0 ) ; and execve ( " / bin/sh " , 0 , 0 ) !
# pass that to a buggy Ruby Gem
BadGem : : bad(s ) # the user is now sitting in a root shell !!
This is obviously NOT GOOD .
How to change the real , effective , and saved IDs
In the list below , I ’m going to list the functions as syscall - RubyFunction
setuid ( uid_t uid ) - Process :: Sys.setuid( integer )
This pair of functions always sets the real , effective , and saved user IDs to the value passed in .
This is a useful function for permanently dropping privileges , as we ’ll see soon .
This is a POSIX function .
Use this when possible .
setresuid ( uid_t ruid , uid_t euid , uid_t suid ) - Process :: Sys.setresuid( rid , eid , sid )
This pair of functions allows you to set the real , effective , saved User IDs to arbitrary values , assuming you have a privileged effective ID .
Unfortunately , this function is NOT POSIX and is not portable .
It does exist on Linux and some BSDs , though .
setreuid ( uid_t ruid , uid_t eid ) - Process :: Sys.setreuid( rid , eid )
This pair of functions allows you to set the real and effective user IDs to the values passed in .
On Linux : A process running with an unprivileged effective ID will only have the ability to set the real ID to the real ID or to the effective ID .
A process running with a privileged effective ID will have its saved ID set to the new effective ID if the real or effective IDs are set to a value which was not the previous real ID .
the real or effective IDs are set to a value which was not the previous real ID .
This is a POSIX function , but has lots of cases with undefined behavior .
Be careful .
seteuid ( uid_t eid ) - Process ::Sys.seteuid(eid)
This pair of functions sets the effective ID of the process but leaves the real and saved IDs unchanged .
IMPORTANT : Any process ( including those with unprivileged effective IDs ) may change their effective ID to their real or saved ID .
This is exactly the behavior we saw with the Ruby script in # 2 above .
This is a POSIX function .
How to correctly and permanently drop privileges
You should use either the :
setuid ( uid_t uid ) - Process :: Sys.setuid( integer )
or setresuid ( uid_t ruid , uid_t euid , uid_t suid ) - Process :: Sys.setresuid( rid , eid , sid )
pair of functions to set the real , effective , and saved IDs to the lowest privileged ID possible .
On many systems , this is the ID of the user nobody .
For the truly paranoid , it is recommended to check that dropping privileges was actually successful before continuing .
For example :
require ‘ etc ’ def test_drop
begin
Process :: Sys.setuid(0 )
rescue Errno:: EPERM
true
else
false
end
end uid = Etc.getpwnam ( " nobody " ) .
uid
Process :: Sys.setuid( uid ) if !
test_drop
puts " Failed ! "
#handle error
end
Conclusion
* nix user and group ID management is confusing , difficult , and extremely error prone .
It is a difficult system with many nuances , gotchas , and caveats .
It is no wonder so many people make mistakes when trying to write secure code .
The major things to keep in mind from this article are :
MADRID , April 17 ( Reuters ) - A Spanish judge considering possible criminal action against six former Bush administration officials for torture at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay defied pressure to drop the case on Friday .
But Judge Baltasar Garzon , internationally known for trying to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , accepted that he might not personally take charge of any eventual criminal investigation into officials including former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
On Thursday , Spain 's attorney general said Garzon should dismiss the complaint brought by human rights lawyers calling for the officials to be prosecuted .
In a ruling on Friday , Garzon ignored this advice but also avoided a direct confrontation with the attorney general 's office by submitting the case to a lottery system which will now assign it at random to one of the six high court judges .
" Let it be assigned to the corresponding court , " Garzon said in the ruling .
The judge who gets the case will now have to decide whether to go ahead of it .
Under the system , Garzon will have a one in six chance of getting the case back .
Under Spanish law , jurisdiction can be claimed in the case because five Spanish citizens or residents who were prisoners at U.S. prison camp in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , say they were tortured there .
Attorney General Candido Conde - Pumpido said the case should not be accepted because if anyone should be investigated for torture at Guantanamo it should be those who carried it out .
U.S. President Barack Obama also spoke out against the proposed investigation on Thursday , saying he would prefer not to focus on past events at Guantanamo , which he has promised to close .
The other Americans named in the accusation are William Haynes II , former general counsel for the Department of Defense ; John Yoo , the former Justice Department lawyer who wrote secret legal opinions saying President George W. Bush had the authority to circumvent the Geneva Conventions ; Douglas Feith , former undersecretary of defence for policy ; Jay Bybee , Yoo 's former boss at the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel ; and David Addington , chief of staff and legal adviser to ex-Vice President Dick Cheney .

One warm August afternoon in 2003 , a power failure originating in Ohio coursed through the electrical grid in the Northeast , sparking the nation ’s largest blackout and leaving millions in eight states without air conditioning , traffic lights and cellphone service .
Energy experts say that shutdown , which cost an estimated $ 6 billion , might have been averted by a “ smart grid . ”
President Obama has made the smart grid a major plank of his “ rebuilding America ” plan , viewing it as a way not only to eliminate blackouts and power failures , but also to create jobs and cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming .
A smart grid -- a digital network enabling utilities , consumers and alternative sources of renewable energy to “ talk ” to one another instantaneously -- could steer electricity to where it is needed most .
Advertisement
In the economic stimulus act that the president signed in February , Congress allocated $ 4.5 billion for smart grid investments , a thin slice of the $ 38.7 billion that the package funneled to the Department of Energy .
But is it enough ?
“ We are making a down payment , ” said Matt Rogers , a senior advisor to Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
The down payment will fund a set of pilot projects to demonstrate the viability of the smart grid and to show that it can deliver energy on a large scale , Rogers said .
Advertisement
Another goal : driving electrical utilities to make long - term investments in smart - grid technologies .
The Electric Power Research Institute , a utility industry think tank , has estimated the cost of building a smart grid at a staggering $ 165 billion -- about $ 8 billion a year for two decades .
And one of the biggest challenges in rolling out a smart grid , energy experts say , is getting hundreds of industries , from power generators to appliance and auto manufacturers , to agree on a set of standards -- some already developed , many not ready yet .
“ If you look at how vast the grid is , all the way from generator to consumer , to bring together a communication fabric so that information can be exchanged will take four to five years , easy , ” said Arshad Mansoor , vice president of power delivery and utilization at the institute .
Advertisement
Hired by the National Institute of Standards and Technology , a nonregulatory agency within the Department of Commerce , to develop a road map of standards and find consensus on a plan , Mansoor ’s group will help NIST , Chu and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke jump - start the process in early May .
The potential problems are daunting : “ It will be a mess , ” Mansoor says , if auto manufacturers each come up with a unique standard for how plug - in hybrid technology will communicate with the smart grid .
To avoid that scenario , the electric utility industry is working with automotive engineers to develop plug - in standards .
Demand for electricity is predicted to grow 30 % by 2020 , placing yet more stress on the grid and increasing risk of blackouts .
That ’s without the additional demand of 1 million plug - in hybrids that Obama has pledged to add to the nation ’s roads by 2015 .
“ Today an American consumer uses 13 times the electricity he or she did a half - century ago , and there are twice as many of us , ” James Hoecker told a House energy subcommittee this year .
The former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , now counsel for electricity industry advocacy group WIRES , said : “ We ’re asking the transmission system to perform tasks for which it was not designed . ”
Advertisement
Today , on hot summer days when consumers crank up the air conditioning , electric utilities have no way of controlling that demand .
All they can do is turn on more power plants to try to meet it .
Bracken Hendricks , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , says that the “ dumb and old energy distribution system ” has n’t changed much from the pioneering days of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla at the turn of 20th century .
“ Electricity in the grid is like water in pipes , ” Hendricks said .
“ You need to manage supply and demand .
You have to keep the levels in balance or the whole system crashes down . ”
In order to meet rising demand , he says , energy companies just build more power plants -- primarily fueled by coal or natural gas , a major source of carbon dioxide emissions .
Advertisement
Spreading a small measure of renewable energy around even a portion of the grid , Hendricks said , could prevent a cascading blackout like the one in 2003 .
“ We ’re looking at a period that has all the potential to be very transformative , depending on how lean and mean the electricity industry can be , ” Hoecker said in an interview .
“ It ’s a quarter - century - long sustained effort . ”

Mr. Joseph , back on stage , waited patiently as some of the crowd , still cheering , refused to leave their feet .
If the election of Barack Obama was supposed to denote the gradual demise of churlish , corporate governance and usher in a new , sustainable era of visionary change , there was little sign of it at the second annual meeting of the Worldwide Zeitgeist Movement , which , its organizers said , held 450 sister events in 70 countries around the globe .
“ The mission of the movement is the application of the scientific method for social change , ” Mr. Joseph announced by way of introduction .
The evening , which began at 7 with a two - hour critique of monetary economics , became by midnight a utopian presentation of a money - free and computer - driven vision of the future , a wholesale reimagination of civilization , as if Karl Marx and Carl Sagan had hired John Lennon from his “ Imagine ” days to do no less than redesign the underlying structures of planetary life .
In other words , a not entirely inappropriate response to the zeitgeist itself , which one young man , a philosophy student in a roomy purple blazer , described before the show began as “ the world as we know it coming to an end . ”
As the evening labored on with a Power Point presentation , a panel talk with Mr. Fresco and a spirited question and answer session , some basic themes emerged : modern economics is a fraud ; global debt will crush the planet ; society itself is dying from the profit motive ; and people ought to wise up to the fact that more than legislation  or presidential administrations  needs to change .
Mr Lieberman was a controversial choice for foreign minister Israel 's new Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , has been questioned by police for at least seven hours over corruption allegations .
Police said Mr Lieberman was questioned under caution on suspicion of " bribery , money - laundering and breach of trust " as part of an ongoing investigation .
Mr Lieberman was sworn in as foreign minister on Tuesday .
He has previously denied any wrong - doing and says the corruption probe against him is politically motivated .
Police confirmed that the interview had been scheduled in advance with Mr Lieberman .
Micky Rosenfeld , a police spokesman , said Mr Lieberman had been questioned over the long - standing investigation into his business dealings , the Associated Press reported .
The accusations are believed to relate to a company run by Mr Lieberman 's daughter .
A spokesman for Mr Lieberman said it was " the same investigation that has been ongoing for the past 13 years and which he has petitioned the courts to have speeded up .
" He co-operated fully with police investigators and answered all their questions and enjoyed drinking their coffee , " said the unnamed spokesman .
Controversy Mr Lieberman , an ultra-nationalist , is one of Israel 's most outspoken politicians .
Livni condemns new leaders Palestinian talks suspended Musician ordered out of West Bank Profile : Avigdor Lieberman
He was a controversial choice for a leading ministerial post in the government of right - winger Benjamin Netanyahu , which was sworn in on Tuesday .
As he assumed office , Mr Lieberman raised concerns among some people by saying Israel was not bound by a US - sponsored 2007 agreement to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians .
Palestinian officials described him as an " obstacle to peace " whose policies would rebound negatively on Israel .
Israel 's former chief peace negotiator , and Mr Lieberman 's predecessor as foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the remarks showed that the government would not be a partner for peace with the Palestinians .
The BBC's Jo Floto in Jerusalem says Mr Lieberman 's supporters are unlikely to be troubled by the police interest in him .
But Wednesday 's questioning will do nothing to reassure those people who believe Mr Lieberman is an unsuitable choice for such a prominent role in the Israeli administration , says our correspondent .

WASHINGTON , April 28 ( UPI ) -- Kathleen Sebelius was sworn in as U.S. health and human services secretary Tuesday evening with President Barack Obama at her side .
The 8 p.m. ceremony in the Oval Office came hours after the Senate voted 65 to 31 to confirm the former Kansas governor to the Cabinet post .

The president held a Bible as she took the oath from White House executive clerk Tim Saunders .
Obama then gave her a kiss on the cheek and said he was " thrilled " to have her in his administration , adding " I expect her to hit the ground running . "
" Thank you , sir .
Honored to serve , " she said .
Sebelius , who takes over the department as the nation faces a potentially serious outbreak of swine flu , immediately headed to the Situation Room to get a briefing on the situation from White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan .
" We wanted to swear her in right away because we 've got a significant public health challenge that requires her immediate attention , " Obama said .
" It is something that we have to monitor very carefully . "
Obama interrupted his closed Blue Room reception with his other Cabinet secretaries to swear in Sebelius , the final addition to his core advisers .
Sebelius had resigned as governor , flew to Andrews Air Force Base and came directly to the White House for the ceremony .
After being nominated , Sebelius came under a dark cloud when it was revealed she failed to pay about $ 7,000 in taxes on time .
Sebelius said the violations were caused by " unintentional errors " related to mistakes resulting from the sale of a home and charitable contributions .
Sebelius was nominated after Obama 's first choice , former Sen .
Tom Daschle , withdrew from consideration after failing to pay more than $ 100,000 in income taxes on free limo rides provided by a friend and Democratic donor .

The price of pork sausages has gone up 51 % in the past year A crisis is unfolding in the UK as people in poverty struggle with rising food prices and the recession , the Save the Children charity has warned .
It comes as new figures from The Grocer magazine show food prices rose by more than 18 % over the last year .
On Monday , the charity will launch a crisis grant scheme to help families .
The government says it believes food prices have peaked and it is tackling child poverty through increased child benefits and child tax credits .
' More unequal ' Colette Marshall , of Save the Children , said : " We are facing a crisis .
Benefits simply have n't been enough and with rising food costs it means that families cannot afford to give children proper decent food .

" Part of the problem is ... many people have seen their prosperity improve over the last 10 years , so we have become a much more unequal country , " she said .
" That is very damaging for the people who just have n't kept up , and it really is quite wrong morally , and it 's economically very stupid actually , not to make sure that we share the resources more equally and protect those who have least . "
According to The Grocer , a typical basket of 33 items of food cost £ 48 a year ago .
That has now risen to £ 57.50 .
Seasonal produce has caused a small drop in monthly figures , but the cost of basic essentials remains high .
Extra benefits James Ball , from the magazine , told the BBC : " It is the staples that have really gone up and that 's tough for people who buy the cheapest food .
" Rice costs double what it did last year , baked beans are up more than a third .
Lots of everyday items cost a lot more than they used to . "
As the UK imports about 40 % of its food , the weak pound has driven up prices .
Unpredictable world harvests and a spike in oil prices last year have also played a part .
However , as British produce comes into season , prices are expected to drop .
Treasury minister Stephen Timms said a raft of benefits due to come in on Monday would help struggling families .
" Extra help on child benefit , child tax credit , the state pension , and pension credits is going to assist children , families and older people who are feeling the pinch at the moment .
" Of course we always look at the time of the budget to see if there is more that can be done but I think people will appreciate the help that is being provided . "
A selection of your comments : I am currently on JSA of £ 121.00 every two weeks .
With this money I am expected to pay ALL my household bills and feed my daughter .
If it had n't been for my family , who are in a better position than I , we would be starving by now !

Food prices have gone up for working people like me who although working only earn a minimum yet are not eligable for any bennefits to help towards food etc .
John Williams , Hornchurch , England I work in one of the inner city schools and although I see many children on very low income , sometime I wonder about their parents priorities .
Most children ( not all ) have mobiles and laptops in their bedrooms , latest outfits but also shirts with no buttons on or dirty .
I too have grown up with a single mum back in the 50s , but then despite the post war crises the pride and prioties were different .
Children did not have everything that they wanted .
Mums cooked their own food rather then bought convenience food .

In the past I have done all my shopping at one supermarket , now i regularly check the leaflets , internet and collect coupons to try and help get the basics and try and provide a healthy balanced diet , but it is an incredible struggle and it worries me that with increasingly rising costs I may not be able to do that soon .
Just keeping a basic ' fruit bowl ' at the moment requires me going to 3 seperate shops to get the best offers and give my children their 5 aday !

It is all very well increasing child / working tax credits but unfortunately a majority of those on tax credits will also get housing / council tax benefits which are then reduced as any income is increased .
So alot of people ( especially single parents as I am ) will be no better off ...
If I went to work full time I would be even worse off as childcare is so expensive .
Jane , Essex I am currently on benefits and I find it very difficult to make ends meet .
By the time I pay my electricity , grocery and other outgoings , I am completely broke the day after I get my giro .
I do n't know how people with children cope , as it can't be easy .
My mother makes a good point when she says that if the government think an old age pensioner can't live on less that £ 100 odds a week , how do they expect you to manage on what you get ?
£ 60.50 a week does n't go far , when you are trying to keep a home , that 's for sure and yes , you do cut back on food , rather than go cold or sit in the dark .

I love music and I 've always loved to dance .
Ever since I was a teenager all I wanted was to hear my kind of music as loud as possible .
In school I stood out because of my love of gay disco , but I did n't care .
In the late 80s I dabbled with speed to give me the energy to dance all night and started going to the London gay club , Heaven .
I was n't gay and I never got propositioned .
I just wanted to dance .
So I did .
Then came acid house and ecstasy .
Suddenly , there was music that I loved complete with its own drug that let you dance like there was no tomorrow .
When taking ecstasy the worst aspects of clubbing melted away : the sweat dripping from the ceiling , berks spouting rubbish , the interminable queues .
You simply closed your eyes and danced your arse off .
Bliss .
As for the warnings against the drug , such as the campaign that followed the death of teenager Leah Betts , they did n't bother me .
Everyone knew she died because she drank too much water and her brain swelled up .
She listened to the government scaremongering about the effects of ecstasy .
Besides , I reasoned , I was n't feckless .
I combined my juvenile behaviour with very responsible jobs - until last year I was a manager with a charity .
Also , as I got older I naturally went clubbing less and less .
Then , last year I went to see the Pet Shop Boys play a benefit gig at Heaven .
I had n't been to a club for four years and after turning 40 had promised myself that I would grow up and start acting my age .
But the Pet Shop Boys had provided the soundtrack to my life .
It seems I was not quite ready to embrace the questionable delights of middle age .
So , that evening I got home from work and got changed .
And that 's it .
That 's all I remember .
A month later when I woke up I did n't even know I had left the house .
I felt like the gig was about to start .
I knew nothing about being in a coma , or my mum and brother deciding not to turn off my life - support machine .
I did n't hear the discussions about what might happen if I woke up .
I certainly did not know about my mum and brother being told on three occasions that I might die .
It transpired that I had taken powdered ecstasy , or MDMA , before going into Heaven .
No one knows how much , except me , and I can't remember .
The friend who was with me that night , and who ultimately saved my life , recalls me dancing oddly and being a bit unsteady .
Thankfully , she had the sense to get me outside and call an ambulance .
Soon I was unable to stand and , to all intents and purposes , I lay dead in her arms outside Heaven .
The ambulance took me to St Thomas 's A&E department in south London .
The MDMA had induced a toxic reaction in my brain , heating it up to 41 degrees .
My cerebellum - the part of the brain that tells the body how to balance , how to make sounds recognisable as words and remembers how to write and hold a pen - was fried .
Despite this I was incredibly lucky .
I later found out that I was one of four people in the hospital that weekend to have taken an E - and the only one to survive .
My friend was told by a consultant that you could take E or MDMA 100 times and suffer no ill - effects or you could take it only once and that would be it .
I was moved to Guy 's hospital as all my vital organs packed up one after the other .
The doctors decided against giving me a liver transplant , but my lungs collapsed twice .
I only had one kidney , as the other was removed when I was 16 , which complicated the situation .
I spent a month in a coma before waking and being transferred to the high - dependency unit .
In there I became convinced the doctors were out to kill me .
In fact in my deluded state I even begged for a knife so that I could cut away at the plastic sheet I thought the mortuary assistants would bind me in .
Next , I spent a week in a neurological ward before I was given a place at a rehab unit five minutes from my house , which I had passed by for 17 years without ever noticing .
I was sure my situation was a cruel practical joke and kept waiting for someone to say they could cure me with a quick injection .
However , I quickly got used to the routine .
Up at 8 am , a compulsory shower and then nothing but endless therapy sessions - physiotherapy , speech and language therapy , psychotherapy .
When I woke and realised it would be another day of not walking and another day of hearing the sound of my life being flushed down the toilet , what made it unbearable was that it was my hand that had pressed the flush .
My steady stream of visitors saved me .
My partner , who worked in a hospital in Glasgow took time off .
My best friend - my mum - came to see me at least three times a week and never once mentioned the terrible emotional strain I must have caused her .
My brother travelled from Ireland whenever he could .
I realised , for the first time , what real , genuine , friendship means and that I had it in abundance .
Some friends played Scrabble with me .
Some gossiped with me , as much as my limited Dalek voice would allow .
Another arranged for me to have a haircut .
You can't credit how much all this means or how small your world becomes when you are in a wheelchair and measure everything by how far the nearest toilet is .
As the weeks turned into months the unbelievable truth slowly dawned on me that I might not walk or dance again .
I had plenty of time to dwell on how much a moment of selfish , thoughtless pleasure , that I can't even remember , had cost me .
I felt a mounting and inescapable sense of anger but I could n't blame anyone but myself .
I was n't in pain , but I was frustrated and bored .
My cognitive and intellectual functions were intact , but the lack of fine motor skills meant that I could not stand , balance or talk .
I still had the same thoughts but my body disobeyed me .
Everything I once took as a given was gone in the time it took me to collapse .
Now the weekends gave boring a new , more boring , meaning .
There were no therapies , nothing other than being woken up at 8 am and the interminable wait until you fell asleep that night .
The weekends seemed to last for an eternity .
You see yourself becoming dependent on others , and while they chat away about plans , hopes and fears , you realise that yours mean nothing .
Eventually my discharge date focused my mind on the immediate future .
The NHS , which had spared no effort or expense in saving my life , now began issuing me disclaimer letters to sign before I could go on weekend leave .
Everything I did was at my own risk .
On no account would the NHS countenance me even trying to walk upstairs .
It felt as if it was more concerned with minimising the threat of litigation than in my learning how to walk .
Fortunately , my two housemates were incredible .
They not only visited whenever possible , but saw this risk - averse attitude as an affront to commonsense .
They devised their own walking practice - pushing me to a practice area , where I would stand up and hold on to their shoulders .
One would then get in my chair and I would push it .
They have also endured the carers - strangers - coming into the house four times a day and leaving the house keys in a keysafe in the front garden for easy access .
We moved and the same hardships they tolerated at the old house travelled with us .
This could have been the perfect excuse to say : " We liked living with the old you , it 's just that the new you comes with so much extra baggage .
Besides , we 've found somewhere , have you ? "
But they never did .
Most of the time I do feel devoid of any hope .
I never thought that I would think , let alone write this , but I really hate being me .
However , I am slowly learning to walk again and I practise every day .
Recently a Bristol academic , Professor David Nutt , was quoted comparing the dangers of taking ecstasy with horse riding , but my life has been ruined .
I used to go out walking in the rain for no other reason than I could but you can't do that in a wheelchair .
Taking ecstasy nearly killed me , and had n't I always thought it safe ?
If I wrote a post saying that Demigod sales were far below what we had hoped for and I said that the reason was due to piracy and that the answer was that we should have put some nasty copy protection on those DVDs to have prevented early piracy what do you think people would say ?
I know what my answer to that would be .
I would say that Stardock could n’t blame poor sales on piracy but rather the fact that the game ’s built - in multiplayer match - making was totally broken for the first day of release due to its underestimation of network resources that a mainstream game would take and even when that got addressed , the multiplayer match - making for two weeks and counting has been incredibly flakey which affected reviews and word of mouth .
That ’s what I would say .
And yet …
http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23381\
Demigod debuts at # 3 for top selling PC games at retail – bearing in mind that that was a partial week and that the majority of units sold were digital sales which were n’t counted .
But … but …what about those hundreds of thousands of pirates ?
Yep .
Demigod is heavily pirated .
And make no mistake , piracy pisses me off .
If you ’re playing a pirated copy right now , if you ’re one of those people on Hamachi or GameRanger playing a pirated copy and have been for more than a few days , then you should either buy it or accept that you ’re a thief and quit rationalizing it any other way .
The reality that most PC game publishers ignore is that there are people who buy games and people who do n’t buy games .
The focus of a business is to increase its sales .
My job , as CEO of Stardock , is not to fight worldwide piracy no matter how much it aggravates me personally .
My job is to maximize the sales of my product and service and I do that by focusing on the people who pay my salary – our customers .
As Ars Technica quoted over a year ago :
" The reason why we do n't put copy protection on our games is n't because we 're nice guys .
We do it because the people who actually buy games do n't like to mess with it .
Our customers make the rules , not the pirates .
Pirates do n't count , " Wardell argues .
" When Sins popped up as the # 1 best selling game at retail a couple weeks ago , a game that has no copy protect whatsoever , that should tell you that piracy is not the primary issue . "
Even Demigod , a game that shipped with no copy protection on the DVD , was massively pirated , and has had , to put it mildly severe launch issues with its multiplayer match - making which has had a negative impact on its Metacritic score has still managed to debut at the top of retail sales charts ( not counting our digital sales ) .
Why is that ?
At that point I can only speculate but the first reason is pretty straight forward : Demigod is an awesome game .
Second , while the multiplayer matchmaking that comes with the game currently sucks , our customers know it will get fixed .
Part of that is the demographic of Stardock customers .
They ’re more experienced , they know that some of the issues with the MP matchmaking are n’t due to rushing the game out or negligence but rather the fact that complicated systems sometimes do n’t scale well and there is no substitute for time when it comes to fix them .
I think there are many lessons to be learned from Demigod .
For example , if I had to do it over again , I would be inclined to require a valid user account to play LAN even if it only has to be validated one time .
That way , we could also make it a lot easier for a legal user to have a LAN party with a single license .
Anyone who has played Demigod on Game Ranger probably knows what and why I 'm bringing that up .
When the focus of energy is put on customers rather than fighting pirates , you end up with more sales .
It seems common sense to me but then again , I ’m just an engineer .

Military Matters : U.S. risks wars backlash
To the large majority of American and European soldiers , this is a lesson in horror .
They return home thankful they live in a place where the state endures .
The last thing they want is to see their native country turn into another Iraq or Afghanistan .
by William S. Lind
Washington ( UPI ) Feb 6 , 2009
Some time ago I wrote a column warning that the United States ' involvement in Fourth Generation Wars overseas would spur the development 4GW at home .
One way it would do so is by introducing soldiers to statelessness .
I do not see e-mail , but I was told that column generated lots of it .
Many e-diots howled that I had somehow " attacked the troops . "
Well , guess what ?
It 's starting to happen .
A reader sent me a copy of a story from The Oklahoman dated Dec. 25 , 2008 .
The title is " Police Say Vet Made , Sold IEDs to Gangs . "
It reads in part :
" Police spent the day searching the house of a decorated , two - tour Iraq war veteran on Tuesday , one day after he was arrested and charged with making explosive devices and attempting to sell them .
...
" Steven Andrew Jordal , 24 , was an infantry tank ( sic ) specialist in the U.S. Army from 2002 to 2007 .
He received the Army 's Good Conduct medal , along with several other medals , badges and ribbons , the military confirmed .
" Oklahoma City police took interest in Jordal when they received a tip he was selling IEDs to criminals .
IEDs have emerged in Iraq as the weapon of choice for insurgents against U.S. forces .
" For as little as $ 100 , Jordal was making the same kinds of weapons he saw used against his fellow soldiers in Iraq and selling them on the streets of Oklahoma City to gang members . "
Surprise , surprise .
This is not the first such report I have seen .
Shortly after my initial column ran , I received a letter from a reader in Poland with a news story that Polish police were being attacked and killed with improvised explosive devices .
If we read these stories merely as accounts of the spread of a technology -- improvised explosive devices -- we read them too narrowly .
American and other foreign troops in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan are learning more than how to make IEDs and how effective they can be .
They are learning by direct observation how a place works when the state disappears .
To the large majority of American and European soldiers , this is a lesson in horror .
They return home thankful they live in a place where the state endures .
The last thing they want is to see their native country turn into another Iraq or Afghanistan .
But a minority will learn a different lesson .
They will see statelessness as a field of opportunity where people who are clever and ruthless can rise fast and far .
They look upon themselves as that kind of people .
They also will have learned it is possible to fight the state , and how to do so .
The effectiveness of improvised explosive devices is part of that lesson ; so are the power and rewards that come to members of militias and gangs .
In their own minds , and perhaps in reality , they will have found a new world in which they can hope to thrive .
There is a parallel here with what the men who fought in the trenches on the Western Front in World War I learned .
For most , it was the worst time in their lives .
Their experience is captured by Erich Maria Remarque 's famous novel " All Quiet on the Western Front . "
But a minority found that war was the best time of their lives .
Their book is Ernst Juenger 's " Storm of Steel . "
It was these men , looking to recreate that tremendous experience , who made up the brownshirts of the Nazi Party 's Sturmabteilung -- the SA .
Their very name , Storm Troopers , originated in what they had done during the war .
They came home determined to create a different Germany , and they did .
As I have argued , both in these columns and elsewhere , if the U.S. government and its people want to avoid importing Fourth Generation War into the United States , they need to isolate the American nation from Fourth Generation War overseas .
The United States therefore needs a defensive , not an offensive , grand strategy .
So long as the United States enmeshes itself in Fourth Generation Wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan -- will the Obama administration add Somalia and Sudan to the list ? -- it will increase the danger its government should seek most to avoid , the horror of Fourth Generation War on America 's own soil .
That is the Fourth Generation 's strategic improvised explosive device , and if it ever goes off in America , we will all get blown up .

PARIS , March 18 ( UPI ) --
The general strike called this week by French labor union leaders and students has won widespread public sympathy , with opinion polls reporting 74 percent support for Thursday 's " Day of Action , " which threatens to become a serious political crisis for the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The public mood , never in great sympathy with Sarkozy 's reform plans to liberalize the economy and labor market , has been badly affected by rising unemployment and incidents like the announcement of hundreds of job losses by the Total oil and gas giant despite a record profit of more than $ 20 billion .
Even the government 's labor minister called that " scandalous . "

It is always dangerous for a French government to fight on two fronts , against the students and against the labor unions at the same time .
But that is the position Sarkozy now faces , and he does so with very little public support behind him .
Last week 60,000 students and academics took to the streets to protest Sarkozy 's education reforms , which are fairly modest by U.S. or British standards .
The reforms seek to give university leaders more control over staff time and to require graduate students who are not actively researching to do some teaching .
They also try to tighten the qualifications for teacher training .
But the reforms have been characterized as a right - wing plot against academic freedom and against the broad thrust of Sarkozy 's initial plans to modernize France by reducing the role of the state and promoting private enterprise .
Staff representatives at 22 of France 's 33 university institutes of technology voted for an indefinite strike .
Foreign students at the Sorbonne in Paris have been told they should consider going home to try to get academic credits for this semester , since they are unlikely to be awarded them in France after the constant interruptions in teaching .

Condemned by the left as " imposing the Anglo - Saxon law of the jungle " on France , that initial strategy of Sarkozy has fallen victim to the economic crisis and the need for more state intervention to bail out banks and stricken plants in the auto industry .
But despite his backtracking and concessions to students and labor unions , Sarkozy is still vulnerable to the " Anglo - Saxon " label .
And like the left in France , Sarkozy is aware of the almost mythical power in France of " la rue , " the term that embraces protest marches , strikes , riots and militant action of all kinds .
Back in December , when he saw riots rage in the Greek capital of Athens for weeks on end , Sarkozy warned his Council of Ministers that the economic crisis threatened a new wave of militancy across Europe .
That was when Sarkozy began to drop his school and university reform program , worried that the combination of labor unions and students could become explosive , as it was in 1968 in the riots and strikes that led , a year later , to the fall of President Charles de Gaulle .
Labor militancy is spreading across the country , after last week 's incident when the head of Sony in France was detained overnight by his employees at a plant threatened with closure .
Workers at the Continental tire factory Monday stormed the company boardroom at Rheims and pelted managers with eggs , while outside , hundreds more facing unemployment chanted , " We are not Kleenex , " a term that has become slang for disposable staff .
" Whether at Sony or Continental or elsewhere , the employees have nothing more to lose ; they reckon nobody cares about them , that they do n't count , " said Jean - Claude Mailly of the Force Ouvriere union .

Thursday 's strike is expected to affect public transport and schools most strongly , but many government offices will be hard hit , along with some parts of private industry ( like Total ) where tempers are running high .
The goal for the coalition of labor leaders behind the general strike call is to exceed the 2 million who stopped work on " Black Thursday , " Jan. 19 , in the last Day of Action .
There is an element of theater about all this .
This week 's general strike was initially called back in January , before Sarkozy made concessions and agreed to hold " a summit of the social partners , " including unions , government and business leaders .
Sarkozy then announced a " fiscal package " to stimulate the economy , which included a series of tax cuts on overtime and sales taxes in restaurants .
But the economic crisis means that little overtime was available .
Union leaders want the tax cuts scrapped and replaced by a new " social investment fund " that is being set up to fund work training and investment in " green " jobs in alternative energy .
So that is one theme of the marches planned for Thursday , even though the " green jobs " theme is one that Sarkozy himself has backed as a Europe - wide project .
And now Sarkozy has irritated his European partners by making protectionist speeches about French - owned car plants needing to employ French car workers in France , rather than seeking cheap labor in the Czech Republic .
Sarkozy 's presidency is not seriously in question , and he has three more years in office .
But his government is on the defensive , and Sarkozy keeps making new enemies .
His latest gesture on the international scene , announcing France 's return to the joint military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , has infuriated the left .
It also has irritated many nationalists and Gaullists on the right , who recall that de Gaulle took France out of the NATO command in 1966 as a symbolic act of French independence .

Those on the left who see the chance of a new 1968 are likely to be disappointed .
Those were boom years , with a much larger industrial working class and stronger labor unions .
These days , job security is the priority for many employees .
But France is in for some days of drama and street theater , which could turn ugly as the economic crisis deepens .
And one key group so far has been remarkable for its silence : the immigrant youngsters of the grim public housing estates who rocked the country four years ago with a month of rage that saw thousands of cars burned across France .
This month 's labor market statistics found that among immigrants , unemployment is running at 8 percent for those from Europe , and at 23 percent for those from elsewhere , mainly North Africa .
If their violence joins the anger of the students and the resentment of the labor unions , that could be a very dangerous mix indeed for Sarkozy and France .
Largely ignored by scientific community , new theory could change how future generations view forests
Two Russian scientists , Victor Gorshkov and Anastassia Makarieva of the St. Petersburg Nuclear Physics , have published a revolutionary theory that turns modern meteorology on its head , positing that forests — and their capacity for condensation — are actually the main driver of winds rather than temperature .
While this model has widespread implications for numerous sciences , none of them are larger than the importance of conserving forests , which are shown to be crucial to ‘ pumping ’ precipitation from one place to another .
The theory explains , among other mysteries , why deforestation around coastal regions tends to lead to drying in the interior .
Although the theory has garnered a wide contrast of reactions — from dismissal to accolades — it has so far been mostly ignored by the greater scientific community since first published in a small journal in 2007 .
A new paper in Bioscience by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso attempts to remedy this by introducing ( or re-introducing ) the theory to scientists of all fields , many of whom have probably never heard of the theory despite its radical and widespread implications .

Dr. Sheil says that the theory was generally ignored “ because it was just too radical for anyone to accept ” , adding that the original papers also included difficult math and language .
Conventional ideas about rainfall production and forests has long seen a link between forests and rainfall but the theories had yet to adequately describe the nature of this link and the reasons behind it .
Large - scale deforestation has been observed to cause a drop in precipitation , cloud formations , and more extreme seasons .
According to the Murdiyarso and Sheil ’s paper , conventional theories not only do n’t explain the connection between forests and rainfall , they have yet to explain fully the actual production of rain across regions .
In fact , current understanding “ offers no clear explanation for how flat lowlands in continental interiors maintain wet climates , ” write Murdiyarso and Sheil , for example the Amazonian interior or the Congo .
If one employs only conventional theories that “ precipitation should decrease exponentially with distance from the oceans , ” all the continents would look like diminishing green spirals from space , with the landscape turning browner and drier closer to the center .

Makarieva and Gorshkov ’s theory claimss to explain why the Australian outback is so dry .

This is where Makarieva and Gorshkov ’s revolutionary theory fills in the gaps .
They posit a ‘ pump ’ , where “ areas able to maintain high levels of atmospheric condensation draw in air and moisture from elsewhere ” .
What regions maintain high levels of atmospheric condensation ?
Quite simply the answer is forests , with rainforests maintaining greater quantities than temperate , but both are important .
“ Forests maintain high evaporation which gets the cycle going , ” Sheil told Mongabay.com , ” this can explain how deep wet continental interiors gain high rainfall ” .
To explain the ‘ pump ’ theory in detail , Mongabay.com turned to Makarieva and Gorshkov :
“ In any pump ( e.g. , water pump that pumps water into the swimming pool or your breathing pump [ lungs ] that pumps air into your body ) a drop of fluid pressure is created , so that the fluid streams towards the area with lowered pressure .
In the case of biotic pump of atmospheric moisture this drop of air pressure is created by water vapor condensation .
That is , pressure of air around us is proportional to the number of gas molecules in a given volume .
Condensation of water vapor leads to the disappearance of vapor molecules and results in air pressure drop . ”
The drop in air pressure is particularly important since it is one of the clear cut observations that “ has been routinely overlooked ” by conventional meteorologists , according to Murdiyarso and Sheil ’s paper .

“ Once the pressure gradient is created , ” Makarieva and Gorshkov continue , “ moist air starts to flow towards the area where condensation is taking place .
Water vapor brought with this air sustains the process of condensation and thus sustains the stationary pressure gradient .
However , as soon as the incoming air becomes dry ( no water vapor ) , there is nothing to sustain condensation , air pressure tends to equilibrium and the pressure gradient disappears .
Thus , for the pump to work , one needs a continuous process of evaporation delivering gaseous moisture to the atmosphere . ”
No region provides this process of evaporation more effectively than rainforests .
“ An actively evaporating natural rainforest will work as a pump continuously supporting lower air pressure above its canopy and thus drawing moist air from the [ the ocean ] ” says Makarieva and Gorshkov .
If the rainforest is cutoff or destroyed , water will simply stop being pumped from the ocean and will cease inland , leading to desertification .
But how does this new model , radical in its emphasis , play out against observations of actual weather patterns ?
Makarieva and Gorshkov say that their theory “ is significant enough to numerically account for the observed wind velocities in all observable circulation patterns , from large scale stationary continental patterns like the Amazon forest pump to spatially and temporarily concentrated patterns like hurricanes and tornadoes ” .

And then comes the statement that has meteorologists rolling in their graves : “ this indicates that water vapor condensation is not only a previously unaccounted , but the major , compared to temperature gradients , driver of atmospheric circulation on Earth . ”
Meteorology has largely been based on the concept that temperature drives the globe ’s wind systems , but the new theory overturns that arguing that oceans and forests , with their ability to produce water vapor condensation , are the real wind movers .
For a specific example Makarieva and Gorshkov point to prehistoric Australia .
They believe the pump “ explains the enigmatic conversion of Australian forests to deserts that roughly coincides in timing with the appearance of the first people . ”
According to Makarieva and Gorshkov , when these early peoples burned small bands of forests along the coast where they first inhabited , “ the internal inland forests were cut off from the ocean ( the tube of the pump cut off ) and underwent rapid desertification . ”
Simply put a loss of coastal forests — which had been driving rain from the ocean into the interior — caused Australia ’s current dry climate .
If Australia had n’t lost those coastal forests , its environment may be entirely different today — and would not be suffering from extreme and persistent droughts .
Implications : large and comprehensive
The implications of Makarieva and Gorshkov ’s explanation of precipitation — and the vital role played by forests — are revolutionary and widespread , which is the reason the theory produces controversy , or is simply dismissed out of hand .
Despite this , Makarieva and Gorshkov do not mince words when explaining the importance of their theory and its implications for scientists in all fields : “ Biotic forest pump can be considered as the crown of evolution of terrestrial biota , ultimately it was this pump that enabled land to flourish with life . ”

Regarding forest conservation the impacts are huge , since the pump posits that large tracts of forests actually carry and sustain levels of precipitation .
“ It should stimulate many stakeholders to see a much greater value in maintaining large forest tracts than they might otherwise , ” Sheil says .
And while tropical forests remain the most productive of ecosystems in terms of precipitation , Makarieva and Gorshkov argue that temperate forests are also vital .
“ This year we have published an extension of precipitation pattern analyses , including more regions for Northern America .
From the new data it is evident that the degrading secondary forests of temperate North America are on their way to desertification , losing their ability to transport atmospheric water along the continent . ”
In a sense this is a contemporary example of what the scientists say occurred in Australia thousands of years ago .
With no end in sight to deforestation , the scientists analyzed the significance of secondary forests cropping up worldwide on the ‘ pump ’ .
Makarieva and Gorshkov are skeptical of secondary forests ’ ability to keep moisture flowing , attributing much more importance to primary forests .
“ All ecological and environmental functions of [ secondary ] forests , including the pumping abilities , are naturally weakened and destabilized compared to the abilities of the undisturbed primary forests , ” they told Mongabay.com “ Secondary forests are precious inasmuch as they are allowed to recover towards the primary state . ”
However , a slight rift has already appeared regarding secondary forests and their capacity to attract rainfall .
In their study Murdiyarso and Sheil argue that secondary forests and even forest plantations “ can have desirable evaporation properties . ”

Sheil says more , explaining that he believes the relative value of secondary forests “ needs to be examined more carefully .
I agree that they will likely be less effective but to dismiss their possible value out of hand seems a mistake also .
We need more data . ”
Murdiyarso and Sheil also argue in their paper that the pump theory actually resurrects a controversial idea : greening deserts .
Conventional meteorology makes it impossible that deserts could be greened , i.e. turned into self - sustaining forests with human help , but the new theory changes this .
Arguably forests could be planted from coasts leading to interior deserts , bringing rain and reshaping the ecosystem entirely .
In effect , it would be the reverse of what happened in prehistoric Australia .
“ If forests could be established on a large - scale in deserts ( as the new hypothesis implies ) they could , if appropriately planned , perhaps bring the rain they need to grow them , ” Sheil says .
“ Once these area were forested the forests would need to be maintained and would capture considerable amounts of carbon ( and thus help to reduce the greenhouse effect and limit global warming ) . ”
In fact the implications for global warming are many , including re-evaluation of past ecosystem responses to changes in climate .
However on the practical end , the new theory grants a new role for the importance of forests .
While they have long been recognized as ‘ carbon sinks ’ they would now need to be recognized as the ‘ bringers of rain ’— vital for maintaining a stable and productive climate for every species on earth .
Reaction : from dismissals to comparisons to Copernicus
“ We would characterize the first reactions to our findings as mute shock and further neglect , by consequence , ” Makarieva and Gorshkov write , noting the difficulties they have encountered not in having their theory accepted — that is a long way off — but simply read and considered .

Sheil , who is helping to bring the theory to light says , “ I am convinced [ the pump theory ] deserves very careful scrutiny and not the general dismissal that has happened thus far .
It may be wrong in certain aspects but I am sure that the scrutiny will be helpful and productive .
This is the nature of science : we do n’t need to decide if it is wrong or right but we need to collect the data that will tell us ”
While other scientists are being exposed to theory for the first time , Makarieva and Gorshkov argue that it has largely been proven .
“ The biotic pump theory is derived from fundamental physical principles , it is not a model .
We have no doubts that , sooner or later , it will make a revolution in atmospheric physics and environmental science in general .
We are facing enormous difficulties in overcoming the initial resistance of the community .
We are working further and developing the theory , but we cannot easily publish our new results as people have not yet absorbed and understood what has been already done . ”
It may be that so far Makarieva and Gorshkov have been victims of scientific politics .
“ Indeed , ” they write , “ as physicists - theoreticians from Russia we do not in the very least belong to the international mainstream meteorological community , and our voices are probably not the ones to be immediately listened to or heard . ”
However , Makarieva and Gorshkov do see more and more people becoming aware not only of the theory but its implications :
“ We are being approached by an increasing number of people , scientists as well as lay members of the society .
Unlike meteorologists , the ecohydrologists and paleobotanists are exceptionally interested . ”
Most recently , Makarieva and Gorshkov have used their theory to describe tornadoes and hurricanes .
It was this study published in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions journal , which “ evoked a full spectrum of possible reactions , from ‘ not publishable in any serious journal ’ to the proposition that our findings are of the same significance to modern meteorology as was Copernicus ’ ideas to astronomy ” .
While Makarieva and Gorshkov state that they are willing to be patient for their theory to be accepted , they add that “ in the case of the biotic pump , time is against the humanity .
The water issue is glaring in its importance .
The sooner the novel mechanism that we propose is noticed , discussed , verified and recognized by the world scientific community , the sooner the humanity comes into possession of a new tool how to mitigate the on - going degradation of water resources , of a new understanding of how to secure water resources for the future generations . ”
While time will surely tell , Makarieva and Gorshkov bring up a good point .
Considering rampant deforestation , global warming , desertification , and water security — time is not on our side .

Preliminary reports in California , where the total number of nonfamily civil suits for more than $ 25,000 declined by 8 percent last year , the portion of plaintiffs without a lawyer rose by 22 percent , while defendants representing themselves rose by 36 percent , according to Ronald M. George , the chief justice of California ’s Supreme Court .
Even though the number of disputes may be on the rise in the economic downturn as people clash with their landlords , creditors and others , Judge George perceives a reluctance to go to court because of the expense .
“ People are n’t going to court as much anyway because they ca n’t afford counsel , ” he said .
“ But those that are proceeding are more likely to represent themselves . ”
The best evidence of the increase in self - representation could come from individual courthouses , where the shift is evident in growing lines at self - help centers like the one in Superior Court in San Francisco .

CIUDAD JUÁREZ , Mexico —
More than half a dozen soccer players refused to join the professional team in this border city , where so many tortured and beheaded bodies put fear in visitors and locals alike .
Those who do play for the team live in gated areas , with high walls and fences topped with razor wire , to protect them from the turf war between the drug cartels that has left nearly 2,000 people dead over the past 14 months .
Despite the forbidding environment , the team , Indios , advanced last May to the top division in the Mexican League .
It soldiers on this season , and so do the team ’s fans .
On Sunday , even as the police announced the discovery of nine bodies buried outside this border city , the mood for a match at Olimpico Benito Juárez Stadium was one of celebration , not apprehension .
Indios operates in a kind of neutral zone , which takes a lot to maintain .
From 250 to 400 municipal police and security guards provide crowd control for each game .
Some players said they left home only for training and games and to buy necessary items , sticking to main roads during daylight , restricting travel at night .
Their wives are encouraged to travel in groups when taking their children to school .

Last month journalist Seymour Hersh broke the story that the Bush administration used an executive assassination ring to go into countries and execute people on a hit list .
Today on CNN’s The Situation Room , former Cheney aide John Hannah said that a list of targets exists and there are troops in the field who have the authority to capture or kill certain individuals .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Host Wolf Blitzer asked Hannah about a list of targets for assassination , and he replied , “ There ’s clearly a group of people that go through a very extremely well - vetted process , interagency process … that have committed acts of war against the United States , who are at war with the United States or are suspected of planning operations of war against the United States , who authority is given to our troops in the field in certain war theaters to capture or kill those individuals .
That is certainly true . ”
Hannah also said that he doubted that Congress was notified about the assassinations .
Hersh originally said at a University of Minnesota event last month that , “ Right now , today , there was a story in the New York Times that if you read it carefully mentioned something known as the Joint Special Operations Command — JSOC it ’s called .
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
They did not report to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or to Mr. [ Robert ]
Gates , the secretary of defense .
They reported directly to him .
… Congress has no oversight of it .
It ’s an executive assassination ring essentially , and it ’s been going on and on and on . ”
At first I thought that this story was too outrageous to be true , but with the story yesterday that Cheney tried to sabotage Obama with Israel , and with the wide list of documented secret activities that have been confirmed to have gone on under the Bush administration , is this really a surprise ?
Cheney believes in the unlimited authority of the Executive Branch , so would it really be that big of a stretch that he would be in charge of an executive assassination ring ?
Until I see evidence that contradicts this report , I am inclined to believe it .
When it comes to characters , every writer has their preferences .
For Thomas Bernhard , the 20th century Austrian writer who seduces readers with blocks of musical prose , it is the fastidious intellectual intent on developing his master work .
There is Konrad , the homebound scientist in The Lime Works , who uses his crippled wife to further his research on the sense of hearing .
There is Rudolph , the mortally ill musicologist in Concrete , who exerts his last energies on writing a major piece about Felix Mendelssohn Bartholody .
And there is Roithamer in Correction who will let nothing , not even himself , deter him from completing his ungainly manuscript , “ About Altensam and everything connected with Altensam , with special attention to the Cone . ”
Men with an aim , a definite goal , specific in every aspect , this is the mold Bernhard deftly shapes into life with his German prose ; however , it is only Roithamer who sees his aim through to the end .
The others waffle in their intentions , pacing the lengths of their cold houses in desolate locations with revolutionary ideas but nothing to show .
Roithamer , on the other hand , will not let the end go escaped because he is practical .
Unlike Konrad and Rudolph , he is well aware of the obstacles that he will face along the way – the opposition of outsiders ; his own irritability ; his debilitating anal retentive ways that he must succumb to ; and the perpetual question of where should I write , whether Cambridge , Hoeller ’s Garret , or Altensam itself will prove the most congenial for his massive undertaking – and it is this awareness that allows him to persevere in the face of so - called writer ’s block .
Even Roithamer ’s own end is , unlike Bernhard ’s other fastidious lead roles , realized .
Hardly ironic , the ultimate correction corrects Roithamer ’s very existence when he hangs himself .
Corrects it in the sense that throughout the course of his life he has , against his will , become another man , one whom he does n’t want to be anymore .
Exposed to his parents from an early age , in particular his mother , a backward educational systems that stifles growth , and the reckless demands of others , Roithamer matured into a man he did not like , a man he had no desire to be , could not be , so he had to correct it , he had to become , or rather , retrieve the man he was .
Like the process of correcting a manuscript , changes are made , deletions abound , stets number fewer , and the manuscript that was soon becomes another , entirely different manuscript .
The process repeats itself : more deletions , less stets , word count pared until nothing remains , till the manuscript is what it has always been , an empty page , corrected to the fullest , origin retrieved .
“ The end is no process .
Clearing , ” so Roithamer .

WASHINGTON —
In the mountains of northwest Pakistan , the psychological impact of America ’s drone strikes can be measured by this :
Some locals have given up drinking Lipton tea , out of a growing conviction that the Central Intelligence Agency is using the tea bags as homing beacons for its pilotless planes .
But in Pakistan ’s cities there is a different impact : a sense that the gizmos , created to instill fear in America ’s enemies , only reveal the fears of Americans to take casualties themselves .
There , a song of protest taunts the world ’s most powerful country for sending robots to do a man ’s job :
America ’s heartless terrorism
Killing people like insects
But honor does n’t fear power .
Even as the C.I.A. crosses names off its list of Al Qaeda leaders with each successful strike in Pakistan , Washington is struggling to understand the long - term implications of a push - button conflict .
One question is whether the robot wars are only a holding action in a far more complex political and ideological war , against an enemy whose resilience America still does n’t fully understand .
President Obama and his advisers acknowledge that it will take years , and billions of dollars , before Afghanistan ’s own army and police can secure that country ’s hinterlands from the now - resurgent militants of both the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Meanwhile , the militants are likely to remain part of the fabric of Pashtun culture in the tribal lands on both sides of the mountainous border , where the governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan have proved unable to exert control .
Given this complexity , the drone strikes are a seductive tool .
They have delivered body blows to Al Qaeda ’s leadership in the tribal areas of northern Pakistan without risking a single American soldier on the ground .
And last week , Mr. Obama was reported to be considering widening their use to include killing Taliban leaders who direct insurgents in Afghanistan from other sanctuaries , near Quetta , in southwestern Pakistan .
A sophisticated FBI - produced spyware program has played a crucial behind - the - scenes role in federal investigations into extortion plots , terrorist threats and hacker attacks in cases stretching back at least seven years , newly declassified documents show .
As first reported by Wired.com , the software , called a " computer and internet protocol address verifier , " or CIPAV , is designed to infiltrate a target 's computer and gather a wide range of information , which it secretly sends to an FBI server in eastern Virginia .
The FBI 's use of the spyware surfaced in 2007 when the bureau used it to track e-mailed bomb threats against a Washington state high school to a 15 - year - old student .
But the documents released Thursday under the Freedom of Information
Act show the FBI has quietly obtained court authorization to deploy the CIPAV in a wide variety of cases , ranging from major hacker investigations , to someone posing as an FBI agent online .
Shortly after its launch , the program became so popular with federal law enforcement that Justice Department lawyers in Washington warned that overuse of the novel technique could result in its electronic evidence being thrown out of court in some cases .
" While the technique is of indisputable value in certain kinds of cases , we are seeing indications that it is being used needlessly by some agencies , unnecessarily raising difficult legal questions ( and a risk of suppression ) without any countervailing benefit , " reads a formerly - classified March 7 , 2002 memo from the Justice Department 's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section .
The documents , which are heavily redacted , do not detail the CIPAV 's capabilities , but an FBI affidavit in the 2007 case indicate it gathers and reports a computer 's IP address ; MAC address ; open ports ; a list of running programs ; the operating system type , version and serial number ; preferred internet browser and version ; the computer 's registered owner and registered company name ; the current logged - in user name and the last - visited URL .
After sending the information to the FBI , the CIPAV settles into a silent " pen register " mode , in which it lurks on the target computer and monitors its internet use , logging the IP address of every server to which the machine connects .
The documents shed some light on how the FBI sneaks the CIPAV onto a target 's machine , hinting that the bureau may be using one or more web browser vulnerabilities .
In several of the cases outlined , the FBI hosted the CIPAV on a website , and tricked the target into clicking on a link .
That 's what happened in the Washington case , according to a formerly - secret planning document for the 2007 operation .
" The CIPAV will be deployed via a Uniform Resource Locator ( URL ) address posted to the subject 's private chat room on MySpace.com . "
In a separate February 2007 , Cincinnati - based investigation of hackers who 'd successfully targeted an unnamed bank , the documents indicate the FBI 's efforts may have been detected .
An FBI agent became alarmed when the hacker he was chasing did n't get infected with the spyware after visiting the CIPAV - loaded website .
Instead , the hacker " proceeded to visit the site 29 more times , " according to a summary of the incident .
" In these instances , the CIPAV did not deliver its payload because of system incompatibility . "
The agent phoned the FBI 's Special Technologies Operations Unit for " urgent " help , expressing " the valid concern that the Unsub hackers would be ' spooked . ' "
But two days later the hacker , or a different one , visited the site again and " the system was able to deliver a CIPAV and the CIPAV returned data . "
The software 's primary utility appears to be in tracking down suspects that use proxy servers or anonymizing websites to cover their tracks .
That 's illustrated in several cases in the documents , including the 2004 hunt for a saboteur who cut off telephone , cable TV and internet service for thousands of Boston residents .
The man 's name is redacted from the documents , but the description of the case matches that of Danny Kelly , an unemployed Massachusetts engineer .
According to court records , Kelly deliberately cut a total of 18 communications cables belong to Comcast , AT&T , Verizon and others over a three month period .
In anonymous extortion letters to Comcast and Verizon , Kelly threatened to increase the sabotage if the companies did n't begin paying him $ 10,000 - a- month in protection money .
He instructed the companies to deposit the cash in a new bank account and post the account information to a web page he could access anonymously .
When the FBI tried to track him down from his visits to the web page , they found he was routing through a German - based anonymizer .
The FBI obtained a warrant to use the CIPAV on Feb. 10 , 2005 , and was apparently successful .
Kelly went on to plead guilty to extortion , and was sentenced to five years probation .
The CIPAV also played a previously - unreported role in an investigation of a prolific computer hacker who made headlines after penetrating thousands of computers at Cisco , various U.S. national laboratories , and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2005 .
The FBI agent leading the case sought approval to plant a CIPAV through an undercover operative posing as a Defense Department contractor " with a computer network connected to JPL 's computer network , " according to one document .
The FBI linked the intrusions to known 16 - year - old hacker in Sweden .
And in 2005 , FBI agents on the Innocent Images task force hit a wall when trying to track a sexual predator who'd begun threatening the life of a teenage girl he'd met for sex .
The man 's IP addresses were " from all over the world " – a sign of web proxy use .
The bureau sought and won court approval to use the CIPAV on Aug. 9 , 2005 .
Other cases are less weighty .
In another 2005 case , someone was unwisely using the name of the chief of the FBI 's Buffalo , New York office to harass people online .
The FBI got a warrant to use the spyware to track down the fake agent .
Additional cases include :
In March 2006 , the FBI investigated a hacker who took over a Hotmail user 's account and acquired personal information .
The hacker tried to extort the owner out of $ 10,000 , demanding the victim create and fund an E - Gold account and e-mail the password to the hacker .
The FBI obtained a search warrant allowing them to send the intruder a CIPAV instead , to uncover his or her location .
In October 2005 , an undercover agent working a case described as " WMD ( bomb & anthrax ) " communicated with the suspect via Hotmail , and sought approval from Washington to use a CIPAV to locate the subject 's computer .
In December 2005 , FBI agents sought to use the spyware to track down another extortionist who sent an e-mail to a casino threatening violence .
In June 2005 , an intruder deleted a database at an unnamed company and demanded payment to restore it .
The FBI prepared a search warrant affidavit and was ready to ask a judge for authorization to deliver the CIPAV through the hacker 's Yahoo e-mail account .
They were briefly thwarted when the intruder stopped communicating with the victim , but after a month of silence the hacker reestablished contact and , presumably , got the FBI 's spyware for his trouble .
The documents appear to settle one of the questions the FBI declined to answer in 2007 : whether the bureau obtains search warrants before using the CIPAV , or if it sometimes relies on weaker " pen register " orders that do n't require a showing of probable cause that a crime has been committed .
In all the criminal cases described in the documents , the FBI sought search warrants .
The records also indicate that the FBI obtained court orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , which covers foreign espionage and terrorism investigations , but the details are redacted .
The FBI released 152 heavily - redacted pages in response to Threat Level 's FOIA request , and withheld another 623 .
Update :
The documents are now available for download here .

While single payer is not on the table , accommodating the insurance industry and healthcare proposals by the party that was trounced in the polls in November apparently is .
That 's why two of the biggest debates now are not over whether to adopt a national healthcare system , that has guaranteed access to care in every other industrialized nation , but whether to force people to buy private insurance and to tax their employer - funded health benefits .
Start with requiring everyone not covered to buy insurance , which amounts to a massive bailout for the insurance industry .
The Democratic chairs of the key committees that are running the show on healthcare have all agreed that individual mandate , putting us all in hock to the insurance giants , will be part of the bill , the New York Times ' Robert Pear reported this morning .
Their alleged premise , says Pear , " that if everyone had health insurance , it would be easier to control health costs . "
Not to mention that it is the top priority for the insurance industry , which is salivating at the prospect of tens of millions of new customers marched into their offices under threat of federal penalties .
But it 's not so popular with everyone else -- a major reason why the individual mandate plan by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , host of the LA forum , crashed and burned last year .
And it has n't worked so well in its prime model , Massachusetts , either .
Listen to the comments of Massachusetts State Sen. Jamie Eldridge , who voted for the law , but recently gave this assessment to a Congressional committee , as reported by healthcare writer extraordinaire , Trudy Lieberman at the Columbia Journalism Review :
The assumption was that , as more people — and , in particular , more young and relatively healthy people — joined the system , premiums would go down across the board .
There was also the assumption that as more people became insured , the number of people going to the emergency room would drop dramatically , saving the Commonwealth money .
Neither of those things have happened — at least not enough to produce the cost savings we were told we would see .
In fact , health care reform has cost the Commonwealth much more than expected — - up to a record $ 1.3 billion this year .
It is maddening that so many of our public health care dollars are diverted to HMOs and health insurance companies , under the current employer - based Massachusetts health care system .
As to taxing benefits , turn the page back to the fall campaign when that idea , the centerpiece of Sen .
John McCain 's healthcare plan , was widely denounced by soon - to - be President Obama and virtually every other Democrat running for office in stump speeches , election mail , and numerous TV ads .
It was considered so distasteful Sen .
Joe Biden even found it to be a handy zinger to Gov. Palin in the vice - presidential debate , saying : " Taxing your healthcare benefit .
I call that the ultimate Bridge to Nowhere . "
But , apparently that was then and this is now , as the Los Angeles Times affirmed this week :
Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are expressing increasing openness to an idea that once seemed unthinkable : putting taxes on some healthcare benefits .
And Peter Orzag , the Obama administration 's budget director , told the Washington Post that taxing benefits " should most definitely remain on the table . "
Unlike real reform , apparently .
What changed ?
Lieberman has one idea :
What happened to Obama ’s budget proposal of a $ 634 billion down payment ( for health care reform ) that was to be funded in part by making wealthier people pay higher income taxes ?
Or the $ 175 billion that was to be saved by cutting the excess payments to Medicare Advantage plans over ten years ?
...
The Senate draft budget does n’t contain any actual money for health care .
Instead ... there will be " space " for a health reform reserve fund .
No taxing the rich — members of Congress beat up on that one .
No trimming Medicare Advantage plans — insurers do n’t like that .
The $ 634 billion figure was always too small to provide all the subsidies people will need if they are required to buy health insurance , which seems to be the direction the pols are going .
But if Obama ’s revenue source does n’t survive the budget process , then where does the money come from ? ... Bingo !
The money might just come from taxing the health insurance benefits of ... everyone else who gets insurance from their boss .
Ironically , the main reason President Obama says single payer reform is not under consideration is because it would " scrap ( the employer based system ) everybody is accustomed to , " as he said in the town hall meeting last week in response to the question of why we can't have the system that works for everyone else :
But demolishing what we have now is almost exactly what would happen when you tax health care benefits .
Many if not most of the youngest and healthiest employees , especially in a recession , would drop their employer coverage to shop for cheaper , barebones plans in the private individual market .
Employers , left with the more expensive employees to cover and an unsustainable risk pool , would see their premium costs skyrocket even more , prompting many to sharply reduce coverage or eliminate benefits entirely .
As Texas employers and healthcare analysis succinctly told the Dallas Morning News ' Jason Roberson during the campaign , " this could eventually lead to the death of company - provided health plans . "
Some seem to have forgotten that consequence .
On April 6 , come help us remind them .
Sometimes , what we get is not what we expect – at all .
For example , a team of scientists from Northeastern University and from NIST discovered by mistake how to produce more solar power by using the residue of a process used to build arrays of titania nanotubes .
Now , physorg.com interprets this invention through the perspective of better hydrogen production , but improving the solar power capturing ability gives a lot more useful applications than only that of hydrogen production .
Titanium dioxide is used widely in foods , toothpastes and all other chemicals that need to be pigmented in white – even in donuts .
35 years ago , Akira Fujishima used titanium dioxide for the first time as a photocatalyst , producing hydrogen from water , electricity and sunlight .
Since then , scientists have discovered how it can successfully be used in making more and more efficient dye - sensitized solar cells .
Northeastern University scientists used NISTS X - ray spectroscopy beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source .
The NIST facility uses low - energy x-rays that can be precisely tuned to specific elements to measure chemical bonds , and is at least 10 times more sensitive than commonly available laboratory instruments , allowing researchers to detect elements at extremely low concentrations .
While making measurements of the carbon atoms , the team noticed spectroscopic data that indicated that the titania nanotubes had small amounts of potassium ions strongly bound to the surface , evidently left by the fabrication process that used potassium salts .
This was the first time the potassium has ever been observed on titania nanotubes , previous measurements were not sensitive enough to detect it .
The team compared the performance of the potassium - bearing nanotubes to equivalent arrays prepared without using potassium , and got three times more energy from the potassium - enriched nanotubes .
“ The result was so exciting , that we got sidetracked from the carbon research , ” says Latika Menon , from Northeastern .
Indeed , these nanotubes could be used to directly produce hydrogen by doing a direct light capture and electrolysis at the same time , but , as I said in the beginning , it could be used as an energy producer for any application .
Really interesting .

They feature throughout the history books and have been an important part of the country for hundreds of years , now a new study has suggested that some of the oldest British names are in danger of being forgotten .
These families names have not disappeared through emigration or death , nor have vanished because a social or demographic change ; rather they face decline because of sheer embarrassment they give the people who have inherited them .
Daft , Cock , Balls , Smeille , death and Shufflebottom , some of the most popular names 100 years ago are facing extinction due the their rude undertones .
The study shows that people are changing there inherited family name in favour of a name that has less of a humourous inclination .
By comparing the population of 2008 with the first Census in Britain in 1881 , these studies have shown a huge decline in names with suggestible meanings .
The use of the name Cock has shrunk by almost 75 per cent and names such as Balls have fallen by almost 50 per cent .
David Hey , the author of Family Names and Family History , and an authority on the subject , believes these names are disappearing because people simply do not understand their history .
“ ‘ Bottom ’ names were from farms at the bottom of a valley .
In the Middle Ages ‘ daft ’ meant meek .
It was a perfectly acceptable name . ”
Now it seems that having an inconspicuous name has become preferential to the population .
The study also showed that the more common British names have survived and in some cases increased .
Smith , Jones , Williams , Brown and Taylor have all remained hugely popular names .
Although some names are disappearing , others have increased in popularity in the last decade .
The fastest growing name in Britain for example , is Zhang , growing from 123 in 1996 to 5804 in 2008 .
It is followed by a further four other Chinese names – Wang , Huang , Yang and Lin .
The increase in popularity of such names correlates accurately with emigration figures from Asia to Britain in the last Decade .
The study also showed that certain names have remained in the same areas of Britain for hundreds of years .
Names derived from the Viking , Dane and Angle invasions are still largely concentrated on the east coast of Britain , where many of these invaders would have settled .
Belfast Telegraph
Actor Gary Busey hit a low in his drug addiction days when he found himself snorting cocaine off his dog .
The Big Wednesday star , who claims he has been sober for 13 years , could n't help himself when his pet pooch rolled in a supply of the drug .
He tells U.S. news show Access Hollywood , " I went in like a cropduster with my nose flying first and snorted the cocaine off the dog .
" But he got more than he bargained for : " You get a little bugs , you get little hairs , you get grease and goo from the ground ; it 's not at all a healthy thing to do .
But when you 're an addict , you do n't think of health , you think about destruction of yourself unconsciously . "
According to a new study , sex selection in China will create an excess 32 million boys of reproductive age in China over the coming generation .
NYT : This disparity seems to surpass that of any other country , they said — a finding , they wrote , that was perhaps unsurprising in light of China ’s one - child policy .
They attributed the imbalance almost entirely to couples ’ decisions to abort female fetuses .
The trend toward more male than female children intensified steadily after 1986 , they said , as ultrasound tests and abortion became more available .
“ Sex - selective abortion accounts for almost all the excess males , ” the paper said .
It 's been said frequently that China may be the first country on earth to get old before it gets rich , simply due to the one - child - per - family policy .
But this huge male - female gap has scary geopolitical implications .
Let 's face it , a nation full of single males is bound to be dangerous and volatile , with a voracious desire to sublimate sexual frustration into bigger and bigger toys : guns and missiles .
That 's what single males the world over gravitate towards , and our best hope is that virtual reality and internet cafes full of first - person shooting games does the trick .
But we doubt it will .
Many will hope to graduate towards the real thing .
Beyond that , there are other reasons to fear that a war with China may eventually be in the cards .
Ever heard of something called " taxation without representation " ?
Yeah , we had a war about it here .
As we attempt to inflate our way out of debt , we 're essentially taxing those who save our dollars .
Turns out , most of them are in China .
And the Chinese might not be crazy about being aggressively taxed by a foreign government .
So take that , add the 32 million single males , and throw in some natural resource hoarding for good measure and you got trouble .
Then all you need is a small sparking of the powder keg , and it 's on .
Bahn - Spähskandal Mehdorn tritt zurück
Die letzte Enthüllung war eine zu viel : Hartmut Mehdorn will als Bahn - Chef zurücktreten .

WITHIN Microsoft ’s Office group , the calendar on the wall appears to be 1983 , the year the company introduced Microsoft Word .
The company still expects customers to buy its software applications as products and install and run them on PCs .
Recognition of the Internet has been slow in coming .
Microsoft is finally preparing Web versions of its
Office suite , though these are intended as supplements , not as replacements .
The company maintains that Web versions of a Word or Excel will never match the functionality and responsiveness that software installed on one ’s own machine provides .
It may be wrong .
Granted , Microsoft ’s largest competitor , Google , has not yet marched up to the bulwarks guarding Microsoft Office and blown a gaping hole into its adversary ’s complacency .
Google Apps , its Office - like suite , contains an uneven bunch of services .
I find Google Calendar far superior to Microsoft Outlook ’s calendar , but Google ’s word processor , Docs , lacks many features in Word that I rely on .
The best online word processor , however , may be the one from a tiny company , Zoho , a nimble innovator .
Zoho Writer is running close enough to Word to imagine that it and other online word processors will be able to do most everything that Word can do , and more .
The 40 - year bonds sold are not among those bought by the Bank of England The UK Treasury has failed to sell all its government bonds in an auction for the first time since 2002 .
It wanted to sell £ 1.75 bn of 40 - year bonds , but investors only bid for £ 1.63bn of the debt , the Debt Management Office said .
Analysts said this may reflect concern over the state of the public finances as government borrowing surges .
But the Treasury said demand for gilts , as UK government bonds are called , remained " strong " .
' One auction ' " It would be wrong to read anything into the results of one auction event , which depends on the gilt on offer , demand and market conditions on the day , " a Treasury spokesman said .
It 's because the government has to borrow so much , that any such flop is unnerving
The BBC's Robert Peston
Peston : Gilts and guilt
The bid - to - cover ratio - how many bonds were offered versus how many were sold - was 0.93 at the auction , the first time in seven years it has been less than 1.0 .
" It 's a sign there is n't enough demand , which could be due to the amount of issuance that is expected to come , or people are worried about inflation , " said Mohit Kumar , a strategist at Deutsche Bank .
The Consumer Prices Index , the benchmark measure of inflation , unexpectedly rose at an annual rate of 3.2 % in February , from 3 % a month earlier , because of the cost of imported goods .
Inflation erodes the value of bonds , which pay a fixed rate of interest over time .
Public borrowing
The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said some analysts thought that gilt sales for 2010 may have to be as much as £ 200bn to fund the government 's plans to revive the economy and meet its previous commitments .
" It 's because the government has to borrow so much , that any such flop is unnerving , " Mr Peston said .
The Bank of England this month began a policy of so - called quantitative easing , which involves effectively creating more money and using it to buy government debt .
It will inject a total of £ 75 bn of new money into the economy .
The goal is to push down the cost of borrowing .
Initially , the Bank said it will buy bonds maturing between five and 25 years , meaning that longer - dated gilts do not have a guaranteed buyer in the central bank .
" If an auction for sub - 25 - year debt failed , then I would be worried , " Mr Kumar said .
Forty - year bonds are towards the longest end of government debt sold , meaning that buyers take the biggest risk to hold it .
Buyers for this kind of debt are usually pension funds and insurance companies that need them to pay annuities , which are regular incomes from a retiree 's pension pot .

As the USArray moves east , details of America ’s rocky underbelly are emerging ( Illustration : Joseba Elorza )
GARY ANDERSON was not around to see a backhoe tear up the buffalo grass at his ranch near Akron , Colorado .
But he was watching a few weeks later when the technicians came to dump instruments and insulation into their 2 - metre - deep hole .
What they left behind did n’t look like much : an anonymous mound of dirt and , a few paces away , a spindly metal framework supporting a solar panel .
All Anderson knew was that he was helping to host some kind of science experiment .
It would n’t be any trouble , he ’d been told , and it would n’t disturb the cattle .
After a couple of years the people who installed it would come and take it away again .
He had in fact become part of what is probably the most ambitious seismological project ever conducted .
Its name is USArray and its aim is to run what amounts to an ultrasound scan over the 48 contiguous states of the US .
Through the seismic shudders and murmurs that rack Earth ’s innards , it will build up an unprecedented 3D picture of what lies beneath North America .
It is a mammoth undertaking , during which USArray ’s scanner – a set of 400 transportable seismometers – will sweep all the way from the Pacific to the Atlantic .
Having started off in California in 2004 , it is now just east of the Rockies , covering a north - south swathe stretching from Montana ’s border with Canada down past El Paso on the Texas - Mexico border .
By 2013 , it should have reached the north - east coast , and its mission end .

NASHVILLE , March 2 ( UPI ) --
A bill before the Republican - dominated Tennessee Legislature would ban adoptions by unwed couples -- gay or straight .
Supporters of the bill say it would place more children in " traditional " families , while critics say it would leave more children lingering in the state foster care system , The Tennessean newspaper in Nashville reported Monday .
Advertisement
Children in foster care usually have few people waiting to adopt them , said Adam Pertman , who heads the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute , a New York group that works to develop better adoption policies .
" So would it be better for these children to wait for your personal notion of the ideal family to come along , " Pertman said to The Tennessean , " or to put children who need homes into the homes of loving , responsible , stable adults who are willing to parent ? "
The bill was introduced without reference to sexual orientation of adoptive parents after Tennessee 's attorney general concluded in 2007 there was no legal basis in state law for a ban solely on gay couples adopting , the newspaper said .
" We need a martial arts master .
Can we get the Crouching Tiger guy ? "
If you 're concerned about racist casting , look no further .
You'd think by now people would know better , what with the Chuck Norris legends floating around so freely .
A few people who saw our Data.gov design post asked for ways to visualize the data on Data.gov .
As an organization that ’s such a proponent of data not only being free , but also using design to provide context to the data , why do n’t we advocate for data.gov to have visualizations for citizens to make sense of the data ?
We did n’t just leave it out because we did n’t think of it .
We left it out on purpose , along with lots of other feature ideas and concepts .
We think that providing a centralized repository of government data in modern developer - friendly formats is a hard enough problem for government to solve .
Vivek Kundra and his team should be focused on making data available and making it as accessible as possible to people via a small , uniform set of developer friendly formats ( say : JSON , XML , KML and CSV ) .
We think that building a system for delivering that data in those formats across the federal government and building a mechanism for people to report back errors , integrity issues or simply comment on the data is far more important than building visualization tools on top of this data .
Why ?
This chart should explain it :
In short : because other people will do that and probably do it better .
If the goal is to get the data in front of the most eyeballs possible , government should be providing the data in usable formats and focusing primarily on that .
External entities will always give the data more exposure and treatment than government can .
The second reason why government should avoid spending time on adding visualizations or other bells and whistles to Data.gov is because it actually hurts transparency .
Visualizations , like any other form of news product , can be editorial– even inadvertently .
If government puts more of a priority on producing great visualizations and user experience than on providing quality accurate data with a great feedback loop , then it runs a pretty good chance of not adhering to the goal of being actually transparent .
You can see this on Recovery . gov right now .
You get a sense that there ’s a lot of data underneath , but they ’ve spent a lot of time on user - interface development .
Check out , for instance , the agency summary page for the SSA .
Looks great !
Neat Charts !
The raw data tells a different story though .
In this case , the data is powered by spreadsheets available at the bottom of the page .
Open one up and you ’re likely going to see something like this :
So you can see why we ’re significantly less interested in government “ totally nailing ” putting bar charts on a website and far more interested in saying “ hey , eye on the ball !
make the data come out clean , and reliable , and give us a way to tell you when it is n’t . ”

AIG pays $ 450 million in bonuses after bailout RAW STORY
Published : Sunday March 15 , 2009
Print This Email This Ailing insurance giant AIG is planning to give out $ 450 million in bonuses this week to executives who led the firm to a $ 99.3 billion dollar loss in 2008 .
Although AIG has agreed to cut back on multi-million - dollar bonuses for its highest ranking officers , the firm 's lower - ranked employees are still set for a massive pay day .
The bonuses are for staff at AIG 's London subsidiary , AIG Financial Products , which helped trigger the collapse , the Wall Street Journal reports .
The payments have dismayed the US government , which has already given the American International Group $ 170 billion in federal bailout money and now holds an 80 % ownership stake in the company .
According to the Washington Post , after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner phoned AIG Group CEO Edward Liddy to tell him that the payments were unacceptable , Liddy responded with a letter indicating that some restructuring was possible but that the bonuses could not be canceled due to a risk of lawsuits for breaching employment contracts .
Liddy also asserted that a refusal to pay bonuses could prompt an exodus of senior employees , writing , " We cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses -- which are now being operated principally on behalf of the American taxpayers -- if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the US treasury . "
The Post states , however , that the current flap over bonus payments could have been avoided if the administration had been willing " to completely and explicitly nationalize the company " instead of merely taking an equity share .
As Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall notes , " So on the business merits , they 're bankrupt .
But we decide it's in the national interest to prevent formal bankruptcy .
And these sharks -- not everyone at AIG , but the execs that created this mess -- use that as a lever to get paid the money they never would have seen if we'd let ( market ) nature take its course . "

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A 107 - year - old Chinese woman who was afraid to marry when she was young has decided to look for her first husband and hopes to find a fellow centenarian so they will have something to talk about , a Chinese paper reported .
Wang Guiying is worried she is becoming a burden to her aging nieces and nephews since breaking her leg when she was 102 and had to stop doing chores like washing her clothes .
“ I ’m already 107 and I still have n’t got married , ” the Chongqing Commercial Times quoted her saying .
“ What will happen if I do n’t hurry up and find a husband ? ”
Born in southern Guizhou province the child of a salt merchant , Wang grew up watching her uncles and other men scold and beat their wives and often found her aunt crying in the woodshed after an attack , the paper said .
“ All the married people around there lived like that .
Getting married was too frightening , ” she said of an era when Chinese women had few rights and low social standing .
Many also had their feet bound in an excruciating process aimed at making them look more dainty and marriageable .
After Wang ’s father , mother and older sister died , she still shied away from marriage .
Instead she moved to the countryside and survived as a farmer until she was 74 years old and no longer strong enough to work in the fields , the report said .
Her nephew in the booming city of Chongqing then took Wang in , but she is worried he and her other nephews and nieces are too old to take care of her now even the youngest is 60 .
“ My nephews and nieces are getting older and their children are already tied up with their own families and I am becoming more and more of a burden , ” she said .
Local officials have said they are happy to help Wang search for a 100 - year old groom , and suggested her family get in touch with old people ’s homes to find candidates , the paper said .

A sniglet is a word that should be in the dictionary but is n't .
Sniglets are the brainchild of comedian Rich Hall who , with a little help from his friends , wrote a series of books containing sniglets in the mid-eighties .
While Rich Hall invented the word " sniglet " itself , sniglets are actually a long - running popular joke in which people make up their own humorous words to define things or concepts that have no " official " definitions .

CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Nine bodies have been found in a common grave in the desert south of Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , according to Chihuahua state prosecutor 's spokeswoman Daniela Gonzalez .
Police look on as one of the nine bodies found in a common grave near Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , is removed .
Investigators have yet to determine the identities of the seven men and two women found in the grave , Gonzalez said .
They have not released information on how they were killed or how long they have been there .
Juarez , which is across the border from El Paso , Texas , has become one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight both each other and Mexican authorities .
The conflict has made violence increasingly common in Juarez , Tijuana and other Mexican border towns .
Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua , but the situation has been getting worse .
Last month , the city 's chief of police was obliged to quit after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job .
Watch as mayor of Juarez talks about who is responsible for slayings »
Earlier this month , the U.S. Consulate in Juarez specifically warned Americans to avoid an area southeast of the city .
The discovery of the bodies comes as 5,000 Mexican soldiers are descending this weekend on Juarez in an effort to end the violence that has claimed more than 400 lives so far this year .
Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN he is hopeful Operacion Conjunto Chihuahua ( Chihuahua Joint Operation ) will be successful .
" The reality is that the military presence in the last several weeks has caused the violence to subside , " he said .
" We were averaging about 10 murders a week ; and since February 26 , when the troops starting arriving , we have been averaging about one . "
Enrique Torres , spokesman for the Chihuahua Joint Operation , said by Sunday there will be 7,500 military personnel , 2,300 federal police and 1,600 city police working together to patrol the city and aggressively fight the cartels .
" We are launching a full frontal attack " Torres said .
" We will also be tackling other types of organized crime -- money laundering and kidnappings . "
Corruption among the police force has been a major concern to local and international authorities .
Torres said the city has been preparing for a year to " clean up the local police . "
Watch panel discuss escalating drug war »
Already , he said , more than 500 city police officers have been fired because they failed to pass the " trust test . "
As part of the " clean - up , " federal authorities have been requiring officers to take a polygraph test .
To prevent corruption among the just arrived soldiers , Torres said they will be frequently rotated .
" They will only work in the region one to two months and then they will be sent to other parts of the country . "
Ferriz , the mayor , said government officials are doing everything in their power to stop the violence ; they have brought in consultants from Colombia and adapted programs that have proven successful there , such as a civilian corruption watchdog program .
But he explained that a big part of the problem is coming from the north .
" The majority of the weapons used for homicides here have been identified as coming from the United States " he said .
Ferriz said that during a recent raid , local police confiscated two .50 - caliber military - style rifles .
Some weeks later they arrested another man bringing in another .50 - caliber rifle .
" He bought it off the internet in the U.S. , " Ferrez said .
" It is so easy there for organized crime to get access to these types of weapons .
The arms and cash contraband into Mexico from the United States must be stopped . "
Ferriz siad he plans to travel next week to Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers about the security situation in and around Juarez .

When I read Dan Grossman ’s paper , Type - Safe Multithreading in Cyclone , I imagine Dan on a raft in the middle of a tropical cyclone , his threads soaked by the rain , frantically racing to build a shelter .
Maybe a type system can’t protect you from the rain , but it sure can protect you from data races–even if the final product looks a little like a Rube Goldberg contraption .
Cyclone , as it turns out , is a safe dialect of C . Dan ’s goal was to extended Cyclone ’s type system to make it safe in a multithreaded environment .
This is not an easy task in a language that uses pointers and manual memory management .
The ideas are similar to those in the dialects of Java in my previous posts , but the type - theoretical concepts are pretty advanced .
- Locks
A Cyclone lock is a special type parameterized by name .
Defining such entities requires a major type - system tour de force .
Little known notions like “ existential types , ” “ dependent types , ” and “ effect systems ” come into play .
The major point of all this magic is that you want to use lock names without knowing what they are .
You create a Cyclon lock using the following pseudo - syntax :
let lk< λ> = newlock ( ) ;
I ’ll use Greek letters for symbolic lock names ( except for the special name , loc ) , since the author did n’t propose any concrete syntax and , admittedly , never finished the implementation .
What ’s happening behind the scenes is that newlock returns an existential type , which is unpacked into variable lk of type lock_t < λ> .
That variable may , for instance , be passed to a ( generic ) function taking lock_t <λ> .
The beauty of an existential type is that it wo n’t let the client “ guess ” the name of the lock .
The name is totally opaque–there is not even a type for it .
It can only be generated by the system in the call to newlock .
To synchronize a ( possibly compound ) statement , you precede it with sync ( lk ) , where lk is a lock variable ( or an expression that evaluates to such ) .
Continuing the previous example , we may write :
sync( lk ) ++*p ;
which increments the value pointed to by p under the lock lk .
- Ownership
In an OO language , ownership is the key to a race - free type system .
The owner of a given object has to be locked before the object may be accessed .
In a non-OO language , like Cyclone , instead of specifying the owner of data , you specify the lock that protects it .
Since you might not have access to the lock variable when you are declaring data , the symbolic lock name is used instead .
Also , since all references in Cyclon are expressed through pointers , lock annotations are associated with pointers .
( This is again parallel to annotating object references with their owner objects . )
We can now complete the example above with the annotated definition of p :
int *λ p = new 0 ;
The pointer p can only be access when the lock whose name is λ is held .
- Local and Shared data
In Cyclon , thread - local data appear as a special case of shared data .
A special lock name loc and a ( global ) variable nonlock are used to turn off the locking of individual instances .
( Compare this to the dummy owner this Thread in the OO approach . )
Lock names are also used to parameterize functions and structs .
In that case it might be necessary to be able to encode the “ sharability ” of the type .
If the lock type has the kind LS , it actually protects Shared data .
The kind LU , on the other hand , may be Unsharable , i.e. , it could be instantiated with the thread - local loc .
LS is a sub-kind of LU .
The main purpose of “ kinding ” is to ensure that thread - local data can never be shared between threads .
- Example
All this sounds very dry without an actual ( however contrived ) example .
Let ’s start with a simple function inc :
void inc<λ:LU >( int *λ p ; {λ} ) { *p = *p + 1 ; }
The function is parameterized by a lock name parameter λ of the LU kind .
It means that it can be instantiated both in the sharing and thread - local context .
Lock - name variable λ first appears in the declaration of the pointer parameter p .
Data pointed to by p is protected by the lock named λ.
That ’s not telling a lot–every pointer in Cyclon is protected by some lock ( or nonlock ) .
What makes the difference is that the same name λ appears in the effects part of the declaration .
The runtime system keeps track of what locks are being held at any point in the program , and passes this information to every function .
Here , {λ} is an effect that contains one lock name , λ .
In other words , the lock that protects p must be taken before calling inc .
( Of course , other locks might be held too . )
Here ’s an example of how inc may be called from another function , inc2 .
void inc2<λ:LU >( lock_t <λ> plk , int *λ p ; {} ) { sync( plk ) inc( p ) ; }
The effects part of the declaration of in c2 is empty .
No locks need be held before calling it .
But when inc is called , the current effects include the name of the lock specified in the declaration of plk ( the sync section adds λ to the effects ) .
Since the same lock name appears in the declaration of p , the precondition for calling inc is fulfilled .
A struct containing a pointer must also be an existential type .
The actual value of λ is assigned to LkInt when the type is “ packed ” ( created from its constituents ) .
struct LkInt {< λ: LS > lock_t <λ> plk ; int*λ p ; } ;
Here , LkInt ( locked integer ) only makes sense in a sharing context , so λ is of the strictly sharing kind , LS .
That allows LkInt s to be passed between threads .
Here ’s an example of using a pointer to LkInt :
void g<λ:LU >( struct LkInt *λ s ; {λ} ) { let LkInt{ <λ '> . plk=lk , . p=ptr} = *s ; inc2 ( lk , ptr ) ; }
Function g is parameterized by some lock name of the LU kind ( so it may be loc ) .
This lock is used by the callee to lock the LkInt argument s ( λ is present in the callee effects ) .
Now s itself contains a pointer and a lock ( of the LS kind ) .
We get at them by unpacking an existential type–splitting it into constituents and giving them new names , lk and ptr .
The name of lk is λ’.
A shallow copy of s is performed in the process .
We can now call in c2 , which does n’t require any effects , and uses lk to lock and increment ptr .
Finally , all these things come together in the example below :
void f( ; {} ) { let lk< λ> = newlock ( ) ; int *λ p1 = new 0 ; int * loc p2 = new 0 ; struct LkInt * loc s = new LkInt{.
plk=lk , .p=p1} ; spawn ( g , s , sizeof ( struct LkInt ) ) ; inc2( lk , p1 ) ; inc2 ( nonlock , p2 ) ; }
Here ’s the play - by - play :
Function f requires no effects .
requires no effects .
The programmer creates a lock lk with the name λ ( unpacks an existential type returned by newlock ) .
with the name λ ( unpacks an existential type returned by ) .
She creates a pointer p1 to an integer protected by the lock named λ.
to an integer protected by the lock named λ.
Then she creates an unprotected thread - local pointer p2 ( using dummy lock name , loc )
( using dummy lock name , ) She combines the lock lk and the pointer p1 into a struct LkInt .
This is an example of “ packing ” an existential type .
Note that both components must share the same lock name .
( The pointer to LkInt , s , is thread - local–lock name : loc . )
and the pointer into a struct .
This is an example of “ packing ” an existential type .
Note that both components must share the same lock name .
( The pointer to , , is thread - local–lock name : .)
The programmer spawns a thread that executes the function g with the argument s .
The argument is passed by a shallow copy , but deep contents ( the lock and the pointer ) are shared .
In fact they must be shared with the kinding LS ; otherwise spawn would not compile .
This mechanism protects any thread - local data from being shared with a new thread .

This mechanism protects any thread - local data from being shared with a new thread .
While the call to g(s ) executes in parallel , the programmer increments p1 under the lock lk .
Notice that these are the same variables that the other thread operates on .
The shared lock enforces mutual exclusion .

Notice that these are the same variables that the other thread operates on .
The shared lock enforces mutual exclusion .
The increment of thread - local p2 requires no lock , that ’s why dummy nonlock is used .
- Limitations
The biggest limitation of the Cyclon system is that it ’s static .
The association between data and locks is rigid .
That makes several useful idioms impossible to implement .
There is no way to “ move ” data between threads .
You can either pass a pointer together with its lock ( essentially creating a monitor ) , or pass data by value .
The other serious problem is the overall complexity of the system–especially the “ effects ” part .
When effects have to be included and manipulated in generic code things get a little hairy .
Granted , a lot of annotations can be elided –the defaults “ do the right thing ” in most cases .
Still , what remains is asking a lot from an average programmer .
- Conclusion
I would like to thank Dan Grossman for correcting some of my mistakes and explaining a few subtle points .
In my next installment I ’ll describe a more recent race - free extension of C , SharC , which supports a mix of static and dynamic checking .
The Church and the Wages of Sin
The end of faith and fear can only come about when the institutions that promote and use it are exposed for what they really are : parasites .
Parasites prey upon the weaknesses of the host and feast upon its resources and fill it with poison .
Faith is that poison , and fear is the vessel used to transport it .
One of the most frequent users of this vessel is the Roman Catholic Church .
In what is now commonly called “ the post 9/11 era ” many people have become much more aware of the historical realities of the Church in the past .
The Crusades , the Inquisition , the persecution of Jews and “ heretics ” , all of these things have come to the fore in the disparate arenas of popular culture , historical analysis , and perhaps more importantly politics .
None of these issues are the concern of this essay .
I wish to narrow my focus to within the past Century or so , specifically the evolving positions of the Church and its leaders and apologists since Vatican II .
The apologists include those who may not be Catholic , but who also find a reason to defend their essential beliefs .
I believe that this period shows a disturbing trend towards greater abuse of fear as a tool to keep the “ faithful ” in line , and to influence the culture at large .
The Catholic Church today inserts itself into almost every discussion about societal problems and scientific inquiry .
Abortion ,
Stem cell research , evolutionary biology , the Holy See sees fit to share its esteemed opinions and beliefs with the public and with its political representatives .
The Church claims to be the greatest example of human kindness , enlightenment and charity in the world .
It is my contention that the Church is actually one of the worst offenders against human decency and reason in the world today .
According to Friedrich Nietzsche “ Life is at an end where the ‘ kingdom of God ’ begins ” ( twilight of the idols , p. 55 ) .
If you were to ask the dearly departed Karol Wojtyla , nom de plume John Paul II , he would have a much different view .
The Kingdom of God has dominion over our lives , indeed it is our lives .
God is life and therefore there is literally no life without God .
How do the esteemed fathers of the church know this ?
They are told directly because they communicate with the deity on our behalf of course .
His holiness whom - ever - the - old - celibates - decide - is - the Pope also has the unexplainable , and down right amazing ability to infallibly speak on behalf of God .
The problem is not so much that The Church has delusions of grandeur as it uses infantile arguments to justify these delusions .
Translations of translations of translations of esoteric
Hebrew theology and myth are said to be fact by so called experts who made up their minds about what the believe before they ever attempted a serious examination of their holy books .
These “ Theologists ” ( as they like to call themselves ) and their apologists also employ faulty logic to create a foundation of “ reason ” for their odd beliefs .
One of my favorite examples of this religious logic was employed by the conservative Christian Apologist Denesh D’Souza in a debate with the writer Christopher Hitchens .
D’Souza made the ridicules argument that Christians created the concept of Compassion .
He backed up this erroneous declaration by citing the Biblical parable of the prodigal son .
Hitchens tore this argument apart easily by pointing out that the story took place before there were any Christians at all : Jesus had not yet been crucified and St. Paul had not even been born yet .
So D’Souza was undermined by his own belief system !
Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman , who is widely admired for his virtuosic performances and who famously tours with his own custom - altered Steinway , created a furor at Disney Hall on Sunday night when he stopped his recital to announce that this would be his last American appearance -- in protest of the nation ’s military policies overseas .
In a low voice that could not be heard throughout the auditorium , Zimerman , universally considered among the world ’s finest pianists , made reference to Guantanamo Bay and U.S. military policies toward Poland .
“ Get your hands off my country , ” he said .
Then he turned to the piano and played Szymanowski’s “ Variations on a Polish Folk Theme ” with such passion and intensity that the stunned audience gave him multiple ovations .

Earlier , about 30 or 40 people in the audience had walked out after Zimerman ’s declaration , some shouting obscenities .
“ Yes , ” the pianist , known in Poland as “ King Krystian the Glorious , ” answered , “ some people , when they hear the word military , start marching . ”
Zimerman then said that America has far finer exports than its military -- and he thanked those who supported democracy .
He left the stage without further comment and was unavailable Monday .
His manager , Mary Pat Buerkle , told the Associated Press on Monday that Zimerman has talked for the last couple of years about not coming back to the United States “ for a while .
. . .
I do n’t think it ’s appropriate to say it ’s all political . ”

Zimerman has had problems in the United States in recent years , but many in the classical music world thought they were logistical .
Just a week ago , before an appearance in Seattle , Zimerman expressed frustration about the hassle and expense of touring the U.S. with his piano .
Shortly after Sept. 11 , his instrument was confiscated at JFK Airport when he landed in New York to give a recital at Carnegie Hall .
Thinking the glue smelled funny , the Transportation Security Administration decided to take no chances and destroyed the piano .
Since then he has shipped his pianos in parts , which he reassembles by hand after he lands .
To get from city to city within the U.S. , he hires a driver to take the shell of the piano , and he drives another car that holds the precious custom - designed keys and hammers .
Lately , he ’d seemed pleased with the direction the United States has taken .
During a performance Friday at Berkeley ’s Zellerbach Hall , he delighted his Bay Area audience by making sly reference to his approval of Barack Obama in the White House .

But by the time he drove his piano to Los Angeles , Zimerman ’s mood appeared to have darkened .
His remarks , which some in the audience characterized as angry , were the talk of Los Angeles ’ classical music world and its small Polish community Monday .
Deborah Borda , president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic , said that while some patrons were taken aback by Zimerman ’s comments , she did not believe it would affect attendance or fundraising .
“ It was very clear he was speaking for himself , ” she said .
“ We obviously ca n’t censor .
We believe in freedom of expression .
We do n’t use a hook to drag people off the stage . ”
In a spirited range of comments on The Times ’ Culture Monster blog , many praised Zimerman and others said the stage was no place for divisive political speech .
“ Go Zimerman , and take the Dixie Chicks with you , ” said one post , referring to the country music group that in 2003 created a ruckus when a member said they were ashamed President Bush was from Texas .

Others noted that though classical music culture in the United States is among the least overtly political of enclaves , Poland has a long tradition of mixing the political and the musical .
Composer and pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski was Poland ’s third prime minister and is revered in Poland the way the Founding Fathers are here .
“ There is a tradition of Polish pianists being in the middle of political events , ” said Marek Zebrowski , director of the Polish Music Center at USC .
Though Poland gets comparatively little attention in the U.S. , American policy recently has been a hot - button issue in Poland .
Poles were upset about allegations that the CIA held suspected Al Qaeda militants in secret prisons in Poland .
A Polish newspaper mockingly referred to the country as “ the 51st state . ”
Also controversial was a Bush administration proposal to put missile defense facilities there .
Sumi Hahn , a Seattle journalist who interviewed Zimerman earlier this month , said she was not surprised to hear of his outburst .
She said he told her that he had “ very mixed feelings now about America . ”

“ In the past five years , ” she quoted him as saying , “ something happened here that changed the world : a war based on lies .
. . .
So much damage was done worldwide ... and Americans are so unaware . ”
On the other hand , Robert Cole , director of Cal Performances in Berkeley , said he was surprised to hear of Zimerman ’s L.A. comments -- especially because of the lightness that characterized his performance in Berkeley .
Just before playing a Bach partita , Zimerman told his audience it was important to consider the political purpose of a piece of music .
Bach , he told his audience , “ had made a decision to put his piece in a minor key rather than a major one . ”
Perhaps , he said , according to audience members who were there , he did that because there was a leader Bach did n’t like .
Zimerman made an approving reference to Obama and then played the piece , but ended it in a joyful C major instead of a melancholy C minor .

“ The audience loved it , ” said Christina Kellogg , director of public relations at Cal Performances .
“ His playing was brilliant and they broke into huge applause , and he was clearly pleased that the audience was completely with him . ”
Cole said he had breakfast with the pianist last week at a music - themed cafe across the street from the campus .
Zimerman spoke mainly of how exhausting it was to travel with a Steinway .
“ I ’m sorry he ’s not coming back , ” Cole said .
“ He reminds me of Don Quixote .
He ’s on a quest for perfection . ”
Cole added that , from a public relations perspective , it ’s too bad Zimerman had n’t offered his comments about Bach to Los Angeles and saved his fiery political rhetoric for Berkeley .

“ I think he maybe picked the wrong place , ” he said .
“ It would have been less of an uproar here . ”

The volunteers had to judge the beauty of paintings and photos
When it comes to appreciating art , men and women really do think differently , research shows .
While women use both sides of their brain , men only use the right half to judge if a piece of work is beautiful , a team of scientists discovered .
This may reflect the different ways men and women 's minds have evolved - men tend to focus on the big picture while women take in " local " details too .
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports the findings .
Professor Francisco Ayala , from the University of California Irvine , and colleagues asked 10 men and 10 women to judge the beauty of artists paintings and photographs of urban and rural landscapes .
We know for sure that there are differences between the male and female brain
Professor Friedermann Pulvermuller , an expert in brain studies at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit
At the same time , the researchers measured the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brains of the volunteers .
This revealed that both men and women were using a part of the brain associated with spatial awareness , called the parietal lobe .
However , while women used both right and left sides , men used only the right parietal lobe .
The researchers suggest that this is because women are contextualising the information and thinking more about the details of what they are seeing , assessing the position of objects according broad categories , such as " above " or " below " , or " left " or " right " .
The men , they say , are focussing on the overall image using a more precise form of mental mapping .
Evolutionary
And they say the differences may have evolved millions of years ago when early humans became hunter gatherers .
Hunting , traditionally done by men , required a " co-ordinating " ability to track animals accurately while on the move .
A " categorical " spatial awareness was better suited to foraging for fruit , roots or berries , a job mainly carried out by women .
" Women tend to be more aware than men of objects around them , including those that seem irrelevant to the current task , whereas men out - perform women in navigation tasks , " the scientists told PNAS .
" Men tend to solve navigation tasks by using orientation - based strategies involving distance concepts and cardinal directions , whereas women tend to base their activities on remembering the location of landmarks and relative directions , such as ' left from ' , or ' to the right of ' . "
The different ways men and women mapped the world appeared to influence their perception of beauty , they believe .
Professor Friedermann Pulvermuller , an expert in brain studies at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit , said : " This is an interesting study .
We know for sure that there are differences between the male and female brain .
The connections between the two hemispheres is better developed in females generally .
" So the findings are in agreement with what we know , but we would need more work before we could make any firm conclusions . "

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : list - tries - 0.0 - first release
Announcing the first public release of list - tries !
Version 0.0 , woo !
list - tries is a library providing implementations of finite sets and maps for list keys using tries , both simple and of the Patricia kind .
The data types are parametrized over the map type they use internally to store the child nodes : this allows extending them to support different kinds of key types or increasing efficiency .
To get at it , head over either to Hackage or my homepage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/list-tries
http://iki.fi/matti.niemenmaa/list-tries/
It 's Hugs - compliant to boot !
I have n't tested UHC , but I suspect it'd work as well .
I 've tested compilation with both GHC 6.10 releases ; 6.8 should also be fine .
Being at version 0.0 , I 'm happy to get feedback , although I 'm fairly busy with school for the foreseeable future so I can't promise I 'll act on it very quickly .
In particular , the API might be a bit unobvious due to the map type parametrization ( and a bit cluttered due to the strict versions of just about every operation ) , but I hope it 's not much trouble .
I 've actually had this release ready for a while now .
I originally planned to coincide its release with that of GHC 6.10.2 since it needs a new version of ' containers ' to build ( see " Warning " , below ) , but of course ' containers ' was n't updated since the changes that list - tries requires are API changes .
I figured I might as well wait until 6.12.1 , but with some recent buzz regarding tries I decided to just shove it out now , even as a crippled version due to the lack of a new enough ' containers ' .
Warning =======
In order to run properly , list - tries needs a version of ' containers ' that has n't yet been released .
I incorporated a little hack which makes it compile even with 0.2 , but some calls will fail by calling ' error ' : 30 of my 1014 test cases do so .
If you have the latest Darcs version of ' containers ' ( which you probably do if you 're using the GHC HEAD , for instance ) , make sure it 's registered as a 0.3 version and then ask Cabal to build list - tries with the ' - fcontainers03 ' flag .
That way you 'll get a fully - featured version of list - tries !
Unfinished ==========
I had hoped to get some benchmarks out before I released list - tries , to see if there 's still much work to be done with respect to performance ( and if there 's any point in releasing it ) , but I did n't find the time .

Map is largely undocumented , but it 's not meant to be used much anyway so that should n't matter a great deal .
WASHINGTON  The Air Force has begun an investigation into whether an e-mail message from an Air Force commander in Europe directing air personnel under her command to an “ inspirational ” story on a Catholic Web site violated the military ’s official position of religious neutrality .
The commander , Col. Kimberly Toney , who leads the 501st Combat Support Wing in Europe , sent the thousands of air personnel in her wing a message last month recommending that they “ take a few minutes to enjoy the attached video and meet a truly inspirational individual . ”
The video highlighted the life story of Nick Vujicic , now 26 , who was born without arms or legs and who credited his faith in Jesus with helping him overcome his physical limitations .
Some Air Force personnel who watched the video said they believed that it breached the military ’s ban on endorsing particular religious views .
Some viewers said they were even more bothered by articles and commentary on the Catholic Web site , 4 marks.com .
Yesterday brought the expected flood of April Fool ’s jokes , like news that the 188 - year - old Guardian newspaper would be switching from ink to Twitter or that the special ingredient in this week ’s A.V. Club Taste Test was ejaculate .
But sometimes even a good joke can backfire in unexpected ways , and that ’s what happened to the wisenheimers over at ThinkGeek.com , who announced a fake product that it turned out everybody wanted .

Star Wars fans — and they are still legion , despite over 20 years of nonstop setbacks — fondly remember a sequence in The Empire Strikes Back on the planet Hoth , an arid wasteland characterized by deadly sub-freezing temperatures .
In order to save Luke Skywalker from certain death , Hans Solo carves opens the dead carcass of a Tauntaun ( described on the Star Wars “ Wookieepedia ” as an “ omnivorous reptomammal ” that the Rebel Alliance used for transport ) with his Lightsaber and tucks his little buddy inside .
Sure , it stinks to high heaven , but nestled under the Tauntaun ’s thick skin and warm intestines , Luke is saved from a grim fate .
ThinkGeek ’s April Fool ’s joke was the unveiling of the Tauntaun sleeping bag , a plush replica of the beast featuring a “ built - in embroidered Tauntaun head pillow , ” “ a glowing Lightsaber zipper pull , ” and “ the exact synthetic compounds needed to recreate Tauntaun fur . ”
Funny , right ?
Because who would want to sleep inside an animal ’s smelly intestines ?
Answer :
The many , many people eager to fork out $ 39.99 , that ’s who !

In response to the overwhelming demand for this made - up product , ThinkGeek has posted the following :
ATTN Tauntaun Fanatics !
Due to an overwhelming tsunami of requests from YOU THE PEOPLE , we have decided to TRY and bring this to life .
We have no clue if the suits at Lucasfilms will grant little ThinkGeek a license , nor do we know how much it would ultimately retail for .
But if you are interested in ever owning one of these , click the link below and we 'll try !

The famous Pecora Commission of 1933 and 1934 was one of the most successful congressional investigations of all time , an instance when oversight worked exactly as it should .
The subject was the massively corrupt investment practices of the 1920s .
In the course of its investigation , the Senate Banking Committee , which brought on as its counsel a former New York assistant district attorney named Ferdinand Pecora , heard testimony from the lords of finance that cemented public suspicion of Wall Street .
Along the way , the investigations formed the rationale for the Glass - Steagall Act , the Securities Exchange Act , and other ...
Since its introduction in 2003 , the iLife suite has become an integral part of Apple 's sales pitch for the Mac platform .
And as the Mac has evolved , the suite 's makeup has also changed with the times .
iTunes has more or less been made a permanent part of Mac OS X , and so is no longer in the collection .
iWeb was added in iLife ' 06 for creating simple , template - based websites .
And iDVD has been relegated to a quaint anachronism as more and more video is shared and streamed online .
( Indeed , because iDVD has n't received any significant updates since iLife ' 06 — and none at all since iLife ' 08 — we have not reviewed it here . )
In the suite 's 2009 incarnation , all of the iLife apps add numerous small interface tweaks ( except for , again , iLife 's appendix , iDVD ) .
And while the apps continue to integrate with Apple 's MobileMe ( n?e . Mac ) service , there is also added integration with other online services , such as Facebook and Flickr .
All told , the individual apps in iLife continue to make some rather amazing capabilities — sorting and editing thousands of digital images , editing digital video into watchable form , creating and editing great looking websites , or creating ( or learning to create ) music — accessible to mere mortals .
This series of reviews will walk you through the suite , starting with the latest versions of iPhoto and iMovie , and tell you what improved , what stayed the same , and whether you should upgrade .
Software iLife '09 Publisher Apple , Inc. Price $ 79 for single user , $ 99 for 5 - user Family Pack Includes iPhoto 8.0 , iMovie 8.0 , iWeb 3.0 , GarageBand 5.0 , iDVD 7.0.3 System Requirements Mac OS X 10.5.6 Leopard , 1 GB RAM recommended , DVD drive for installation and iDVD
As far as major features improvements , both iPhoto '09 and iMovie '09 are the stars of the collection with the flashiest updates .
Contributing Writer Chris Foresman took both apps for a spin , putting iPhoto 's Faces and Places through its paces .
Assistant Editor David Chartier took the updated iWeb '09 for a spin , wringing the most out of its new Widgets and FTP publishing features .
And Infinite Loop contributer Jeff Smykil poked and prodded at GarageBand '09 .
Though he was critical of GarageBand 's kitchen - sink approach to music , he did find some things to like in its new Magic GarageBand , Music Lessons , and amp and effects modeling .
Like previous versions of iLife , a copy of the suite is installed on all new Macs .
Users with previous versions of iLife can upgrade for the same price as anyone else : $ 79 .
Apple also offers the $ 99 Family Pack , which is licensed to install on five machines in the same household .
Or , if you want the latest iLife and iWork updates , but are still chooglin ' along with Tiger , you can get the $ 169 Mac Box Set , which includes both suites as well as the necessary upgrade to Leopard .
This first installment of our iLife '09 review will cover iPhoto and iMovie , with the iWeb and GarageBand reviews to follow shortly .
i Photo '09
i Photo '09 does n't present a radical departure from its '08 predecessor ; much of the UI and functionality is nearly identical , with many small refinements here and there .
But the new version does boast one major new feature , Faces , which I spent a lot of time experimenting with .
In addition to Faces , iPhoto will also organize images by Places .
The new version also makes it easy to upload albums to Flickr and Facebook as well as MobileMe , and it offers some nice options for slideshows ( though not everyone will be able to take advantage of these ) and making photo books .
Faces
By far the biggest deal in iPhoto '09 is the new Faces feature .
Like Events in iPhoto ' 08 , Faces adds a new logical way to organize your photos .
Originally all photos in iPhoto were arranged by date .
Then Apple added the concept of Rolls — analogous to a film roll , but not limited to 24 or 36 images .
The Rolls feature allowed a more granular arrangement by import session , and each import could be further subdivided into separate rolls .
Then Apple added Events , which refined the roll concept to arrange pictures logically by their associated event .
Faces is a little different , though .
Suppose you want to see all photos of Aunt Martha , regardless of roll or event ?
Faces will do just that .
It uses a facial recognition algorithm , along with some identifying on your part , to sort all your images by who 's in them .
This is the new Faces view in iPhoto '09 .
Each time you import new photos , iPhoto '09 analyzes each image to try to automatically identify faces .
The quality of the automatic recognition is mixed , however .
It can identify faces that are blurry , very small , or partially obscured .
But I found that the algorithm tended to be most accurate when heads are turned mostly toward the camera , upright ( i.e. not tilted ) and take up less than half the frame .
Unfortunately , the images in my library have plenty of faces in profile , tilted compositions , and faces that fill the frame .
And occasionally , the algorithm identified something as a face that was simply a texture or pattern or other non-face detail .
Here I marked the first image of The Woz .
Now his mug is in my Faces database .
Now iPhoto can start to identify images that it " thinks " has Woz in it .
While flipping through images in the " Name " mode , you 'll see the areas that iPhoto has identified as a face .
When you see a face that 's not identified , just click " Add Missing Face . "
This gives you a box you can move and resize to cover the face .
I discovered that the box normally resizes from the center , which some people may find awkward — if so , hold down the Option key while dragging a corner to resize from the corners .
To mark a face that was n't caught by the automated recognition , click " Add missing face " and adjust the box to fit the face .
Once a face is marked , either automatically or manually , you 'll most likely see a tag that says , " unknown face . "
As you begin to tag people with a name , you might see " Is this so - and - so ? " with a check or an ' x ' .
Just click the check if iPhoto guessed right , or the ' x ' if it 's wrong .
If there is just one face , and iPhoto has picked the right name , you can hit " enter " and move on .
Otherwise , click in the tag and type in the name .
As you add names to your list , they 'll begin to auto - complete while typing .
The interface makes what can be a pretty laborious task fairly quick — as long as you take a lot of " normal " pictures .

Now that simultaneous worldwide releases are more common than ever , what 's next ?
Simultaneous theatrical and DVD releases ?
Online release ?
No .
If you 're 20th Century Fox , the next step is to release the movie to outer space .
This Friday , December 12 , The Day the Earth Stood Still will become the world 's first galactic motion picture release .
On the same day that Earthlings get to see Keanu Reeves ' latest movie , that movie will make its way towards a premiere at the Alpha Centauri .
And you thought an IMAX release was impressive .
How are they doing this ?
Fox has hired the Deep Space Communications Network in Cape Canaveral to transmit the entire movie .
The transmission will travel at 186,000 miles per second through space , and the movie can be intercepted and viewed at any point as it makes its way to the Alpha Centauri .
If you happen to be on Mars this Friday , you can watch the movie for free 4 minutes after they beam this thing up .
Beats going to the theaters with all those cell phones and crying babies , right ?
" We are thrilled about beaming this film into space .
This will be our first full length movie transmission .
And what could be more relevant to send into Deep Space than a movie about the Earth 's acceptance of visitors from outer space , " commented Jim Lewis , Managing Director , Deep Space Communications Network .
Because of the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri , any aliens orbiting around the destination would n't get the transmission until 2012 , and it 's going to take an additional 4 years after that for us to receive any replies .
Who knows , maybe in 2016 , NASA would suddenly receive a transmission from space that just says " Four tentacles up ! "
Scary thought : if the Mayans were right and the world ends on 2012 , aliens are going to think that a The Day the Earth Stood Still remake is the most important movie in Earth 's history .

Wovon reden wir in dieser Debatte eigentlich ? =>

Oder : Zahlen und Fakten
( Lieber Leser , der folgende
Text setzt sich mit den Zahlen der Polizeilichen Kriminalstatistik zu Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung auseinander , sollten Sie selber missbrauchsbetroffen sein , dann lesen Sie diesen
Text bitte nur vorsichtig , oder auch gar nicht .. )
Wir waren ja schon einmal auf die polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik des Jahres 2007 eingegangen .
Dabei hatte sich ja schon herausgestellt , dass die Zahlenangaben der Regierung über den Anstieg der Verbreitungsdelikte ( behauptete 110 % ) schlicht falsch ist : die Anzahl Verdachtsfälle für Verbreitung betrug 2872 im Jahr 2007 und 2897 im Jahr 2006 .
Sie ist also mehr oder weniger konstant geblieben .
( es handelt sich dabei wirklich um genau dieselbe Statistik , die auch von der Regierung gerne zitiert wird ! )
( So , jetzt wird es leider unappetitlich )
Bisher ist uns bei der Betrachtung der Statistik ein Punkt entgangen .
Das BKA hat die Statistik der Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung von Kindern sehr genau aufgeschlüsselt .
Im Straftatenkatalog findet sich der Schlüssel :
1316 Schwerer sexueller Missbrauch von Kindern zur Herstellung und Verbreitung pornographischer Schriften § 176a Abs. 3 StGB
Dazu der Absatz 3 des § 176a StGB :
(3) Mit Freiheitsstrafe nicht unter zwei Jahren wird bestraft , wer in den Fällen des § 176 Abs. 1 bis 3 , 4 Nr. 1 oder Nr. 2 oder des § 176 Abs. 6 als Täter oder anderer Beteiligter in der Absicht handelt , die Tat zum Gegenstand einer pornographischen Schrift ( § 11 Abs. 3 ) zu machen , die nach § 184 b Abs. 1 bis 3 verbreitet werden soll .
Es handelt sich also um ziemlich genau die Verbrechen , von denen Frau von der Leyen so gerne schwadroniert : Den sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern um pornographische Schriften zu erstellen .
Also der gezielte Missbrauch von Kindern zum Zwecke der Erstellung dieses Materials .
( Um es gleich mal vorweg zu nehmen : beim sexuellen Missbrauch zur Herstellung und Verbreitung kinderpornographischen Materials ist in über 70 % der Fälle der Täter aus dem näheren Umfeld des Opfers , also bekannt , oder verwandt ! .. mehr dazu aber noch am Ende )
Zum Straftatbestand mit der Ordnungsnummer 1316 gibt es außerordentlich viel Informationen in der o.g. Statistik .
Zuerst wollen wir auf den behaupteten Anstieg dieser Straftaten eingehen : ( Wir danken einem fleißigen Leser für das Erstellen der obigen Statistik ) Diese Zahlen kann man mit der Anzahl aller Straftatbestände ( Fälle ) „ sexueller Missbrauch von Kindern “ ins Verhältnis setzen : Straftaten ( Gruppen ) 2007 2006 Diff.
Proz . AQ 1310 Sexueller Missbrauch von Kindern nach §§ 176 , 176a , 176 b StGB 12.772 12.765 7 0.1 % ~ 82 % 1316 Schwerer sexueller Missbrauch von Kindern zur Herstellung und Verbreitung pornographischer Schriften § 176a Abs. 3 StGB 103 106 - 3 - 2,80 % ~ 89 % Die weitaus meisten (> 99 % ) der Kindern werden also missbraucht , ohne dass jemand dies mit einer Verbreitungsabsicht dokumentiert .
Das sind in der aktuellen Diskussion die weniger prominenten Schicksale .
Reden wir also zuerst von den Opfern : Kinder insges .
Kinder < 6 Kinder 6 bis < 14 Jugendl. alle m. w. alle m. w. alle m. w. alle m. w. 1310 voll .

Bei den Straftaten des sexueller Missbrauchs von Kindern zur Herstellung pornographischer Schriften ( Punkt 1316 ) fällt auf , dass hier fast so viele Jungen wie Mädchen als Opfer betroffen sind .
Die Vermutung liegt nahe , dass dies allgemein bei Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung von Kindern der Fall ist , und dass hier , wegen der vorliegenden Missbrauchsdokumentation , die Dunkelziffer bei männlichen Opfern deutlich geringer ist , als sonst üblich .
( Christian dazu :
Als Junge gehört sexuelle Selbstbestimmung zum Rollenbild , wenn man als Junge sexuell missbraucht wird , oder sich eben missbrauchen lässt ( ! ) , dann ist dies ein Zeichen von Schwäche und kann in eine tiefe Scham münden .. das weibliche Rollenbild hat dagegen Raum für Schwäche ) Nun zu den Tätern ( die leider in der Polizeistatistik , wie auch in der Antwort des Familienministeriums an erster Stelle zu stehen scheinen ) :
insg .
Alleintäter polizeibekannt u. Alkohol 1310 sexueller Missbrauch 10455 9826 94,00 % 4739 45,30 % 888 8,50 % 1316 .zur Herst./ Verbr. 92 70 76,10 % 37 40,20 % 2 2,00 %
In den 10.455 aufgeklärten Fällen sexuellen Kindesmissbrauches waren 9.826 ( 94 % ) mit Alleintätern , in 4.739 ( 45 % ) der Fälle war der Täter bereits als Verdächtiger einer vorherigen Straftat bekannt .
In 8,5 % der Fälle wurde die Straftat unter Alkoholeinfluss begangen .
In 20 Fällen wurde eine Schusswaffe mitgeführt .
Bei den 92 aufgeklärten Missbrauchs - Fällen zur Herstellung pornographischen Materials , handelte es sich in 70 Fällen ( 76 % ) um Alleintäter .
In 37 Fällen ( 40 % ) war der Täter bereits polizeibekannt .
In nur 2 Fällen wurde unter Alkoholeinfluss gehandelt .
Die folgende Tabelle zeigt die Altersverteilung der Tatverdächtigen :
Geschl. alle < 14 14-16 16-18 14-18 18-21 < 21 >21 1310 M 8757 660 921 643 1564 654 2878 5879 1310 W 330 53 25 18 43 18 114 216 1310 Sum .

Zur Übersicht hier nochmals die Altersverteilung der Tatverdächtigen als Diagramm :
Da gibt es aber auch einige Daten , die uns alarmieren sollten : Bei sexuellem Kindesmissbrauch waren über ein Viertel der ermittelten Tatverdächtigen noch unter 18 Jahren alt , über ein Sechstel war sogar unter 16 Jahre alt !
Circa 8 % der Tatverdächtigen waren selber noch Kinder !
Dann bleibt noch die Frage zu klären , in welchem Verhältnis die Täter zu Ihren Opfern standen :
alle verwandt bekannt flüchtig unbek .
ungeklärt 1310 voll .
15084 2929 4915 1200 4978 1053 1310 vers. 851 44 170 84 468 84 1310 insg. 15935 2973 5085 1284 5446 1137 1316 voll .

In über der Hälfte der Fälle war das Opfer mit dem
Täter bekannt oder mit ihm / ihr verwandt , dazu auch folgendes Diagramm : Sieht man von den ungeklärten Fällen ab , dann ist beim sexuellen Missbrauch zur Herstellung und Verbreitung kinderpornographischen Materials in über 70 % der Fälle der Täter aus dem näheren Umfeld des Opfers , also bekannt , oder verwandt ! [ 70 von 99 { =120 - 21} ]
Und gegen diesen Missbrauch im Bekanntenkreis soll jetzt eine Sperre im Internet helfen ?
Wird hier nicht das Leid unzähliger Kinder bagatellisiert , um in Deutschland eine Infrastruktur zu etablieren , die dem Ausblenden beliebiger Inhalte dienen wird ?
Wäre es nicht anstatt dieser unglaublich gefährlichen Symbolpolitik angebracht : Den Opfern echte Hilfe anzubieten ?
echte ?
Die Dunkelziffer bei Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung zu verringern ?
bei Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung zu ?
Die
Täter zu verfolgen , anstatt nur der von ihnen verbreiteten Inhalte ?
zu , von ihnen verbreiteten ?
Den Pädophilen , die unter Ihren Neigungen leiden , durch Therapie helfen keine Täter zu werden ?
, die unter Ihren Neigungen leiden , durch Therapie ?
Unsere Kinder stark zu machen , sodass sie gar nicht die Schwachstellen haben , die Täter benutzen um sich Ihnen zu nähern ?

( Vielleicht wollen Sie ja eine Stunde mit folgendem Post und den dortigen Links verbringen . )
Zur weiteren Information ( auch für die Suchmaschinen , die hier landen ) , die entsprechenden Abschnitte aus dem § 176 des StGB : ( 1 ) Wer sexuelle Handlungen an einer Person unter vierzehn Jahren ( Kind ) vornimmt oder an sich von dem Kind vornehmen läßt , wird mit Freiheitsstrafe von sechs Monaten bis zu zehn Jahren bestraft .
( 2 ) Ebenso wird bestraft , wer ein Kind dazu bestimmt , daß es sexuelle Handlungen an einem Dritten vornimmt oder von einem Dritten an sich vornehmen läßt .
( 3 ) In besonders schweren Fällen ist auf Freiheitsstrafe nicht unter einem Jahr zu erkennen .
( 4 ) Mit Freiheitsstrafe von drei Monaten bis zu fünf Jahren wird bestraft , wer 1 . sexuelle Handlungen vor einem Kind vornimmt , 2 . ein Kind dazu bestimmt , dass es sexuelle Handlungen vornimmt , soweit die Tat nicht nach Absatz 1 oder Absatz 2 mit Strafe bedroht ist , 3 . auf ein Kind durch Schriften ( § 11 Abs. 3 ) einwirkt , um es zu sexuellen Handlungen zu bringen , die es an oder vor dem Täter oder einem Dritten vornehmen oder von dem
Täter oder einem Dritten an sich vornehmen lassen soll , oder 4 . auf ein Kind durch Vorzeigen pornographischer Abbildungen oder Darstellungen , durch Abspielen von Tonträgern pornographischen Inhalts oder durch entsprechende Reden einwirkt .
( 5 ) Mit Freiheitsstrafe von drei Monaten bis zu fünf Jahren wird bestraft , wer ein Kind für eine
Tat nach den Absätzen 1 bis 4 anbietet oder nachzuweisen verspricht oder wer sich mit einem anderen zu einer solchen Tat verabredet .
( 6 ) Der Versuch ist strafbar ; dies gilt nicht für Taten nach Absatz 4 Nr. 3 und 4 und Absatz 5 .
( Eigentlich ist es schon interessant , das hier also der Versuch ein Kind für sexuellen Missbrauch anzubieten nicht schon strafbar ist ! )

About the Author
Every time I told people in suits and ties - or my parents - I was in the game business , they started to talk about kids .
They viewed our business as the toy business .
Games are for children .
This was when I pulled out my silver bullet .
I had The ESA 's ( then IDSA ) latest report showing the average age of gamers .
I started when it was 27 .
The " average age " went up a year each year , but was still a neat statistic when I could say 30 or 31 .
Whether it was directed at a school parent or an audience at a conference ,
It inevitably led to a dropped jaw and a " wow , I did n't know that . "
The industry instantly became relevant to their business .
I have n't really paid much attention to this number because my proselytizing for the business was taken over by outlets like the Wall Street Journal , Newsweek and USA Today , which all have a larger reach than this blog or my speaking engagements .
But this past week I saw some slides for an ESA speech indicating the average age of a gamer has risen to 35 , or roughly , the median age of the US population .
I suppose reaching this point was inevitable , but in the back of my mind , I always thought the aging would slow down .
At some point it would have to reflect the disproportionate number of people under 25 playing games .
After all , our consumer used to be younger than the median age of the population , and you would think , like the movie business with an average age a full 3 years younger , our product would appeal disproportionately to the demographic universally recognized as more likely to spend money .
Those of us who have aged out of the 18 to 35 focus of media can appreciate the dwindling selection of interesting product coming from savvy media channels who know how to make laser focused offerings for the most lucrative segment of the market .
We are relegated to the " Bye Bye Birdie " lament of " Kids these days " when considering the most popular content in every media but our own .
I know its an old reference , that 's how our kids feel about our stuff .
It would be great to say we are not " our father 's games " but when looking at the most recent offerings to my thirteen year old son and the upcoming blockbusters - Street Fighter IV , Resident Evil 5 , Tom Clancy 's latest kill the foreigners , The Godfather 2 , WWE Smackdown 286 , Final Fantasy 15 or so , even Guitar Hero with Metallica and other songs that were old when I tried to find a dance partner in junior high , followed by this year 's big excitement The Beatles - I realize they ARE his father 's games .
Over the course of twenty - five years we got really good at making games for gamers .
We taught them how to play and what they should pay and then followed them through the market .
Our planning stages focus on what they will buy , and if we can't confirm they will buy it with a high degree of certainty , we do n't make the product .
The games are so tailor made to the desires and skills of these gamers , they are about as easy for mainstream consumers of entertainment to crack as ancient Mandarin dialect .
No one wants to work for their entertainment .
There was a time , not so long ago - last cycle - when this audience was enough .
A one million seller was extremely profitable .
Two million had publishers doing cart wheels .
Anything more had them taking money out in wheelbarrows .
Today , two million is break even .
Before it was nice to tap into a little itty bitty corner of the mainstream with something like GTA , Halo or Tomb Raider .
Now it is imperative for our own survival .
Our aging consumer , steady tie ratio , and consistent unit sales numbers across generations of console indicates our business is not really growing the way it could , should or has to .
The initial ship of this year 's Street Fighter IV was the same size as the initial ship of Tomb Raider 2 eleven years ago .
In other words , we are not exceeding the patterns established by prior console generations .
Like the movie industry touting box office growth when all they do is raise ticket prices , we are enjoying relative unit growth as a function of generation growth in the installed base , rather than growth in the number of game consumers .
Worse yet , our audience is aging .
An aging audience means less dollars spent .
The Wii has the lowest number of consumers in the 18 to 24 demographic , and it also has the lowest tie ratio among the platforms .
A precious few companies float product over a consistent demographic , but not many .
Look at the handoff of Nickelodeon to MTV to VH1 .
They can give a shit less about maintaining their audience after 14 or 24 , respectively .
If you are my age , you know what I mean .
One day every show on the channel is great , and then the next you seem to be enjoying VH1 a lot more .
It 's like something invaded your brain while you were asleep and made everything on the channel repellant .
MTV just does n't care .
We were their first audience , but from my point of view , there is not a single intelligible note left on the channel .
If you are under 30 you do n't have to believe me .
Just wait a few years and you will see what I mean .
The result , MTV Networks continue to go great guns and generate revenue .
Unfortunately , we seem to be falling in the category of the majority of industries with loyal consumers .
The only open question is whether today 's publishers will adapt or die .
When the movie business encountered a similar issue in the late 1960's .
This was a time when Clint Eastwood was starring in the musical Paint Your Wagon and Francis Ford Coppola was directing another musical , Finian 's Rainbow .
The studios completely lost touch with their audience .
MGM paved the way to film success with musicals in the fifties .
The studios cultivated this audience and continued to provide content to the same audience , as the audience aged and stopped going to movies .
The younger audience just did n't care .
Films were expensive to make and audience growth was flat .
The studios were taking guidance from the past rather than looking to the future .
They were recreating the films they grew up on and expecting a new audience .
Then , all of a sudden , almost by accident , and outside the system , Easy Rider slipped out .
The film cost nothing and made a fortune by attracting a young audience .
It gave the studios a much needed kick in the ass .
They realized the system was broken and reengineered the pipeline from production through release .
The new production process opened the door for an inexperienced crowd fresh out of film school - Steven Spielberg , George Lucas , Jon MIlius , Martin Scorcese to name a few .
Their type of movie did not bet the farm on every production , allowing for greater risk with each product .
The distribution process , arising from Jaws , created the blockbuster .
Rather than rolling a movie slowly across the country and letting the audience find it through word of mouth , they started to market movies aggressively so people would know they were in the theater .
As a result of the changes , the audience , number of revenue streams and overall market grew ( this is an extremely truncated version of history .
If you are interested take a look at this books about Lew Wasserman Sony and of course Easy Riders , Raging Bulls ) .
Sure they have their issues today , but we are looking at the end of a single cycle that is longer than the entire life of our industry .
The US auto industry , so far , has not been so lucky .
There was a time when Cadillac was the " Cadillac " of cars .
From the forties to the seventies it was the epitome of luxury , technology and status .
General Motors jealously guarded the jewel in its crown and maintained its status at the top of the GM aspirational hierarchy .
But when it came to design , Cadillac was so concerned about alienating its core user base , it maintained styling cues and appointments well beyond their relevance .
This strategy maintained their audience for 30 years , but that is all they did .
As the group aged , the younger market was wide open for competition from all around the world .
Worse yet , as the average age creeped up the older side started to die off , shrinking the market size .
Ultimately the company realized it would need to take a risk because their customers were dying .
It started selling trucks and jettisoned the old branding to focus on performance .
A large portion of the audience ended up staying and the average age of the Cadillac consumer fell from 64 in 2000 to 56 in 2008 .
Turns out my Grandfather did n't really care about the change from Sedan DeVille to DTS and new buyers like the 600 horsepower CTS .
Still a far cry from the 42 year old average consumer of BMW , but a very positive move .
The entire industry down and it is still too early to tell whether the strategy save the company , but it certainly moved the 107 year old company in the right direction .
I do n't believe either of these examples provide a roadmap for sustaining our industry .
However , they do provide effective warnings about complacency and fetishistic attachment to existing consumers .
We have to start taking risks again .
We are not at the point of drastic Cadillac - like measures , but there should be a risk component in publisher portfolios .
The gap between the sub USD one million XBL / PSN downloadable and USD 20 million console game is to great to have nothing in between .
Traditional publishers ' relevance and the premier creators of interactive entertainment is under attack by movie studios , Miniclips type sites , DVD games , Facebook apps and other social network games and a ton of others .
They are using the same game mechanics and the same hooks we abandoned years ago in favor of the pursuit of " advanced technology . "
The audience is being conditioned to pricing models that do n't demand up front investments of USD 60 or monthly subscription fees .
It is not just a question of a simple interface change .
The Wii mote led the horse to water , but so far they are not drinking .
We need end to end revisions .
Changes in production marketing and pricing .
We can continue to believe EA , Actard , Microsoft and Sony will always dominate the market operating business as usual - kind of like MGM and Cadillac - or we can look to new audience segments and determine how we can make the changes needed to remain relevant .
If we do n't I am afraid my son's generation will view today 's games as the new polyester shirt .
I ’ve gotten it at last : a shortbread recipe that is light , crumbly , buttery , flavorful , and not something that is best purchased in a red tartan Walker ’s box .
Shortbread has been something of a culinary nemesis for me for a while .
I would play with my own recipes for it in the kitchen , and they were always off .
One was too floury , one too much butter .
One time , I cleverly pressed my lovely dough into my tart pan dreaming of a buttery round cut into wedges .
Well , I should have known that my pan was 11 ″ , not 9 .
The result was more like a toffee candy than a crumbly cookie .
Meh .
Tonight , though , I decided to try again .
I had some brown sugar that just needed to be gone , and some cornstarch as well .
I ’ve got to get those cabinets vacated .
Plus , I had quite wanted cinnamon brown sugar shortbread the last time I had a kitchen disaster .
I checked my notes from all my shortbread disasters , and began tweaking the last recipe .
Tonight , I can say with confidence , “ We have success ! ” And , this shortbread can easily accommodate veganizing by substituting Earth Balance for the butter .
Please , make these cookies .
They are lovely served with a nice English tea .
You could make two batches for entertaining , or one for delightful snacking .
I have a feeling these are n’t going to last very long at all .
Cinnamon Brown Sugar Shortbread
1 /4 C brown sugar
1/4 C white sugar
1/2 C butter ( one stick ) cut into pieces
1 C flour
1/4 C cornstarch
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp cinnamon
pinch of salt
Cream together the butter and the sugar .
Add the remaining ingredients and continue to mix until the dough is well combined , and shaped like small peas .
At this point , I like to get my hands into the dough and blend it , pressing it into a ball .
When the dough is in a cohesive ball , freeze the dough for 15 minutes .
Grease an 8×8 baking pan .
Press the dough into the pan .
Try to get it as even as possible .
If you have a mini rolling pin , that will help you immensely .
Pop the dough back in the freezer for another five minutes , since the pressing will soften the butter again .
Preheat your oven to 350º .
Before baking , dock the dough all over with a fork to allow steam to escape .
Bake the dough for 25 - 35 minutes .
The dough should not puff up , spread out , have butter pooling on the top , or brown .
Remove from the oven when done and sprinkle with granulated sugar .
Let cool on a wire rack for 15 - 2o minutes before cutting .
Makes 16 shortbread fingers .
The Icelandic Free State by Loren Cobb
As I write this it has been snowing steadily for three days , and the world outside is white beyond white .
My cat and I are gathered warm around the hearth , thinking about another cold and snowy place one thousand years in the past : the Free State of Iceland .
Here is the story .
In the year 866 Norway was little more than a collection of small coastal kingdoms , smaller chiefdoms , and individual farms , the whole united only by common traditions and language .
The richest agricultural lands of Norway were in Vestfold , a coastal zone to the west of Oslo .
Harald Fairhair , proud King of Vestfold and beneficiary of its agricultural riches and shipbuilding prowess , began in that year to unify of all Norway under his rule .
Monument to the Battle of Hafrsfjord , by the sculptor Fritz Røed .
In this Harald was merely continuing a centuries - old European expansion of feudal powers to every corner of the continent , but to the independent farmers of Norway , who had never owed fief or paid land tax to anyone , the sudden arrival of royal tax collectors came as a rude shock .
By ancient custom and law , the independent landowners of Norway owned their land in allodial title , free of any tax or feudal service obligation .
They were n't about to give up those rights without a fight .
As told in the Heimskringla saga of Iceland , Harald 's ships defeated the assembled forces of all the petty kings in a naval battle at Hafrsfjord .
In the climax of the battle the great berserker Thor Haklang laid his ship alongside King Harald's , and the fighting was hand - to - hand between the king 's men and crazed berserk warriors clad only in wolfskins .
Thor Haklang fell on that day , and all of Norway soon fell under iron - fisted feudal rule .
For each province in his new kingdom , Harald appointed a jarl to give judgments at law , to impose fines , to collect taxes , and to raise an armed militia .
As told and retold in scores of Icelandic sagas , there were many landowners who could not accept the new legal and social order .
Beginning in the 880s , a Norwegian diaspora began .
Disgruntled farmers and chieftains outfitted ships , then rounded up their cattle , wives , slaves , and retainers , and set sail for freedom in the outlying islands of the Viking realm : the Færoes , the Shetlands , the Orkneys , the Hebrides , and above all , Iceland .
Iceland : The New Frontier
Not much at all was known about Iceland in those days , other than that it was empty , fertile , and very remote .
The island had been discovered in 850 by a Viking ship that was blown off course , but the first permanent settlements began only in 874 .
Given their twin needs for freedom and distance from King Harald , it was almost ideal for the families of the Norwegian diaspora .
A land rush ensued .
As recorded in the Icelandic Landnámabók ( " Book of the Land Taking " ) , farming families by the hundreds set sail for Iceland , each hoping to find and claim a place in some secluded fjord where they could disappear from tax collectors and feudal jarls forever .
The earliest settlers claimed enormous tracts , but they were accused by later settlers of taking too much .
In the end King Harald himself set the rule : no man could take possession of an area larger than he and his crew could carry a cauldron of fire across in a single day .
There was a different rule for a female head of household : she could take only as much land as she could walk around from dawn to sunset on a spring day , while leading a two - year - old well - fed heifer .
At least one woman , Aud the Deep - Minded ( Auðr Ketilsdóttir ) , laughed at that rule and claimed a huge spread .
By 930 all useful land had been claimed , and the era of the land - taking was over .
How to Govern ?
The great question for the new nation was how to set up a government that freedom - loving Icelanders could tolerate .
They wanted a society with no king , no jarls , no sheriffs , no jails , no taxes , no feudal obligations whatsoever .
What did that leave ?
Was it even possible ?
The Icelanders ' answer had elements of genius ; it survived peacefully and successfully for more than three centuries at a time when the rest of Europe was convulsed with wars , crusades , mass migrations , famines , and troubles without end .
An essential and unique feature of Icelandic society in those times was the complete absence of towns and villages .
Each farm stood by itself as a self - contained economic and social unit , consisting of the farmer and his wife and children , their unmarried relatives , foster children , slaves , employees , and indigents living under the protection of the farmer .
Every farmer kept the peace within his domain , insofar as he was able , but disputes between farmers required something further , some social mechanism for conflict resolution that did n't act like an overbearing feudal lord .
Icelandic society of one thousand years ago did not use writing .
History was entirely oral , in the form of sagas that were repeated over and over as evening entertainment around the central hearth of the long houses .
The many laws of the land were memorized word for word ; in fact one of the principle duties of the leader of the legislature  the " law - speaker "  was to recite one third of the laws every year at their annual meeting .
It was a very litigious society , despite the absence of written law  everyone , it seemed , knew every wrinkle and detail of the law by heart , and played the angles for their best advantage .
Every famous legal case that established a precedent or revealed a defect in the law quickly became the subject of its own saga , and in that way became known to everyone .
The annual meeting of representatives of all the people of Iceland , known as the althing , was established in 930 for the purpose of reviewing and amending laws , and hearing disputes and accusations .
Thus the althing was simultaneously a legislature and a court of law .
A person could be found guilty of a capital crime at the althing , but by design the althing lacked any public officials empowered to apprehend or execute an outlaw .
Instead , the outlaw had to be captured and killed by private citizens  which in practice meant the family and friends of the injured party .
By eliminating the role of peace officer , the law of Iceland in effect regulated and gave legitimacy to the blood feud .
It was an astonishing experiment .
Privatized Justice Icelanders quickly recognized that some farmers were much better than others at handling religious matters , working with the law , and mediating disputes .
Even before the althing was established , such a farmer was known as a goði , or chieftain ( literally , speaker for the gods ) .
When the althing was founded the number of chieftains in all Iceland was limited by law to just 39 .
Although they were chieftains in origin , these were the people who gradually became the representatives of the people at the althing .
At the same time , a chieftaincy became a private possession that was normally inherited from father to son ( women were ineligible ) , or it could be sold , given as a gift , or shared among several farmers .
Site of the medieval Althing .
The rock wall
acted as a natural amplifier for voices .
Chieftains were not elected in formal elections , but the weight and influence of a chieftain at the althing depended critically on the number of Icelanders who declared that he was their representative .
Every free Icelander had to select a chieftain to represent him ; in doing so he became one of the chieftain 's thingmen .
An incompetent chieftain would lose thingmen , and his chieftaincy would rapidly lose value .
Finally he would either give it away , or share it with someone more competent .
Thus the people were represented in the althing in a way that was , in the end , democratic  even though the chieftaincy itself could be bought and sold at will .
To obtain the support of a chieftain and all of his thingmen in a dispute , an Icelander first needed to convince him to take the case .
Depending on the complexity of the dispute , and the potential dangers involved  no dispute in Iceland was ever free of physical danger  the chieftain would propose a price for his assistance .
This price was customarily high , unless the petitioner was a close friend or relation of the chieftain .
Support , mediation , and justice could be purchased , but only if you were willing and able to pay the price .
Their system was set up so as to give disputants a powerful incentive to settle disputes quickly , usually with one party offering to pay the other a settlement .
If that failed , then each party would attempt to enlist the aid of a chieftain to represent him in mediation , or before the althing .
If either of the disputants failed to find a chieftain , or did n't like the decision that the mediator or the althing offered , then his or her final recourse under the law was physical violence , either a formal duel or a deadly attack ( which had to be preceded by a public announcement ) .
The ever - present threat of deadly violence served as a further incentive to all parties to agree to a settlement , but the demands of medieval honor occasionally outweighed any possible monetary compensation .
The Icelandic sagas are replete with the tragic stories of multigenerational blood feuds that began with a simple disagreement among parties too stubborn or too concerned about their honor to agree to a financial settlement .
The End of the Free State Iceland lived at peace under the unwritten constitution of the Free State for 300 years , from 930 to about 1230 , with little social disruption and what seems to have been a very low level of serious crime ( at least by medieval standards ) .
The powers of the chieftains were strictly limited by the farmers and the power of the althing .
It was not until 1230 that any strongman or warlord or feudal jarl could establish a foothold  and this was not for lack of trying !
There are many theories about the decline of the Free State , but in the end I think it was brought down by two influences that seemed harmless or actually beneficial at the time : a growing economy and the medieval Christian church .
At inception , and for at least a century thereafter , Iceland was extremely poor .
The agricultural surplus was razor thin , and famines were frequent .
Other than a small supply of coins from Europe , there was no money : woven cloth served as a medium of exchange in the place of coinage .
In the 11th century things began to improve , and by the 13th the richest landowners had sufficient financial resources to seek additional power within the political system .
Some became storgoðar  strong chieftains  who were able to buy and control other chieftains , to raise private militias , and to reach out for support to the King of Norway .
Their armed struggles for power and influence created chaos beyond anything that the constitution had been designed to handle .
An earlier crisis , equally threatening to the Free State , had occurred in the year 1000 .
Christianity had appeared in Iceland , just as in other parts of Scandinavia , and many new converts wanted the althing to declare the entire island to be Christian .
King Olaf of Norway threatened to cut trade relations with Iceland if the island did not convert .
A civil war could have resulted , but the full power of the althing 's conflict mediation system was brought to bear on the dispute .
In the end both sides agreed to abide by the decision of one man , Thorgeir Thorkelsson , the law - speaker of the althing .
He was himself a follower of the ancient Æsir pagan faith , but with many ties of blood to the Christian community .
After great internal struggle , Thorgeir ultimately chose to commit all Iceland to the new Christian religion .
This was the Free State 's first severe test , which it survived without descending into a ruinous civil war .
At first the new Christian Church of Iceland had little supervision or influence from continental Europe .
In the year 1096 the althing made a critical mistake : it granted to the Church the right to collect a tax for its support .
From its humble beginning as a small collection of chapels built and owned by individual farmers , the Church gradually acquired ownership of vast lands , wealth , and properties .
With property and wealth came power and influence , despite legal restrictions and secular control by the althing .
By the 13th century the Church had become a powerful advocate for introducing the feudal system into Iceland .
Church leaders gave King Haakon IV of Norway an opening to political influence .
It was all he needed .
By 1262 the althing concluded that it could neither suppress the armed battles occurring between the new warlords , nor control the Church .
The only power they could see that could dominate both was the Norwegian crown .
Public meetings were held in every local thing with royal representatives , to lay out the options .
After several years of agonized discussion , the people of Iceland authorized their althing to make a petition to King Haaken to take over sovereignty of the state , to enforce peace among the warlords , and to counterbalance the power and wealth of the Church .
Thus ended history 's first and perhaps only experiment in governing a democratic state with no executive , no armed forces , no police or prosecutors , and no governmental services of any kind .
Lessons ?
The fate of the Icelandic Free State suggests to me that an isolated libertarian society can thrive for centuries with a constitutional democracy but no executive power whatsoever  until it grows too rich , or allows any group to become too powerful .
Such a society appears to be stable as long as it is relatively poor and isolated , but that stability apparently declines with increasing economic surplus and closeness to the outside world .
It may also be true that the stability of a purely libertarian political system vanishes when any significant non-state center of power emerges , grows rich , and throws off its controls .
Of course , non-state power centers are dangerous for any form of government , not just libertarian .
One of the symptoms of a failing state is the appearance of heavily - armed militias and private armies , as we have seen in Afghanistan and Somalia .
Modern democratic societies protect themselves from violent overthrow by maintaining a state - owned monopoly on organized deadly force : the armed forces and the police .
The stability of the modern democratic state is found in the dynamic balance of powers between the armed forces , the executive , legislative , and judicial branches , and the free press .
When this dynamic balance fails , then police states and military dictatorships arise .
The Icelandic Free State ultimately failed for lack of an executive backed by a monopoly on organized deadly force .
The althing and its institution of justice  the regulated blood feud  proved too weak to overcome the gathering strength of armed and ruthless private militias , not to mention a rich and influential church .
Those of us who work for peace throughout the world should contemplate the example of the Icelandic Free State with great care and attention .
What social and spiritual institutions  and what kind of dynamic balance of powers  will be needed to preserve democracy and to prevent war and oppression , in a world overflowing with economic and military powers ?

Somalia is not a good example of a failed state .
Somalia has been governed for many centuries by clans .
A clan does not claim to have a monopoly over territory , although a clan will own land .
Everyone must belong to a clan , or else be a guest of a clan .
Each clan has its own set of laws , called Xeer .
Theory predicts  and practice shows  that these laws will be mostly identical .
When you try to impose a monopoly government over this clan structure , the clans are constantly trying to break through .
If the government is a dictatorship , the dictator will belong to a clan , and he will run the government for the benefit of his clan .
If the government is socialist , the people who do the central planning will belong to a clan , and will plan for the benefit of their clan .
If the government is democratic , each clan will run a member for office , and the numerically - superior clan will win and ( you guessed it ) run the government for the benefit of his clan .
The " heavily - armed militias " and " private armies " are clan militias .
The clans have rules for interactions between clans ( interestingly , men are encouraged to marry a woman from another clan , and the woman is expected to change alligiance to her new clan ) .
However , if you have someone trying to monopolize the government , they can play one clan off against another .
Usually this does not work , because there are enough clans to be able to gang up on any two clans that try to work together to oppress the other clans .
However , if the group trying to monopolize government is able to bring in outside resources , it is possible that they could succeed in their manipulations .

Your quotation from the Njal Saga ( " With law , the land shall be built ; without law , the land shall be laid waste ... " ) is most appropriate .
When the saga begins law is based on mediation by chiefs and trials at the Althing .
However , by pagan law one could always challenge an opponent to trial by combat .
Thus , it worked out that justice was merely rule by the strongest .
Gundar represented the best that pagan society could offer .
He was a mighty warrior , but just and honorable .
He married badly  a woman as strong - minded and independent as he was  so he was constantly making peace for the quarrels she provoked with Njal 's equally strong wife .
But Gundar died in a feud , his wife refusing to give him strands of her hair to repair his broken bowstring .
Njal died , too , his home burned over his head .
If Gundar could not make the pagan system work , nobody could .
It was morally bankrupt .
Christianity brought fundamental reforms , and peace came with it .
When the church became corrupt , that was later , and later the Icelanders eagerly adopted the Lutheran church ( and , unfortunately , also the austere clothing and narrowness of belief ) in an effort to reclaim local control .
One generation 's solutions may not work for all time , but those who can learn from the past should be able to understand why they have inherited the system they have , and to realize that it is never easy to make any system work .
The saga is a great read , especially if you read it aloud .
The narrative is compelling , but not for anyone who attempts to skim it .
A saga is like Christianity , not enjoyable for those who do not take it seriously , but powerful for those who do .
 William Urban , Monmouth , Illinois ( Peoria - Galesburg MM )
Reply : I think you may be conflating the institution of religion with the institution of justice .
The pagan religions ( plural ) of Europe were not tied to any one system of justice , any more than Christianity was .
Indeed , the medieval Christian church developed its own system of ecclesiastical courts , different from the Roman , Common Law , and Germanic systems of justice .

Loren I think you left out a critical point about Iceland 's conversion to Christianity .
While it was up to one man , a critical deciding factor was that Christian Norway was going to sever trade with them if they did not convert .
So the conversion was n't so much about religion but economics .
Even after they converted , the Icelanders were allowed to keep some of their pagan practices of exposing infants and eating horsemeat in a sort of " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
Wikipedia has an article : Christianization of Iceland .

Thanks for the correction !
I have revised the essay accordingly .

Thanks for the interesting article about a fascinating place and time period , but I am perplexed by the references to the Iceland free state period as having a constitution .
My understanding is that Iceland had no consitution until the 19th century .
The first Law Speaker was sent to Norway to learn the Norwegian code of law and he ( and subsequent law - speakers ) were tasked with reciting a third of the law at each session of the Althing .
They were not reciting a constitution , but a code of law , though under the circumstances there may be little difference .

Thanks for pointing out this ambiguity .
I have revised the text to make it clear that I was referring to an unwritten constitution .
Aristotle defined constitutional laws as those that govern " the arrangement of the offices of the state " , and that is the definition that I prefer .
 Loren I read with great interest your letter on the Icelandic Free State .
It 's a fascinating history that raises provocative questions about capitalism , democracy , libertarianism , and religion , and the political and social lines that connect them all .
One point puzzles me :
You state , " In the end King Harald himself set the rule : no man could take possession of an area larger than he and his crew could carry a cauldron of fire across in a single day . "
This implies that Harald had some control , or at least influence , over the Norwegians who settled Iceland .
However , I can find nothing of that relationship in your narrative .
Thanks again for a wonderful saga .
 Carey Horwitz Reply :
It is true that King Harald had no legal or political control over the Icelanders , but they still looked to Norway for many things , including trade , coinage , religion , and culture .
Norway was in every way their " mother country . "
I do n't know the details , but I suspect that word got back to Harald that there was some strife in Iceland over the amounts of land that were being taken .
My guess is that he simply put out the word within Norway that anyone planning to emigrate to Iceland should follow some suggested rules .
Since Aud the Deep - Minded arrived in Iceland from Ireland , she might not even have known about the rules , or felt bound by them even if she had .
She had been married to the King of Dublin , a Viking named Olaf the White .
After he was killed she emigrated with her surviving children and considerable treasure , first to the Orkneys , then to the Færoes , and finally to Iceland .
Part of her story is told here .

Why seastead ?
All land on Earth has been claimed ; the ocean is humanity ’s next frontier .
The world needs a place where those who wish to experiment with building new societies and new technology can go to test out their ideas .
Currently , it is very difficult to experiment with alternative social and governance systems on a small scale ; countries are so enormous that it is hard for an individual to make much difference .

( CNN ) -- Three Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , police officers were shot to death while responding to a 911 call of a domestic argument triggered by a urinating dog , according to a criminal complaint filed in the case .
Law enforcement from several jurisdictions respond to a shooting standoff at Pittsburgh home Saturday .

The officers were the first department fatalities since 1995 , according to the department .
Police said following the shootings Saturday that Richard Poplawski , 22 , would be charged with three counts of homicide , aggravated assault and other charges .
Poplawski , who was shot in the leg during a four - hour standoff with police , was hospitalized at an undisclosed location , police said .
Details of the incident were included in the police complaint seeking an arrest warrant for Poplawski .
The complaint says Margaret Poplawski called 911 about 7 a.m.
Saturday to report that her son was " giving her a hard time . "
Watch officers respond at the scene »
She told police she awoke to discover that " the dog had urinated on the floor , " and awakened her son " to confront him about it . "
The two had an argument , and Margaret Poplawski told her son she was calling police to remove him from her home , according to the complaint .
When officers Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III arrived , she opened the door and let them in .
" Mrs. Poplawski reported that as the officers entered approximately 10 feet into the residence , she heard gunshots , turned and saw her son about six feet away with a long rifle in his hands , at which point she fled downstairs after asking him , ' What the hell have you done ? ' " the complaint said .
Margaret Poplawski reported she stayed in the basement during the standoff , and heard her son yell , " Yeah , I 've been shot , " and " I 'm standing down , come in and help me , " according to the complaint .
Police Chief Nathan Harper identified the dead officers as Eric Kelly , Mayhle and Sciullo .
Kelly was a 14 - year veteran of the department ; the other two had worked there for two years each .
Watch prayers for fallen officers »
The chief said Sciullo was the first to approach the home , and was shot in the head as he entered the doorway .
When Mayhle tried to help his fellow officer , he also was shot in the head .
Kelly arrived at the scene and was shot before he could aid the other two officers , Harper said .
Harper said the suspect fired from a bedroom window , shooting at an armored vehicle carrying a SWAT team -- preventing those officers and medics from reaching the wounded policemen .
Two other officers , Timothy McManaway and Brian Jones , were injured .
McManaway was shot in the hand and Jones , who was trying to secure the rear of the house , broke his leg trying to get over a fence , Harper said .
Rescue units from other jurisdictions also were met with gunfire , the chief said .
McManaway told police he responded to the scene after a report that officers were being fired upon , according to the complaint .
As he arrived , he saw that Kelly was " lying supine " by his personal SUV , as Kelly had just completed his shift and apparently was on his way home when he responded to help the other officers .
Kelly raised his arm for help , and McManaway said he ran to Kelly , who was wounded and said he could not breathe .
As he was trying to help Kelly , shots rang out from the home , injuring his hand , he said , according to the complaint .
McManaway returned fire , and told authorities he pulled Kelly behind the SUV , where the two remained until SWAT officers arrived .
Kelly was taken to a local hospital , where he died of his injuries .
Margaret Poplawski told police her son had enlisted in the Marine Corps a few years ago , but was discharged for assaulting his drill sergeant in basic training , according to the complaint .
Since his discharge , she told police , he had been " stockpiling guns and ammunition , buying and selling the weapons online , because he believed that as a result of the economic collapse , the police were no longer able to protect society .
Mrs. Poplawski reported that her son only liked police when they were not curtailing his constitutional rights , which he was determined to protect , " the complaint said .
Autopsies showed that Kelly died of gunshot wounds to the trunk and lower extremities , Sciullo died from gunshot wounds to the head and trunk , and Mayhle was shot in the head , the complaint said .
" We have never had to lose three officers in the line of duty on one call , " Harper , the police chief , said .
" They have paid the ultimate sacrifice . "
Authorities believe Poplawski , wearing a bullet - proof vest , aimed more than 100 rounds at police , using an AK - 47 , Harper said Saturday .
Harper said some neighbors were evacuated during the standoff .
Police had responded to calls from the home two or three times previously , Harper said .

Details of your e-mails will be recorded Details of user e-mails and net phone calls will be stored by internet service providers ( ISPs ) from Monday under an EU directive .
The plans were drawn up in the wake of the London bombings in 2005 .
ISPs and telecoms firms have resisted the proposals while some countries in the EU are contesting the directive .
Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group , said it was a " crazy directive " with potentially dangerous repercussions for citizens .
All ISPs in the European Union will have to store the records for a year .
An EU directive which requires telecoms firms to hold on to telephone records for 12 months is already in force .
The data stored does not include the content of e-mails or a recording of a net phone call , but is used to determine connections between individuals .
Authorities can get access to the stored records with a warrant .
Governments across the EU have now started to implement the directive into their own national legislation .
The UK Home Office , responsible for matters of policing and national security , said the measure had " effective safeguards " in place .
There is concern that access to our data is widening to include many public bodies ISPs across Europe have complained about the extra costs involved in maintaining the records .
The UK government has agreed to reimburse ISPs for the cost of retaining the data .
Mr Killock said the directive was passed only by " stretching the law " .
The EU passed it by " saying it was a commercial matter and not a police matter " , he explained .
" Because of that they got it through on a simple vote , rather than needing unanimity , which is required for policing matters , " he said .
Sense of shock
He added : " It was introduced in the wake of the London bombings when there was a sense of shock in Europe .
It was used to push people in a particular direction . "
Sweden has decided to ignore the directive completely while there is a challenge going through the German courts at present .
" Hopefully , we can see some sort of challenge to this directive , " said Mr Killock .
Isabella Sankey , Policy Director at Liberty , said the directive formalised what had already been taking place under voluntary arrangement for years .
" The problem is that this regime allows not just police to access this information but hundreds of other public bodies . "
In a statement , the Home Office said it was implementing the directive because it was the government 's priority to " protect public safety and national security " .
It added : " Communications data is the where and when of the communication and plays a vital part in a wide range of criminal investigations and prevention of terrorist attacks , as well as contributing to public safety more generally .
" Without communications data resolving crimes such as the Rhys Jones murder would be very difficult if not impossible .
" Access to communications data is governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ( Ripa ) which ensures that effective safeguards are in place and that the data can only be accessed when it is necessary and proportionate to do so . "
Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that ISPs would also be storing details of website visits .

At the Consumer Electronics
Show this past week , NVIDIA was demonstrating a new reference platform for an ultra small form - factor multimedia PC and we should underscore the word " .
To say this new product concept is tiny would be an understatement .
Consider if you will , an entire PC , capable of decoding and playing full 1080 p HD video content , in a box that fits in the palm of your hand with a 3 " x 4 " motherboard .
Based on Intel 's 1.6GHz Atom 330 processor with the hearty support of NVIDIA 's GeForce 9400 M core logic MCP with 16 integrated GeForce graphics cores , NVIDIA 's Ion has to be one of the most capable Atom - based small form - factor solutions we 've seen thus far .
From what we 've seen of Ion 's capabilities and the capabilities of products like the Asus N10Jc Netbook ( built on Intel 's 945 chipset with discrete GeForce 9300 M graphics ) , Ion should take the Netbook and Small Form - Factor Desktop game up a notch or three .
When you consider how products like the Dell Studio Hybrid could benefit from this new technology , Ion appears to be a home run in the making .
We met with Drew Henry , NVIDIA 's General Manager of MCP products , at CES and he gave us a tour of Ion , as well as a demonstration of its capabilities .
We 've got Ion in today 's HotHardware Video Spotlight , so we 'll let Drew do the talkin' .
( New York ) - Malaysia 's
Home Ministry should immediately rescind its order suspending publication of two opposition party newspapers , Human Rights Watch said today .
Human Rights Watch also called for repeal of the 1984 Printing Presses and Publications Act .
On March 23 , the Home Ministry notified the opposition party Parti Keadilan Rakyat ( PKR ) and its coalition partner Parti Islam Se - Malaysia ( PAS ) that they were prohibited from publishing their respective party newspapers , Suara Keadilan and Harakah , for three months .
With three key by - elections scheduled for April 7 , 2009 , the ban will harm the parties ' ability to inform and rally voters .
Both parties plan to go ahead with distribution of this week 's publications , which are already in print .
No official reason accompanied the ministry 's action , although in later reports Home Ministry officials said the papers were banned for publishing reports that contravened the ministry 's guidelines and permit conditions .
Home Minister Datuk Sri Syed Hamid Albar said that the newspapers " were still publishing untrue stories after they were given warnings . "
He also said that the stories aimed to " instill hatred for the government and leaders . "
" The government may argue it is banning party papers over concern for citizens ' welfare , but this is unfair political warfare in disguise , " said Elaine Pearson , deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch .
" Malaysia 's citizens deserve better from their elected leaders . "
Despite constitutional guarantees to freedom of expression , the draconian Printing Presses and Publications
Act effectively silences criticism of the Malaysian government by requiring newspapers to renew publishing licenses annually .
According to the law , the minister 's discretion to grant , revoke , or suspend licenses is " absolute " and not subject to judicial review .
Suara Keadilan has faced government interference since it received its first printing permit less than a year ago , eight years after its initial application .
In September 2008 , the Home Ministry instructed PKR to " show cause " why its publication license should not be suspended after it reported incorrectly that Inspector - General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan became paralyzed after heart surgery .
In February 2009 , the government attempted to limit circulation by confiscating thousands of copies from distributors and warning them against selling the newspaper .
It is unclear if Suara Keadilan circulation is limited to PKR party members .
On February 11 , the authorities seized copies of Harakah , in print for 22 years without suspension .
On February 26 , PAS received a letter from the Home Ministry that it was in violation of its permit in part because Harakah reported on non-party matters .
A third member of the opposition coalition , Parti Tindakan Demokratik ( DAP ) , has been trying unsuccessfully to renew the license of Rocket , the party paper , since December 2008 .
" Much of Malaysia 's mainstream media , with ties to Malaysia 's ruling coalition , rarely run into trouble , " said Pearson .
" But online journals and other ‘ new media ' that are critical of the government are easy targets for censorship . "
Human Rights
Watch also expressed concern with the refusal of the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) , the dominant party in the ruling coalition , to grant six members of the " new media , " including Malaysiakini and the Malaysian Insider , access to its annual meeting on March 24 - 28 , 2009 .
An UMNO official cited their " unfriendly " reporting as the reason .
The meeting is of particular importance this year as UMNO will be choosing a new leader .
With the current leader , Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi , stepping down , the new UMNO leader will fulfill his unexpired term , which has another four years to run .
On September 12 , 2008 , in still another attack on a free press , police arrested Raja Petra Kamarudin , founder and editor of Malaysia Today , under the Internal Security Act , which allows for indefinite preventive detention without charge or trial ( https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/12/malaysia-free-journalists-and-parliamentarian).
He was accused of demeaning Islam .
Although released on technical grounds , the government is appealing the decision .
In a separate case , Raja Petra is on trial for sedition on the politically motivated charge of defaming a government leader .
" The Malaysian government needs to allow all voices to be heard , " said Pearson .
" Freedom of speech is a touchstone of a true democracy . "
Martin Blank is a freelance hitman who starts to develop a conscience , which causes him to muff a couple of routine assignments .
On the advice of his secretary and his psychiatrist , he attends his 10th year High School reunion in Grosse Pointe , Michigan ( a Detroit suburb where he 's also contracted to kill someone ) .
Hot on his tail are a couple of over - enthusiastic federal agents , another assassin who wants to kill him , and Grocer , an assassin who wants him to join an " Assassin 's Union . "

A con­gres­sion­al bill that would cre­ate a truth com­mis­sion to explore the U.S. role in the 2004 régime change in Haiti is lan­guish­ing in the House For­eign Affairs Com­mit­tee with only 12 co-spon­sors .
But Rep. Bar­bara Lee ’s ( D‑Calif . ) H.R. 331 has sparked hope among some Haitians who think the bill might pass under a friend­ly Oba­ma admin­is­tra­tion and bring need­ed change to the indebt­ed island nation .
Unless the truth about the coup is uncovered , Congress will write off the Bush policy of regime change as an anomaly , says Lee .
Lee intro­duced the bill Jan. 8 with­out fan­fare .
She has brought the same bill to the U.S. House almost every year since 2004 .
It has nev­er advanced out of committee .
The commission ’s task would be to deter­mine what hap­pened on Feb. 29 , 2004 , and the months lead­ing up to the removal of Haiti ’s Pres­i­dent Jean Bertrand Aris­tide , cur­rent­ly exiled in South Africa .
The offi­cial U.S. posi­tion goes some­thing like this :
In Feb­ru­ary 2004 , an armed mili­tia was poised to take over the cap­i­tal , Port - au - Prince .
To avoid a blood­bath , Aris­tide called on the Amer­i­cans to air­lift him and his wife to safety .
Aris­tide ​ “ left the coun­try with our assis­tance , which he request­ed , ” Mari Tol­liv­er , spokesper­son for the U.S. Embassy in Haiti , told In These Times in August .
( Karl Duck­worth , spokesper­son for the State Depart­ment , said that he could not com­ment on the U.S. role in Aristide ’s depar­ture , as the Oba­ma State Depart­ment is doing a ​ “ com­plete eval­u­a­tion of all the areas to see where we will be on issues . ” )
Aris­tide tells a dif­fer­ent sto­ry .
He says that a rag - tag band of some 200 rebels strong - armed poor­ly equipped police sta­tions in sev­er­al Hait­ian towns , but posed no threat to the cap­i­tal , the pres­i­dent or the cen­tral gov­ern­ment .
Aris­tide says Amer­i­can offi­cials forced him to board a plane whose des­ti­na­tion was unknown .
Con­gress has only once for­mal­ly addressed the ques­tion of the U.S. role in the coup .
On March 3 , 2004 , the West­ern Hemi­sphere Sub­com­mit­tee of the House Inter­na­tion­al Rela­tions Com­mit­tee held a hear­ing , pro­vid­ing the oppor­tu­ni­ty for Con­gress to ques­tion State Depart­ment offi­cials .
Those tes­ti­fy­ing were not under oath ; there were no fol­low - up hearings .
The week fol­low­ing the hear­ing , Lee intro­duced her bill on the House floor , explain­ing that the pur­pose of the truth com­mis­sion was to ​“ find out more about the events lead­ing up to Pres­i­dent Aristide ’s depar­ture , the twi­light activ­i­ties of his alleged res­ig­na­tion , the cur­rent uncon­sti­tu­tion­al gov­ern­ment , and the ongo­ing tur­moil , fear , and mis­in­for­ma­tion that is still flow­ing out of Haiti . ”
In 2004 , 49 rep­re­sen­ta­tives co-spon­sored the bill .
Nicole Lee , exec­u­tive direc­tor of Wash­ing­ton , D.C. - based TransAfrica Forum , an advo­ca­cy group , is an attor­ney who , before the coup , lived in Haiti .
Lee ( no rela­tion to the con­gress­woman ) says one of the key func­tions of the com­mis­sion would be to doc­u­ment the role of the Inter­na­tion­al Repub­li­can Insti­tute ( IRI ) in desta­bi­liz­ing the Hait­ian gov­ern­ment .
The non­prof­it IRI is affil­i­at­ed with the Repub­li­can Par­ty and fund­ed , in part , by the non­prof­it Nation­al Endow­ment for Democ­ra­cy ( NED ) , which Con­gress par­tial­ly funds ​“ to strength­en demo­c­ra­t­ic insti­tu­tions around the world through non­govern­men­tal efforts , ” accord­ing to the NED website .
“ The Inter­na­tion­al Repub­li­can Insti­tute all along real­ly foment­ed a lot of ten­sion between the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Con­ver­gence [ the anti-Aris­tide par­ty ] and the gov­ern­ment , ” says Lee .
​ “ There were reports – and con­tin­ue to be reports – that the IRI pro­vid­ed infor­ma­tion and also pro­vid­ed fund­ing and train­ing to for­mer Hait­ian mil­i­tary offi­cials that end­ed up com­ing across the bor­der with the Domini­can Repub­lic ” lead­ing to the Feb­ru­ary 2004 coup , she says .
Unless the truth about the coup is uncov­ered , Con­gress will write off the Bush pol­i­cy of régime change as an anom­aly , says Lee .
Mean­while , the pro­posed bill has elicit­ed response in Haiti .
From exile , Aris­tide ref­er­enced the bill in a state­ment read recent­ly on the radio by a rep­re­sen­ta­tive :
Lee ’s bill leads us to believe that the new Amer­i­can admin­is­tra­tion will not sup­port the coup d’état as was the case for the pre­vi­ous admin­is­tra­tion , the state­ment said .
Yvonne Zapzap heads the Fam­i­lies of Polit­i­cal Pris­on­ers Col­lec­tive and spoke by phone from Haiti through a trans­la­tor .
She says Haitians are aware of the bill and believe a truth com­mis­sion would help end the lin­ger­ing effects of the coup .
Peo­ple vot­ed for [ cur­rent Pres­i­dent René ]
Pré­val so that the polit­i­cal pris­on­ers would be out of jail , but peo­ple are still in jail , she says , refer­ring to sup­port­ers impris­oned with­out tri­al dur­ing the 2004 to 2006 U.S. - appointed inter­im gov­ern­ment .
The impacts of the coup are still present since Aris­tide was snatched from Haiti , she says .
TransAfrica Forum ’s
Lee puts it this way : ​ “ When Aris­tide was removed , water projects stopped , edu­ca­tion projects stopped , health­care clin­ics shut down .
It was n’t just about remov­ing a leader , it was about destroy­ing a real democ­ra­cy .
And that real­ly needs to be account­ed for . ”
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is “ sensibly laying out pretty strict criteria ” for when banks can pay back their TARP bailout money , said Felix Salmon in Reuters .
That ’s good :
It is n’t enough that an individual bank is healthy , when the broader financial system and credit flow are not .
But the TARP legislation is “ pretty unambiguous ” that Geithner ca n’t stop banks from paying the Treasury back , so this will be a test of Geithner ’s power .
You ’d think Geithner would welcome some money flowing back into the TARP coffers , said Dwight Cass in Breaking Views.com ( via Fortune ) , and the markets would certainly cheer banks able to survive on private capital .
Besides , who can blame “ relatively strong ” banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan for wanting to “ shuck off ” the TARP “ scarlet letter ” ?
The problem is that those banks are mostly strong on paper , said Andrew Ross Sorkin in The New York Times .
In reality , each bank is busy pulling an accounting “ bunny out of the hat ” to wow investors with better - than - expected — and better - than - merited — earnings .
So far , investors are n’t buying the “ amateur hour ” magic .

Many properties of a ( sufficiently nice ) function are reflected in its Fourier transform , defined by the formula
For instance , decay properties of are reflected in smoothness properties of , as the following table shows :
Another important relationship between a function and its Fourier transform is the uncertainty principle , which roughly asserts that if a function is highly localised in space , then its Fourier transform must be widely dispersed in space , or to put it another way , and cannot both decay too strongly at infinity ( except of course in the degenerate case ) .
There are many ways to make this intuition precise .
One of them is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , which asserts that if we normalise
then we must have
thus forcing at least one of or to not be too concentrated near the origin .
This principle can be proven ( for sufficiently nice , initially ) by observing the integration by parts identity
and then using Cauchy - Schwarz and the Plancherel identity .
Another well known manifestation of the uncertainty principle is the fact that it is not possible for and to both be compactly supported ( unless of course they vanish entirely ) .
This can be in fact be seen from the above table : if is compactly supported , then is an entire function ; but the zeroes of a non -zero entire function are isolated , yielding a contradiction unless vanishes .
( Indeed , the table also shows that if one of and is compactly supported , then the other cannot have exponential decay . )
On the other hand , we have the example of the Gaussian functions , , which both decay faster than exponentially .
The classical Hardy uncertainty principle asserts , roughly speaking , that this is the fastest that and can simultaneously decay :
Theorem 1 ( Hardy uncertainty principle )
Suppose that is a ( measurable ) function such that and for all and some .
Then is a scalar multiple of the gaussian .
This theorem is proven by complex - analytic methods , in particular the Phragmén - Lindelöf principle ; for sake of completeness we give that proof below .
But I was curious to see if there was a real - variable proof of the same theorem , avoiding the use of complex analysis .
I was able to find the proof of a slightly weaker theorem :
Theorem 2 ( Weak Hardy uncertainty principle )
Suppose that is a non-zero ( measurable ) function such that and for all and some .
Then for some absolute constant .
Note that the correct value of should be , as is implied by the true Hardy uncertainty principle .
Despite the weaker statement , I thought the proof might still might be of interest as it is a little less “ magical ” than the complex - variable one , and so I am giving it below .
— 1 . The complex - variable proof —
We first give the complex - variable proof .
By dilating by ( and contracting by ) we may normalise .
By multiplying by a small constant we may also normalise .
The super - exponential decay of allows us to extend the Fourier transform to the complex plane , thus
for all .
We may differentiate under the integral sign and verify that is entire .
Taking absolute values , we obtain the upper bound
completing the square , we obtain
for all .
We conclude that the entire function
is bounded in magnitude by on the imaginary axis ; also , by hypothesis on , we also know that is bounded in magnitude by on the real axis .
Formally applying the Phragmen - Lindelöf principle ( or maximum modulus principle ) , we conclude that is bounded on the entire complex plane , which by Liouville ’s theorem implies that is constant , and the claim follows .
Now let ’s go back and justify the Phragmén - Lindelöf argument .
Strictly speaking , Phragmén - Lindelöf does not apply , since it requires exponential growth on the function , whereas we have quadratic - exponential growth here .
But we can tweak a bit to solve this problem .
Firstly , we pick and work on the sector
Using ( 2 ) we have
Thus , if , and is sufficiently close to depending on , the function is bounded in magnitude by on the boundary of .
Then , for any sufficiently small , ( using the standard branch of on ) is also bounded in magnitude by on this boundary , and goes to zero at infinity in the interior of , so is bounded by in that interior by the maximum modulus principle .
Sending , and then , and then , we obtain bounded in magnitude by on the upper right quadrant .
Similar arguments work for the other quadrants , and the claim follows .
— 2 . The real - variable proof —
Now we turn to the real - variable proof of Theorem 2 , which is based on the fact that polynomials of controlled degree do not resemble rapidly decreasing functions .
Rather than use complex analyticity , we will rely instead on a different relationship between the decay of and the regularity of , as follows :
Lemma 3 ( Derivative bound )
Suppose that for all , and some .
Then is smooth , and furthermore one has the bound for all and every even integer .
Proof :
The smoothness of follows from the rapid decrease of .
To get the bound , we differentiate under the integral sign ( one can easily check that this is justified ) to obtain
and thus by the triangle inequality for integrals ( and the hypothesis that is even )
On the other hand , by differentiating the Fourier analytic identity
times at , we obtain
expanding out using Taylor series we conclude that
◻
Using Stirling ’s formula , we conclude in particular that
for all large even integers ( where the decay of can depend on ) .
We can combine ( 3 ) with Taylor ’s theorem with remainder , to conclude that on any interval , we have an approximation
where is the length of and is a polynomial of degree less than .
Using Stirling ’s formula again , we obtain
Now we apply a useful bound .
Lemma 4 ( Doubling bound )
Let be a polynomial of degree at most for some , let be an interval , and suppose that for all and some .
Then for any we have the bound for all and for some absolute constant .
Proof :
By translating we may take ; by dilating we may take .
By dividing by , we may normalise .
Thus we have for all , and the aim is now to show that for all .
Consider the trigonometric polynomial .
By de Moivre ’s formula , this function is a linear combination of for .
By Fourier analysis , we can thus write , where
Since is bounded in magnitude by , we conclude that is bounded in magnitude by .
Next , we use de Moivre ’s formula again to expand as a linear combination of and , with coefficients of size ; expanding further as , we see that is a polynomial in with coefficients .
Putting all this together , we conclude that the coefficients of are all of size , and the claim follows . ◻
Remark 1
One can get slightly sharper results by using the theory of Chebyshev polynomials .
( Is the best bound for known ?
I do not know the recent literature on this subject .
I think though that even the sharpest bound for would not fully recover the sharp Hardy uncertainty principle , at least with the argument given here . )
We return to the proof of Theorem 2 .
We pick a large integer and a parameter to be chosen later .
From ( 4 ) we have
for , and some polynomial of degree .
In particular , we have
for .
Applying Lemma 4 , we conclude that
for .
Applying ( 4 ) again we conclude that
for .
If we pick for a sufficiently small absolute constant , we conclude that
( say ) for .
If for large enough , the right - hand side goes to zero as ( which also implies ) , and we conclude that ( and hence ) vanishes identically .

A Step - by - Step Guide to Composting
No matter how much you make , there ’s never enough compost to go around .
So pick your system and get started .
This article provides an overview of five potential prenup pitfalls that future spouses should think about before signing away their legal rights .
Many articles extoll the virtues of entering into a prenuptial agreement prior to your marriage .
However , there are some downsides to a prenup that should also be considered .
This article provides an overview of five potential prenup pitfalls that future spouses should think about before signing away their legal rights .
Pitfall 1 : Negotiating a prenuptial agreement may irrevocably damage your relationship and make divorce more likely .
In the context of a prenup , there is usually an “ initiator ” spouse ( the one who wants the prenup ) and a “ compliant ” spouse ( the spouse that is being asked to agree to the terms of a prenup ) .
The dynamics of prenup negotiations may set up a bad pattern for the marriage .
Some fiancés pushing for a prenuptial agreement may be demonstrating a lack of faith in their partner and a lack of commitment to the marriage .
This can cause the compliant spouse to feel a lack of connection to the initiator fiancé and feel like the initiator is cold or callous .
In addition , negotiating a prenuptial agreement is anything but romantic : and if prenup discussions become tense or difficult , that can destroy a portion of the couple ’s love – before they ’ve even had the chance to enjoy their wedding .
Negotiating finances is a harsh business , and it ’s often made harsher by a couple ’s lawyers .
Generally speaking , both fiancé ’s should hire attorneys to negotiate and draft a prenup on their own behalf , because the agreement may not be enforceable without involvement of separate legal counsel .
Most lawyers representing parties in prenuptial negotiations act as if it the entire transaction is purely business .
Although some aspects of a romantic partnership may require the partners to focus on money and financial health , marriage is not a business .
Often the initiating party ( or that party ’s lawyer ) says , “ After the wedding , you can just put the premarital agreement in a drawer and forget about it . ”
But of course , that ’s not true and not really , entirely possible .
The premarital agreement cannot simply be forgotten – it ’s a legal contract that both parties are bound to live by .
There may be some resentment on either or both sides about what was given up , or not agreed to .
This resentment may rear its ugly head in all aspects of the marriage .
Pitfall 2 : When the two parties negotiating a prenuptial agreement do not have equal bargaining power , the agreement tends to be coercive .
For example , when one fiancé asks for a prenuptial agreement very close to the wedding date , after the invitations have been sent out , the negotiation is inherently unfair .
The other fiancé may feel extreme pressure to agree to anything just so the wedding is n’t cancelled .
In fact , under such circumstances , the compliant fiancé can claim that he or she did not have sufficient time to consider the prenup and was under extreme duress when signing it – in this case , the compliant spouse could have a very strong case for having the prenup overturned .
There are other , less extreme ways for bargaining power to be imbalanced .
Maybe one fiancé is not very savvy with business or money matter , and is n’t sure what he or she is being asked to give up .
Maybe the initiating fiancé is very influential and almost intimidating to his or her partner , such that the compliant fiancé can’t imagine pushing back or asking questions about the prenup and feels that it ’s impossible to say no to the proposed terms of the contract .
Even mediators can be insensitive or unaware of any power imbalance when assisting clients in negotiating a prenuptial agreement .
Mediators should try to determine whether the agreement proposed by “ both parties ” may be really the thoughts of only one , and whether the other party feels coerced .
All motivations and feelings should be exposed and discussed in the mediation prior to proceeding .
Pitfall 3 : Prenuptial agreements may be inappropriate for couples entering into first marriages , even if there is a big difference between their incomes and assets .
Marriage is an exciting joint venture .
An important part of the joint venture of marriage is the financial partnership .
A spouse may correctly feel that some of this aspect of the marriage has been taken away if a premarital agreement decreases that spouse ’s rights .
State divorce laws are designed to handle the issues of disparity of income and disparity of premarital assets if and when the spouses get divorced .
So insisting on a prenuptial agreement that may end up harming the relationship may not be a sensible trade - off .
However , prenuptial agreements can be highly useful for people entering into second marriages and who have children from their first marriage .
A prenup can balance a spouse ’s loyalty to the new spouse with the spouse ’s concern and loyalty to his or her children of the first marriage .
Pitfall 4 : A prenuptial agreement often damages the relationship between the two families - of - origin .
An initiating party ( or the initiating party ’s parents ) may want a financial agreement prior to the marriage due to the existence of family wealth and propose a premarital agreement that excludes all family property from the marriage , forever .
Result : the future spouse ’s family feels humiliated and disrespected , and never forgets the rebuff .
This is not good for the relationship , as it will result in family - of - origin conflict that will be present during the entire marriage .
A common example is where the initiating fiancé ( Spouse A ) does n’t want a prenuptial agreement , but Spouse A ’s parents insist .
The prenuptial agreement is made and agreed to , but the compliant spouse feels that Spouse A was unable to stand up to his or her parents – the compliant spouse loses respect for Spouse A and Spouse A ’s parents .
When one party ’s family - of - origin tries to control the marriage through a prenuptial agreement , it disturbs the delicate balance in a couple ’s relationship and makes it more likely to fail .
Pitfall 5 : Oftentimes , the terms of a prenuptial agreement are unfair at the time of divorce and the spouses end up in court battle anyway .
Prenuptial agreements do not always eliminate divorce court battles .
Sometimes , premarital agreements give a spouse a fraction of what he or she would be entitled to under state law .
Although the outcome tends to support the notion that the deal made in the prenuptial agreement years earlier was unfair to that spouse , courts routinely enforce prenups that result in an unfair outcome , but will take a second look when enforcing the prenup would create such a disparity of wealth that the disadvantaged spouse would end up close to destitute or on public benefits .
When a couple that had a prenup decides to divorce , and the prenup seems to result in an unfair result to one spouse , that spouse may very likely go to court to try and have the prenup set aside and request that the court use the laws of the state to make decisions about alimony and property division .
Court cases that involve the validity of a prenup can be very expensive and time - consuming – they can literally drag on for years .
So , it ’s important to realize a prenup ( especially an unfair prenup ) is no guarantee that you ’ll avoid divorce court .
In just a few short decades , George Lucas has gone from renegade entertainer who filled children 's lives with wonder , to the object of wrath and ridicule .
Now scientists can explain why .

Over at VeryEvolved , a lengthy and fascinating article on the nature of nostalgia explains how our brains process memories .
And how the disruption of fond , nostalgic feelings can result in extreme emotional backlash :
Every time you recall a memory it may become subtly altered and associated with what ever it was that triggered that old memory .
If this trigger happens repeatedly , then you 're adding new layer of interpretation that will be recalled automatically with the old memory next time it 's called up .
A great example of this in action that also demonstrates fluid nostalgia , is the backlash against George Lucas .
A large portion of 70's and 80's children had grown up owning Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader figures and playing in the backyard pretending sticks were light sabers .
Fond childhood memories .
When the first abysmal Star Wars Prequel was released the strong feelings against the film were n't just those of disappointment at a bad movie .
If it were that simple , we should also feel the same way about Police Academy 7 .
The reaction can be partly explained by the sense of attack on our previously fond feelings .
Watching the new movie automatically calls up memories from the previous series and all the pleasant childhood playtime memories associated with it .
But recalling these fond memories in the context of a negative experience begins the process of re-coding , or modifying our old memories .
This is an undesirable outcome for nostalgia as it is usually such a pleasant feeling .
Naturally there is some resistance and cognitive dissonance when this happens and the brain will try to avoid it like any other unpleasant experience .

If you live or work downtown , and a bunch of white foam people have been floating by you , tumbling into buildings and onto the ground and dissipating , or rising ever - higher up through the clouds , please do n’t freak out : they ’re just ( another ) marketing campaign .
Jim Schwartz ( who we have to thank for creating the Toronto Sun Sucks blog that we just wrote about ) , tipped us off this morning to the creations , sending us the dramatic video below .
Schwartz also pointed us in the direction of Flogos , short for “ foam logos , ” a company that does exactly this kind of thing .
The company ’s FAQ page — which does a way better job of explaining how Flogos are made than we ever could — notes that Flogos “ can travel from 1 to 30 miles and float as high as 5000 feet , ” and are , with every machine that produces them ( the company recommends “ at least two ” ) , capable of popping out at a rate of one “ every 15 to 50 seconds . ”
Torontoist spoke to Flogos Canada President Tom Richard on the phone this afternoon , and he confirmed that the vaguely horrifying human shapes are rising out and up from Front Street .
While the company is doing some promotion right now in several cities for Lindt ( you know , the chocolate company ; because when you think delicious , you think foam ) , the ones you may have spotted today are part of a demonstration his company is putting on for the Canadian Special Events Marketing Expo ( CSEME ) , which is itself put on by Canadian Event Perspectives Magazine .
In other words , these Flogos are advertising for advertising itself .
And if that all hurts your head anywhere as much as it hurt ours , you probably wish there was some place more soothing to look to than the sky .

It is a matter of skill .
Two warriors meet to test themselves against wildly different styles of combat .
They are Russian wrestlers and tonfa - swinging Englishmen , American boxers , Indian mystics , New York brawlers , crazed jungle monsters and quiet masters of the martial arts .
Blunt instrument or elegant weapon , the choice of discipline is n't important .
Skill alone determines the outcome .
They travel the world to meet and battle each other , and above all , to win .
Some search for answers , some for glory , some for revenge .
Some only seek worthy opponents in a never - ending quest to improve their knowledge and skills .
But only one can become the world 's greatest street fighter .
Konami hired high school senior Yoshiki Okamoto as a graphic artist in 1982 , despite the fact that Okamoto did n't like video games and did n't want to make them .
Two years later , under orders to create a racing game , he made classic shooters Time Pilot and Gyruss instead ... and then asked for a raise .
He was fired the next day .
Five - year - old Capcom scooped him up .
They were shifting their business model from electronic game machines to video games , and Okamoto - their second R&D hire , after designer Noritaka Funamizu - put one of their first hits in arcades with 1942 , a scrolling World War II aerial shooter that , ironically , encouraged players to wipe out the Japanese air force on their way to Tokyo .
Together with Tokuro Fujiwara 's one - two punch of Commando and Ghosts 'n Goblins , 1942 helped put Capcom on the map , and ushered in their move on the American market .
The next step involved Okamoto taking on his old employers .
Data East had release Karate Champ , a basic fighting game , in 1984 .
Konami answered in 1985 with Yie - Ar Kung Fu ( One - Two Kung Fu ) , staring martial arts master Oolong as he put the hurtin ' on fighters like sumo wrestler Buchu , shuriken - throwing ninja girl Star , and tonfa - wielding Tonfun until somebody 's health bar was gone .
Capcom wanted its own fighting game , combining the best elements of Karate Champ and Yie - Ar Kung Fu , and outdoing both .
Okamoto put director " Piston " Takashi Nishiyama and project planner " Finish " Hiroshi Matsumoto - the team responsible for Capcom 's overhead beat - ' em - up Avengers - on the job , and stuck newly hired 22 - year - old graphic designer Keiji Inafune on the team to design the fighters .
They named their project after the Americanized title of Sonny Chiba 's 1974 beat 'em up classic , Clash !
Killer Fist .
Street Fighter landed in arcades in 1987 .
Cosmetically , Nishiyama and Matsumoto did n't deviate far from Yie - Ar's example , and Inafune had cribbed heavily from 70's manga and anime Karate Baka Ichidai for several character designs .
Gamers played as Ryu , a solemn , red - headed Shotokan Karate master in a torn white gi and red slippers .
The health bars were identical to Yie - Ar's , and several of the ten fighters scattered across the globe were curiously familiar ... like shuriken - throwing ninja boy Geki and tonfa - wielding Eagle .
Joining them was elderly Chinese assassin Gen , Caucasian punk Birdie , thinly veiled Mike Tyson clone Mike , and Thai bosses Adon and Sagat , the eye - patched Mauythai master and dead ringer for Ichidai 's villainous Reiba , the Dark Lord of Muaythai .
Where Street Fighter differed was in the execution .
The colors and characters popped off the screen in ways Yie - Ar's super - deformed avatars never did .
You had your choice of where to go first for a best - of - three contest , and whatever the outcome , a very , very badly digitized voice would declare victory or bemoan defeat .
Even better , a second player could join the game at any time as Ken , Ryu 's blonde , American sparring partner , for a karate duel against Player 1 .
If the challenger won , they continued the game as Ken. Joust and Mario Bros. covered similar ground years before , but neither brought the same level of competitiveness to their gameplay .
Street Fighter was about busting the other guy up and sending him home .
Then there were the devastating special moves .
Executing a Hadouken ( " wave motion fist " ) fireball , Shouryuken ( " rising dragon fist " ) uppercut , or Tatsumaki Senpukyaku ( " tornado whirlwind kick " ) spin - kick could easily wipe out most enemies in one or two hits , but they were incredibly tough to pull off .
Some gamers did n't believe they were actual moves .
Discovering the tricks to Ryu 's magical chi-based attacks was a matter of trial and error , or else the knowledge was passed down from experienced player to novice .
Even then , the game 's unique control scheme did n't always cooperate .
Instead of buttons , the Street Fighter upright cabinets came with punch pads - one for punches , one for kicks - that delivered light , medium , or heavy attacks depending on how hard and fast it was mashed .
But the eight - direction joystick was legendarily unresponsive , and players could n't really judge what constituted a strong versus a weak hit , opting instead to simply pound the machines relentlessly .
Tales of sprained and dislocated fingers began to circulate .
Regardless whether the injuries were real or apocryphal , the punch pads did n't last long under all that abuse .
Street Fighter cabinets went down with alarming frequency .
Luckily , the game 's board had been built to accommodate a second design for the Japanese market .
The punch - pads were phased out in favor of a six - button control scheme that made it far easier to use the various kicks and punches .
The conversions , however , did n't make the joystick any more accurate , or clean up lingering bugs from the force - reading sensors , which were never removed .
Despite the problems , Street Fighter became a modest success in Japan and a hit - literally - stateside .
Capcom USA soon requested a follow - up game .
Funamizu and character designer Akira Yasuda gamely obliged with Street Fighter ' 89 , a side - scrolling brawler in the Double Dragon vein that failed to catch on .
Meanwhile , riding high on yet another successful title called Mega Man Tokuro Fujiwara made the Metroid - ish action platformer Street Fighter 2010 : The Final Fight for the Nintendo Entertainment System , featuring a bionic Ken ; it mercifully vanished into obscurity .
Street Fighter ' 89 was soon re-dubbed Final Fight , and went on to its own successes .
But what everyone really wanted was a real Street Fighter sequel , and Okamoto was now on the hook to provide one .

THE evolution in public policy concerning the manufacture , sale and possession of semiautomatic assault weapons like AK - 47s , AR - 15s and Uzis has been very disturbing .
Presidents Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton and I all supported a ban on these formidable firearms , and one was finally passed in 1994 .
When the 10 - year ban was set to expire , many police organizations  including 1,100 police chiefs and sheriffs from around the nation  called on Congress and President George W. Bush to renew and strengthen it .
But with a wink from the White House , the gun lobby prevailed and the ban expired .
I have used weapons since I was big enough to carry one , and now own two handguns , four shotguns and three rifles , two with scopes .
I use them carefully , for hunting game from our family woods and fields , and occasionally for hunting with my family and friends in other places .
We cherish the right to own a gun and some of my hunting companions like to collect rare weapons .
One of them is a superb craftsman who makes muzzle - loading rifles , one of which I displayed for four years in my private White House office .
But none of us wants to own an assault weapon , because we have no desire to kill policemen or go to a school or workplace to see how many victims we can accumulate before we are finally shot or take our own lives .
That ’s why the White House and Congress must not give up on trying to reinstate a ban on assault weapons , even if it may be politically difficult .

A recent study by UK scientists discovered that a common soil bacteria activates cells in the brain to produce serotonin and can alter behavior similar to antidepressants .
“ These studies help us understand how the body communicates with the brain and why a healthy immune system is important for maintaining mental health .
They also leave us wondering if we should n’t all be spending more time playing in the dirt . ”
– Dr Chris Lowry , Bristol University
The research , published in the journal Neuroscience by collaborators at Bristol University and University College London , used lab mice treated with Mycobacterium vaccae and found that it activated a specific group of neurons in the brain that produce serotonin .
Serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine , or 5 - HT ) is an important neurotransmitter which plays a role regulating mood , metabolism , anger , aggression , sleep , and appetite , and is found in the brain , gut , and blood .
A number of ailments are linked to low levels of serotonin , including anxiety and depression , bipolar disorders , and obsessive compulsive disorder .
Many antidepressants work with serotonin pathways to affect moods and anxiety , so finding a natural , commonly available substance that activates serotonin production could lead to new treatments for those suffering from depression .
While I do n’t see that doctors are going to start prescribing spoonfuls of dirt for clinical depression , this study affirms what many parents already know : Getting dirty is good for you .

Although the official government line is that its massive construction projects had nothing to do with the quake , some state researchers in Beijing have called for a full investigation .
Lei Xinglin , of the China Earthquake Administration , said that the Zipingpu reservoir " clearly affected the local seismicity and it is worthwhile to study the role it played in triggering the earthquake further " .
He added that firm conclusions remain " premature " however .
Many Afghans who returned from refugee camps in Iran or pakistan are still dispalced .
Badshah 's face says it all -- the story of dreams he never realized .
Inside a Pakistani police station in Quetta , capital of the southwestern Baluchistan Province , he is waiting to be interviewed before being sent home .
Although his hopes of sneaking into Iran and making a decent living have been dashed , he is lucky to be returning to his village alive .
Forty - five fellow Afghan men and teenagers died in the same shipping container that was supposed to take them to the Iranian border from Chaman , a dusty border town on Pakistan 's Afghan border .
While getting an Afghan passport is an arduous task in itself , for many Afghans like Badshah , securing an Iranian visa is next to impossible .
This , together with promises of a job , lured him into paying a couple thousand dollars to a people smuggler .
The smuggler promised to take him to Iran via Baluchistan , which serves as a main transit route for drug and people smuggling between Afghanistan and Iran .
But halfway though the arduous journey , Badshah and his fellow travelers realized the mistake they had made , locked inside an airless shipping container .
"
We thought that the container would have an exhaust fan .
But after a couple hours ' journey it was difficult to breathe and we started suffocating , " Badshah says .
" We started shouting and banging at the walls of the containers with our fists and feet , so somebody would pay attention to us .
But nobody did and a lot of us died while a few survived .
" When he regained consciousness , Badshah found himself in a hospital in Quetta .
He was among the 51 Afghans who were handed over to Afghan diplomats on April 9 .
Pakistani police are still questioning six Afghans while the 45 dead bodies were taken to Kabul on April 6 .
Several of the dead were teenagers .
In the Afghan capital , Kabul , Jean - Luc Lemahieu , the head of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes ( UNODC ) , calls Afghanistan 's human - trafficking problems " enormous . "
They are also intertwined with the country 's drug problem .
Lemahieu suggests that poverty , lack of opportunities , high unemployment , and high birthrates push thousands of young Afghans into making dangerous and sometime fatal journeys to seek jobs and security in other countries .
Many
Afghans believe that same factors also push thousands more into the ranks of the Taliban .
During the past decade , from Australia to Scandinavia , global media have reported on Afghans dying while in search of a better life and security .
Many if not all pay money to people smugglers .
Last week , Italian rail police reportedly discovered about two dozen Afghan teenagers living in a cramped underground space in Rome 's main train station .
Lemahieu says that while many impoverished countries in the world face the problems of human trafficking , Afghanistan 's problems have been exacerbated by decades of fighting and displacement .
"
It is very difficult to put clear figures to it in a country where we are not sure what the exact population of the country is , " Lemahieu notes .
" The further they get away from the neighboring countries and from Afghanistan , the more money is involved , the more human trafficking is involved , [ and ] the more criminal activity is involved .
"
In Quetta , Afghan diplomat Mohammad Daud Mohsini deals with hundreds of Afghans who are arrested in Pakistan and face deportation back to their country every week .
" Some make it through here but many are arrested , " he says .
He sees no solution to the problems , unless security and economic prospects improve inside his country .
The UN's Lemahieu suggests that regional cooperation and transparent border controls could help in improving the situation considerably .
He says the latest incident needs to be investigated by the international police organization Interpol because it apparently involved a transnational criminal network .
Though Afghanistan last year adopted a new law against human trafficking , its implementation remains challenging as Kabul struggles to quell the rising violence fanned by the Taliban insurgency in the country .
Lemahieu says socioeconomic development inside Afghanistan is the ultimate answer to this problem .
" We need to bring more development to Afghanistan .
We need to bring more security and stability in Afghanistan .
We need to ensure that incentives continue to exist in this country for the people to remain within their own country , " Lemahieu says .
" People do n't prefer to go out of their country , they prefer to stay within their culture , [ and ] they prefer to stay with their community , " he adds .
" But there is desperation which moves them out of the country .
And it is criminal activity which abuses that desperation .
And we need to act promptly and very severely against those criminals .
" Najibullah , another Afghan rescued in Quetta , says that despite all the hardships in his country , he will not seek a new life on the outside .
He has a message for other young Afghans who might be considering paying smugglers to find jobs elsewhere .
" I want to tell my countrymen that they should not rely on and should not trust people they do n't know well , " Najibullah says .
RFE /RL Radio Free Afghanistan correspondent Barakwal Miankhel contributed reporting from Quetta
This has been a week to provoke uncomfortable contemplation about the sort of country we are we now living in .
We have learned that the Home Secretary , aided by civil servants , grossly exaggerated the security threat posed by a leak from her department , prompting the police to arrest an opposition MP .
The Government has conceded that the surveillance powers it granted to local councils have been used to spy on innocent members of the public .
And yesterday it emerged that Ian Tomlinson , who was assaulted by a police officer at the G20 protests in London earlier this month died not from a heart attack but abdominal bleeding .
The common imprint on each of these stories is that of the unaccountable and rampant executive arm of the British state .
Of course , the authorities should have the ability to place suspected terrorists under surveillance .
But it is ludicrous that these powers were ever placed in the hands of local councils , or could be used to investigate petty offences such as littering .
Of course , civil servants have a right to stop confidential information from being smuggled out of their departments .
But they should call in the police to investigate only if it is truly a matter of national security .
It is not the job of the police to help to shield ministers from embarrassment .
Similarly , no one disputes that the police need , on occasion , to apply reasonable force against demonstrators to protect public property .
But the behaviour of certain officers in the City of London two and half weeks ago was utterly indefensible .
Such brutality from the rank and file must flow from a terrible failure of leadership within the police .
This twisted state of affairs – civil servants hyping security threats , the police assaulting innocent members of the public , local councils snooping on their electorates – did not arise overnight .
It is a toxic consequence of years of illiberal policy - making and a growing arrogance on the part of those who govern Britain .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There has been a pernicious assumption by those in power for much of the past decade that it is reasonable to give the executive sweeping powers in the name of public security and that the civil liberties Britons have enjoyed for generations matter little .
This is the thinking that has been used to justify all manner of illiberal innovations from ID cards , to the DNA database , to prolonged detention without trial for terror suspects .
Jacqui Smith used this very " national security " argument to justify calling in the police over the leaked Home Office documents .
Those who warned that the executive 's power grab would end in an unacceptable erosion of our freedoms have been vindicated .
The Government was warned when the council surveillance Bill was going through Parliament that it was too loosely drafted and gave too much power to local authorities .
Such concerns were dismissed by ministers .
Only now do they admit that they got it wrong .
Yet they still cling to the belief that those with executive power are more competent guardians of public freedoms than the public itself .
We need a completely new approach .
Any powers granted to public authorities to protect public safety must come with strict conditions of accountability .
The police , in particular , need to be brought under much tighter control .
Whichever party forms the next government needs to take back those powers that should never have been conferred .
But more than this , it must expunge the mentality that says security always trumps freedom .
It is time our arrogant executive was put back in its rightful place .

You who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now 's the time for your tears
Bob Dylan , " The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll "
The cops who brutally attacked newly - arrived immigrant Robert Dziekanski at Vancouver International Airport on Oct. 14 , 2007 , tragically causing his death , will face absolutely no criminal charges .
That 's right , none .
A year ago when I wrote my sad and angry piece , " Kill , Duck and Cover : The RCMP Rant " , I was outraged and sickened , but at least I knew that , with the video evidence the whole world had just seen , there would eventually be some sort of justice for Dziekanski and his heartbroken mother , Sofia Cisowski .
But , sadly , I was wrong .
There will be no justice .
None whatsoever .
Self - Investigation
As in just about every other case of police brutality here in Canada , the system has done almost everything possible to protect the cops from prosecution .
As is generally the case with police forces around the world , the RCMP almost always tries to protect its own , even if that means keeping its most violent members out on the streets " protecting " the public .
It 's been asked by so many people so many times before , but it really needs to be asked once more here :
What the fuck 's up with the RCMP investigating itself anyway ?!
Because that 's what happened , once again , in this case .
Is it some sort of sick joke ?
Because I do n't get the punch line .
And , in case you could n't guess , they almost never find anything criminal in any of their own actions .
Does anyone really think they want to ?
A Job Well Done
As for the prosecutors , it 's hard not to see them as completely aligned with the cops who they work with day in and day out , rather than with the public who they are supposed to serve .
To any regular follower of the news it would appear that what matters to your typical prosecutor is protecting cops from justice , not protecting the public from brutality ... or even death .
" Insufficient evidence to bring charges " , they say , even if , in this case , the whole assault is right there on video for all to see .
But it 's not just that there 's insufficient evidence to press charges .
No , it would seem that , in the minds of the prosecutors , this Robert Dziekanski case simply involved standard police procedure .
Nothing criminal here at all .
And that 's not just my opinion , that 's what was said Friday by the spokesman for the prosecutor 's office .
Not only was there nothing wrong with the actions of these four cops , but , it seems , they did an outstanding job in the way they handled the situation .
Seriously !
According to Stan Lowe , spokesman for the B.C. Criminal Justice Branch , " the officers in question were lawfully engaged in their duties when they encountered Mr. Dziekanski and the force they used to subdue and restrain him was reasonable and necessary in all the circumstances ” .
The scariest thing is that Lowe went on to say that the officers followed RCMP policy on the use of force .
That is to say , the way they violently took the unarmed , non-resisting Dziekanski down is exactly the way they should act in such situations .
What is this , fucking North Korea ?!
I 'd love to see how Mr. Lowe would react if that had been one of his loved ones being taken out in such a " reasonable and necessary " manner .
And just so we all got this right , going in and talking calmly to the man and then handcuffing him and leading him away peacefully would not have been the right course of action .
Violently taking him down , now that was the right thing to do .
Apology ?
Hell no , give these guys medals !
He was holding a stapler , after all , and that 's pretty scary for four big muscular , fully - trained - in - hand - to - hand - combat professionals .
Hey man , they could have been stapled !
Good Cops / Bad Cops
Obviously society needs the police and clearly they do put their lives on the line at times , but that in no way excuses brutality in any form .
They 're simply civil servants paid to do a job for the public .
But that 's certainly not how some of them act .
Similarly , we need teachers , but I do n't hear anyone saying we 've got to tolerate any teachers who molest students .
And let 's not forget that there are other people out there who risk their lives in the course of their work , most notably firefighters and search and rescue personnel , but we would n't tolerate any brutality on their part .
So why is it tolerated when the police engage in it ?
What we need in this country are good decent cops who would be sickened by the type of brutal force that was used against Dziekanski .
And I believe there are many of them out there who were .
We do know that many retired cops have spoken out about their dismay and even disgust at how quickly many police resort to violence and , particularly , the use of the taser these days .
Apologists
The apologists for police brutality will say it 's a tough job and they 're risking their lives , so all is excused .
To which I say , what a load of bullshit !
Again , firefighters have much more dangerous jobs and risk their lives constantly , but they do n't go around killing people who refuse to obey an order now do they ?
Those who say that these guys were " just doing their jobs " must seriously think the job of a cop is to use brutal violence against unarmed civilians .
But who would think such a thing ?
If unprovoked , unnecessary brutality leading to death was just part of the job of the police then their jobs would involve inherently criminal behavior .
And society would need protecting from them .
But , of course , their real job involves no such license to rough up such utterly harmless people as Robert Dziekanski .
As a number of retired police officers have said in interviews , these four reckless cops were completely out of control .
What was needed here was a calm response to a man in distress .
Instead they barged in and immediately - within 30 seconds - violently tasered him five times .
Excessive Use of Force
If tasering a passive 40 - year - old unarmed man five times and then jumping on him so he can no longer breathe is n't excessive use of force , what is ?
Yeah , ok , if someone 's shooting at you , shoot back .
But all these other cases - cases of people being shot dead when either armed with just a knife or , in many other cases , tasered or shot to death when completely unarmed - are just ridiculous .
Not As Accepting of Brutality
Last week a cop killed a teenager in Greece ( the first killing of a teenager there in over 20 years ) and the whole nation erupted into a week - long fit of rage , riots and repulsion .
And the cop was immediately charged with voluntary homicide .
Contrast that to Canada , where three teenagers were shot dead by the police in a one - month period across the country this past summer ... and everyone shrugged .
The thing that really gets me is that they do n't shoot for the legs , they actually shoot to kill ... 15 - year - olds !
Can you imagine shooting to kill a 15 - year - old because he would n't drop a knife ?
Not because he lunged at you , just because he refused repeated orders to drop the knife .
That 's what happened to a kid in Winnipeg this past summer .
There 's got to be a more professional - and less lethal - way of dealing with such situations .
Perhaps such as trying to talk the person down .
Not Such A Funny Joke
The more cases one reads , the more apparent it becomes that the whole " justice " system is a joke in this country .
Even in the rarest of cases where one cop testifies in court that a shooting by a colleague was unprovoked , such as the horrific case in Vanderhoof , B.C. , the judge still let 's the killer go free ... and back to work .
The only time cops seem to get charged and convicted is when they get caught stealing and / or dealing drugs .
That 's right , drugs bad , brutalizing and even killing members of the public , ok .
Hit - and - run drunk driving causing death ( with your own kids in the car ! ) , as one of the four cops who killed Dziekanski is now accused of , is pretty unacceptable too .
Though I can almost guarantee he 'll get a light sentence because he 's a cop .
Should n't it be the other way around ?
Throw the book at him because he 's a cop and should know better than anyone else .
Either way , what a guy - killing two innocent people in just one short year .
Embarrassing ...
To Say The Least
Really now , think about it , should n't the RCMP be extremely embarrassed by the fact that four of their highly - trained officers could n't handle a 40 - year - old man , armed with nothing more than a stapler , in any other way than by tasering him five times and then jumping on him , causing his death ?
Far from embarrassment , however , the RCMP seem to have little regret .
In fact , it 's totally mindboggling to read RCMP statements about the case and see how incredibly arrogant they are in their belief that they are faultless and that their officers performed to absolute perfection .
As always , it seems that it was the victim's own fault ( and , man , you can't get much more pathetic than actually trying to blame Dziekanski for his own death - but that 's exactly what they , along with the prosecutors , seem to be doing ) .
A Clear Message
The prosecutors say the tasers contributed to , but did n't cause Dziekanski 's death .
But that 's hardly the point here .
It 's not whether the tasers killed him or not , what 's certain is that the actions of the cops did .
If they had n't handled the situation in such a violent way Dziekanski would still be alive and enjoying his new life in Canada today .
Finally , just let me say what a great message I think this sends to all the other cops out there .
If you approach an unarmed man with his hands raised who is n't resisting arrest in any way , you can brutally take him down ... and if he dies in the process , so be it , you 'll face no repercussions whatsoever .
One thing is absolutely clear , though , and that 's that the RCMP and the entire " justice " system is set up to protect the police and not the public .
Anyone who follows the news on a regular basis and could still argue with that statement is either willingly ignorant or staggeringly blind .
One other thing no one can argue with is that three of those four cops who used " reasonable and necessary " force against Dziekanski are out there " protecting " us right at this very moment .
Almost makes you want to move to Greece .

Democrats ' ' Battered Wife Syndrome '
In recent years , the Washington political dynamic has often resembled an abusive marriage , in which the bullying husband ( the Republicans ) slaps the wife and kids around , and the battered wife ( the Democrats ) makes excuses and hides the ugly bruises from outsiders to keep the family together .

So , when the Republicans are in a position of power , they throw their weight around , break the rules , and taunt : “ Whaddya gonna do ‘ bout it ? ”
Then , when the Republicans do the political equivalent of passing out on the couch , the Democrats use their time in control , tiptoeing around , tidying up the house and cringing at every angry grunt from the snoring figure on the couch .
This pattern , which now appears to be repeating itself with President Barack Obama ’s unwillingness to hold ex-President George W. Bush and his subordinates accountable for a host of crimes including torture , may have had its origins 40 years ago in Campaign 1968 when the Vietnam War was raging .
President Lyndon Johnson felt he was on the verge of achieving a negotiated peace settlement when he learned in late October 1968 that operatives working for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon were secretly sabotaging the Paris peace talks .
Nixon , who was getting classified briefings on the talks ’ progress , feared that an imminent peace accord might catapult Vice President Hubert Humphrey to victory .
So , Nixon ’s team sent secret messages to South Vietnamese leaders offering them a better deal if they boycotted Johnson ’s talks and helped Nixon to victory , which they agreed to do .
Johnson learned about Nixon ’s gambit through wiretaps of the South Vietnamese embassy and he confronted Nixon by phone ( only to get an unconvincing denial ) .
At that point , Johnson knew his only hope was to expose Nixon ’s maneuver which Johnson called “ treason ” since it endangered the lives of a half million American soldiers in the war zone .
As a Christian Science Monitor reporter sniffed out the story and sought confirmation , Johnson consulted Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford about whether to expose Nixon ’s ploy right before the election .
Both Rusk and Clifford urged Johnson to stay silent .
In what would become a Democratic refrain in the years ahead , Clifford said in a Nov. 4 , 1968 , conference call that “ Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I ’m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [ Nixon ] elected .
It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our country ’s interests . ”
So , Johnson stayed silent “ for the good of the country ” ; Nixon eked out a narrow victory over Humphrey ; the Vietnam War continued for another four years with an additional 20,763 U.S. dead and 111,230 wounded and more than a million more Vietnamese killed .
Over the years , as bits and pieces of this story have dribbled out – including confirmation from audiotapes released by the LBJ Library in December 2008 – the Democrats and the mainstream news media have never made much out of Nixon ’s deadly treachery .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Significance of Nixon ’s Treason . ” ]
The Watergate Exception
The one exception to this pattern of the Democrats ’ “ battered wife syndrome ” may have been the Watergate case in which Nixon sought to secure his second term , in part , by spying on his political rivals , including putting bugs on phones at the Democratic National Committee .
When Nixon ’s team was caught in a second break - in – trying to add more bugs – the scandal erupted .
Even then , however , key Democrats , such as Democratic National Chairman Robert Strauss , tried to shut down the Watergate investigation as it was expanding early in Nixon ’s second term .
Strauss argued that the inquiries would hurt the country , but enough other Democrats and an energized Washington press corps overcame the resistance .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
With Nixon ’s Watergate - compelled resignation in August 1974 , the Republicans were at a crossroads .
In one direction , they could start playing by the rules and seek to be a responsible political party .
Or they could internalize Nixon ’s pugnacious style and build an infrastructure to punish anyone who tried to hold them accountable in the future .
Essentially , the Republicans picked option two .
Under the guidance of Nixon ’s Treasury Secretary William Simon , right - wing foundations collaborated to build a powerful new infrastructure , pooling resources to finance right - wing publications , think tanks and anti-journalism attack groups .
As this infrastructure took shape in the late 1970s , it imbued the Republicans with more confidence .
So , before Election 1980 , the Republican campaign – bolstered by former CIA operatives loyal to former CIA Director George H.W. Bush – resorted to Nixon - style tactics in exploiting President Jimmy Carter ’s failure to free 52 American hostages then held in Iran .
The evidence is now overwhelming that Republican operatives , including campaign chief Bill Casey and some of his close associates , had back - channel contacts with Iran ’s Islamic regime and other foreign governments to confound Carter ’s hostage negotiations .
Though much of this evidence has seeped out over the past 29 years , some was known in real time .
For instance , Iran ’s acting foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh told Agence France Press on Sept. 6 , 1980 , that he knew that Republican candidate Ronald Reagan was “ trying to block a solution ” to the hostage impasse .
Senior Carter administration officials , such as National Security Council aide Gary Sick , also were hearing rumors about Republican interference , and President Carter concluded that Israel ’s hard - line Likud leaders had “ cast their lot with Reagan , ” according to notes I found of a congressional task force interview with Carter a dozen years later .
Carter traced the Israeli opposition to him to a “ lingering concern [ among ]
Jewish leaders that I was too friendly with Arabs . ”
Israel already had begun playing a key middleman role in delivering secret military shipments to Iran , as Carter knew .
But – again for “ the good of the country ” – Carter and his White House kept silent .
Since the first anniversary of the hostage crisis coincidentally fell on Election Day 1980 , Reagan benefited from the voters ' anger over the national humiliation and scored a resounding victory .
[ For more details on the 1980 “ October Surprise ” case , see Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
GOP ’s Growing Confidence
Though much of the public saw Reagan as a tough guy who had frightened the Iranians into surrendering the hostages on Inauguration Day 1981 , the behind - the - scenes reality was different .
In secret , the Reagan administration winked at Israeli weapons shipments to Iran in the first half of 1981 , what appeared to be a payoff for Iran ’s cooperation in sabotaging Carter .
Nicholas Veliotes , who was then assistant secretary of state , told a PBS interviewer that he saw those secret shipments as an outgrowth of the covert Republican - Iranian contacts from the campaign .
Veliotes added that those early shipments then became the “ germs ” of the later Iran - Contra arms - for - hostages scandal .
But the Republicans seemed to have little to fear from exposure .
Their media infrastructure was rapidly expanding – for instance , the right - wing Washington Times opened in 1982 – and America ’s Left did n’t see the need to counter this growing media power on the Right .
The right - wing attack groups also had success targeting mainstream journalists who dug up information that did n’t fit with Reagan 's propaganda themes – the likes of the New York Times Raymond Bonner , whose brave reporting about right - wing death squads in Central America led to his recall from the region and his resignation from the Times .
This new right - wing muscle , combined with Ronald Reagan ’s political popularity , made Democrats and mainstream journalists evermore hesitant to pursue negative stories about Republican policies , including evidence that Reagan ’s favorite “ freedom fighters , ” the Nicaraguan contras , were dabbling in cocaine trafficking and that an illegal contra-aid operation was set up inside the White House .
In mid-1986 , when my Associated Press colleague Brian Barger and I put together a story citing two dozen sources about the work of NSC official Oliver North , congressional Democrats were hesitant to follow up on the disclosures .
Finally in August 1986 , the House Intelligence Committee , then chaired by Democrat Lee Hamilton and including Republican Rep. Dick Cheney , met with North and other White House officials in the Situation Room and were told that the AP story was untrue .
With no further investigation , the Democratic - led committee accepted the word of North and his superiors .
Lucky Exposure
It was only an unlikely occurrence on Oct. 5 , 1986 , the shooting down of one of North ’s supply planes over Nicaragua and a confession by the one survivor , Eugene Hasenfus , that put the House Intelligence Committee ’s gullibility into focus .
The plane shoot - down – and disclosures from the Middle East about secret U.S. arms sales to Iran – forced the Iran - Contra scandal into public view .
The congressional Democrats responded by authorizing a joint House - Senate investigation , with Hamilton as one of the mild - mannered co-chairs and Cheney again leading the GOP ’s tough - guy defense .
While the Republicans worked to undermine the investigation , the Democrats looked for a bipartisan solution that would avoid a messy confrontation with President Reagan and Vice President Bush .
That solution was to put most of the blame on North and a few of his superiors , such as NSC adviser John Poindexter and the then - deceased CIA Director Bill Casey .
The congressional investigation also made a hasty decision , supported by Hamilton and the Republicans but opposed by most Democrats , to give limited immunity to secure the testimony of North .
Hamilton agreed to this immunity without knowing what North would say .
Rather than show any contrition , North used his immunized testimony to rally Republicans and other Americans in support of Reagan ’s aggressive , above - the - law tactics .
The immunity also crippled later attempts by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh to hold North and Poindexter accountable under the law .
Though Walsh won convictions against the pair in federal court , the judgments were overturned by right - wing judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals citing the immunity granted by Congress .
By the early 1990s , the pattern was set .
Whenever new evidence emerged of Republican wrongdoing – such as disclosures about contra - drug trafficking , secret military support for Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and those early Republican - Iran contacts of 1980 – the Republicans would lash out in fury and the Democrats would try to calm things down .
Lee Hamilton became the Republicans ’ favorite Democratic investigator because he exemplified this approach of conducting “ bipartisan ” investigations , rather than aggressively pursuing the facts wherever they might lead .
While in position to seek the truth , Hamilton ignored the contra - drug scandal and swept the Iraq - gate and October Surprise issues under a very lumpy rug .
In 1992 , I interviewed Spencer Oliver , a Democratic staffer whose phone at the Watergate building had been bugged by Nixon ’s operatives 20 years earlier .
Since then , Oliver had served as the chief counsel on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and had observed this pattern of Republican abuses and Democratic excuses .
Oliver said : “ What [ the Republicans ] learned from Watergate was not ‘ do n’t do it , ’ but ‘ cover it up more effectively . ’
They have learned that they have to frustrate congressional oversight and press scrutiny in a way that will avoid another major scandal . ”
The Clinton Opportunity
The final chance for exposing the Republican crimes of the 1980s fell to Bill Clinton after he defeated President George H.W. Bush in 1992 .
Before leaving office , however , Bush - 41 torpedoed the ongoing Iran - Contra criminal investigation by issuing six pardons , including one to former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger whose cover - up trial was set to begin in early 1993 .
Special prosecutor Walsh – a lifelong Republican albeit from the old Eisenhower wing of the party – denounced the pardons as another obstruction of justice .
" George Bush 's misuse of the pardon power made the cover - up complete , " Walsh later wrote in his book Firewall .
However , the Iran - Contra investigation was not yet dead .
Indeed ,
Walsh was considering empanelling a new grand jury .
Walsh also had come to suspect that the origins of the scandal traced back to the October Surprise of 1980 , with his investigators questioning former CIA officer Donald Gregg about his alleged role in that prequel to Iran - Contra .
The new Democratic President could have helped Walsh by declassifying key documents that the Reagan - Bush - 41 team had withheld from various investigations .
But Clinton followed advice from Hamilton and other senior Democrats who feared stirring partisan anger among Republicans .
Later , in a May 1994 conversation with documentary filmmaker Stuart Sender , Clinton explained that he had opposed pursuing these Republican scandals because , according to Sender , “ he was going to try to work with these guys , compromise , build working relationships . …
“ It seemed even at the time terribly naïve that these same Republicans were going to work with him if he backed off on congressional hearings or possible independent prosecutor investigations . ”
[ See Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
No Reciprocity
But the Democrats – like the battered wife who keeps hoping her abusive husband will change – found a different reality as the decade played out .
Rather than thanking Clinton , the Republicans bullied him with endless investigations about his family finances , the ethics of his appointees – and his personal morality , ultimately impeaching him in 1998 for lying about a sexual affair ( though he survived the Senate trial in 1999 ) .
After the impeachment battle , the Republicans – joined by both the right - wing and mainstream news media – kept battering Clinton and his heir apparent , Vice President Al Gore , who was mocked for his choice of clothing and denounced for his supposed exaggerations .
Though Gore still managed to win the popular vote in Election 2000 and apparently would have prevailed if all legally cast votes had been counted in Florida , the Republicans made clear that was n’t going to happen , even dispatching rioters from Washington to disrupt a recount in Miami .
George W. Bush ’s bullying victory – which was finalized by five Republican partisans on the U.S. Supreme Court – was met with polite acceptance by the Democrats who again seemed to hope for the best from the newly empowered Republicans .
[ For details on Election 2000 , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Instead , after the 9/11 attacks , Bush - 43 grabbed unprecedented powers ; he authorized torture and warrantless wiretaps ; he pressured Democrats into accepting an unprovoked war in Iraq ; and he sought to damage his critics , such as former Ambassador Joseph Wilson .
Now , after eight destructive years , the Democrats have again gained control of the White House and Congress , but they seem intent on once more not provoking the Republicans , rather than holding them accountable .
Though President Barack Obama has released some of the key documents underpinning Bush - 43 ’s actions , he opposes any formal commission of inquiry and has discouraged any prosecutions for violations of federal law .
Obama has said he wants “ to look forward as opposed to looking backward . ”
In dismissing the idea of a “ truth and reconciliation commission , ” Obama also recognizes that the Republicans would show no remorse for the Bush administration ’s actions ; that they would insist that there is nothing to “ reconcile ” ; and that they would stay on the attack , pummeling the Democrats as weak , overly sympathetic to terrorists , and endangering national security .
On Thursday , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs admitted as much , saying that Obama rejected the idea of a bipartisan “ truth commission ” because it was apparent that there was no feasible way to get the Republicans to be bipartisan .
“ The President determined the concept did n’t seem altogether workable in this case , ” Gibbs said , citing the partisan atmosphere that already has surrounded the torture issue .
“ The last few days might be evidence of why something like this might just become a political back and forth . ”
In other words , the Republicans are rousing themselves from the couch and getting angry , while the Democrats are prancing about , hands out front , trying to calm things down and avoid a confrontation .
The Democrats hope against hope that if they tolerate the latest Republican outrages maybe there will be some reciprocity , maybe there will be some GOP votes on Democratic policy initiatives .
But there ’s no logical reason to think so .
That is n’t how the Republicans and their right - wing media allies do things ; they simply get angrier because belligerence has worked so well for so long .
On the other hand , Democratic wishful thinking is the essence of this political “ battered wife syndrome , ” dreaming about a behavioral transformation when all the evidence – and four decades of experience – tell you that the bullying husband is n’t going to change .

The idea to embark on this project hatched in November 2004 .
I had been interested in language for a long time and become an avid reader of the numerous linguistics blogs that thrive in the English - speaking segment of the blogosphere .
Six months earlier I had started a bilingual blog of my own .
During the same period , I was working on my web site development and programming skills by learning a little Python and diving into the code of the WordPress blogging tool , which is written in PHP and interfaces with a MySQL Database .
When I became more and more taken with the concept of eggcorns , which had been popping up on my favorite blogs , it occurred to me that it would be useful to collect them in a lexical database with a web interface for entering and retrieving records on individual eggcorns .
After a number of rather pitiful attempts to create such a tool from scratch , I realized that it would be much easier to bend the WordPress blogging software to my needs .
I started customizing ( well , hacking really ) an alpha-version of the code , and the result is the site you are perusing .
But maybe I should briefly explain what eggcorns are .
The word _eggcorn_ was coined collectively by the linguists who write at the excellent group blog Language Log. Linguists collect usage examples .
Unlike language teachers or the often self - styled grammar experts who complain in the press about the decay of English , they are not picky : the actual , real - life use is what counts , and the most interesting bits — those that might reveal something about how real people apprehend their language — often stretch the received rules of correctness .
In September 2003 , Mark Liberman reported ( Egg corns : folk etymology , malapropism , mondegreen , ??? ) an incorrect yet particularly suggestive creation : someone had written “ egg corn ” instead of “ acorn ” .
It turned out that there was no established label for this type of non-standard reshaping .
Erroneous as it may be , the substitution involved more than just ignorance : an acorn is more or less shaped like an egg ; and it is a seed , just like grains of corn .
So if you do n’t know how _acorn_ is spelled , _egg corn_ actually makes sense .
Mark Liberman ’s colleague Geoffrey Pullum chimed in and suggested that this type of linguistic error should be called an _eggcorn_ .
Then Arnold Zwicky , wrote an enlightening article ( Lady Mondegreen says her peace about egg corns ) in which he gave his blessing to the term _eggcorn_ and explained that new labels for spontaneous reshapings of known expressions are sorely needed , and listed the aspects under which eggcorns overlap with but yet differ from known classes of lexical creativity : malapropisms , mondegreens , folk etymologies etc .
Mark Liberman subsequently gave some more thought to eggcorn terminology .
Since then , the Language Log linguists and many others have gone eggcorn - hunting .
Eggcorns have turned out to be surprisingly common : even the seemingly outlandish _egg corn_ is not an individual one - off error , but has been reinvented many times over .
The criteria of how to identify eggcorns have also been clarified .
Not every homophone substitution is an eggcorn .
The crucial element is that the new form makes sense : for anyone except lexicographers or other people trained in etymology , more sense than the original form in many cases .
The more brazen among the eggcorn users may eloquently defend and explain the underlying semantics ( metaphors , metonymies , convincing but erroneous accounts of the supposed history ) .
Thus , thumbs down for _definately_ and _they ’re / there house_ ( not eggcorns , just phonetic misspellings : the non-standard versions do n’t make any more sense than , or reinterpret the meaning of the standard versions ) , but thumbs up for _for all intensive purposes_ .
There are , of course , borderline cases .
For some low - frequency examples it is hard to tell what was going on in the writer ’s mind ; on the other end of the scale we find reshapings that are already so widespread that they frequently occur in journalistic writing or are standard forms in some regional dialects of English .
The latter are not necessarily reinvented every time they occur , but learnt # [ 1 ] .
Some of them will enter the dictionaries , marked as folk etymologies .
The aim of this site is to collect eggcorns and texts that analyze them .
I have found a handful of them myself and am adding speculations and observations where they occur to me , but I do not pretend to be the ultimate source of linguistic wisdom .
Whoever wishes to criticize or to add to what is noted here is very welcome to do so .
Every entry has a comment area for this purpose .
( Turning a blogging tool into a lexical database has certainly advantages . )
I am internally eternally grateful to the Language Log linguists for introducing me to eggcorns , and to several of them for their kindness ; I also thank the denizens of the #wordpress IRC channel for helping me understand the code , teaching me PHP , listening to my obscure talk about semantics of expressions and reanalytical reshapings , and even catching on and starting to collect eggcorns — from their own writing , in a few cases .
Working on this site ( the eggcorn collecting , the coding , and the design ) is enjoyable and instructive .
As I write , the work on the structural elements is still in progress , and new features and improvements will be gradually added .
I hope the friends of the eggcorn will find the Eggcorn Database useful .

As a non-native speaker of English , I can attest to learning _tow the line_ — not in the sense of being taught , but in the sense of picking up this expression and the underlying metaphor as what I presumed to be standard English .
There once was a time when you had to pull out your engine and hardwire it to a dynamometer to get power and torque measurements at the crankshaft or put your ride on a drive roller and use a chassis dynamometer to get stats on power delivered to the wheel .
That ’s so like 2007 .
Now , thanks to the Apple iPhone and a team of gear - head developers at BunsenTech , an application aptly named Dynolicious handles all this for the everyday performance junky and amateur racer set .
Dynolicious provides all the specs you need to match your ride against your homie .
Some of the main highlights include 0 - 60 mph times ( as well as 0 - 100 mph ) , quarter mile elapsed and trap times , lateral G’s and Braking G’s ( both current and peak ) as well as wheel horsepower and estimate engine horsepower .
Not only does it grab all this awesome data but actually shows it to you in a way that make sense to regular folk who are not statisticians .
You get real - time speedometer and friction circle readings with graphs , the ability to review info for your latest run ( or any run you have saved in the past ) as well as the option to compare different cars or particular dates if you want to see what that new bolt - on Comptech supercharger does for your performance .
Going the traditional route , each hop on a dyno will typically set you back at least $ 100 bucks plus additional fees for various add - on services and test data .
The Dynolicious app will only set you back $ 12.99 and you can run it all the time ( not necessary recommended if you actually want to have some battery juice left to talk . )
But you get the point .
So , how can this little dynamo provide so much for so little ?
Accelerometers can determine orientation , vibration and shocks by detecting the magnitude and direction of acceleration .
And the iPhone uses a 3 - axis accelerometer to accurately calculate all of the various parameters required .
For me , the iPhone ’s Dynolicious might be the “ killer app ” that finally forces me to give up my Blackberry Curve , which does e-mail great , but in the car basically just slides around my dash .

The revised Plan accelerates the timeline for a number of important actions and makes deeper cuts in several key areas of GM 's operations , with the objective to make us a leaner , faster , and more customer - focused organization going forward .
Significant changes include :
* A focus on four core brands in the U.S. - Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC - with fewer nameplates and a more competitive level of marketing support per brand .
* A more aggressive restructuring of GM's U.S. dealer organization to better focus dealer resources for improved sales and customer service .
* Improved U.S. capacity utilization through accelerated idling and closures of powertrain , stamping , and assembly plants .
* Lower structural costs , which GM North America ( GMNA ) projects will enable it to breakeven ( on an adjusted EBIT basis ) at a U.S. total industry volume of approximately 10 million vehicles , based on the pricing and share assumptions in the plan .
This rate is substantially below the 15 to 17 million annual vehicle sales rates recorded from 1995 through 2007 .
" We are taking tough but necessary actions that are critical to GM 's long - term viability , " said Fritz Henderson , GM president and CEO .
" Our responsibility is clear - to secure GM 's future - and we intend to succeed .
At the same time , we also understand the impact these actions will have on our employees , dealers , unions , suppliers , shareholders , bondholders , and communities , and we will do whatever we can to mitigate the effects on the extended GM team . "
Fewer U.S. brands , nameplates , and dealers
As part of the revised Viability Plan and the need to move faster and further , GM in the U.S. will focus its resources on four core brands , Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC .
The Pontiac brand will be phased out by the end of 2010 .
GM will offer a total of 34 nameplates in 2010 , a reduction of 29 percent from 48 nameplates in 2008 , reflecting both the reduction in brands and continued emphasis on fewer and stronger entries .
This four - brand strategy will enable GM to better focus its new product development programs and provide more competitive levels of market support .
The revised plan moves up the resolution of Saab , Saturn , and Hummer to the end of 2009 , at the latest .
Updates on these brands will be provided as these initiatives progress .
Working with its dealers , GM anticipates reducing its U.S. dealer count from 6,246 in 2008 to 3,605 by the end of 2010 , a reduction of 42 percent .
This is a further reduction of 500 dealers , and four years sooner , than in the February 17 Plan .
The goal is to accomplish this reduction in an orderly , cost - effective , and customer - focused way .
This reduction in U.S. dealers will allow for a more competitive dealer network and higher sales effectiveness in all markets .
More details on these initiatives will be provided in May .
Sales volume and market share projections
The Viability Plan anticipates improved financial results despite more conservative U.S. sales volume expectations going forward .
The lower volume expectations are the result of managing the business with fewer nameplates and dealers , leaner inventories , and reduced market share .
To address the inventory issue , GM on April 23 announced U.S. production schedule reductions of approximately 190,000 vehicles during the second and early third quarters of 2009 .
The Viability Plan also reduces GM 's market share projections to adjust for the impact of the brand and dealer consolidation , as well as for the short - term impact of speculation regarding a GM bankruptcy .
The plan assumes a 19.5 percent share in 2009 , with share stabilizing in the 18.4 to 18.9 percent range in subsequent years .
" We have strong new product coming for our four core brands : the Chevrolet Camaro , Equinox , Cruze and Volt ; Buick LaCrosse ; GMC Terrain ; and Cadillac SRX and CTS Sport Wagon and Coupe , " said Henderson .
" A tighter focus by GM and its dealers will help give these products the capital investment , marketing and advertising support they need to be truly successful . "
Lower structural costs , lower breakeven point
The Viability Plan also lowers GMNA 's breakeven volume to a U.S. annual industry volume of 10 million total vehicles , based on the pricing and share assumptions in the plan .
This lower breakeven point ( at an adjusted EBIT level ) better positions GM to generate positive cash flow and earn an adequate return on capital over the course of a normal business cycle , a requirement set forth by the U.S. Treasury in its March 30 viability plan assessment .
GM will lower its breakeven point by cutting its structural costs faster and deeper than had previously been planned :
* Manufacturing : Consistent with the mandate to accelerate restructuring , we plan to reduce the total number of assembly , powertrain , and stamping plants in the U.S. from 47 in 2008 to 34 by the end of 2010 , a reduction of 28 percent , and to 31 by 2012 .
This would reflect the acceleration of six plant idling / closures from the February 17 plan , and one additional plant idling .
Throughout this transition , GM will continue to implement its flexible global manufacturing strategy ( GMS ) , which allows multiple body styles and architectures to be built in one plant .
This enables GM to use its capital more efficiently , increase capacity utilization , and respond more quickly to market shifts .
* Employment : U.S. hourly employment levels are projected to be reduced from about 61,000 in 2008 to 40,000 in 2010 , a 34 percent reduction , and level off at about 38,000 starting in 2011 .
This further planned reduction of an additional 7,000 to 8,000 employees from the February 17 Plan is primarily the result of the previously discussed operational efficiencies , nameplate reductions , and plant closings .
GM also anticipates a further decline in salaried and executive employment as it continues to assess its structure and execute the Viability Plan .
More details will be announced as soon as they are finalized with the various stakeholders .
* Labor costs : The Viability Plan assumes a reduction of U.S. hourly labor costs from $ 7.6 billion in 2008 to $ 5 billion in 2010 , a 34 percent reduction .
GM will continue to work with its UAW partners to accomplish this through a reduction in total U.S. hourly employment as well as through modifications in the collective bargaining agreement .
As a result of these and other actions , GMNA 's structural costs are projected to decline 25 percent , from $ 30.8 billion in 2008 to $ 23.2 billion in 2010 , a further decline of $ 1.8 billion by 2010 versus the February 17 Plan .
Strengthening GM 's balance sheet
Another key element of GM 's restructuring will be taking the necessary actions to strengthen its balance sheet .
GM today took an important step in improving its balance sheet by launching a bond exchange offer for approximately $ 27 billion of its unsecured public debt .
If successful , the bond exchange would result in the conversion of a large majority of this debt to equity .
" A stronger balance sheet would free the company to invest in the products and technologies of the future , " Henderson said .
" It will also help provide stability and security to our customers , our dealers , our employees , and our suppliers . "
Another important part of improving the balance sheet will be the ongoing discussions with the UAW to modify the terms of the Voluntary Employee Benefit Association ( VEBA ) , and with the U.S. Treasury regarding possible conversion of its debt to equity .
The current bond exchange offer is conditioned on the converting to equity of at least 50 percent of GM 's outstanding U.S. Treasury debt at June 1 , 2009 , and at least 50 percent of GM 's future financial obligations to the new VEBA .
GM expects a debt reduction of at least $ 20 billion between the two actions .
In total , the U.S. Treasury debt conversion , VEBA modification and bond exchange could result in at least $ 44 billion in debt reduction .
Throughout the Plan , GM will continue to make significant investment in future products and new technologies , with an investment of $ 5.4 billion in 2009 , and investments ranging from $ 5.3 to $ 6.7 billion from 2010 to 2014 .
Very importantly , development and testing of the Chevy Volt extended - range electric car remains on track for start of production by the end of 2010 and arrival in Chevrolet dealer showrooms soon thereafter .
" The Viability Plan reflects the direction of President Obama and the U.S. Treasury that GM should go further and faster on our restructuring , " Henderson said .
" We appreciate their support and direction .
This stronger , leaner business model will enable GM to keep doing what it does best - provide great new cars , trucks and crossovers to our customers , and continue to develop new advanced propulsion technologies that are vital for our country 's economy and environment . "

Drupal , the popular , open source , content management system ( CMS ) so far has grown mostly by way of its community roots .
But Tom Erickson , the newly appointed CEO at Drupal 's lead commercial sponsor , Acquia , believes that the commercial enterprise can grow the community , too .
That could further compound the success that Drupal has already seen , having been tapped by NASA , Sony , MTV , Mozilla and others , as well as a number of community Web sites .
Erickson , who has also held the position of chairman since October , previously served as CEO at Systinet , a player in service - oriented architecture software that Mercury Interactive acquired in 2006 .
He replaces co-founder Jay Batson , who will stay with the firm in another management role , the company said .
In addition , Erickson 's appointment as Acquia 's new CEO is n't the only major development for Drupal this week .
Acquia also rolled out a new search service for Drupal Web sites , cloud - based hosting , and new Drupal application stacks .
The plan is that new releases will give Acquia a greater competitive edge against commercial competitors while providing additional support for its open source code base .
" Up until now , much of the focus around Acquia has been on serving the existing , large Drupal community , " Erickson told InternetNews.com .
" We believe ... we can now make the community larger and do more outreach to people that are non-Drupal users today . "
Acquia launched a year ago with $ 7 million in venture capital with the aim of providing a commercially supported version of Drupal .
Since then , Acquia 's release of Drupal includes the core CMS components while adding in additional modules and testing .
Acquia is now going a few steps further with its Drupal Stack Installers , which aim to make it easier for enterprises to deploy Drupal .
The installers provide what Erickson referred to as the complete " DAMP " stack -- referring to Drupal , the Apache Web server , the MySQL database and the PHP dynamic language .
Previously , users had to have each stack component installed on their own .
Initially , Acquia is only providing the stack for Mac and Windows users , though a Linux version is targeted for release by the end of the year .
Erickson said Acquia could afford to delay a Linux version because it said Linux users are often more sophisticated , and typically already have what they need to run Drupal .
CMS in the cloud
New cloud - based services are also key to Acquia 's growth plans for Drupal .
The company this week unveiled Hosted Drupal , delivered through Amazon 's EC2 cloud service .
The offering is targeted at the largest Drupal users , and is n't intended to compete against the broader Drupal ecosystem of hosting providers that tend to deal with small and midsized sites , Erickson said .
He was unable to provide specific pricing for the hosted services .
Acquia will also be turning to Amazon 's EC2 cloud service to handle its new cloud - based search service for Drupal sites as well .
Existing Drupal installations already have a myriad of search option available by way of add - ons .
But Erickson argued that Acquia Search will be doing something different , and more potent .
At the heart of Acquia 's hosted search is the Apache Solr search platform , which will give users a facetted search that includes a sidebar menu for filtering and narrowing down results quickly .
Initially , he said Acquia will be making the service available for free as it tries to figure out what it 's worth .
But it wo n't be tapping at least one way to make money from the service : Erickson said Acquia is n't considering exploring contextual search advertising as part of the offering .
Drupal 's next steps
In addition to a future Linux version of the Drupal Stack , Erickson said Acquia and Drupal have plenty in store in the near future .
For one thing , a virtualization - ready version is in the works -- as an appliance .
" We are going to target virtualization , but we will target it together with hardware manufacturers , " Erickson said .
But continuing to press ahead with Acquia 's strategy costs money .
And while Erickson claimed that year - old Acquia is already seeing revenues , but it 's not yet cash - flow positive -- and likely wo n't be until 2010 .
To get there , he said Acquia will be targeting a number of different avenues , including customers migrating from proprietary players and enterprises using home - grown content management systems .
He also said that having commercial support and services for Drupal would continue to make it more attractive to those that might not otherwise consider an open source solution .
" Some have a false notion of what open source is , " he said .
" They have a view that open source is not an organized group with proven solutions that are tested .
Now , with an enterprise like Acquia , we 're helping to make sure that there is testing . "
As President Barack Obama marks his 100th day in office today , we 've set out to grade the 44th president 's performance on the bread - and - butter issues near and dear to Wired.com : copyright , cyber security , science , net neutrality , transparency and privacy .
Obama scored high marks in some , but in others he may have to go to summer school .
Copyright : D
The president has brought at least five Recording Industry Association of America lawyers into the Justice Department , placing two of them in the number 2 and number 3 spots .
Obama 's Justice Department has also weighed in on an RIAA file sharing lawsuit , supporting the Copyright Act 's civil damages of up to $ 150,000 per purloined music track .
The Bush administration had taken the same position .
Obama is also negotiating the so - called Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a global intellectual property treaty that got underway during the Bush administration .
Obama declared the inner-workings of the treaty a national security issue , as did his predecessor , by refusing Freedom of Information
Act requests to divulge any clear details of the measure .
Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks suggest the proposed act would require internet service providers to terminate repeat copyright scofflaws , criminalize peer - to - peer file sharing , subject iPods to border searches and even interfere with the legitimate sale of brand - name pharmaceutical products .
Meanwhile , Vice President Joe Biden says Obama is searching for the nation 's first copyright czar , a cabinet - level position created by Congress to be on par with the drug czar .
Others are n't so sure of our grade .
" It 's more Obama is cutting class than a particular grade , " says Fred von Lohmann , a copyright attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" I think the administration is facing more important priorities than copyright law right now .
The economy is the most obvious issue right now . "
Cyber security : C
Obama commissioned a 60 - day review of the nation 's cyber security by Melissa Hathaway , the acting senior director for cyberspace .
Though it has n't been released , the review likely recommends the appointment of a so - called cyber - security czar .
" It requires leading from the top , from the White House , to departments and agencies , state , local , tribal governments , the C - Suite and to the local classroom and library , " Hathaway said during the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco last week .
What that ultimately means is unclear .
But what is clear is that the government does not have a policy – at least a public policy – on how to respond to cyber intrusions , real or imagined .
The policy vacuum has been filled by an inter-agency battle for control of the cyber security mission , complete with the anonymous planting of scary news stories about Chinese government hackers plotting to destoy parts of the U.S. electric grid .
In March , DHS cyber chief Rod Beckstrom resigned over concerns that the secretive National Security Agency would wind up in charge .
Given the NSA 's recent history of extrajudicial domestic spying , we 'd rather see cyber security handled by the IRS .
Science : A-
On Monday , Obama pledged to spend 3 percent of gross domestic product , about $ 420 billion , on science .
He said that global warming was a threat to public health .
Certainly , the environment has gotten no cleaner during Obama 's first 100 days .
But he ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to review the Bush administration 's refusal to allow California , the District of Columbia and 12 other states to set more stringent auto emission standards than those imposed by the federal government .
And on Tuesday , the president asked Congress for $ 1.5 billion to produce vaccines , rebuild anti-viral stockpiles and respond to the swine flu outbreak .
Among some of Obama 's top science appointments include Lisa Jackson , to be chairwoman of the Environmental Protection Agency .
As a New Jersey state EPA administrator , she was part of a movement to roll back greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent .
Then there 's Energy Secretary Steven Chu , the Nobel - laureate for physics , who supports solar power , biofuels and other forms of alternative energy .
" I want to be sure that facts are driving scientific decisions , not the other way around , " Obama said .
Net Neutrality : B +
If Ben Scott , the policy director of Free Press is n't complaining , neither can we .
He tells us he 's satisfied with the president 's actions for the first 100 days insofar as net neutrality is concerned , although it is taking a back seat to the global financial meltdown .
Free Press was the group responsible for getting the Federal Communications Commission last year to order Comcast to stop throttling BitTorrent traffic .
Scott , seen at right , supports Obama 's nomination of Julias Genachowski as FCC chairman , which Congress has yet to approve .
Genachowski and Obama advocated ( .pdf ) network neutrality during the election .
The $ 7 billion in broadband stimulus money requires recipients to act under net neutrality rules , which mandates a non-discrimination policy against internet protocols , like BitTorrent , which is a bandwidth hog and often used to pirate copyrighted works .
" While you can be a stickler and say net neutrality is a priority , I 'm inclined to give him a little slack , " Scott said .
" There are other pressing issues as well . "
Transparency : B -
We were initially skeptical of Obama 's promise of government transparency .
Then we watched in awe as a slew of longstanding Freedom of Information
Act requests were approved – requests that were stonewalled during the Bush administration .
Among the most controversial documents released included dozens of memos surrounding the Bush administration 's torture tactics and the legal rationale for them .
The government also just released Apple chief Steve Jobs ' 2008 SEC deposition about stock option backdating after Forbes demanded it through a FOIA claim .
The government , responding to a FOIA claim by Wired.com , unveiled internal documents detailing a sophisticated FBI spyware used to disrupt hackers and extortion plots .
It 's not all good , of course .
There was the White House 's ridiculous claim of " national security " for declining a FOIA request concerning the ACTA intellectual property treaty .
The claim was made worse when the government released a brief summary of the plan that basically said nothing .
Then there was the FBI failure to release documents explaining the privacy policy for its Investigative Data Warehouse , a multi-billion - document clearinghouse of data about suspects and individuals named in the agency 's investigations .
All the while , the FBI is seeking new funding to use the database for " link analysis " and " pattern analysis " to analyze relationships between the names of those in the database .
That said , on a government operational level , Obama has enacted some meaningful executive orders , including policies casting some sunshine on official meetings with lobbyists and government officials , and slowing the revolving door of those officials becoming lobbyists themselves .
" He 's instructed the Office and Management and Budget to be more transparent going forward .
He 's instructed the Office of Government Ethics to study ways to better disclose procurement lobbying , " said Matthew Sanderson , the former chief finance counsel for the McCain - Palin campaign .
Privacy : D -
Justice Department lawyers in Washington are arguing that the Fourth Amendment provision against unreasonable searches and seizures does not apply to so - called cell - site data .
Such data , which is maintained by mobile phone carriers for up to 180 days , chronicles the physical locations of where mobile phone calls were placed .
In a case pending before a federal appeals court , which began under Bush , the Obama administration says no warrant is required to obtain that data , which can be used in a criminal prosecution .
And just days after Obama 's inauguration , the new administration began echoing its predecessor when it came to surveillance .
The newest administration urged a federal judge to reject a lawsuit challenging whether a sitting president can bypass Congress and secretly authorize warrantless wiretapping , as Bush did following the 2001 terror attacks .
And it should come as no surprise that Obama is also seeking to dismiss a lawsuit against the nation 's telecommunications companies accused of being complicit in Bush 's once - secret spy program .
Obama voted for the legislation immunizing the telcos in July , when he was a senator from Illinois .
The legislation , by the way , generally granted congressional approval to Bush 's spy program , allowing the warrantless electronic eavesdropping on Americans in the United States if they are communicating overseas with somebody the government believes is involved in terrorism .
Obama even touted the Bush line in a lawsuit brought by five CIA prisoners who allege they were transported overseas where they were tortured .
Both administrations invoked the so - called state secrets privilege , a legal nicety that usually involves a judge automatically dismissing a lawsuit because it could expose national security issues .
But a federal appeals court on Tuesday , at least temporarily , rejected that assertion in a legal challenge to what is known as an " extraordinary rendition " kidnapping program .
" According to the government ’s theory , the judiciary should effectively cordon off all secret government actions from judicial scrutiny , immunizing the CIA and its partners from the demands and limits of the law , " judge Michael Daly Hawkins of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , wrote Tuesday .
" The subject matter of this action … is not a state secret , and the case should not have been dismissed at the outset . "
Mr. President , this is going on your permanent record .

BBC Sport in Bahrain
Brawn driver Jenson Button won the Bahrain Grand Prix to secure his third victory in four races this season .
Button started fourth but was up to third by the start of the second lap , crucially fighting off a challenge from Lewis Hamilton 's improving McLaren .
Button chased the leading Toyotas hard early on and moved into a lead he never lost when they made their pit stops .
Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel was second from Toyota 's Jarno Trulli as Hamilton had his best finish of 2009 in fourth .
Hamilton 's fast start , made possible by the Kers power - boost system on his McLaren , catapulted him ahead of Vettel on the run down to the first corner and was crucial in deciding the result of the race .
Despite starting third and fourth , Vettel and Button were the favourites for victory once the drivers ' respective fuel loads were taken into account .
And the pace of the two cars was close enough over a race stint to suggest that it would have been a close race .
With Glock passing pole - sitter Trulli off the line for the lead , Hamilton rocketed into third , with Button also slipping ahead of Vettel .
The first lap was so important as I knew Vettel was going long - but I made it work and I was up to third by the end of that lap , so I was delighted
Jenson Button
Then , in the decisive moment of the race , Button was able to take advantage of a mistake by Hamilton at the end of the first lap to pass the McLaren impressively and move into third place at Turn One on the second lap .
That meant Button was able to lap at his maximum potential for his entire first stint , trailing the Toyotas at a few seconds ' distance , while Vettel 's pace was compromised in the early laps by Hamilton .
Consequently , Button emerged in the lead after the first pit stops and was able rapidly to extend his advantage while Vettel was held up behind Trulli .
The Italian and the German were nose - to - tail , with Hamilton right behind them , until the McLaren and the Toyota made their second and final stops on lap 37 .
That released Vettel , who had a 10.5 - second lead over Button when the Brawn emerged from its pit stop .
With only three laps before his own stop , Vettel had nowhere near enough time to try to erode Button 's advantage .
He did , though , make up enough ground to emerge ahead of Trulli .
" This is a good point for the team , " said Vettel .
" I was very surprised when Lewis [ Hamilton ] came up beside me on the first lap and later on I just did not have the tyres to attack and do any better . "
Button cruised to a comfortable victory - extending his championship lead to 12 points , while Vettel fought off a challenge from Trulli in the closing laps .
" This was a tough race this weekend , we have n't had the pace advantage we did have - other teams have caught up with or even overtaken us , " said Button after the race .
" The first lap was so important today because I knew Vettel was going long - but I made it work and I was up to third by the end of that lap so I was delighted . "
Toyota had chosen a different tyre strategy from the other leading teams .
They chose to get the slower ' medium ' tyres out of the way in their middle stint and fit the faster ' super - soft ' tyres for the final part of the race , as they were not sure if the softer tyres would last .
The others all chose to save the ' medium ' tyres until the final stint , and McLaren in particular proved that - for the overall race strategy - it worked out to be a better ploy .
As such , though Trulli's Toyota running on ' softs ' meant he was faster than Vettel in the final 16 laps of the race and had the Italian right behind his rival , he could not pass the Red Bulls 's Chinese GP winner who managed to hang on for second place .
" I am a little bit disappointed because I was waiting for the first win for Toyota , " he said .
" Unfortunately at the start I had an oil spillage which cost me the position from then on it was a hard race I was following my team - mate I was going longer .
" We did a very long second stint on hard tyres , I was trying to fight and actually it was a really hard fight .
" I was n't extremely quick but I was competitive on hard tyres - then eventually Sebastian took the position after my last stop - then he was on hards and I was on soft , and I was pushing him .
I was quicker but there was no way to overtake him . "
Hamilton followed them home in fourth , slipping backwards in the closing stages on his ' medium ' tyres .
606 : DEBATE Button win ?
Or Toyota loss ?
TAFNA " I am delighted with fourth , " said Hamilton .
" Considering we started fifth we moved up one place , we had a great start .
" But Red Bull , the Toyotas and Brawn are just so fast in the fast corners , I can't keep up with them .
We have a lot of work to do .
" It was a long race , it 's very hot in this heat .
But bit by bit I 'm learning more and I 'm able to give the team a little bit more direction . "
Barrichello was fifth , a three - stop strategy not working out for Button 's team - mate , ahead of the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen , Glock and Fernando Alonso 's Renault .
Toyota 's tyre strategy meant that Raikkonen also had his hands full in the closing laps fighting off Glock .
But he used his Kers power - boost button to good effect to keep the German behind and score Ferrari 's first points of the year .

Here is your utterly insane stat for the weekend :
According to the Chicago Tribune , the median price for a home sold in the month of December 2008 in Motor City is Seven Thousand , Five Hundred dollars .
I had to write it out that way because I simply could n’t wrap my head around the numeral $ 7,500 for a home .
Granted , its in one of the most economically devastated regions of the country , but still — that data point is amazing .
The Trib :
“ It may be tough to get financing for a new car these days , but in Detroit you can buy a house with a credit card .
The median price of a home sold in Detroit in December was $ 7,500 , according to Realcomp , a listing service .
Not $ 75,000 .
Remove a zero — it ’s seven thousand five hundred dollars , substantially less than the lowest - price car on the new - car market .
Among the many dispiriting numbers that bleakly depict the decrepitude of this onetime industrial behemoth , the steep slide of housing values helps define the daunting challenge to anyone who wants to lead this shrinking , poverty - pocked city of about 800,000 people . . .
On a positive note , Detroit ’s homicide rate dropped 14 percent last year .
That prompted mayoral candidate Stanley Christmas to tell the Detroit News recently , “ I do n’t mean to be sarcastic , but there just is n’t anyone left to kill ” . . .
John Mogk , a professor at Wayne State University Law School : “ A thousand people are leaving the city every month and the city does not have the financial resources and the economic base to solve its own problems . ”
Wow , those are just unbelievable numbers . . .

Introduction by Tom Engelhardt
It ’s natural , whether as a website or an individual , to get caught up in issues that are immediate and urgent .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been the focus of so many TomDispatch columns are happening right now .
People are dying now .
The economy is melting down now .
The foreclosed and homeless are waking up now in ever - growing numbers .
Unemployment lines are getting longer as you read this .
Children are hungry this very minute , and the anxiety of a middle - class in freefall is palpable right now almost anywhere you go .
But now and then , it ’s also useful to take a step back and ask some longer term questions .
Even if we could stop the wars , put people back to work ( and back into their homes ) , even if we could get consumers spending again , there ’s always the “ what - for ” question .
What have we accomplished if all we ’ve done is reset the clock on the next war , the next bubble , the next bust … and if , all the while , the ice is melting and the globe warming ?
Chip Ward , a TomDispatch contributor since 2003 , spent 16 years confronting corporations that pollute and run , leaving sickness and suffering in their wake .
He was focused on urgent and immediate tasks that made a difference right away ( and , while he was at it , running a library system in Salt Lake City that was slowly filling up with homeless people ) .
Recently , he took a break and retreated to the remote canyons of southern
Utah where he ’s been reflecting on that bigger picture and , as it happens , on the nature of bigness itself at a moment when “ too big to fail ” is the phrase du jour .

Too Big to Fail
Ecological Ignorance and Economic Collapse
By Chip Ward
“ Too big to fail . ”
It ’s been the mantra of our economic meltdown .
Although meant to emphasize the overwhelming importance of this bank or that corporation , the phrase also unwittingly expresses a shared delusion that may be at the root of our current crises — both economic and ecological .
In nature , nothing is too big to fail .
In fact , big is bound to fail .
To understand why that ’s so means stepping away from a prevailing set of beliefs that holds us in its sway , especially the deep conviction that we operate apart from nature ’s limits and rules .
Here ’s the heart of the matter :
We are ecologically illiterate — not just unfamiliar with the necessary scientific vocabulary and concepts , but spectacularly , catastrophically , tragically dumb .
Oh yes , some of us now understand that draining those wetlands , clear - cutting the rainforests , and pumping all that CO2 into the atmosphere are self - destructively idiotic behaviors .
But when it comes down to how nature itself behaves , we remain remarkably clueless .
The Adaptive Cycle from Google to GM
Science tells us that complex adaptive systems , like economies or ecosystems , tend to go through basic phases , however varied they may be .
In the adaptive cycle , first comes a growth phase characterized by open opportunity .
The system is weaving itself together and so there are all sorts of niches to be filled , paths to take , partnerships to be made , all involving seemingly endless possibilities and potential .
Think of Google .
As niches are filled and the system sorts out , establishing strong interdependent relationships , the various players become less diverse and are bound together in ways that are ever more constricting .
This is the consolidation phase that follows growth .
As the system matures , it may look ever bigger and more indestructible , but it is actually growing ever more vulnerable .
Think of General Motors .
The hidden weakness that underlies big systems is inherent in the consolidation phase .
When every player gets woven ever more tightly into every other , a seemingly small change in a remote corner of the system can cascade catastrophically through the whole of it .
Think of a lighted match at the edge of a dry forest .
Think of Bear Stearns .
As global capitalism is melting down around us , we are experiencing just how , in an overly mature system , disruptions that start small can grow exponentially .
So , for example , unemployment goes up another percent or two , just enough to make those of us with jobs save our cash , fearing we might be next .
As we buy less , stocks pile up , production lags , more people are fired , more fear spreads , and consumption contracts further .
The above scenario , as familiar as can be , also provides an example of how easy it is to cross thresholds — even just that slim percent or two can do the trick — and fall into self - reinforcing feedback loops .
Big consolidated systems are particularly vulnerable to such runaway scenarios .
Think of the domino effect within the densely connected global economy that led to Bear Stearns , then Lehman , Merrill Lynch , AIG …
The third phase in the typical adaptive cycle is collapse .
If you want to know what that ’s like , turn on the TV , look out your window , or knock on your neighbor ’s door , assuming that you still have a window or your neighbor still has a door .
Since everything ’s connected , when an overgrown system spirals out of control , collapse tends to feel like an avalanche rather than erosion .
It may be hard to notice during the turmoil and confusion , but enormous amounts of energy are released in the collapse phase of an adaptive cycle and that leads to the final phase : regeneration .
After seeds are cracked open by a forest fire , seedlings bloom in the nutrient - rich ashes of the former forest .
They soak up newly available sunlight where the forest canopy has been opened .
Then , as those open spaces start to fill , the growth phase begins anew .
Hopefully , in our world , those empty auto - making factories will soon house a blooming business in wind turbines and mass transit .
It is important , however , to recognize that sometimes the collapse phase leads to renewal and sometimes to an entirely different and unwanted regime .
Fire , for example , can renew a forest by clearing debris , opening niche space , and resetting the successional clock , or , if combined with a prolonged drought , it can set the stage for desertification .
In human systems , we can influence whether the outcome is positive or negative by setting goals , providing incentives , and creating policies designed to reach them .
Building an Economy in Thin Air
Once you tune in to the phases of an adaptive cycle , you see them unfolding all around you .
They may seem overwhelmingly complex , especially when compared to the neater , more linear models that shape our conventional ways of seeing the world , but ignoring that cycle as you build an economy is akin to denying gravity as you build a skyscraper .
Bigness is a warning signal that tells us to take a second look and consider whether the seemingly solid thing in front of us is far closer to collapse than it looks and , if so , to ask what can be done about it .
If we were ecologically savvy , the conventional wisdom would be :
If it ai n’t broke but it sure is big , then fix it .
We do that by breaking it up and creating space for new niches and for the more dynamic diversity that naturally flows into such a system .
It ’s easy to attribute the creative fervor of the growth phase to an absence of regulation , rather than seeing it as the natural process of niche - filling in a system with lots of available space .
As is now plain , freeing an already big corporate system of almost all regulation so that it can grow even bigger does not , in fact , encourage creativity ; it just hastens the consolidation phase .
So , to offer but one example , letting GM off the hook on fuel efficiency during the Bush era did n’t make the company more creative .
It only added to its long - term vulnerability .
It was surely no coincidence that , after the mammoth AT&T monopoly was broken up in the 1980 ’s , cell phone technology emerged explosively starting in the 1990’s .
In a sense , cell phones were the technological equivalent of a new species emerging after the collapse and regeneration phases of an ecosystem .
In the same way , it was n’t giant IBM which generated the revolutionary development of personal computers and the Internet .
The next breakthrough in solar technology may be more likely to start in your neighbor ’s garage than in Chevron ’s lab .
Driving Off Cliffs
Our ignorance of the adaptive cycle is just one example of our ecological illiteracy .
We are similarly inept at reading all sorts of natural signs .
Take , for example , thresholds , those critical points where seemingly minor changes can tip an economy into recession or a climate into a new regime of monster storms and epic droughts .
Thresholds are like the doors between the phases in the adaptive cycle , except that they are often one - way — once you stumble through them , you ca n’t get back to the other side — so it is crucially important to understand where they are .
Although we recognize that there are such things as “ tipping points ” and we recognize , belatedly , that we have already crossed too many of them , we ’re lousy at seeing , let alone avoiding , thresholds before we reach them .
Understanding exactly where a threshold is located may be difficult , but we can at least look for such boundaries , and deliberately try not to cross them when the unintended consequences of doing so can be dire .
There are , after all , usually warnings : the reservoir level is lower every year ; the colors in the coral reef are fading away ; mercury levels in the lake increase ; you are more dependent than ever on imported oil …
Once you have driven off a cliff , it does you little good to realize that you are falling .
The time to practice water conservation is before your well runs dry .
Our culture ’s ability to deal with thresholds has proven only slightly better than my dog ’s ability to solve algebra problems .
Regeneration , Not Recovery
Still , if we really were attentive to the natural cycles unfolding around us , we would n’t be attracted to growth like moths to a flame .
We would n’t equate bigness with success , but with risk , with enervation awaiting collapse .
We certainly would n’t be aiming today to rebuild yesterday ’s busted economy so that , tomorrow , we can resume our unlimited looting of nature ’s storehouse .
Believing that we are unbounded by nature ’s limits or rules , we built an economy where faster , cheaper , bigger , and more added up to the winning hand .
Then — until the recent global meltdown at least — we acted as if our eventual triumph over anything from resource scarcity to those melting icebergs was a foregone conclusion .
Facing problems ( or thresholds ) where the red lights were visibly blinking , we simply told ourselves that we ’d figure out how to tweak the engineering a bit , and make room for a few more passengers .
We got it wrong .
A capitalist economy based on constant , unlimited growth is a reckless fantasy because ecosystems are not limitless — there are just so many pollinators , so many aquifers , so much fertile soil .
In nature , unchecked rapid growth is the ideology of the invasive species and the cancer cell .
Growth as an end in itself is ultimately self - destructive .
A ( globally warming ) rising sea may lift all boats , as capitalists like to point out , but it may also inundate the coastline and drown the people living there .
If “ recovery ” from economic meltdown is just another word for a return to business as usual , we will be squandering a crucial chance to begin to build an economy that could be viable over the long run , without overloading the Earth ’s carrying capacity and courting catastrophe .
We do n’t have to go big .
Remember that regeneration phase of the adaptive cycle ?
Here ’s where that comes in .
Yes , collapse is a nightmare , but it also presents opportunities .
If we were more aware of the thresholds we ’ve already crossed , we might think differently about the next iteration of the economy .
We could always cross a threshold of our own making and decide to live differently .
Unrestrained growth , after all , was never a prerequisite for health , happiness , and justice .
It ’s not written into the Constitution .
What would an end to separation from nature and from each other feel like ?
How might it be expressed day to day ?
The regeneration phase that is now upon us begs us to answer those questions .
This much is clear .
If we want to avoid endless darkness and hardship , we have to become ecologically literate — deeply so .
The future is , you might say , too big to fail .

David Kellermann had worked for Freddie Mac for 16 years
The acting chief financial officer of struggling US mortgage giant Freddie Mac has been found dead after apparently killing himself , police say .
Fairfax County Police said there was no foul play suspected in the death of David Kellermann , found in his home 20 km ( 13 miles ) west of Washington DC .
The 41 - year - old had worked for the company for 16 years and became chief financial officer in September .
Freddie Mac was bailed out by the US government last year .
Police were investigating the death after being called to the house just before 0500 local time by Mr Kellermann 's wife .
" We were called from inside the house to come investigate an apparent suicide , " a Fairfax police spokeswoman told local media , according to AFP news agency .
Finance investigation
US media reports said Mr Kellermann was found hanging in the basement of the house .
In March Freddie Mac revealed a loss of $ 50.1 bn ( £ 36.1 bn ) for 2008 , and said it planned to ask the US government for another $ 31bn of aid .
The company received $ 13.8 bn in federal aid last year .
It also said in March that it was co-operating with an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission , and that employees had spoken to investigators .
Freddie Mac has suffered badly in the US housing downturn
However , the company said it was not aware of any links with Mr Kellermann .
" Freddie Mac knows of no connections between this terrible personal tragedy and the ongoing regulatory inquiries discussed in our SEC filings , " company spokesman David Palombi told Reuters .
Freddie Mac 's interim chief executive John Koskinen said the death was a " terrible personal tragedy . "
" David was a friend to many in the Freddie Mac family , and we mourn his passing , " he added .
Mr Kellermann 's job included responsibilities for the company 's financial controls , financial reporting and tax .
He also oversaw the company 's annual budgeting and financial planning processes , according to his company biography .
Freddie Mac and sister company Fannie Mae underwrite more than half of all US mortgages .
The death is the latest blow for Freddie Mac , after chief executive officer David Moffett resigned last month after just six months in the job .
The outbreak of swine flu , first in Mexico then cases all over the world , has gotten a lot of people worried .
And for a very good reason : despite the existence of scarier diseases caused by exotic viruses like Hantavirus and Ebola , influenza still reigns as the number one infectious killer in modern times .
Unlike regular seasonal epidemics of the flu , there are also rare but deadly pandemics , i.e. cases of influenza that spread on a worldwide scale and infect a large proportion of the human population .
While it 's important not to panic ( the swine flu appears to be highly treatable with conventional antiviral drugs ) , a review of past pandemics will elucidate why authorities are responding quickly to this outbreak .
Here 's a quick summary of the 5 deadliest pandemics in history :
1. The Peloponnesian War Pestilence
The very first pandemic in recorded history was described by Thucydides .
In 430 BC , during the Peloponnesian war between Athens and Sparta , the Greek historian told of a great pestilence that wiped out over 30,000 of the citizens of Athens ( roughly one to two thirds of all Athenians died ) .
Thucydides described the disease as such " People in good health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head , and redness and inflammation in the eyes , the inward parts , such as the throat or tongue , becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid breath . "
Next came coughing , diarrhea , spasms , and skin ulcers .
A handful survived , but often without their fingers , sights , and even genitals ( Source )
Until today , the disease that decimated ancient Athens has yet to be identified .
2. The Antonine Plague
In 165 AD , Greek physician Galen described an ancient pandemic , now thought to be smallpox , that was brought to Rome by soldiers returning from Mesopotamia .
The disease was named after Marcus Aurelius Antoninus , one of two Roman emperors who died from it .
At its height , the disease killed some 5,000 people a day in Rome .
By the time the disease ran its course some 15 years later , a total of 5 million people were dead .
3 . The Plague of Justinian
In 541 - 542 AD , there was an outbreak of a deadly disease in the Byzantine Empire .
At the height of the infection , the disease , named the Plague of Justinian after the reigning emperor Justinian I , killed 10,000 people in Constantinople every day .
With no room nor time to bury them , bodies were left stacked in the open .
By the end of the outbreak , nearly half of the inhabitants of the city were dead .
Historians believe that this outbreak decimated up to a quarter of human population in the eastern Mediterranean .
( source )
What was the culprit ?
It was the bubonic plague , caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis .
This outbreak , the first known bubonic plague pandemic in recorded human history , marked the first of many outbreaks of plague - a disease that claimed as many as 200 million lives throughout history .
4. The Black Death
After the Plague of Justinian , there were many sporadic oubreaks of the plague , but none as severe as the Black Death of the 14th century .
While no one knows for certain where the disease came from ( it was thought that merchants and soldiers carried it over caravan trading routes ) , the Black Death took a heavy toll on Europe .
The fatality was recorded at over 25 million people or one - fourth of the entire population .
( source )
It 's interesting to note that the Black Death actually came in three forms : the bubonic , pneumonic , and septicemic plague .
The first , the bubonic plague , was the most common : people with this disease have buboes or enlarged lymphatic glands that turn black ( caused by decaying of the skin while the person is still alive ) .
Without treatment , bubonic plague kills about half of those infected within 3 to 7 days .
In pneumonic plague , droplets of aerosolized Y. pestis bacteria are transmitted from human to human by coughing .
Unless treated with antibiotics in the first 24 hours , almost 100 % of people with this form of infection die in 2 to 4 days .
The last form , septicemic plague , happens when the bacteria enter the blood from the lymphatic or respiratory system .
Patients with septicemic plague develop gangrenes in their fingers and toes , which turn the skin black ( which gives the disease its moniker )
Though rare , this form of the disease is almost always fatal - often killing its victims the same day the symptoms appear .

We have n't heard the last of the bubonic plague .
In 1855 , another bubonic plague epidemic ( named the Third Epidemic ) hit the world - this time , the initial outbreak was in Yunnan Province , China .
Human migration , trade and wars helped the disease spread from China to India , Africa , and the Americas .
All in all , this pandemic lasted about 100 years ( it officially ended in 1959 ) and claimed over 12 million people in India and China alone .
5 . The Spanish Flu

In March 1918 , in the last months of World War I , an unusually virulent and deadly flu virus was identified in a US military camp in Kansas .
Just 6 months later , the flu had become a worldwide pandemic in all continents .
When the Spanish Flu pandemic was over , about 1 billion people or half the world 's population had contracted it .
It is perhaps the most lethal pandemic in the history of humankind : between 20 and 100 million people were killed , more the number killed in the war itself ( Source )
The Spanish Flu actually did n't originate in Spain - it got its name because at the time , Spain was n't involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship , thus it received great press attention there .
Recently , scientists were able to " resurrect " the virus from a well - preserved corpse buried in the permafrost of Alaska .
The Goverment of Canada has launched a Request For Information on open source software .
The RFI , which closes on February 19 , 2009 , is designed to provide it with assistance in developing guidelines for " the acquisition , use , and disposal " of open source software .

It happens every year around this time : Israelis celebrate the founding of their state in 1948 while Palestinians solemnly mark the same period in history they call the Catastrophe , and never the twain shall meet .
Except , that is , when people insist that they do .
On this hilltop not far from Haifa , Israelis and Palestinians are gathering for a two - day event that incorporates both narratives under the banner of " Together in Pain , Together in Hope . "
A program marking both Haatzmaoot and Nakba – " independence " and " catastrophe , " respectively – aims to expose participants to the experience of the other while not denigrating one 's own .
For some , this is one small route to the elusive Middle East peace that many of their compatriots see as passé .
Another round of Fatah - Hamas unity talks ended fruitlessly Tuesday in Cairo , with Palestinians still unable to reach consensus on how to respond to international demands for peace negotiations .
On the Israeli side , the rise of a new center - right government that has not affirmed its commitment to a two - state solution .
This diplomatic stalemate has resulted in a dominant perception among Israelis and Palestinians that things are only going worse .
The least one can do , many feel , is to spend these emotionally charged days with others who think like them .
While Jews and Arabs at this joint event do n't claim to be the majority , they do appear to be growing in number – from 40 when the gathering started in 2003 to 230 participants this year , not including scores of latecomers who had to be turned away for lack of space .
What 's also noticeable , both the organizers and returnees note , is that the event is continually drawing new faces , including more " mainstream " people and not just year - round specialists in peace and coexistence work .
" I felt after this last war in Gaza , I could n't just celebrate Independence Day as usual , so I was glad to find another framework entirely , " says Beni Gassenbauer , a dentist who lives in Jerusalem and immigrated to Israel from France 30 years ago .
" I did n't see myself staying in Jerusalem and having a party as if nothing has happened . "
Still , the idea of sharing the most important secular holidays in the Israeli calendar – Tuesday was Memorial Day , honoring war veterans and victims of terrorism , and Wednesday is Independence Day – with Palestinians commemorating the Nakba ( officially celebrated May 13 this year ) was one he felt he'd do better to keep from his family .
" My family is very right - wing , and we find it harder and harder to speak about politics , " Dr. Gassenbauer says .
" I did n't tell my father I was coming here . "
Nadia Mahmoud Giol , who grew up in a small Arab village in the Galilee and now lives in Upper Nazareth , has come back to the gathering for a second year .
Last year 's experience so moved her that she convinced a few other Palestinian friends to come .
Others told her she was wasting her time .
" I heard reactions from Arab friends saying , ' the Jews do n't believe the truth , they do n't believe in our Nakba , ' and I say , ' You have n't met them to talk about it , ' " Mrs. Giol explains .
" People says it 's nonsense , these gatherings – you 're just talking .
But I do n't think so ; I think it 's crucial .
And I think being here has an effect , in that you affect the people around you when you go home .
As for me , I 'm trying to bring up my children to know both sides of the story . "
Take my shoes , and stand in them
At the event , participants hear not just " sides " of the story , but real , personal tales .
The crowd listened to two witnesses to the 1948 war .
Issa Dhabit , 10 years old when the war broke out , talked about the fearful experience of Israeli soldiers taking over his town of his Ramle , and his family 's dispersion around the globe .
Polish - born Selina Ortner - Shatil told a harrowing story of surviving the Holocaust and making it to pre-state Palestine , only to lose her beloved husband of 10 months in the war for Israel 's independence .
Afterward , they were among the many who lit candles dedicated to fallen relatives , recent victims of the conflict , and people slain in the cause of peace – from Israel 's Yitzhak Rabin to Egypt 's Anwar Sadat .
Yair Boimel , a historian from Haifa University , gave an overview of the 1948 war and told the rapt crowd – which was 80 percent Jewish and 20 percent Palestinian , reflecting Israel 's demographics – that the majority of Palestinians who left in that year were expelled , as opposed to having fled .
This point , made by a cadre of Israelis academics known as the " new historians , " is considered crucial by many , because the traditional Israeli explanation is that most of the local inhabitants left of their own accord , encouraged by invading Arab armies .
It might seem like splitting hairs , but here yesterday 's issues impact tomorrow 's peace talks .
Should Israel offer Palestinians compensation as part of a comprehensive peace deal ?
Should Palestinians have their demand for a " right of return " recognized ?
Rare eye - to - eye conversations
Just last week , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Washington 's Middle East peace envoy , George Mitchell , that peace with the Palestinians will come only if they recognize Israel 's existence as a Jewish state .
Translation : Only if Palestinians give up the demand for a right of return for refugees from 1948 .
Israel 's controversial foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , has extended his definition of the Israel - Palestinian conflict by saying that it must include a solution to the tensions over Israeli Arabs , who have increasingly come to identify as Palestinians .
Eyeing Israel 's Arab minority as a demographic threat , Lieberman suggested that a peace deal should include a land swap , in which areas of Israel with a high concentrations of Arabs close to the West Bank be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority .
Lieberman 's meteoric rise makes it clear that this week 's joint event has relevance even though its participants do n't include Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Most Palestinians from those areas can no longer obtain permits to enter Israel .
But even if they could , the conditions for such a meeting is are not ripe , says Michal Talya , the founder and organizer for the annual gathering .
" I think coming to an event like this takes a level of inner awareness and an ability to step out of your national identity and see beyond , " says Ms. Talya .
Their reality of living under Israeli occupation makes it almost impossible to have the kind of eye - to - eye conversations that happen here .
" Jewish Israelis feel threatened by Palestinians , and I 'm talking about just the Palestinians inside Israel .
So the idea is to come together on these two days , the time when we 're at the height of feeling far away from each other , and to try to heal the wounds . "
Some Palestinians who came in previous years , she acknowledged with some sadness , found it harder to come this time around , given the events of the past year .
" Hope seems to be shrinking , so instead of destroying , we 're trying to build . "

Vi and Vim Editor : 12 Powerful Find and Replace Examples
Photo Courtesy : B Zedan
This article is part of the on - going Vi / Vim Tips and Tricks series .
Vim is commonly mentioned as text editor , not text creator .
Why ?
Because we spend lot of time editing an existing text than creating new text .
In the text editing , text / pattern substitutions becomes a vital part .
In this article , let us review how to perform both basic and advanced text and pattern substitution features in Vi and Vim Editor .
These features are explained using 12 very practical and powerful text substitution examples .
Syntax of the text substitution inside vim editor :
:[range]s[ubstitute ]/{pattern}/{string}/[flags ] [ count ]
Following are three possible flags .
[ c ] Confirm each substitution . [ g ]
Replace all occurrences in the line . [ i ]
Ignore case for the pattern .
Example 1 . Substitute all occurrences of a text with another text in the whole file
This is the basic fundamental usage of the text substitution inside Vi editor .
When you want a specific text to be replaced with another text in the entire file then you can use the following sequence .
:%s/old-text/new-text/g
%s – specifies all lines .
Specifying the range as ‘ %’ means do substitution in the entire file .
– specifies all lines .
Specifying the range as ‘ %’ means do substitution in the entire file .
g – specifies all occurrences in the line .
With the ‘ g ’ flag , you can make the whole line to be substituted .
If this ‘ g ’ flag is not used then only first occurrence in the line only will be substituted .
Example 2 . Substitution of a text with another text within a single line
When you want a specific text to be replaced with another text within a single line in a case insensitive manner .
Specifying no range means , do substitution in the current line only .
With the ‘ i ’ flag , you can make the substitute search text to be case insensitive .
:s/I/We/gi
Example 3 . Substitution of a text with another text within a range of lines
With the range , you can make only a range of line to be affected in the substitution .
Specifying 1 , 10 as range means , do substitution only in the lines 1 – 10 .
: 1,10s/helo/hello/g
Example 4 . Substitution of a text with another text by visual selection of lines
You can also select a specific lines by visually selecting those lines .
Press CTRL + V in command mode , use navigation keys to select the part of the file you want to be substituted .
Press ‘:’ which will automatically formed as :'< ,’>
Then you can use the normal substitute as
:'<,'>s/helo/hello/g
Example 5 . Substitution of a text with another text only the 1st X number of lines
Using count in substitution ,
If you specify the count N in the substitution then it means do substitution in N lines from the current position of the cursor .
do substitution in 4 lines from the current line .
:s/helo/hello/g 4
Example 6 . Substitute only the whole word and not partial match
Let us assume that you want to change only the whole word ‘ his ’ to ‘ her ’ in the original text mentioned below .
If you do the standard substitution , apart from changing his to her , it will also change This to Ther as shown below .
Standard Subsitution
Original Text :
This is his idea :s/his/her /g Translated
Text :
Ther is her idea
Whole Word Subsitution
Original Text :
This is his idea :s/\<his\>/her/
Translated Text :
This is her idea
Note : : You should enclose the word with < and > , which will force the substitution to search only for the full word and not any partial match .
Example 7 . Substitute either word1 or word2 with a new word using regular expression
In the following example , it will translate any occurrences of either good or nice will be replaced with awesome .
Original Text : Linux is good .
Life is nice .
:%s/\( good\|nice\ )/awesome/g
Translated Text : Linux is awesome .
Life is awesome .
You can also do substitution by specifying regular expression .
Following example does the substitution of hey or hi to hai .
Please note that this does not do any substitution for the words ‘ they ’ , ‘ this ’ .
: %s/\<\( hey \|hi\ ) \>/hai/g
\< – word boundary .
\| – “ logical or ” ( in this case hey or hi )
Example 8 . Interactive Find and Replace in Vim Editor
You can perform interactive find and replace using the ‘ c ’ flag in the substitute , which will ask for confirmation to do substitution or to skip it as explained below .
In this example , Vim editor will do a global find the word ‘ awesome ’ and replace it with ‘ wonderful ’ .
But it will do the replacement only based on your input as explained below .
:%s/awesome/wonderful/gc replace with wonderful ( y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y ) ?
y – Will replace the current highlighted word .
After replacing it will automatically highlight the next word that matched the search pattern
n – Will not replace the current highlighted word .
But it will automatically highlight the next word that matched the search pattern
a – Will substitute all the highlighted words that matched the search criteria automatically .
l – This will replace only the current highlighted word and terminate the find and replace effort .
Example 9 . Substituting all lines with its line number .
When the string starts with ‘ \= ’ , it should be evaluated as an expression .
Using the ‘ line ’ function we can get the current line number .
By combining both the functionality the substitution does the line numbering of all lines .
: %s/^/\=line( " . " ) . " . " /g
Note :
This is different from the “ : set number ” where it will not write the line numbers into the file .
But when you use this substitution you are making these line number available inside the file permanently .
Example 10 .
Substituting special character with its equivalent value .
Substituting the ~ with $ HOME variable value .
Original Text : Current file path is ~/test / :%s!\~!\= expand( $ HOME ) !g Translated Text : Current file path is / home / ramesh / test /
You can use expand function to use all available predefined and user defined variables .
Example 11 .
Alter sequence number in a numbered list while inserting a new item
Assume that you have a numbered list like the following inside a text file .
In this example , let us assume that you want to add a new line after Article 2 .
For this , you should change the number of all other articles accordingly .

3rd Article “ Make Vim as Your Perl IDE Using perl - support.vim Plugin ” got missed .
So when you want
to add it , then you want to change “ Article 3 ” to “ Article 4 ” , “ Article 4 ” to “ Article 5 ” , upto “ Article 12 ” to “ Article 13 ” .
This can be achieved by the following vim substitution command .
:4,$s/\d\+/\=submatch(0 ) + 1 /
Range : 4 , $ – 4th line to last line .
Pattern to Search – \d\+ – digits sequence
Pattern to Replace – \ =submatch (0 ) + 1 – gets the matched pattern and adds 1 to it .
Flag – as there is no flag , by default it substitutes only the first occurrence .
After executing the substitute statement the file will become like this , where you can
add the 3rd Article .

Note : Check the substitution changed the 3 to 4 , 4 to 5 and so on .
Now we can add a new line mentioning it as Article 3 , and no need to do any manual changes .
Example 12 .
Substituting the sentence beginnings with upper case .
( i.e title case the entire document ) .
While formatting a document , making the title case is also an important thing .
It can be done easily with substitution .
:%s/\.\s*\w/\=toupper(submatch(0 ) ) /
g
\.\s*\w – Search Pattern – literal . ( dot ) followed by Zero or more space , and a word character .
toupper – converts the given text to upper case .
submatch ( 0 ) – returns the matched pattern .

Colbert weeps for Glenn Beck 's sanity David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday April 1 , 2009
Print This Email This Glenn Beck of Fox News astonished many viewers recently when he repeatedly reduced himself to tears while announcing his " 9.12 Project " to save the nation .
However , Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert expressed only pleasure with Beck 's performance .
" My Glenn Beck fantasy came true , " Colbert announced on Tuesday .
" The fantasy where a hysterical Glenn Beck tells his audience of desperate shut - ins through tears and spittle that vague unnamed enemies have failed them and that it 's time to take angry action . "
" Are you ready to be that person that you were that day after 9/11 ? "
Beck tearfully asked his audience .
Colbert helpfully explained that Beck is attempting to get us to move " beyond the fear we felt on 9/11 to the compassion we felt on 9/12 .
And hopefully , we 'll all eventually get to the way Glenn felt on 9/9 of 2005 . "
On that date , Beck said , " You know , it took me about a year to start hating the 9/11 victims ' families .
...
When I see a 9/11 victim family on television of whatever , I 'm just like , ' Oh , shut up ! '
I 'm so sick of them because they 're always complaining . "
" Good point ! " Colbert exclaimed , as his audience gasped in shock .
" The 9.12 Project is not for families directly affected by 9/11 -- just people building their careers on it . "
" I 'm sorry , " Beck apologized during another of his bouts of weeping .
" I just love my country -- and I fear for it . "
This heartfelt declaration choked Colbert up as well .
" I 'm sorry , " he gasped .
" I just love Glenn Beck 's sanity -- and I fear for it . "
Colbert then announced his own forthcoming 10.31 Project -- which apparently involves ghosts , witches , jack o' lanterns , and bats in the belfry .
" Go house to house on your block , " he urged his audience , " ring doorbells , and demand that your neighbors make a tangible commitment to America -- preferably in the form of a sugary treat . "

An article on polygon collision detection .
Can be used to implement collision between sprites in a 2D game .
The algorithm can also be extended to 3D .
Introduction
This article describes how to detect the collision between two moving ( 2D ) polygons .
It 's not the first tutorial on the topic , however , the tutorials on the net tend to be a bit too complex for a relatively simple problem .
The source codes I could find also had too many abbreviations that I do n't get , or were crippled with C optimizations .
So here , I 'll try to keep it as simple as possible .
In any case , it should be possible to include the functions presented here to your C# projects quite straightforwardly .
The technique can be used to detect collisions between sprites as an alternative to pixel - perfect collisions which are usually too slow .
Background
To detect if two polygons are intersecting , we use the Separating Axis Theorem .
The idea is to find a line that separates both polygons - if such a line exists , the polygons are not intersecting ( Fig. 1 ) .
The implementation of this theorem is relatively simple , and could be summed up in this pseudo code :
For each edge of both polygons :
Find the axis perpendicular to the current edge .
Project both polygons on that axis .
If these projections do n't overlap , the polygons do n't intersect ( exit the loop ) .
This can be easily extended to deal with moving polygons by adding one additional step .
After having checked that the current projections do not overlap , project the relative velocity of the polygons on the axis .
Extend the projection of the first polygon by adding to it the velocity projection ( Fig. 2 ) .
This will give you the interval spanned by the polygon over the duration of the motion .
From there , you can use the technique used for static polygons : if the projections of polygons A and B do n't overlap , the polygons wo n't collide .
( NB : However , remember that if the intervals do overlap , it does n't necessarily mean that the polygons will collide .
We need to do the test for all the edges before knowing that . )
Once we have found that the polygons are going to collide , we calculate the translation needed to push the polygons apart .
The axis on which the projection overlapping is minimum will be the one on which the collision will take place .
We will push the first polygon along this axis .
Then , the amount of translation will simply be the amount of overlapping on this axis ( Fig. 3 ) .
That is it !
Now , each time a collision occurs , the first polygon will nicely slide along the surface of the other polygon .
Figure 1 : Projections of the polygons onto an axis .
Figure 2 : Projections for moving polygons .
Figure 3 : Find the minimum interval overlapping , then calculate the translation required to push the polygons apart .
Using the code
The PolygonCollision ( ) function does all of the above , and returns a PolygonCollisionResult structure containing all the necessary information to handle the collision :
public struct PolygonCollisionResult { public bool WillIntersect ; public bool Intersect ; public Vector MinimumTranslationVector ; }
Two helper functions are used by the PolygonCollision function .
The first one is used to project a polygon onto an axis :
public void ProjectPolygon ( Vector axis , Polygon polygon , ref float min , ref float max ) { float dotProduct = axis.DotProduct ( polygon.Points [ 0 ] ) ; min = dotProduct ; max = dotProduct ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < polygon .
Points .
Count ; i++) { dotProduct = polygon .
Points [ i ] . DotProduct ( axis ) ; if ( d < min ) { min = dotProduct ; } else { if ( dotProduct > max ) { max = dotProduct ; } } } }
The second one returns the signed distance between two given projections :
public float IntervalDistance ( float minA , float maxA , float minB , float maxB ) { if ( minA < minB ) { return minB - maxA ; } else { return minA - maxB ; } }
Finally , here is the main function :
public PolygonCollisionResult PolygonCollision ( Polygon polygonA , Polygon polygonB , Vector velocity ) { PolygonCollisionResult result = new PolygonCollisionResult ( ) ; result .
Intersect = true ; result .
WillIntersect = true ; int edgeCountA = polygonA .
Edges .
Count ; int edgeCountB = polygonB.Edges .
Count ; float minIntervalDistance = float .
PositiveInfinity ; Vector translationAxis = new Vector ( ) ; Vector edge ; for ( int edgeIndex = 0 ; edgeIndex < edgeCountA + edgeCountB ; edgeIndex ++) { if ( edgeIndex < edgeCountA ) { edge = polygonA.Edges[edgeIndex ] ; } else { edge = polygonB.Edges[edgeIndex - edgeCountA ] ; } Vector axis = new Vector ( - edge.Y , edge.X ) ; axis . Normalize ( ) ; float minA = 0 ; float minB = 0 ; float maxA = 0 ; float maxB = 0 ; ProjectPolygon ( axis , polygonA , ref minA , ref maxA ) ; ProjectPolygon ( axis , polygonB , ref minB , ref maxB ) ; if ( IntervalDistance ( minA , maxA , minB , maxB ) > 0 ) \ result .
Intersect = false ; float velocity Projection = axis. DotProduct ( velocity ) ; if ( velocity Projection < 0 ) { minA += velocity Projection ; } else { maxA += velocity Projection ; } float intervalDistance = IntervalDistance ( minA , maxA , minB , maxB ) ; if ( intervalDistance > 0 ) result .
WillIntersect = false ; if ( ! result .
Intersect && !result .
WillIntersect ) break ; intervalDistance = Math. Abs( intervalDistance ) ; if ( intervalDistance < minIntervalDistance ) { minIntervalDistance = intervalDistance ; translationAxis = axis ; Vector d = polygonA .
Center - polygonB.Center ; if ( d.DotProduct ( translationAxis ) < 0 ) translationAxis = - translationAxis ; } } if ( result . WillIntersect ) result .MinimumTranslationVector = translationAxis * minIntervalDistance ; return result ; }
The function can be used this way :
Vector polygonATranslation = new Vector ( ) ; PolygonCollisionResult r = PolygonCollision ( polygonA , polygonB , velocity ) ; if ( r. WillIntersect ) { polygonATranslation = velocity + r.MinimumTranslationVector ; } else { polygonATranslation = velocity ; } polygonA.Offset( polygonATranslation ) ;

History
Concorso d’ Eleganza event to be held in Italy on this weekend and the special thing about this even is the launch of Aston Martin ’s ultra-limited One - 77 .
The pics of the vehicle have already emerged at the Geneva motor show and a technical cut away was also presented there , but now these guys have promised to show everything there .
Only 77 copies of the model will be produced with $ 1.75 m cost for each .
There is a 7.3 - liter V12 powerhouse that would produce a 700 hp with 516 lb - ft torque .
This tiny supercar has been designed to reach 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds with over 200 mp top speed .
Only six out of 77 cars will be shipped to the US .
Aston Martin CEO Ulrich
Bez says that : “ The new car will definitely show some new benchmarks in an array of fields of automotive design and it indicates a big step in engineering program of the One - 77 .
Here ’s an awesome project from 2006 we just stumbled upon , An Ordinary Building .
On the night of September the 20th 2006 a sign appeared on a building in the center of Viterbo , an ancient city in central Italy , not far from Rome .
Apparently put by the City Council it has already caused quite a stir .
The sign is in fact an art piece by controversial artist duo Eva and Franco Mattes ( aka 0100101110101101.ORG ) .
Looking as official as any other street sign , it reads :
Hundreds of unaware passersby have been staring at the sign : “ It ’s brilliant ! ” comments an elderly woman “ But I have no idea how to interpret it . ”
While an outraged citizen living nearby comments , “ This is just unacceptable , look around , there are buildings much worse than this one , especially in the suburbs . ”
When asked to give an explanation of the sign , Franco Mattes , currently in New York , declared « It means what it says » .
With a scruffy , desert floor extending as far as the eye can see in all directions – dotted with the Mojave Desert ’s signature spiky , gnarled Joshua trees – veteran park ranger Joe Zarki kneels down in the dust .
Pointing to an invasive , red brome grass , which has proliferated here in the past few years , he explains why the rise in temperatures that have helped it thrive could signal the end of Joshua trees within a century .
“ These exotic grasses dry out , which means that the fires we have are getting larger in size , spread more rapidly , and are harder to put out , ” Mr. Zarki says .
Unlike lodgepole pines and other conifers that were replenished in Yellowstone National Park after devastating fires in 1988 in Wyoming , the moisture - sensitive Joshua tree grows in a specific microclimate and cannot easily reproduce itself in the wake of widespread destruction .
A recent study showed that Joshua trees are not replenishing after fires that now routinely claim thousands of acres .
In the 1970s , a typical fire scorched less than an acre .
The disappearance of the Joshua tree may be just one way in which climate change is affecting our national parks .
According to researchers , climate change is contributing to :
• The possible loss of all the glaciers in the Glacier National Park within 20 years .
• Dying coral reefs in Biscayne and Virgin Island National Parks due to increased heat and disease .
• Insect pests thriving and destroying forests ranging from the Great Smoky Mountains to Yellowstone .
• Declining water levels at Lake Mead because of extended droughts .
Global climate change is “ the single greatest threat to the health of our national parks , ” says Michael Cipra , California desert program manager of the National Parks Conservation Association .
In the case of the Joshua Tree National Park , Mr. Cipra points out that the red brome grasses are also fertilized by nitrogen deposited by greenhouse gases moving east from the Los Angeles Basin .
The nitrogen levels are 15 to 30 times higher than in undisturbed ecosystems , nurturing exotics such as the red brome and cheatgrass , which now represent up to 60 percent of the park ’s biomass from annual plants .
And when the Joshua tree goes , so may the creatures that depend on it – the Yucca night lizard that nests in its decaying bark and the red- tailed hawks and Scott ’s orioles that perch in its branches .
Park officials are already looking to invest more money and effort to research and monitor the changes .
The idea , says Jonathan Jarvis , regional director , Pacific West Region of the National Park Service , is that the parks may serve as the proverbial “ canaries in the coal mine ” – predictors of things to come for other populations and ecosystems .
As a result of climate change , national parks are seeing extended fire seasons , species migration , and increased snow melt , he says .
Researchers and park officers outlined some of their concerns this week to a congressional subcommittee at a special hearing on the “ Impacts of Climate Change on America ’s National Parks ” here in Twentynine Palms , Calif .
M. Rebecca Shaw , director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy of California , told the panel , “ An explosion of studies in the last five years has documented observed climate impacts on species distributions , wildfire frequency and intensity , pest outbreaks , and sea - level rise . ”
“ Keeping wildlife populations , rivers , forests , deserts , and our national parks healthy will allow us to support nearly 6.5 million existing jobs and continue to generate $ 88 billion in state and national tax revenue , ” Cipra told the panel , pointing to a 2006 study by the Outdoor Industry Association , which found that fishing , hunting , hiking , and other outdoor pursuits contribute $ 730 billion annually to the US economy .
The congressional subcommittee also heard from John Coleman , founder of The Weather Channel , who denies that global warming exists .
“ These scientists know that if they do research and the results are in no way alarming , their research will gather dust on the shelf and their research careers will languish , ” said Mr. Coleman .
Nevertheless , committee chairman Rep. Raul M. Grijalva ( D ) of Arizona said he is proposing substantial funding to help mitigate the effects of global warming on national parks .
“ You ’ve got to hear the other side of this argument , no matter how overwhelming the evidence is to the contrary , ” he said .
“ And then you have to move on and deal with it , anyway . ”
National parks can be both a warning system and a laboratory , providing an opportunity to study climate - change effects and communicate them to the public , says Michael Bean , director of the Wildlife Program at Environmental Defense .
For one , parks are relatively unaffected by other threats of major development , making it easier to isolate climate - change effects .
“ Parks are well studied … so there is a considerable baseline of knowledge on which can be based assessments of change , ” he says .
Perhaps most important , “ people care about parks and pay attention when something they ’ve grown accustomed to is suddenly different .
So they serve as a good classroom for information , ” adds Mr. Bean .
PARIS 
As the United States prepares to commit 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan , the commander of NATO and American forces there said on Monday that the coalition was “ not winning ” the war against the resurgent Taliban in parts of the country .
Gen . David D. McKiernan ’s assessment echoed that of President Obama who said in an interview that the United States was not winning the Afghan war and who raised the possibility of the American military reaching out to moderate elements of the Taliban , much as it did with Sunni militias in Iraq .
In an interview published in the French newspaper Le Figaro on Monday , the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , took the idea further , saying the West should accept a pro-Taliban leadership if Afghans choose such an administration in elections set for next August .
“ In Afghanistan , there will not be an exclusively military solution , ” he said , adding : “ We should accept the result of the forthcoming elections whatever it is . ”

James Caron writes in a guest op - ed for IC
Some time before dawn on the 5th of this month , there was an explosion in the main building at the ziyarat , or shrine , of ‘ Abd - ur - Rahman in Hazar Khwani village , North - west Frontier Province , Pakistan .
While explosions have become despairingly common in this general region , with Taliban - inspired networks proliferating among the majority Pashtun ethnic group , this particular explosion shocked many commentators .
It did so not only because the village was located in a fairly secure area , but also because Rahman Baba , as the saint was better known , was something of a symbol of peace in the Pashtun regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan , and his poetry continues to be one of the sturdiest foundations of Pashtun cultural heritage .
Since the bombing a variety of commentators – some in Pakistan and especially western observers – have read this event as a war between two cosmically separate factions of Islam .
In a piece in The Observer on March 8th , William Dalrymple ’s headline claimed that “ Wahhabi radicals are determined to destroy a gentler , kinder Islam ” [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/08/islam-pakistan-rahman-baba].
The article argued that a wholesale Saudi - funded importation of “ madrasa student ” ideology threatens a somehow more authentic Pakistani Islam based on a tolerant Sufism .
I disagree with both the reifications of pundits such as Dalrymple and those of certain sections of the critical Pakistani intelligentsia , at least in part .
In my recent experience living in and around Peshawar and the NWFP , I sensed that one major social fault line in Frontier Islam is something more basic .
In many cases , working - class and service - industry people belonging to the Deobandi school of thought , which casual commentators often conflate with “ radical Wahhabism , ” proved to be among the gentlest and most generous people I met in Pakistan .
In my extended interactions with certain such people , even though they belonged to proselytizing groups such as the Tablighi Jama ‘at this membership did not color their interactions with me as a person .
I noticed , instead , a split between those who focused on the social role of their Islam as an analytical and activist tool to create social movements ; and those for whom Islam was a humanist experience .
Simply put , it was abstracted social - centric Islam versus concrete people - centric Islam .
Social - centric
Islams of all stripes , moderate or radical ; their largely middle - class propagandists , and their populist adherents tend to say a similar thing .
That is , they hold that reform of superstitious customs – including shrine pilgrimage – will help poor people better their material lives and create a more just social order .
In seeking to forcibly enable an abstract vision of purist religious and social reform for people in a highly unjust political and economic environment , paradoxically the radical faction responsible for this blast probably never stopped to think about actual people .
This for me is the real tragedy of the symbolic attack – for there was little real damage – on Rahman Baba ’s ziyarat .
For me , an American Muslim academic who has studied the Pashto language , it was my favorite place in Pakistan exactly because of its people - centrism .
One of the Masters students in the Pakistan Studies program at Peshawar University lives in Hazar Khwani village where the tomb is , and in 2005 he invited me to visit his family there .
I ’d prefer not to mention his name , since association with Americans is no longer something that people would wish others to know about .
After several languorous hours of the legendary Pashtun hospitality , a sizable group of us went to the shrine to say a fatiha prayer for Rahman Baba .
One reason I love the shrine is the personality of Rahman Baba himself , as reflected in his poetic work .
A couple of lines that illustrate well a social religion grounded on a genuine love for individuals and personalized devotion are the following .
The version sung by Qamar Gula , an Afghan woman singer in the 1970s , is my favorite :
Dwa yaran da ranga cha na de lidali /
Che yaw da bal khkandzal kral ; bal du ’a kra
Che me mina Khdae pa ta bande payda kra / Tarka ma pa hagha wradz khpala riza kra
Who ever heard of two lovers like this /
Where one cursed the other ; while the other prayed for the first
When God created love for you in me /
On that day I gave up my free will
The following lines may be among the most widely known bits of Pashto poetry anywhere .
A fair number of Pashtuns I have met know this passage by heart :
Kar da gulo ka che sima de gulzar shi /
Aghze ma kara ; pa pkho ke ba de khar shi
Kuhi ma kina da bal sari pa lar ke /
Chere sta ba da kuhi pa ghara lar shi
Plant flowers where you live , so that your region is a flower garden /
Do n’t plant thorns or they will stick in your feet
Do n’t dig a pit in someone else ’s path / Your path might sooner or later end up leading into that pit
The shrine is located where Rahman Baba and his disciples used to meet .
And whether or not he planted the garden himself , Rahman Baba ’s shrine complex sits in a grove of deciduous trees – sycamore , poplar , and eucalyptus – interspersed throughout an ancient graveyard .
Rahman Baba purportedly had the ability to communicate with animals due to his gentleness , and even now , when people have birds that are suffering from any form of ailment , they bring them to Rahman Baba ’s forest to recuperate .
There is a special very large aviary constructed in and among the trees for this purpose .
I imagine these innocent creatures were spared on the dawn of the 5th .
There were a few buildings in between the aviary and the main mausoleum which might have sheltered them from the blast .
Rahman Baba ’s shrine complex had none of the ostentation of most South Asian shrines .
The sober austerity struck me as very “ Pashtun ” – not at all like the stereotype of a sensuous , mystical “ Sufi Islam ” as opposed to some other essentialized “ strict Islam ” .
The shrine complex consists of a number of small cube - shaped whitewashed buildings , and a large marble mausoleum structure sponsored by the Saudi government in 2001 or 2002 .
If there was much beauty , it was mainly located in the trees and the sunlight filtering through , and in non-visual adornments granted not by wealthy donors but by the participation of everyday visitors .
Instead of visual ostentation , the main decoration was verbal .
Much like the Persian poet Hafiz of Shiraz , Rahman Baba of Hazar Khwani wrote poetry that is still used daily by people today for inspiration in coping with their problems .
People do a niyat – meditate on their problem – and then open Rahman Baba ’s diwan , or poetry collection , to find a couplet at random .
Almost invariably it helps ( and the couplets above give only the most rudimentary sense of the gentle sorts of “ advice from beyond ” that the diwan contains ) .
I myself have kept a copy in my office .
It got me through a difficult year of teaching full time and advising students for the first time .
In any case , after this exercise , if the couplet has been helpful , supplicants often visit the shrine complex and commission that couplet to be painted in green lettering on the whitewashed walls of the small boxlike buildings there .
My inlaws from the lowlands of the ( ethnically very different )
Punjab province sometimes gently poked fun at me , a historian , visiting the NWFP for research .
I remember one asking incredulously , “ What are you going to see there ?
There ’s nothing but Pashtuns ! ”
His point was that unlike the Punjabi city of Lahore , for example , Peshawar and the surroundings offer little in the way of glorious monuments or iconic cityscapes ( with a few notable exceptions ) .
For him , and for too many others , those things are what history is all about .
Ergo , in this view , Pashtuns have no history .
But personally , I draw the most inspiration in my work from reflecting on various modalities of verbal culture .
And
there are few societies on earth that have produced the sort of oral - historical , poetic patrimony that Pashtun society has – language - based monuments so socially intimate that most outsiders will never appreciate them , or even see them .
“ Wildflowers blooming , ignored , in the wasteland ” is the analogy used in the title of a mid 1980s poetic anthology , as well as a paraphrase of words that the legendary peace activist Khan ‘ Abd - ul - Ghaffar Khan once used to describe his people .
For this other reason the shrine struck me as a very “ Pashtun ” monument , stripped of everything but those beautiful green words on white , words which meant the world to someone in an hour of need .
It is this people - centric Islam that was under attack , an Islam that cuts across sectarian divides and invites Wahhabis and all other Muslims alike to imagine each other as fellow humans above all else , complex and unique .
Though this was not true of everyone , many so - called ‘ Wahhabis ’
I knew answered that invitation with a soft and understated “ yes ” , and coexisted with the more socially marginal figures who managed this space full - time .
After our group paid our respects in the mausoleum , we met a large group of malangs , or ascetics / hermits .
They were chopping wood at the time , in preparation to cook lentil soup for the evening charity kitchen .
There was already a fire going , and I detected hashish fumes mixing with the mesquite smoke .
The malangs put down what they were doing and made us some milky tea , without any request on our part .
It was the first time I ’d ever had a substantive discussion with malangs .
It mainly pivoted on my telling one of the malangs that even in the US , some of us study the poetry of Rahman Baba .
The malang I was speaking to – in true ego - denying form , he never offered his name – was not surprised .
He said , “ Of course , he is a great friend of God. Even in America he must be famous . ”
One photo I took of the main mausoleum is my favorite among all those I took in my entire time in Pakistan .
Quite by chance , I hit the camera button at the exact moment when two friends were greeting each other in an embrace , which is exactly the feeling I get when I open Rahman Baba ’s diwan .
Looking even more closely one notices two women in brown burqas , mostly obscured by shadows , between two flags off to the left .
This almost unnoticeable presence is part of what so outraged the new crop of ‘ religious students ’ , the literal meaning of the word ‘ taliban ’ .
Superstition and saint veneration was objectionable enough ; but according to what I ’ve read of the event , the thought of women engaging in these activities , in public , appears to have been the trigger for this bombing .
The act , therefore , consisted of two parts .
The perpetrators viewed women as a social category to be reformed , not as individual people with individualized spiritual needs ; and they viewed individualized Islam , grounded in actually - existing people , to be beside the point .
In attempting to destroy this shrine , or to discourage attendance at it , they saw no value in the relationships expressed here .
For me at least , Rahman Baba the man is not the object of veneration ; Rahman Baba the tradition is .
To me Rahman Baba was a geographic focal point which communicated all the individual desires and hopes that passed through society .
The saint is immortal because of his words ; and his words are immortal partly because their presence in that concrete physical space engenders a personal connection to other individuals regardless of sectarian or socioeconomic or even temporal boundaries .
For this reason , an attack on Rahman Baba ’s ziyarat hit me especially hard .
Despite all the distance between my life and that of Hazar Khwani village , I felt that I had added my own presence to that of countless other specific individuals .
When I saw the news of this bombing , I felt as if I was seeing the participatory history of unique people , with individual pains and individual dreams , being replaced by dogmatic abstraction .
For this reason , it would be a true shame in my eyes if popular and critical analyses of this , and other such , events also replicated a typology - based worldview , with ideological labels like “ Deobandi ” or “ Barelvi ” or “ Wahhabi – not actual people – at their core .

Artists from Rodin to Warhol to Mark Kostabi have outsourced the construction of their work .
Hilary Berseth goes them one better :
He constructs basic frameworks of wire and wax , then lets teams of tiny yellow - and - black art fabricators finish the job .
“ I knew they were ordered and regimented , ” the Pennsylvania artist says about his honeybees , which built the three otherworldly sculptures on view at Eleven Rivington .
“ I had an intuition that I ’d be able to organize that , architecturally . ”
Berseth ’s armatures each go into a closed box in the spring , and then the respective colonies take over , filling out his templates with wax cells , then stuffing them with honey .
“ The last two seasons , I ’ve been working with a beekeeper whose name is Jim Bobb , ” he says , explaining where he turns for expertise .
“ He has a graduate degree in mathematics from Berkeley — he ’s a minor beekeeping celebrity . ”
The mysterious pinwheel shown here is , he says , the most refined result of his unpredictable process .
But Berseth ’s breakthrough came from an earlier hive , where the bees built him a remarkable spiral .
“ I was really happy with that one when I got it open .
That was when I realized , Wow , you can sort of break the behavior ” — that is , manipulate the bees ’ instincts about proportion and form .
“ You can plan out a certain amount of what ’s going to happen , and then that design will sort of ripple through , and then they ’ll begin to draw out combs and riff off that design . ”
Does he suffer for his art ?
Yes .
“ I have been stung a couple of times .
And I swell up like a son of a bitch . ”
Berseth ’s joint show with Kevin Zucker , “ Reverse Turing Tests , ” is at Eleven Rivington through November 9 .
Berseth starts with a form made of thin wax sheets , mimicking the spacing inside a natural hive .

Berseth orders fresh colonies by mail each spring .
Each has one queen and thousands of workers .
The first time he handled a crate of bees on his own was “ frightening !
A good beekeeper is really fluid at this . ”
The assistants get to work .
Midseason inspection .
Color indicates how well the queen ’s laying eggs ; a stinky smell means bees are dying .

ROME ( Reuters ) - Italy ’s first family soap opera was back on the front pages on Wednesday after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ’s wife said his party ’s selection of women to run in European elections was a “ shamelessly trashy ” process .
Silvio Berlusconi and his wife Veronica Lario arrive for dinner with U.S. President George W. Bush at Villa Madama in Rome in this June 4 , 2004 file photo .

Veronica Berlusconi , who has publicly lamented her husband ’s eye for younger women in the past , also accused him of going to the birthday bash of an 18 - year - old woman in Naples but not attending the coming - of - age - parties of his own children .
Veronica , 52 , who rarely appears with her husband , said she agreed with Italian newspapers ’ descriptions of her husband ’s party ’s choice of female candidates as “ entertainment for the emperor , ” in what newspapers saw as a reference to him .
The latest public clash between the Berlusconis , which dominated mainstream newspaper front pages along with swine flu and Fiat ’s rescue of Chrysler , follows a media debate over “ starlets in politics . ”
“ Women in Politics -- Veronica ’s Wrath , ” was the way La Stampa of Turin put it .
In an e-mail to Italian news agency Ansa , she praised politicians such as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then added :
“ But what ’s happening today ( in Italy ) behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave . ”
She added that it offended all women and particularly those who had fought in the “ frontline ” for women ’s equality .
Her 72 - year - old husband , speaking to reporters during a trip to Warsaw , said he was sorry his wife had apparently believed “ what she read in the papers ” and added that it was all “ a campaign ( against him ) hyped by the leftist press . ”
The controversy exploded earlier this week when an on - line magazine close to Berlusconi ’s main conservative ally , lower house speaker Gianfranco Fini , criticized how center - right women candidates were being chosen for the June European elections .
COSTUME -JEWELLRY POLITICIANS
That article , seen by some media as a reference to Berlusconi ’s party , said women politicians could not be used like “ pieces of costume jewelry ” to attract votes .
Berlusconi’s People of Freedom party is considering a number of former actresses and television personalities as possible candidates in the June European election , media reports say .
As party leader , he has a powerful voice in who makes the list .
“ Some have written that it is all part of entertainment for the emperor .
I agree , ” Veronica said .
“ What is emerging from newspapers is shamelessly trashy , all in the name of power . ”
Berlusconi told reporters in Warsaw it was “ absurd ” that women who speak several languages and have several degrees should consider themselves excluded from politics just because they had been on television or in show business .
Veronica Berlusconi also took her husband to task for recently dropping in at the birthday party in Naples of an 18 - year - old woman whose father is a political acquaintance .
“ That surprised me very much too , ” Veronica said , “ Even because he never came to the 18th birthday parties of his children , even though he was invited . ”
Berlusconi has three children with Veronica and two by his first marriage .
He has been in hot water with her several times in the past in a very public way .
Two years ago , she criticized him for flirting with young starlets at a party .
He later issued a syrupy public apology in the press , saying : “ I beg you to forgive me . ”

Otzi the prehistoric iceman goes online allowing users to virtually tour his body
A Stone Age warrior frozen in an icy tomb for 5,300 years can now be viewed in astonishing detail thanks to a new website .
The Iceman photoscan project took 150,000 high definition images of the perfectly preserved mummy from 12 different angles , which the researchers loaded onto the new website www.icemanphotoscan.eu.
This allows users to zoom into details that are just millimetres wide from the comfort of their living room .
They can also view the mummy in 3D and see its distinctive tattoos in both white and UV light .
Otzi has been photographed using 12 different angle - shots
150,000 high definition images were taken of the iceman mummy
' This website allows an in - depth virtual contact with the mummy without compromising its sensitive preservation conditions , ' Preservation Project Manager Marco Samadelli said .
' It is an opportunity for the wider public to discover and study a cultural heritage , unique to the world . '
Nicknamed Otzi , the prehistoric hunter is complete with fur and grass robes , leather shoes and bow and arrow .
Otzi is kept in a specially built museum in Bolzano , Italy .
Visitors view the mummy through portholes into a specially refrigerated room .
' The current preservation conditions of the mummy prevent the wider public from getting close to it , ' researchers from the European Academy Bozen said .
Scraps of clothing were found on the 5,300 year - old mummy
The intuitive zoom function lets users close in on interesting details such as Otzi 's numerous tattoos ( L ) .
Some scientists have speculated the marks indicate a form of acupuncture
Otzi was discovered in ice by German tourists in 1991 on the Alpine mountains that marks the Italian - Austrian border .
Scientists estimate he was aged around 45 , was 5ft 5 " tall and weighed about 7.9st when he perished .
They believe he died from exhaustion and an old , unhealed arrow wound .
Scientists believe Otzi died 5,300 years ago
The project also created 3D images of the mummy , but users will need their own 3D glasses to get the effect
The hunter was frozen with all his possessions including a bow , a quiver of arrows and a copper axe .
He was wearing warm clothing including a cloak made of woven grass , a coat and leggings made from goatskin and a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap .

Symbol of brave devotion : Arthur West 's flask from the doomed liner
The story of a father 's final act of love towards his family as the Titanic sank has been revealed .
Arthur West scrambled down the rope of a rescue boat to give his wife and two daughters a flask of hot milk before returning to the deck , and his fate .
The 36 - year - old 's act of bravery was revealed in an account written by his wife , Ada , which is being auctioned next month with the flask and letters .
The items could fetch up to £ 60,000 at the sale in Devizes , Wiltshire .
The luxury liner struck an iceberg and sank on 15 April 1912 , killing 1,517 people .
' Cries and groans '
" We were all asleep when the collision took place , but were only jolted in our berths , " Mr West 's widow wrote .
" The steward bade us all get up and dress thoroughly with plenty of warm things .
" Arthur placed lifebelts upon the children then carried them on to the boat deck .
I followed carrying my handbag .
Barbara was rescued aged 10 months along with her sister and mother " After seeing us safely into the lifeboat , Arthur returned to the cabin for a thermos of hot milk , and finding the lifeboat let down he reached it by means of a rope , gave the flask to me , and , with a farewell returned to the deck of the ship . "
Mr West , his wife and young children , Constance and Barbara , were emigrating to Florida when disaster struck .
The family - second - class passengers , from Truro in Cornwall - were put into lifeboat number 10 before their rescue by another liner , the Carpathia .
Ada wrote that the noble actions of her husband , whom she referred to in one letter as " Dad " , had not been matched by two men who had managed to sneak on to their lifeboat .
when I said goodbye to dear Dad it was without a shadow of fear as to our ever seeing him again
Ada West , letter extract
In a statement to the Board of Trade she revealed that the men had hidden under women passengers ' skirts .
" I saw no signs of wreckage or bodies , only icebergs - had no idea that the disaster had been so great , " she wrote .
" There were men in our boat who had concealed themselves under the ladies skirts and had to be asked to stop lighting cigarettes as there was a danger of the dresses becoming ignited . "
In a letter written in New York following their rescue , she also wrote : " We were amongst the first to leave the ship - when I said goodbye to dear Dad it was without a shadow of fear as to our ever seeing him again .
Extract of a letter written by Mr West on 10 April 1912 " It was only when I saw the ship sink and heard the awful cries and groans from the poor drowning creatures that I felt the least bit of fear as to his safety .
It was all too terrible ! "
In a separate letter on Titanic branded stationery , Mr West describes the liner 's luxury before the disaster .
" We went aboard and found our cabin , it 's most beautifully fitted and the white paint shines like a mirror , " he said .
" The rest is mahogany with silver - plated fittings .
We have two hanging wardrobes - several drawers - in fact plenty of space for everything . "
The statement , the letters and the flask are being auction following the death of Barbara in 2007 - one of the last survivors .
The pre-sale estimate for all the items at Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneers is £ 40,000 to £ 60,000 .

An FBI interrogator named Ali Soufan , who was involved back in 2002 goes public and blows the lid off of the Republican talking points about torture :
One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based .
The first , dated August 2002 , grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high - ranking terrorist , Abu Zubaydah , on the grounds that previous methods had n’t been working .
The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use .
It is inaccurate , however , to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative .
Along with another F.B.I. agent , and with several C.I.A. officers present , I questioned him from March to June 2002 , before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August .
Under traditional interrogation methods , he provided us with important actionable intelligence .
--
There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that was n’t , or could n’t have been , gained from regular tactics .
In addition , I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions — all of which are still classified .
The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods , the nature of the threat , the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists , and due process .
--
One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so - called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I. , similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks .
Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques , our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation .
An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him .
Ha , our Vice President said a bad word and it's on tape .
" Gimme a fucking break , " he said , after some Senator called him " Mr. Vice President , " which is his hilarious title .
Listen to the swears :
Our old vice president , " Creepy Dick , " once swore at a Senator , too .
It is a time - honored Vice Presidential tradition , like taking the oath of office before the President and generally being a total PR liability .

The August 1 , 2002 " 2002 Techniques Memo "
This memo was written by John Yoo and signed by Jay Bybee .
It provides cover for CIA enhanced interrogation techniques .
It was released on 4/16/09 in response to an ACLU FOI request .
Based upon information presented to the OLC by the CIA 's John Rizzo , waterboarding was described as harmless :
As we understand it , when the waterboard is used , the subject 's body responds as if the subject were drowning -- even though the subject may be well aware that he is in fact not drowning .
You have informed us that this procedure does not inflict actual physical harm .
In keeping with the premise that waterboarding was safe , and defending why the waterboard is not torture , Bybee wrote :
As we explained in the Section 2340A Memorandum , " pain and suffering " as used in Section 2340 is best understood as a single concept , not distinct concepts of " pain " as distinguished from " suffering " ....
The waterboard , which inflicts no pain or actual harm whatsoever , does not , in our view , inflict " severe pain and suffering " . "
Thus , the central defense of waterboarding was that it did not cause actual physical harm .
It is somewhat unclear , if the waterboard is so safe , why the waterboard would require " monitor[ing ] by personnel with medical training and extensive SERE school experience with this procedure who will ensure the subject ’s mental and physical safety . "
Nonetheless , the " 2002 Techniques Memo " central tenet was that waterboarding is HARMLESS .
The August 1 , 2002 " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " from Jay Bybee to Alberto Gonzales
This memo was written by John Yoo under Jay Bybee 's name to define torture for the administration , and was leaked to the press in 2004 .
The memo surprisingly utilized medical terminology to define torture :
Although these statutes address a substantially different subject from section 2340 , they are nonetheless helpful for understanding what constitutes severe physical pain .
They treat severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment .
Such damage must rise to the level of death , organ failure , or the permanent impairment of a significant body function .
These statutes suggest that to constitute torture ' severe pain ' must rise to a similarly high level -- the level that would ordinarily be associated with a physical condition or injury sufficiently serious that it would result in death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions . "
Thus
Yoo , under the declaration that waterboarding is harmless defined torture as an insult that was " likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment . "
OLC had made up a definition of torture to permit " safe waterboarding " .
The May 10 , 2005 " 2005 Bradbury Memo "
This memo was written by Stephen Bradbury .
It provides revised analysis of CIA enhanced interrogation techniques .
It was released on 4/16/09 in response to an ACLU FOI request .
Importantly , this memo replaced the 2002 Yoo / Bybee memos , which were withdrawn by Jack Goldsmith following the leak of the " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " in May 2004 .
We are now learning that there was serious debate about the morality and utility of waterboarding within the intelligence services and the State Department , and an internal CIA probe by the inspector general raised numerous questions about the " enhanced interrogation techniques " .
Specifically , it is clear that waterboarding was anything but harmless .
As cited in the " 2005 Bradbury memo " , the CIA inspector general noted that the original approval of waterboarding was based upon inadequate safety evaluation by qualified medical officers :
See IG Report at 21 n 26 ( " [ The CIA Office of Medical Services ( OMS ) ] was neither consulted nor involved in the analysis of the risk and benefits of [ enhanced interrogation techniques ] , nor provided with the OTS report cited in the OLC opinion [ the Interrogation Memorandum ] . " ) .
Since that time , based on comments from OMS , additional constraints have been imposed on the use of the techniques .
Evaluating the new constraints placed on waterboarding in the " 2005 Bradbury memo " reveals a MAJOR change .
" Harmless " waterboarding now required that a physician be present in the room in which the detainee is waterboarded to prevent death .
Furthermore , they now included a tracheotomy kit in the room where " harmless " waterboarding was conducted :
... a detainee could suffer spasms of the larynx that would prevent him from breathing even when the application of water is stopped and the detainee is returned to an upright position .
In the event of such spasms , a qualified physician would immediately intervene to address the problem , and , if necessary , the intervening physician would perform a tracheotomy .... we are informed that the necessary emergency medical equipment is always present - although not visible to the detainee - during any application of the waterboard .
A tracheotomy is a surgery in which a physician cuts into a patient 's neck , slicing through the skin and into the airway ( trachea , see below ) .
Then a tube is inserted into the hole to provide an airway to the lungs .
Thus after waterboarding Zubaydah and KSM 266 times by March 2003 , it apparently became clear to the CIA that in the hands of the interrogators working for the CIA , waterboarding was not the " harmless " procedure it was originally described to be .
In fact , waterboarding was considered to be so dangerous by the CIA 's own doctors , that they mandated a physician with an emergency tracheotomy kit be in the room while the waterboarding took place .
.
.
.
Failure to perform a tracheotomy in the presence of airway - obstructing laryngospasm can result in loss of oxygen severe enough to cause brain damage and death .
The memos do not indicate whether or not any of the waterboarded detainees required a tracheotomy .
However , a heavily censored footnote on page 15 of the " 2005 Bradbury Memo " discusses what appears to be a near - death episode that must have happened with Zubaydah or Khalid Sheik Mohammed , the only detainees known to undergo " extensive waterboarding " by the CIA .
This event may be the basis of the change in waterboarding protocols :
In our limited experience , extensive use of the waterboard can introduce new risks .
Most seriously , for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation , the subject may simply give up , allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness .
An unresponsive subject should be righted immediately and the interrogator should deliver a sub - xyphoid thrust to expel the water .
If this fails to restore normal breathing , aggressive medical intervention is required .
Any subject who has reached this degree of compromise is not [ censored hereafter ] .
They changed the torture definition to stop defining themselves as torturers
The " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " to Gonzales generated what turned out to be a troublesome definition of torture .
Troublesome because it was clear by March 2003 that the actual practice of waterboarding by the CIA required a physician and tracheotomy kit to prevent " death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions . "
The 2002 torture definition clearly defined AS TORTURE the actual practice of waterboarding detailed in the IG report and later memos .
But rather than stop torturing people , they abandoned their original definition of torture as including an act that causes " permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment . "
And despite a footnote in the " 2005 Bradbury Memo " indicating that " extensive waterboarding " can cause a subject to " simply give up , allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness [ and thus death without medical intervention ] " , this " 2005 Bradbury Memo " incredibly finds that waterboarding does not result in severe mental pain or suffering .
An aside on Jack Goldsmith
In June , 2004 , following the leak of the " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " to the press and in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal , OLC head Jack Goldsmith withdrew both the 2002 Yoo / Bybee Memos without authoring replacement memos .
Whereas many people have touted Jack Goldsmith 's withdrawal of the Yoo Torture Memos as " principled " , it is clear that the operative " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " he withdrew in June 2004 also happened to inconveniently define CIA waterboarders as torturers .
Although he resigned immediately following the memo withdrawal to " make sure his decision stuck " his silence allowed the OLC to quietly redefine torture and march right along with the waterboarding program .
Conclusion
At this point it is fairly obvious that the lawyers authoring the torture memos were charged with finding legal loopholes to torture statutes for the " enhanced interrogation techniques " .
Waterboarding was originally described as harmless , resulting in a definition of torture crafted around this concept .
When the CIA 's own experience indicated that waterboarding was not harmless , and indeed fit the earlier " good - faith " definition of torture , they simply abandoned the " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " concept of severe pain and harm , and now required physicians with tracheotomy kits to be present in the waterboarding chamber to reduce the death risk .
.
The " 2005 Bradbury Memo " indicates that the prevailing thought following the OLC 's redefinition of torture was that if a doctor was present to resuscitate anyone killed by an interrogator , then the CIA was legally innocent of murder or torture .
By this logic , it may have been acceptable to cut off fingers and toes as long as there was an orthopedic surgeon present to reattach them .
Following the sequence of memos , it is evident that in addition to bad - faith misrepresentation of the effectiveness of waterboarding in the memos , the memos reveal bad - faith misrepresentation of the safety of waterboarding and arbitrary redefinition of torture to permit whatever the CIA wanted to do .
In short , it appears that in these OLC memos there was no " good - faith " effort to define torture and avoid it .

When the FDA discovered melamine in U.S. infant formula products , it made a conscious decision to withhold that information from the public .
Instead , it called a teleconference with the infant formula manufacturers to warn them about its findings !
The truth about the melamine only became public after the Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request , demanding the test results from the FDA .
Absent that request , this whole issue would have continued to remain an FDA secret .
In the aftermath of that decision , the FDA is now under intense fire for once again betraying the public trust and acting to protect the interests of corporations rather than the people .
Congress , public health groups and consumer advocate ( like me ) are blasting the FDA for utterly disregarding public safety and catering ( once again ) to the financial interests of the companies it regulates .
The FDA , of course , claims that low levels of melamine are perfectly safe for babies to consume in unlimited quantity .
Sure they are !
And Bisphenol - A is safe , too .
So is aspartame , sodium nitrite , sucralose , MSG and every other food ingredient poison you can think of .
According to the FDA , they 're all safe for babies to eat or drink in virtually unlimited quantities .
Needless to say , the FDA has become the laughing stock of all intelligent observers .
It 's not hard to figure out that the FDA has sold out to Big Business and betrayed the people , thrusting defenseless babies directly into the line of fire of dangerous chemicals and toxic additives .
Yet the FDA still conspires to hide the truth about these dangers from the public .
Truth be told , it is the FDA that has become the real danger to the public .
This agency is a complete failure .
Its leaders should resign in disgrace ... or , more accurately , they should be arrested and prosecuted for their roles in a deadly conspiracy involving food and drug companies that sought to boost business profits at the expense of human lives .
This is all about much more than mere melamine , of course .
If the FDA would consciously hide the truth about melamine from the public it was supposed to serve , then what else might it hide in the future ?
( What has it been hiding already ? )
The bottom line is that the FDA cannot be trusted , and rather than ruling by trusted authority , it rules by intimidation and oppression , even with its own scientists ( http://www.naturalnews.com/News_000542_FDA_corruption_medical_devices.html).
Think about it :
If the FDA does n't care enough about the safety of your babies to disclose the truth about melamine , what makes you think the FDA will give a damn about anything else that might threaten the health and safety of Americans ?
The FDA exists for only one purpose :
To protect the profits of powerful food and drug companies .
Babies be damned .

( OPRAH.com ) --
One of the original Kings of Comedy , Steve Harvey is the host of one of the most popular radio shows in the country , " The Steve Harvey Morning Show . "
His first book , " Act Like a Lady , Think Like a Man , " is shooting to the top of the best - seller lists , and Oprah Winfrey says she loves everything it has to say !
Harvey says this book has a special meaning for him .
" This is the first project that I did n't do for money , " he says .
" Other than my foundation -- mentoring programs -- everything I do is for money .
I tell jokes for a check ; I 'm on TV for a check .
...
But this [ book ] right here I did purely to empower women . "
In his book , Harvey says the way a man introduces you gives good insight into the status of your relationship .
If a man introduces you as a friend or says your name with no title at all , Harvey says you have nothing .
" We 're very protective .
We mark our territory .
If a man loves you ... he's willing to profess it .
He 'll give you a title after a while .
You 're going to be his lady , his woman , his fiancée , his wife , his baby 's mama , something , " he says .
" If he 's introducing you after six months , ' This is ... Oprah , ' you should be standing there going , ' This is going nowhere . ' "
Oprah.com : Read an excerpt from this best - selling book !
Man with a plan
Another thing women need to understand , according to Harvey , is that every man has a plan .
" Men do n't come up to you to just talk .
We come up to you with a plan , " he says .
" We 're looking across the room at you , and we do n't care about your hopes and dreams .
We do n't care about what your future holds .
We saw something we wanted . "
When a man approaches a woman , Harvey says , he already knows what we wants from her , but he does n't know what it will cost .
" How much time do you want from me ?
What your standards ?
What are your requirements ?
Because we 'll rise to the occasion no matter how high you set the bar if we want to , " he says .
" The problem is , women have stopped setting the bar high . "
Oprah.com :
What 's your love type ?
The cookie
Though a woman might want many things from a man , Harvey says men only need three things : support , loyalty and sex .
Or as Harvey calls it , " the cookie . "
" We 've got to have your support .
Whatever adventure we 're out on , whatever pursuit in life , we need your support .
Then we need your loyalty .
That 's your love .
We 've got to know that you belong to us , " he says .
" And we 've got to have a cookie .
Everybody likes cookies .
That 's the thing about a cookie .
I like oatmeal raisin ... but if you 've got vanilla cream , I 'll eat that too . "
Kickin ' it
In his book , Harvey tells the story of his father - in - law 's first introduction to one of Harvey 's daughter 's boyfriends .
" [ My 26 - year - old daughter ] was dating this guy who was about 30 .
He had been over to the house about four , five times .
And my father - in - law was visiting from Memphis , " Harvey says .
" He 's in the kitchen and he 's eating and [ my daughter 's ] boyfriend is in there , and [ my father - in - law ] goes : ' So , son , sit down .
Tell me , what 's your plan for my granddaughter ? ' "
After plenty of hemming and hawing , Harvey says the boyfriend finally said that the two were just " kickin ' it . "
Harvey was pretty confident his daughter did n't have the same interpretation of the relationship , he says .
" I said : ' Cool .
Let 's bring my daughter in there .
Let 's inform her that she 's just being kicked ... let 's see if that 's what she wants to do , " he says .
" They broke up the next day . "
Gone fishin '
Harvey says men are like fishermen -- but women are actually the ones looking for a good catch .
You wo n't be able to find one , though , until you up your standards .
" You 've got sports fishermen , and you 've got guys out there fishing to eat .
You 've got guys that are fishing to keep the fish , and you 've got guys that are fishing to catch them , unhook them and throw them back , " Harvey says .
" You 've got to determine along the way which one of the fish you 're going to be . "
Without ironclad standards ,
Harvey says you 'll always end up back in the dating pool .
" You 've got to quit lowering your standards , " he says .
" Set your requirements up front so when a guy hooks you , he has to know this is business . "
And do n't let the man set the pace of the relationship --
Harvey says it 's always the woman who has total control .
" With all that power , why do you suddenly relinquish this power just because you want a guy to accept you ?
That 's stupid , " he says .
" Say : ' Look , if you want to be with me , this is what you got to do .
This is what it takes to get to me . ' "
When should you sleep with your new boyfriend ?
As an auto plant worker , Harvey says he had to wait 90 days to receive benefits -- and says the same probation period should apply to dating .
" In 90 days they checked me out .
They determined if I was easy to work with , if I got along well with others , if I showed up when I said I was going to show up , if I was worthy . "
Women , Harvey says , hold the greatest benefit of all -- the cookie -- so there 's no reason to give it away until you know your man deserves it .
" Slow down , ladies , " Harvey says .
" Look , you can not run us off . "
So what if you do n't want to wait 90 days ?
Harvey says if you change the probation period , you do so at your own risk .
" You all keep changing the rules .
And men are aware of the fact that you are changing the rules .
We 're aware of the fact that you act desperate .
We 're aware of the fact that you think there 's a good shortage of good men out there , " he says .
" We play on all of that .
...
We created the term ' gold digger ' so you wo n't ask us for nothing .
We created the term ' nagging ' so you can quit badgering us .
These are terms that we created so you can require less of us . "
Mr. fix -it
Harvey says four little words can strike fear and dread into any man :
We need to talk .
" You just drove a nail in his forehead , " Harvey says .
Men are fixers , not talkers , Harvey says , so it 's better to get to the point .
" When you say , ' We need to talk , ' we put up the barriers , " he says .
" I tell ladies , just sit down and strike up a conversation . "
Oprah.com :
How to talk to a brick wall
Turn off the text
Social networking
Web sites and text messages can be a great way to keep in touch with friends , but Harvey says it 's not the best way to date .
" You have nothing if you 're texting a guy in a relationship , " he says .
" We can text six women a minute .
We can text it and push ' reply all . '
I mean , since we 're lying , we might as well lie to everybody . "
If you want the relationship to be more , take it face - to - face .
" Women talk about [ how ] chivalry 's dead .
Chivalry 's not dead -- it 's just not required anymore , " he says .
" You 've got to get a guy in your face .
Look in his eyes .
...
God has given you all this incredible thing called intuition .
You 've got to use that . "
Safety first
You know you 've got a keeper when your man wants to make sure you 're always safe , Harvey says .
Every man wants to protect his woman , and Harvey says this instinct kicks in when his wife , Marjorie , scuba dives .
" I can't go home without her .
We 've got seven kids between us , " Harvey says .
" They need their mother .
I 'm not a good mother at all . "
Although Marjorie is a certified diver , Harvey is n't a swimmer .
" I have a security guy who can swim , " he says .
" So [ he puts ] on the snorkeling gear and when she goes down , I tell him , ' You swim over and just keep an eye on my wife . ' "
Harvey also has instructions for everyone else on the boat .
" I told all the dive masters on the boat : ' If she does not come out of that water in 30 minutes , everybody in the water .
Everybody .
We 're doing a dive search right here , ' " he says .
" I do n't care if nobody [ else ] on the boat goes home .
She goes home . "

All About Dating • Relationships
Our goal for the Fourth Anniversary Update is to deepen and enhance replayability of the game with a variety of features aimed at satisfying the full spectrum of Guild Wars players .
For example , we wanted to give new purpose and rewards to existing content , so we added a new system of cycling Zaishen Challenge Quests and the Traveler to encourage players to experience the different types of available content in a whole new light .
We 've also designed an elaborate unlocking system for every pet in the game , making it possible for you to accumulate unlocked pets and swap them out for different builds and gameplay types .
As the demand on inventory space increases with all the new content being added to the game since our last storage update , we have increased your storage potential with the creation of Equipment Packs and additional Xunlai Storage panes available in the In - Game and NCsoft Stores .
In the same vein , the Hall of Monuments has been made account - based to make the accumulation of titles and other accomplishments more smoothly available to multiple characters on an account .
As you play these characters more and more , you might be looking for a way to freshen up their look beyond just getting a new set of armor , so we have added a whole new way to do this with Makeover Credits that have been added to the In - Game and NCsoft Stores .
These Credits are redeemable at a [ Stylist ] NPC who deepens your ability to truly customize a character by allowing you to mix aesthetic features from ALL campaigns , something which is not possible through character creation .
The Live Team has been working nonstop to make these new features a reality , and we 're incredibly happy to finally reveal everything we 've done .
Instead of releasing a typical Developer Update article , we 're explaining all the exciting new content in a series of detailed gameplay web pages .
You can find the links to those pages in the update notes below , as well as a summary of each updated game feature .
Read on for more information !
Equipment Pack [ edit ]
Each character has been given a 5th bag slot reserved for the Equipment Pack .
These new bags will save you oodles of storage space and give you a way to keep your weapons and armor divided from your other loot .
These bags :
Hold only weapons and armor .
Come in four sizes : 5 - slot bags are available in Pre-Searing Ascalon in exchange for a treat for Professor Yakkington , for a nominal fee of gold at various merchants across all campaigns , or for Zaishen Coins at a new Zaishen Rewards NPC in Great Temple of Balthazar .
10 , 15 , and 20 - slot bags are available in exchange for Zaishen Coins at a Zaishen Rewards NPC in Great Temple of Balthazar .
See the gameplay article for more details .
Xunlai Storage [ edit ]
To provide you with access to even more storage space , Xunlai Storage Panes are now available for purchase in the In - Game Store and the NCsoft Store .
Xunlai Storage Panes each add an additional 20 slots of storage space to your Xunlai Chest .
These panes can be used by any character on your account that has access to your storage chest .
You can now purchase up to 4 additional panes of storage from the In - Game Store and the NCsoft Store .
See the Storage FAQ for more details .
Zaishen Challenge Quests [ edit ]
Every day , we challenge you with different objectives from all over the world , running the gamut from missions to bounties to PvP .
Each day , these quests have you play in a specific area for each of the three formats .
We believe this will encourage players to group up with those in the area attempting to complete this common goal of getting rewarded for that day 's Challenge Quest .
Zaishen Challenge Quests have a variety of rewards , including the new Zaishen Coins , a new form of currency taken by Zaishen Rewards NPCs .
Pick up your Zaishen Challenge Quests in the Great Temple of Balthazar .
Your Quest Log can only hold three of each type of Zaishen Challenge Quests .
Three quest types are offered each day : Mission completion .
Finish storyline missions for the Zaishen .
Bounties .
Hunt down and kill evil bosses from around the world !
Combat .
Battle it out in different arenas and triumph over other players .
Each quest has one Base Objective , which is required to complete the quest and rewards you with experience , gold , faction , title points , and Zaishen Coins .
Quests may also have one or more optional Bonus Objectives , which reward extra Zaishen Coins .
Zaishen Coins : Come in copper , silver , and gold denominations .
Are only awarded for completing Zaishen Challenge Quests .
Are not tradeable to other players , but can be passed to other characters on your account through the Xunlai Storage Vault .
Can be used to buy items like the Equipment Packs from Zaishen Rewards NPCs in the Great Temple of Balthazar .
Can be used to unlock pets for your Zaishen Menagerie collection .
See the gameplay article for more details about Zaishen Challenge Quests and Coins .
Zaishen Menagerie [ edit ]
Arcane Mages of the Zaishen Order have been hard at work on the island of the Heroes ' Ascent volcano .
Terraforming magics learned from the hedge wizards of Vabbi have allowed the Zaishen to create a sanctuary and breeding ground for many of the charmable animals from around the world .
They fund the sanctuary and their study of these animals by allowing adventurers to build their own collection of charmable animals to be cared for in the Menagerie Grounds .
By unlocking a pet for your collection , you will then be able to recharm that tier of animal any time you wish by visiting the Zaishen Menagerie Grounds .
As part of this service , the Zaishen Trainers have developed evolutions of certain rare animals that have never been seen in the wild , and they 've even recovered a small amount of extremely rare Moss Spider eggs to be trained as a charmable pet for the first time .
The Moss Spider is best known for being native to Ascalon before the Searing , and until now was believed to be extinct .
The Zaishen Menagerie is an outpost , located in the Battle Isles next to Heroes ' Ascent .
Speak with Gate Guard Hirvela to enter the Menagerie Grounds .
All characters on your account share a Menagerie collection .
Unlock seven different tiers of level and evolution for every charmable animal in the game .
Unlock a pet by bringing your charmed animals to Emryd the Tamer , or visit Helena [ Zaishen Keeper ] to unlock them with Balthazar Faction or Zaishen Coins .
Only charmable animals from campaigns you own are unlockable via the Zaishen Keeper .
The menagerie is your own area -- only you and your Heroes can enter .
Once you 've unlocked a pet , you 'll see charmable level 5 versions of that pet roaming the grounds .
Higher - level versions and special evolutions of your pets are also available from Wynn [ Zaishen Training Captain ] .
Purchase an unlock pack from our In - Game Store or the NCsoft Store .
The unlock pack adds the non-prestige pets from all campaigns to your collection .
See the gameplay article for more details .
Nicholas The Traveler [ edit ]
The rumors are n't true , Nicholas Sandford survived the Searing !
He may look a little aged since the last time you saw him , but Nicholas and his trusty companion , Professor Yakkington , are finally coming out of hiding .
Having dropped his last name in favor of the moniker " the Traveler , " Nicholas has mourned in seclusion over the loss of his family , friends , and beloved Mary Malone long enough .
He has traveled the globe , gathering up a hefty supply of exotic and unique new items to put in his Gift of the Traveler , which he trades for materials , trophies , and other items he desires .
Each week , Nicholas and the Professor will change location to a different explorable area in Tyria , Cantha , or Elona .
In each location he will want something different for one of his Gifts .
He is out there in the world right now ; do you have the stamina to find him ?
The Traveler changes location at the end of each weekend .
Each account can get up to 5 Gifts of the Traveler each week .
The Traveler gives his Gifts in exchange for the items he desires that week .
The item he seeks will change depending on his location in the world .
Gifts of the Traveler hold many new and exclusive items , but you 'll just have to open one to see what they are .
See the gameplay article for more details .
Hall of Monuments : Now Account - Wide [ edit ]
Our previously announced plans for the Hall of Monuments to be an account - wide feature have come to fruition , and then some !
Switch between your Character and Account views by speaking with Kimmes the Historian in the Hall of Monuments .
Added the ability to specify the displayed achievements for each monument .
Added the ability to replay the cinematic view of a monument .
Accomplishments will automatically be added to your account the next time you log in with any character that has a displayed an achievement in the Hall of Monuments .
See the gameplay article for more details .
New Character Customizations [ edit ]
The ability to change a character 's look once created is a luxury we 've never had .
Now you will not only be able to freshen up the look of a character you have been staring at for years , but you 'll actually be able to mix and match aesthetic features from all campaigns , giving you a multitude of new combinations that are n't available during character creation !
To prepare for this new feature , we 've had to reorganize the way characters ' appearance data is stored .
As such , the first time you view your characters at the character selection screen , they wo n't look the way you remember them .
Never fear !
To update your character selection screen 's display , you need only log in on each character , and they will be viewed correctly from here on out .
Preview your new look !
Speak with Anatomical Engineer Llye [ Stylist ] in the Great Temple of Balthazar to check out all the options for redoing your character .
The Stylist allows you to mix and match aesthetic features from different campaigns , creating hundreds of combinations which are not available at character creation .
Change your character 's hair style , hair color , face , skin color , and / or body scale with Makeover Credits , or all of those plus gender with Extreme Makeover Credits , at the Stylist .
Buy your Makeover Credits and Extreme Makeover Credits at the In - Game Store and the NCsoft Store .
Makeover Credits are sold in packs of 5 , and Extreme Makeover Credits are sold individually .
Each Makeover Credit allows you to change one character 's hair style , hair color , face , skin color , and / or body scale .
Each Extreme Makeover Credit allows you to change one character 's gender , as well as the Makeover options of hair style , hair color , face , skin color , and / or body scale .
Character Name Changes are now available at the In - Game Store and the NCsoft Store .
See the gameplay article for more details .

Guild Wars Wiki notes [ edit ]
Enlarge By Glenn Hartong , The Enquirer Six year - old Pranav Veera , who has a photographic memory and has tested in the very upper ranges of intelligence , poses with letters spelling his name , at home in Loveland , Ohio .
LOVELAND , Ohio  Pranav Veera can recite the names of the U.S. presidents in the order they served in office .
He can say the alphabet backward .
Give him a date back to 2000 , and he 'll tell you the day of the week .
He 's only 6 years old .
VIDEO : Pranav knows his numbers IQ : Families ' eldest boys do best on tests SCIENCE SNAPSHOT :
It does n't pay to be smart
At first glance , Pranav is a typical young boy who is highly competitive at playing Wii video games and likes to play outside .
A closer look reveals he 's anything but typical .
Pranav has an IQ of 176 .
One person in 1 million has an IQ of 176 or above .
Albert Einstein's IQ was believed to be about 160 .
The average IQ is 100 .
When Pranav was 4 - and - a- half , his parents noticed he seemed unusually intelligent while playing with alphabet sets .
He could even recall which letters were certain colors .
" That kind of puzzled us , " said his father , Prasad Veera .
" You have to have not a normal memorization , but some other means of recall . "
Now , he loves all kinds of alphabets .
" He loves to collect them , like different colors , different sizes , different materials , " said his mother , Suchitra Veera .
The Veeras decided to have Pranav tested three months ago at Powers Educational Services in Hyde Park , Ohio .
" I said , ' Let 's try it out , because he seems to do a lot of stuff kind of not quite normal for his age , ' " his father said .
" He tested 176 . "
He seems to have a photographic memory , so keeping Pranav engaged and learning is a big challenge for his family .
His mother and grandmother , Shanta Sastri , work with him at home .
They 're guided by his focus and interests .
" The way to get him interested is to associate something with numbers , like presidents ' birthdays … and when they came into office , " his mother said .
" Once we introduced him to the idea , he was asking more and more questions , so we created a spreadsheet for him in Excel , and he keeps on asking us to add more types of information to it , like sort them in the order that they came into office , sort them in the order when they were born , " she said .
In prekindergarten , his teacher had him do more challenging work , such as division and telling time .
In kindergarten , his classmates are learning the alphabet and numbers up to 100 .
He 's counting over 1 million .
" He 's an amazing child , " said Marci Taylor , his teacher at McCormick Elementary in the Milford School District .
" He knows so much , yet he 's probably more excited about learning than any child I 've ever seen .
He shakes with excitement . "
Pranav knows so many incredible things , she said , but what 's also impressive is that he 's still a 6 - year - old boy .
" He loves to go play at recess and climb on the monkey bars , " Taylor said .
It 's possible that Pranav might eventually have his learning accelerated , even by skipping grades , but his father said they would have to consider that with his social needs .
" We want him to be as normal as possible , " his father said .
" Right now , it 's kind of early , and we can do a lot at home , " his mother added .
" We have to figure out what works best , because I think it 's different for each child .
" Pranav draws his intelligence from both sides of the family .
His father has a Ph.D. and his mother has two master 's degrees .
What does Pranav want to be when he grows up ?
" An astronaut , " he said without hesitation .
Truly , for Pranav , the sky 's the limit .

Gov. Rick Perry ( R - TX ) made national headlines this month when he said that Texas may have to leave the United States , due how bad things could get in Washington , but in order to deal with swine flu outbreak , Perry has requested federal help .
Maybe all that secession talk was n’t such a great idea ?
Perry said in a statement , “ As a precautionary measure , I have requested that medication be on hand in Texas to help curb the spread of swine flu by helping those with both confirmed and suspected cases of this swine flu virus , as well as healthcare providers who may have come in contact with these patients .
We will continue to work with our local , state and federal health officials to ensure public safety is protected . ”
This current tone is different than Perry ’s re-election pandering at a tea party , “ We ’ve got a great union .
There ’s absolutely no reason to dissolve it .
But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people , you know , who knows what might come out of that .
But Texas is a very unique place , and we ’re a pretty independent lot to boot . ”
Perry became a national joke with his talk of secession , but he did accomplish his goal of staking out some far right turf ahead of his reelection campaign .
Advertisements
Perry is going to be challenged by popular Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in the 2012 gubernatorial GOP primary .
Perry is n’t very popular in the state .
At best his approval rating is a 50/50 split in some polls , while Hutchison ’s approval ratings are usually around 60 % .
Hutchison is also popular with the state ’s conservative Democrats , so Perry is facing an uphill battle for reelection against a well known , liked , and well funded opponent .
Perry has a responsibility to take care of the people in his state , but taking a far right position on secession , then asking the federal government for help , not only makes him look like a hypocrite , but also a fool .
Perry is desperate , and desperate people often act and speak in a contradictory manner , which is what Perry is doing in this case .
The fact that he had to ask the government for help with the swine flu , illustrates how stupid his secession comments were .

A bill by West Virginia Republican state Del. Craig
Blair that would have mandated random drug testing of people who receive food stamps or unemployment benefits received nationwide publicity , but no respect in Charleston , where the measure is stalled in committee and wo n't even get a hearing .
A last chance effort by Blair to force the bill to a House floor vote Tuesday was defeated 70 - 30 on a straight party line vote .
The bill , HB 3007 , picked up a handful of cosponsors , but also attracted heated opposition from welfare rights , civil liberties , and children 's advocacy groups .
Opponents argued that requiring drug testing to receive government benefits was most likely unconstitutional , more likely to impact poor families negatively than not , and just downright cruel .
Blair argued that the state was facing " a crisis " of drug abuse among state aid recipients , but never produced evidence to back up his claim .
But he has still achieved something : Instant notoriety .
Blair , who is not publicity - shy , created his own NotWithMyTaxDollars.com web site to push the bill , and has gotten national media attention .
He claims his web site has 50,000 hits now .
But he has also suffered the slings and arrows of outraged fellow legislators .
Del. Sally Susman ( D - Raleigh ) hand delivered a letter to Blair calling his bill the " most ridiculous " of the session .
House Judiciary Chairwoman Carrie Webster ( D - Kanawha ) said of Blair that " he has an idea , but he has no plan , " as she explained that many bills never make it to committee agendas .
Blair and his drug testing bill are gone for this year .
But similar efforts remain alive in a handful of other states .

Stefan Jacoby is the CEO of Volkswagen Group of America .
He told Automotive News it is his view that it will take electric cars 35 year to gain a significant share of the global automotive market .
The obstacle ?
Infrastructure .
Jacoby argues " What would happen if 50 million new electric customers would plug their electric cars in an electric socket ?
There is no country on earth that is really properly prepared for electric cars . "
Of course VW has bet on diesel , and already 30 % of new Jettas sold in the US use clean diesel technology .
He thinks it is unrealistic that people will adopt electric cars in mass number , and believes electric motors are n't yet " properly developed . "
Resigned to the fact " We have to live for a certain period with fossil fuel engines , " Jacoby thinks optimization of those engines are the best near term plan .
This may or may not be the case .
Technological advances tend to happen abruptly .
Remember the the Internet in 1992 ?
Studies have also concluded the current US electric grid could handle up to 50 million electric cars , with charging absorbed by considerable excess capacity in off peak times .
It may be true that less developed countries will have a longer way to go to adopt electric cars as they are only now beginning to adopt petroleum powered ones , however it is possible that electric cars could be the starting point for those populations .
For example Tata Motors which make the world 's cheapest car in India , the Nano , is planning an electric version .
China too has its own low budget electric car , the BYD FD3M already on the market .
The rate of current US automotive fleet replacement is about 7 million cars per year .
Since the total fleet is about 100 million , if half of them are replaced with electrics , then in 10 years 35 % of the US auto fleet could be elctric .
True , it may take time for electric cars to make significant ground , but 35 years is pushing it .
Sorry Mr. Jacoby , you can keep your diesels .

Yesterday we saw the worst set of public finance figures in our peacetime history .
According to some forecasters Britain is set to have the largest budget deficit of any G20 country this year .
It could be more than 10 per cent of our GDP – that is easily the biggest deficit since the Second World War , and worse than countries that have had to go to the IMF .
We can't put this problem off until some unspecified time in the future , however much this government would like to do so .
Our fiscal position is sapping confidence , which means we are losing a potential cash injection into the economy that our indebted Treasury cannot afford itself .
So that 's why the Conservatives will make debt reduction a high priority .
If we do n't take concrete steps to start reducing this massive debt now the recession will get worse , and the recovery will be delayed .
To achieve this we need to control public spending , in both the long term and the short term .
In the long term , we will control spending by reducing the demands that the broken society makes on the state .
Family breakdown , welfare dependency , educational failure , addiction and crime all cost taxpayers untold billions a year .
If we do not confront the root causes of these problems that bill is only going to rise .
That 's why far from retreating from our plans for school reform , welfare reform and strengthening families , we are as committed to them as we have ever been .

These social changes will not produce public expenditure savings in the short term , so we need a plan to control public spending now .
The work to restore fiscal sanity will have to start on day one , in order to build the confidence of consumers and the international markets .
That means examining each extension of the state that has taken place to see if it is delivering results .
That means curbing the culture of excessive executive salaries in quangos .
And that means assessing whether it is right that people who earn as much as £ 50,000 a year receive tax credits .
But this does n't mean we are going to behave like turbo - charged accountants , slashing spending without regard to the social consequences .
We are going to behave like progressive Conservatives .
There will be tough decisions to make , and there will be people to disappoint – I would never claim that controlling public spending can be a pain - free process .
But it is an entirely different exercise when it is underpinned by a clear and compassionate philosophy .
Its objective is a society that is fairer , safer and greener , where opportunity is more equal – and where future generations are n't burdened by our debts .
If we are in government these objectives will be at the forefront of our minds every single day , leading each and every spending decision we make .
Because today , my Party understands that fiscal responsibility needs a social conscience , or it is not responsible at all .
David Cameron is the leader of the Conservative Party

Want to help fund the bank bailout , ease California ’s budget crisis and shore up strained U.S. finances ?
Legalize drugs , tax the trade and save on interdiction , domestic enforcement and the prison and court system .
I ’m only partly joking .
It wo n’t solve all of the U.S. ’s problems and lord knows will cause some new ones , but the money is undeniably big enough to make a dent .
After all , it certainly helped Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who legalized alcohol in 1933 in the midst of the Depression and after more than a decade of prohibition , thus bringing a half a billion in 1933 dollars into public coffers in the form of tax revenue .
By 1936 , alcohol taxes were 13 percent of Federal revenue .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has a similar opportunity .
He is facing a $ 42 billion budget deficit , his prisons are filled to bursting , in substantial part with people in on drug - related crime , and he will soon be forced by judicial edict to start freeing people .
He also has an offer from a group call Let Us Pay Taxes , which claims to represent the marijuana industry and is willing to pay $ 1 billion annually in taxes if only he will legalize .
No doubt they are low - balling .
The U.N. estimates the value of the U.S. cannabis market at $ 64 billion annually , while a paper by academics Jonathan Caulkins and Peter Reuter calculates that about half of the costs of drugs are in one way or another attributable by factors linked to interdiction and its perils ( click here to read Render ’s paper in pdf format ) .
But even if you cut the U.N. number in half and only tax it at 50 percent , a lower tax than many states and localities put on tobacco , you ’d still get more than $ 15 billion nationwide .
If California consumes its 13 percent share , in line with GDP , and I am betting it does , you are looking at something on the order of $ 2 billion even before you take account of lower costs .
Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Miron has a lower estimate , at $ 7.7 billion annually nationally in lower spending and $ 6.2 billion in extra revenues .
Of course , these figures could fluctuate wildly depending on levels of compliance and market factors .
But why stop at cannabis ?
Just as Roosevelt decided that prohibition of alcohol was a failed policy the U.S. could no longer afford , perhaps the costs of re-building the U.S. banking system and lifting the country out of a severe recession will prompt another radical plans .
I would n’t bet on it , but strange things are happening all over .
A BILLION HERE , A BILLION THERE
And if we start including other drugs the billions will only mount .
There is another $ 100 billion in annual illegal drug sales in the U.S. outside of cannabis , which might produce another $ 25 billion annually in revenue by the same maths .
The U.S. Federal government alone spent $ 13 billion on the drugs war in 2002 , not counting prison costs .
Then there are other costs of the American drug interdiction efforts internationally , not least in Afghanistan , where opium revenue fuels the Taliban .
The U.S. spends more than $ 1 billion a year there on anti-drug efforts , but opium money undoubtedly raises the total costs for the U.S. by much more .
The stream of income from all of this extending into the future is very valuable indeed and would go a way towards paying the price of fixing the banking system .
This brings us to another point of weakness for the U.S. ; namely its ability to fund all of the costs it has already taken on and is likely to have to shoulder in the next several years .
Moody ’s credit rating agency did what everyone has pretty much taken for granted for a while not long ago , acknowledging that the U.S. ’s AAA credit rating is being “ tested ” and falls into a category below those on the top shelf like Canada and Germany .
It ’s not all wine and roses though .
Cheaper legal drugs may lead to a spike in use , which might hit productivity and impose lots of costs , such as higher health and other welfare costs .
All of those prison , military and law enforcement jobs are a huge source of stimulus , and the cut backs implied by legalization would raise transitional problems .
Moreover , drug legalisation , just like for alcohol , is essentially a moral and political decision about which reasonable people can disagree .
It ’s also , to put it mildly , not very likely .
Still the war on drugs rolls on , costing billions , creating huge incentives for violence and crime , imprisoning hundreds of thousands and seemingly never much closer to victory .
The waste and misery involved must make it rival the sub - prime bubble as a misallocation of resources .
Perhaps one stone will end up killing two birds .

Considering the amount of money the Chinese have loaned us , he should be worried :
BEIJING — The Chinese prime minister , Wen Jiabao , spoke in unusually blunt terms on Friday about the “ safety ” of China ’s $ 1 trillion investment in American government debt , the world ’s largest such holding , and urged the Obama administration to offer assurances that the securities would maintain their value .
Speaking ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and bankers this weekend near London to lay the groundwork for next month ’s Group of 20 summit meeting of the nations with the 20 largest economies , Mr. Wen said that he was “ worried ” about China ’s holdings of United States Treasury bonds and other debt , and that China was watching economic developments in the United States closely .
As the financial crisis has unfolded , China has become increasingly vocal about what it perceives as Washington ’s mismanagement of the global economy and financial system , joining a chorus of foreign critics of unbridled American capitalism .
On Thursday , for example , France and Germany rebuffed American calls to coordinate a global stimulus package at the G - 20 meeting , saying financial regulation should come first .
This is an interesting explanation of what ’s gone on with the stimulus debate :
The outcome is not surprising .
Obama had roughly 90 people working at his headquarters on Internet outreach and new technology projects , observes Joe Trippi , a Democratic operative who broke new ground on modern campaigning during Howard Dean ’s 2004 Democratic primary bid .
Even with closet - size spaces , the White House can accommodate only about 200 or so people for jobs ranging from national security to health care reform to Internet guru .
The Obama team “ built this incredible campaign and now they have these ridiculously primitive tools .
The communication tools they mastered do n’t exist in the White House .
It ’s like they are in a cave , ” said Trippi .
“ Then there are the masters of the Stone Age , and they are doing a good job , ” he added .
Certainly , the Republican attack tools here have been crude and old - fashioned — go on talk shows and lie , get the wingnut radio to rant about pork , etc .
And , I think to some extent , the media has gone a long with it all because they ’re comfortable with this , having come of age in a post - Nixonian political environment dominated by bogus culture wars and mind - numbingly stupid right - wing agitprop .
I can imagine Richard Cohen writing column title “ Luddites 1 , hopey internet gurus 0 ” or something like that .
But the whole idea that firing up the old wingnut distortion machine still constitutes a useful political strategy is dubious at best .
It seems to me that most media assumptions made about politics stem from what I call the Chris Matthews cranky uncle theory of politics , whereby elections are decided by people like Chris Matthews ’ angry uncle , who likes Republicans for “ cultural reasons ” and because he hates “ government waste ” , but who also may vote Democrat because he thinks they might dole out more money to him when he becomes unemployed and maybe because he used to be in a union .
But McCain won the cranky white bastard demographic handily last time and still got shellacked .
Obama won two - thirds of the under 30 vote and two - thirds of the Latino vote .
If that keeps happening — and there ’s no reason to think it wo n’t —
Republicans will keep losing elections badly .
There just are n’t enough cranky white bastards anymore .
Is there anything about the Republican strategy on the stimulus that will help them expand beyond the cranky white bastard demo ?
I ’m not sure .
And , no , Twittering their crazy neo-Hooverist rantings is n’t going to change anything .
Speaking of cranky white bastards , Broder is doing a Q&A at noon .
Bill O'Reilly is unhappy that evil liberal bloggers are connecting the hateful , violent , and paranoid rhetoric coming from the likes of himself and Glenn Beck to actual incidents of violence .
So he and Beck sat down to talk about it last night .
And of course , much unintentional hilarity ensued :
O'Reilly :
As you may know , the Factor and the Glenn Beck Program are enjoying huge ratings .
...
On the flip side , CNN and NBC , their cable networks are doing very poorly .
In the first quarter of the month , Fox News had 10 of the Top 10 cable news programs .
That means the others did n't have any .
We had all 10 .
That 's causing anger and desperation on the left .
And now some of these haters are accusing Beck , me and others of inciting violence .
As we reported last night on Policing the Net , these despicable people are now using murder to attack people with whom they disagree .
With us now to respond is Glenn Beck .
So you understand that this is just the jealousy factor .
Beck :
Oh yeah .
... [ Nattering about ratings ]
O'Reilly : Now , you had actually addressed -- for the folks that do n't know what we 're talking about , the tragedies in Binghamton and Pittsburgh , where 14 people were killed in Binghamton and three police officers in Pittsburgh , were driven by madmen .
People who flip and they go in and they do this .
And then these commentators , if you want to call them that , Internet fanatics , whatever word you wanna use , say , ' Oh no , O'Reilly and Beck , because they are complaining about the state of the union right now , they 're responsible . '
It 's absurd .
It is hateful , obviously .
I tend to ignore it .
But you actually did something on it , on your show .
This one took a long time because I forgot that Chinese parks having a ton of people in it would mean that I 'd have to draw said ton of people .
Jono counted for me , and it 's apparently 78 people .
o.O ; ; But !
At least I figured out the paper issue , so this one only took a 10 minute brush - up on Photoshop , instead of 2 hours .
But Chinese parks are interesting .
There was n't really a notion of a " public park " until the Westerners showed up .
Nowadays the parks are either co-opted from private Chinese gardens or private western parks ( from foreign concessions ) .
No matter how Western , they 'd always figure out a way to have water and meandering paths somewhere .
And no matter how Chinese , they 'd always add some open space .
And of course , during communist times , it was also the locus of mass entertainment and amusement , so it also has remnants of amusement park " rides " ( Merry - go - rounds , a horse pen , maybe a small pond with toy boats that you can race , a mirror maze , odd playground creatures ... ) .
Nowadays parks are also the place for morning exercise .
There would be two taichi groups and 3 social dance groups occupying the same place .
Crazy .
For example , the following photos were from the SAME PARK .
Namely , the park about 10 min walk from my uncle 's place in Shanghai .
The guy in here : he 's singing .
Because he feels like it .
The entranceAnd here 's one from a different park that shows the rival exercise groupsAnd then , there 's the size issue .
Chinese parks are very densely packed .
For example , here is Luxun park : But compared to , say , Golden Gate park , it 's positively tiny : For the Palo Alto folks , it 's more the size of Rinconada :
And for the Chicago folks , here it is compared to Jackson and Washington parks :
Even in choppy waters , recruiters are still angling for the perfect job candidate .
But employers do n’t have the time or resources to sift through all the applications churned up by the recession .
California ’s unemployment rate hit 10.5 % in February -- the highest in nearly 26 years -- while the national rate stands at 8.1 % .
To boost your chances of getting plucked , you ’ll need a top - notch resume .
That means one that combines eye - catching details and a fast , modern pitch with old - school basics , including impeccable grammar and spelling .
Today ’s successful resumes are marketing tools , not encyclopedia entries .
They ’re capable of selling your story on paper or online .

Here ’s how to get a recruiter to fall for your resume , hook , line and sinker .
Be a profit center
In these tough times , many companies are concerned with just staying afloat .
Show how you can boost revenue , increase productivity or cut costs for your prospective employer .
“ Focus on accomplishments , not responsibilities , ” said Doug Hardy , a resume expert for job search website Monster .
“ Look for numbers and put them up high . ”
Advertisement
Mention how , as a purchasing agent , you sought out bargains and negotiated millions of dollars of savings on supplies .
Or show how , as a sales manager , you were responsible for 80 employees and helped double their sales figures in just two months .
Even busboys and bank tellers can demonstrate how they boosted efficiency .
Remember to quantify the results .
Dollar amounts are the most effective , followed by time saved , then percentages , Hardy said .
Employers often search resume databases for candidates who “ saved 20 % " or “ increased revenue $ 100,000 . ”
But do n’t act like a hot shot and list your salary demands right off the bat .
Unless you ’re Manny Ramirez , you ’re likely to turn off employers in the current environment if you appear pricey and inflexible .
Go digital
Advertisement
Many employment applications now consist of online forms .
But that ’s just the first round .
If you hope to be seriously considered later , have a resume handy .
And be prepared to send it digitally .
More employers are using computers to scan resumes for certain keywords and phrases before any human recruiter sees them .
The trick is figuring out the code .
Here ’s one strategy : Browse job search engines such as Monster.com , Indeed.com or CareerBuilder.com ( which is part - owned by Tribune Co. , the parent of the Los Angeles Times ) and search for positions that match your skills .
See what terms employers are using and start using those in your resume .
Go easy on the italics , bold lettering and underlining .
Keep the font simple .
Minimize graphics and colors .
It will make the resume easier to read and download .
“ Do n’t cutesy it up , ” said Robyn L. Feldberg , president of the National Resume Writers ’ Assn .
“ Clip art and photos in general look tacky . ”
Advertisement
Some recruiters now read resumes on smart phones , devices that can send e-mail and browse the Internet .
Send a trial copy to a friend ’s BlackBerry or iPhone to see how it looks .
“ Sometimes , a bullet point comes across as a question mark -- not quite the brilliant first impression you were trying to make , ” she said .
Develop a permanent online home for your credentials .
The networking site LinkedIn lets you create a personal profile where you can list your education , professional experience and skills .
When you share your contacts with someone , that person in effect has access to your electronic resume .
Sites such as LinkedIn can put you on the radar of prospective employers , who increasingly are using online tools to hunt for qualified candidates .
Advertisement
But be warned : Companies trawl sites such as Facebook and MySpace to verify the backgrounds of prospects .
You ’d be wise to yank those online pictures you posted of yourself drunk in the hot tub while you ’re job hunting .
Be ( a little ) creative
Creativity counts when you ’re looking for work .
Graphic designers have screened their resumes onto T - shirts .
One recent applicant scored a manager position with a Manhattan accounting firm after wearing a sandwich board inscribed with “ Experienced MIT Grad for Hire . ”
If you ’re applying to a smaller , local company , show your enthusiasm by going into the office and handing the resume directly to the recruiter .
Who knows -- if you ’re likable enough , you might be offered an interview on the spot .
Advertisement
But there ’s a fine line between self - expression and self - destruction .
Skip the smiley faces , exclamation points and pink , scented resume paper -- only Elle Woods of “ Legally Blonde ” fame can pull that off .
And beware the video resume .
Less than a quarter of executives said their companies accepted them .
And consider the cautionary tale of Aleksey Vayner .
The Yale senior constructed a video resume a few years back , replete with clips of his weightlifting prowess , fancy dance moves and bizarre ramblings about what it takes to succeed .
Advertisement
Some snickering investment banker e-mailed it to friends .
It ended up on YouTube , where it promptly went viral .
National publications picked up the story , completing Vayner ’s humiliation .
Get to the point
Many recruiters narrow the field after just a cursory scan of your resume .
“ An employer is going to form a first impression in 30 seconds or less , ” Hardy said .
“ The only purpose of the top of the resume is to get them to read down to the end . ”
Advertisement
Be concise .
Keep the document to one page and leave the most relevant , impressive information at the top .
Avoid a too - detailed list of job experience , and cut out that waitress position you held for three months in college .
Leave plenty of white space .
Employers are n’t going to bother reading a resume so jammed that it requires a magnifying glass .
Laura DeCarlo , president of Career Directors International , recommends a “ summary ” early on of concrete skills , such as budgeting or supervision .
Florid prose is likely to irritate recruiters rather than impress them .
And skip the “ references are available upon request ” boilerplate .
Employers assume you ’ll provide them .
Advertisement
Customize
A targeted resume that demonstrates your understanding of the company and the specific requirements of the job will do better than a slightly rehashed version of a decades - old document .
“ It ’s a fatal flaw when people leave their resumes generic , ” Feldberg said .
“ The hiring manager ca n’t figure out what kind of job they want , and the candidate ca n’t present themselves as the solution to that employer ’s problems . ”
Never lie on your resume ; recruiters are increasingly vigilant about confirming credentials .
But you can tidy up flaws in your work history .
Advertisement
Start by shaking up the format of your resume .
The traditional method of listing your work history in reverse chronological order is becoming passe , experts said .
A “ functional ” resume might be best for someone switching careers or trying to hide gaps in employment .
Instead of a timeline , this format focuses on skills and experiences , showcasing a candidate ’s range of abilities .
Meanwhile , keep your skills current .
That item about your Microsoft Word proficiency might have been impressive 15 years ago , but highlighting it today makes you look dated .
Consider a short section on special interests .
Candidates for sales positions can show competitiveness by running marathons , while mechanical engineer hopefuls can prove their aptitude by building computers for fun , Feldberg said .
Advertisement
“ Employers do n’t care if you garden or like to spend time with your family , ” she said .
“ But mention a hobby if it pertains in some way to the job , or if it ’s so interesting that it could be a conversation starter . ”
It ’s illegal for prospective employers to ask your age , marital status , sexual orientation , religion or political affiliation .
So do n’t volunteer it .
Loose ends
Typos can be lethal to a resume .
More than 75 % of employers bounce applicants if their resumes contain spelling errors or are grammatically sloppy , according to the Society for Human Resource Management .
So run a spelling check , and then ask others to proofread your resume .
Advertisement
If you ’re still employed , do n’t include your work e-mail or work number .
You could lose the job you have .
Use your personal e-mail and cellphone instead .
But keep them professional .
Your bunnyboo@gottagetajob.com account does n’t belong on your resume .
And when prospective employers call your mobile or home phone , make sure they do n’t get a voice mail recording of your kids or that ear - splitting jam from Fall Out Boy .
After all , the only horn your resume should be tooting is your own .
Just make sure it ’s playing a song that recruiters want to hear .

Well it appears ES4 path is dead officially and a new standard has been published replacing it , the ECMAScript Fifth Edition announced in Geneva , Switzerland and will be in place as fully tested and approved by all involved by the end of 2009 .
ES5 was previously known as ECMAScript 3.1 or an iteration of the ES3 standard that is what most JavaScript is based on in all browsers , and was previously competing with the ES4 newer standard that changed Javascript quite a bit but in many areas much better , in some areas it was bloated .
This revision of ECMA - 262 will be known as ECMAScript , Fifth Edition .
It was previously developed under the working name ECMAScript 3.1 , which will no longer be used .
ECMAScript is the scripting language that is used to create web pages with dynamic behavior .
ECMAScript , which is more commonly known by the name JavaScript™ , is an essential component of every web browser and the ECMAScript standard is one of the core standards that enable the existence of interoperable web applications on the World Wide Web .
ECMAScript Fifth Edition ( ES5 ) was strongly guided by Crockford and Microsoft , which is different than the push for ES4 which is what ActionScript 3 is based on and was supported by Adobe and Mozilla .
However it seems everyone is happy and everyone is supporting this version to get things moving if you go by the ECMA Org quotes :
Industry Reaction Brendan Eich , Mozilla CTO and creator of the JavaScript language , said “ The Fifth Edition of ECMAScript makes real improvements based on browser innovation and collaboration in Ecma , which provides a solid foundation for further work in future editions . ”
Microsoft ’s ECMAScript architect , Allen Wirfs - Brock , commented “ We expect the Fifth Edition to benefit all web developers by helping improve browser interoperability and making enhanced scripting features broadly available . ”
Peace .
I still have to read further into the ECMAScript 5 specification which was published , but there are some new interesting things .
One nice feature is the JSON object .
Right now you have to eval to use JSON in javascript in a browser but they now have JSON.parse ( object ) and JSON.stringify ( object ) which is standard and conveniently already wired into IE8 this way .
This is based on the JSON2.js library by Douglas Crockford of Yahoo .
var jsObjString = " { \" memberNull\ " : null , \ " memberNum\ " : 3 , \" memberStr\ " : \" StringJSON\ " , \ " memberBool\ " : true , \ " memberObj\ " : { \ " mnum\ " : 1 , \" mbool\ " : false} , \ " memberX\ " : {} , \ " memberArray\ " : [ 33 , \" StringTst\ " , null , {} ] " ; var jsObjStringParsed = JSON.parse( jsObjString ) ; var jsObjStringBack = JSON.stringify(jsObjStringParsed ) ;
Another feature is DOM prototypes which are useful and cool , which allow you to extend dom objects .
If you use javascript or are an actionscripter , not sure if Adobe will have ActionScript 4 go this way or if Alchemy has changed the flash player into a multi language VM now .
It will be fun to watch things progress but also if you are into javascript it seems this standard , ES5 , will be it by the end of the year .
And probably since IE8 already supports it , in all new browser by then as well .
It will probably take 1 - 2 years before browser saturation makes this usable but if you are using standards that mimic this then there will be no change then , such as the JSON2.js library .

Despite all the hoopla surrounding Google 's Android open - source operating system for smartphones , so far only one phone is available to date that actually runs the Android OS -- the HTC Dream ( also knon as the T - Mobile G1 ) .
The HTC Dream is finally going to get some company in the form of only the second official Android phone to be announced -- also from HTC -- the HTC Magic .
The HTC Magic will start shipping in " the spring , " and it will initially only be available in Europe .
European mobile phone service provider , Vodafone , snagged the initial exclusive rights to sell the HTC Magic in the U.K. , Spain , Germany , and France ( via SFR , which is co-owned by Vivendi and Vodafone ) .
Vodafone claims that the HTC Magic will be " available from free on various price plans . "
The only place the HTC Dream will initially be available where it will not tied exclusively to a contract with Vodafone , will be in Italy .
HTC promises that the HTC Magic will be available in more countries at a later date , presumably including the U.S.
The HTC Magic announcement comes out of the Mobile World Congress 2009 trade show in Barcelona , Spain , a day after HTC announced its Touch Diamond2 and Touch Pro2 smartphones , which will also start shipping in the spring and which will initially be available only in the Europe and Asia .
The HTC Magic shares many similarities with the HTC Dream , such as a 3.2 - inch QVGA touch - screen display , trackball , 3.2 - megapixel camera , 3.5G and Wi-Fi connectivity , and microSD 2.0 support .
They both include a full bevy of Google apps ( Google Mail , Google Talk , Google Maps , Google Search , and YouTube ) , POP3 and IMAP support , an " Android - optimised Webkit browser , " and access to the Android Market .
Both models use the 528MHz Qualcomm MSM7201A processor , and include 256MB ROM and 192MB RAM .
What truly differentiates the HTC Magic from the HTC Dream is that the HTC Magic does not include a slide - out , five - row , QWERTY keyboard like the HTC Dream does .
The HTC Magic is also about an ounce and a half lighter than the HTC Dream ( 4.18 - ounces vs. 5.60 - ounces ) as well as being a slightly smaller device ( 4.45x2.17x0.54- inches vs. 4.60x2.16x0.62 - inches ) .
Lastly , the HTC Magic 's 1,340 mAh Lithium - Ion battery is rated to last longer ( 450 minutes talk time , 420 hours standby for GSM ) than the HTC Dream 's 1,150 mAh Li-Ion battery ( 406 minutes talk time , 319 hours standby for GSM ) .
The future success of Andoid phones still remains to be seen .
As of now , Android - based smartphones represent only about 3 - percent of smartphones making Internet requests in the U.S. , according to AdMob .
Until more mobile phone manufacturers release Android phones and more Android - based models make it onto the market , Android will remain to be little more than an interesting experiment in open - source mobile - phone technology .
Ocean fertilisation experiments hope to boost krill populations in the southern ocean ( Image : AWI )
UPDATED : The German science ministry has suspended Victor Smetacek ’s ocean seeding experiment , demanding that an independent assessment into the environmental impacts of the experiments be carried out before the iron filings are dumped in the Southern Ocean .
The Alfred Wegner Institute confirmed to New Scientist that operations on board were suspended until further notice .
The largest and to date the most comprehensive experiment to soak up greenhouse - gas emissions by artificially fertilising the oceans set sail from South Africa earlier this week .
The ambitious geoengineering expedition has caused a stir among some campaigning groups , but has the scientific backing of the UK , German , and Indian governments , as well as the International Maritime Organisation .

Within weeks , the ship ’s crew hope to dump 20 tonnes of ferrous sulphate into the Southern Ocean .
Plankton need iron to grow , and the aim of the expedition is to trigger a plankton bloom and boost the amount of carbon that is sucked out of the air and locked up at the bottom of the ocean .
The team , led by Victor Smetacek of the Alfred Wegner Institute , Bremerhaven , Germany , will also monitor the population of krill to see if their populations also increase .
These small crustaceans feed on plankton and are an important food source for many marine species .
So , if the population grows , this could give fisheries a boost .
‘ Anti-offset crusaders ’
Ocean fertilisation experiments have been carried out on a few occasions in the past , but became controversial in 2007 when a company called Planktos announced it would dump iron fillings off the coast of the Galapagos islands .
Some environmental organisations , including the ETC group , expressed concerns that this was tantamount to pollution and , by affecting plankton at the bottom of the food chain could have unforeseen consequences .
Planktos eventually cancelled the expedition and the company folded due to lack of funds .
It blamed a “ highly effective disinformation campaign waged by anti-offset crusaders ” .
Following on the Planktos affair , both the International Maritime Organisation ( IMO ) and the Convention on Biological Diversity recommended that governments restrict ocean fertilisation activities .
So the fact that Smetacek ’s expedition – backed by the German government , which hosted the CBD ’s meeting last year – has been allowed to proceed has raised eyebrows .
“ If this iron dump goes ahead it will be in clear defiance of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity , ” warns Jim Thomas of ETC Group .
The CBD resolution makes an exception only for small coastal experiments , but Smetacek says his expedition has been approved by the German environment ministry .
‘ Slippery slope ’
Regardless of the CBD ’s recommendations , which are not legally binding , Smetacek ’s experiment is not in contravention of the IMO ’s London Convention on ocean pollution .
Its statement on ocean fertilisation ( pdf ) says “ ocean fertilization activities other than legitimate scientific research should not be allowed ” and adds that scientific experiments should be assessed on a case - by - case basis .
Smetacek insists his experiments have been approved by all necessary parties .
“ Twenty tonnes of iron particles in the vast ocean is very much drop in the bucket and is unlikely to have a lasting effect , ” says Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University .
“ The rational concern is that experiments will lead down some slippery slope – that small experiments could be scaled up without any regulation . ”
Planktos was a commercial organisation .
It intended to sell carbon credits to companies that would pay the company to dump iron in the oceans , which would in theory suck CO 2 out of the atmosphere and counter their own polluting activities .
For now , the CBD and the IMO agree there is not enough evidence that this would work and so are firmly against commercial activities .
Smetacek ’s experiments could reveal whether or not ocean fertilisation will work .
Even if it does , however , Caldeira does not believe companies should be allowed to sell carbon credits in return for fertilising the oceans .
He says this would simply encourage companies to continue emitting greenhouse gases .
Ocean fertilisation and other geoengineering schemes , says Caldeira , should be seen as potential short - term solutions that could cool temperatures while humans switch to non-fossil sources of energy .
I remember my first job out of college .
I had my own office , my own business cards and a snazzy title : Assistant Vice President of Marketing .
I made $ 20,000 a year -- minus parking .
The job had little to offer other than a title , which was proudly emblazoned on the dozen boxes of business cards I would never crack open .
" Marketing , " incidentally , meant " sales , " and " Executive Vice President " meant " huckster . "
I sold collectible coins for banks to use in giveaways .
Imagine the futility of trying to explain to a bank teller in Left Nut , Kansas why someone should pay more than one cent for a penny .
" They 're collectible , " I 'd explain .
" Like baby teeth . "
The company was five people big , and Assistant Vice President of Marketing was the bottom of the totem pole , below both Senior Vice President of Marketing and Executive Vice President of Documentation & Parking Validation ( the receptionist ) .
My boss , the Supreme Managing Chief Executive President Officer , targeted recent graduates for his labor force , knowing that : A ) they needed the money , and B ) they needed the self - esteem .
I personally jumped at any opening in polite conversation to slip in my title .
Think about it :
You open up your checkbook , sign a check leaving the amount open , tear the check off and say to the person who is bugging the piss out of you , “ This is a shut up check .
Fill in any amount you like .
Once you do , kindly shut the fuck up . ”
No muss .
No fuss .

The australian amateur photographer Chris Van Wyk was snorkeling in the Mary River , a river system in South East Queensland , Australia , when met this beauty and did n't lose the cance to take some amazing shots .

Well , Mary River
Turtle is an endangered species , and , as you may guess from its name , it inhabits just the Mary River .
The problem is that the Queensland Government announced on April 27 , 2006 its intention to dam the Mary River , a project that could have dreadful consequencies on the survival of three endangered species , Mary River Turtle , the Queensland_Lungfish and the Mary River Cod , which have in that area their only remaining habitat .

Case counters like Covidly and Worldometer passed the million mark earlier today , but Johns Hopkins is generally regarded as the most reliable .
Not that it matters ; we probably passed one million COVID - 19 deaths weeks ago .
It 's worth noting that the Johns Hopkins cumulative deaths graph shows that we hit 500,000 cases exactly three months ago , on June 28 .
Half a million people who shared the earth with us then are gone .

Two ultra-Orthodox Jewish newspapers have altered a photo of Israel 's new cabinet , removing two female ministers .
Limor Livnat and Sofa Landver were grouped with the rest of the 30 - member cabinet for their inaugural photo .
But Yated Neeman newspaper digitally changed the picture by replacing them with two men .
The Shaa Tova newspaper blacked the women out .
Publishing pictures of women is viewed by many ultra-orthodox Jews as a violation of female modesty .
Other Israeli papers reprinted the altered images next to the original photos , with one headlining it " Find the lady " .

The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) says an unusual new flu virus has spread widely and cannot be contained , as the World Health Organisation urges governments to be on the alert .
" It is clear that this is widespread , " the CDC's Dr Anne Schuchat told reporters .
" And that is why we have let you know that we cannot contain the spread of this virus . "
The strain of swine flu is suspected of killing as many as 60 people in Mexico and infecting thousands more .
It is a new strain , and therefore poorly understood .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) says it does not know the full risk yet .
The organisation has held an emergency meeting to discuss the outbreak .
Its director - general , Margaret Chan , says the deadly new form is serious and does have pandemic potential .
" It has pandemic potential because it is infecting people , " WHO Director - General Margaret Chan said in Geneva .
" However , we cannot say on the basis of currently available laboratory , epidemiological and clinical evidence whether or not it will indeed cause a pandemic . "
The WHO is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia like symptoms among their populations , particularly among young , healthy adults who seem to be the most affected in Mexico .
The CDC 's acting director , Dr Richard Besser , says it seems humans are transmitting the virus .
" There are things that we see that suggest that containment is not very likely , in that we are seeing cases in Texas and we 're seeing cases in San Diego without any connection between them , which makes us think that there 's been transmission from person to person , " he said .
The Mexican government says there will be a mass vaccination campaign , and in the meantime it has closed all schools and universities .
CDC officials are assisting public health authorities in Mexico to test additional specimens and providing epidemiological support as part of a WHO team .
The centres have also dispatched teams in southern California , where several cases were reported .
Health leaders in the US , Mexico , Canada and at the WHO say they are communicating frequently , and state and local US health authorities are conducting investigations .
There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu , only to protect pigs , according to the CDC .
Dr Schuchat says measures are being taken to produce a vaccine against the virus if necessary , but cautions that it usually takes " months " to produce a vaccine .
" We 're not going to have large amounts of vaccine tomorrow , " she warned .

Sometimes I wish I were somewhere else .
Who does n’t ?
On a beach , maybe ( done that ) .
Or at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan , where Obama says the action is now .
But on some days , my goodness , New York is pretty hard to beat .
Tonight at the glorious Brooklyn Academy of Music , I got to see a screening of Astra Taylor ’s ( of Zizek ! fame ) new film , Examined Life , in which she casts some of today ’s most attention - getting philosophers as noble peripatetics — and most of them on the streets and in the parks of New York City .
Cornel West , Judith Butler , Martha Nussbaum .
Yes , Zizek too .
Peter Singer , who ’s in the film , came to participate in the most bizarre Q&A I ’ve ever experienced ( two conversations at once , one audience member talking half the time , do n’t ask ) .
Through sounds and images , the film exposes us to the ideas and personal ticks of some incredible thinkers .
Kwame Anthony Appiah has never looked so good as posed in front of elevators in JFK Airport ( and , thanks to this city , I ’ve seen him in person twice in the last month ) .
The theater at BAM was packed with mostly young people really engaged with what was going on .
So while I was sitting there remarking at how maybe philosophy has become somehow cool , I had to ask :
Which philosophy ?
A unifying thread is n’t obvious .
West is a Christian pragmatist , Singer is an atheist utilitarian , and Zizek an ( intellectually ) anarchic psychoanalyst .
Nussbaum talks justice , Butler talks body , and Michael Hardt talks revolution .
Singer keeps talking about world hunger , but the die - hard folks wish he ’d keep talking about animals .
In a pointlessly nationalist mood , one might ask , is a particularly American philosophy emerging here ?
All but Zizek , after all , are primarily based here , and he ’s around pretty often .
Nah .
Connectedness is big , in one way or another .
Responsibility for others .
The badness of commercialism and of Bush .
But beyond that , not that I can detect .
So what is Astra Taylor giving us , if not the image of a movement ?
Beyond , at least , that most of these guys are great self - promoters .
A conversation , I think .
An image of the eschaton .
By tossing philosophy out into the streets of our insane cities , she holds out the possibility of Athens — the rosy - remembered world of Socrates , Plato , and Aristotle where thought was in the air .
The streets , the legend goes , were practically paved with ideas .
In good old anti-intellectual America , a philosopher in the street seems like a fish in the desert .
I like the film , in all its scatterbraining , because it invites us to do something new with our streets .
To take them as an opportunity to think , to talk , to criticize , and to imagine .
An Iowa couple has stepped forward with an editorial in the Des Moines Register and a video produced by the Iowa Family Policy Center , both claiming that their son was recruited by homosexuals and later died from AIDS because of it .
From the editorial :
The single most tragic event in our years together has been the untimely death of our oldest son , Randy .
Our firstborn was a blessing that brought so much joy into our lives .
He was extremely smart , he participated in extracurricular activities , graduated with many honors and went on to college .
After college , he moved to Omaha and took a job .
It was while he was living in Omaha that one of Randy ’s co-workers recruited him into the homosexual “ lifestyle . ”
We loved our son as much as any parents have ever loved a son .
Even when we became aware of his homosexuality , we assured him of our love .
That is not to say that we condoned or accepted what we knew to be a dangerous “ lifestyle , ” but we always maintained our relationship with the son we had raised and the man we prayed would be delivered from homosexuality .
…
It was interesting to note that once Randy was diagnosed HIV positive , the homosexual community who had actively recruited him and had claimed to be his “ family ” were nowhere to be found .
As his health declined , he spoke frankly about the homosexual experience .
Randy said , “ It is not an alternate lifestyle .
It is a cult . ”
The Milky Way -- our home galaxy -- is pretty sleepy , as galaxies go .
While bigger than most , it 's a good neighbor , generally behaving itself and keeping the noise down .
M87 , on the other hand is a galactic frat house .
Deep in the heart of every big galaxy is a supermassive black hole .
The Milky Way is no exception , but our black hole is quiet .
The one in the core of M87 , though is actively feeding .
As material swirls around the Point of No Return , magnetic forces align to channel out twin beams or jets of energy and matter that scream out from just above and below the black hole at nearly the speed of light .
Bad neighbor indeed .
At 50 + million light years distant it 's no danger to us , though it does keep astronomers up at night : our view of M87's jet is pretty clear , and when it hiccups , that can be a mighty eructation !
Behold :
What you are seeing are ultraviolet images from Hubble of the heart of M87 .
The bright spot on the left is the core of the galaxy where the black hole sits , and you can see it stays about the same brightness over time .
The jet is blasting out to the upper right .
The jet is n't smooth ; it 's clumpy , presumably due to past eruptions from the black hole as more matter tries to choke down the drain .
The inner clump or knot is called HST - 1 .
This time sequence shows it changing in brightness from 1999 to 2006 .
It brightens and fades with time , but in 2005 it suddenly increased in brightness so much that it actually blasted out 90 times the energy as its parent black hole !
What could cause such a horrendous explosion of luminosity ?
No one knows .
Maybe a wandering cloud of gas drifted into the jet and got slammed by the relativistically - moving particles , heating up and pouring out high - energy light .
Or perhaps the magnetic fields that focus the jet somehow got compressed , squeezing the material in the beam and causing it to glow ever - brighter .
It 's hard to say .
But this tremendous surge in energy has some interesting implications for astronomers who study galactic shenanigans .
We call galaxies like M87 active for obvious reasons .
There are different kinds of active galaxies , and the most energetic of them are called blazars .
We think these are galaxies where we are looking straight down the throat of the jet .
We see hugely energetic gamma rays from blazars as well as light from across the spectrum .
The gamma rays are so tightly focused that if the beam is aimed even slightly away from us we do n't see them .
Blazars are known for being highly variable in their light , fluctuating by a factor of ten or more in brightness over time .
It 's always been thought that these changes in brightness are tied to the way the black hole is feeding ; if a big ol ' clump of gas suddenly gets caught up near the hole , the jet gets a surge in energy .
But now we have reason to question this !
The knot that suddenly brightened so much in M87's jet was a long way from the black hole , far outside the maw of the beast -- a million times farther out than where we think the big energy changes happen near the black hole .
So it 's possible , even likely , that there are at least two ways a blazar ( or any active galaxy ) can suddenly blast out huge explosions of energy .
Science is like that .
It 's a bit ironic , I suppose : active galaxies caused astronomers headaches for decades .
They were all so different from each other !
Then it dawned on folks that maybe what we were seeing was the same phenomenon , but seen from different angles ( rather like the parable of the blind men and the elephant ) .
It unified the models , and things got a lot simpler .
Yay !
And now we see once again that Nature is cleverer than we are , still able to throw a monkey in our wrench .
We assumed jets were variable because their engine -- the black hole -- was eating matter at different rates , but now we see that something else can happen far away from that central engine , and whatever this process is it can dramatically change the appearance of the jet .
I personally like it when things like this crop up .
While it can make analysis harder , it makes life more interesting !
There are always more mysteries to solve , more puzzles to piece together .
In this case we did n't even know there were more pieces at all !
And so the game goes on .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Some people are blinded by their ignorance and hatred of guns .
I see that D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton is using the recent shootings in New York , Pennsylvania and Washington state as grounds to fight the reversal of gun bans in the District .
I find it unbelievable that she and other liberals cannot see the logic that there are bad people in this world and no law is going to stop a maniac hell - bent on destruction .
The District has some of the strictest gun laws in the entire country , but does Mrs. Norton not know that it ranked fourth - highest in 2002 for murder rates , with 46.2 murders per 100,000 people ?
She probably does n't know that two cities in Utah , Sandy and Orem , ranked near the very bottom with 1.1 murders per 100,000 .
Provo had 0.0 per 100,000 .
( Source : Morgan Quitno Press using data from FBI Crime in the United States 2002 . )
Utah has some of the most relaxed gun laws ever .
No one wants guns “ off the street ” and out of the hands of bad guys more than the National Rifle Association and law - abiding gun owners .
However , the data show very clearly that guns are not the problem ; people , specifically bad people , are the problem .
Crime is rampant in the District because criminals know they have free reign ( i.e. , everyone is defenseless ) .
Liberals hate guns more than they hate criminals , and this hatred prevents them from seeing logic .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India will increase defence spending by nearly a quarter in 2009 / 10 as the government focuses on security measures after November ’s Mumbai attacks .

India will increase defence spending by nearly a quarter in 2009 / 10 as the government focuses on security measures after November 's Mumbai attacks .
REUTERS / B Mathur / Files
Defence spending is set to rise 23.7 percent to $ 28.9 billion for the fiscal year 2009 / 10 that begins on April 1 .
“ We are going through tough times .
The Mumbai terror attacks have given an entirely new dimension to cross - border terrorism , ” Acting Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said while unveiling an interim budget ahead of a general election that must take place by May .
“ A threshold has been crossed .
Our security environment has deteriorated considerably , ” said Mukherjee , who is also the country ’s foreign minister .
Last year , India raised defence spending by 10 percent .
India is integrating its three armed forces -- the army , navy and the air force -- and increasing security along its coasts after militants from Pakistan attacked Mumbai from the sea route , killing 179 people .
The country is also looking to spend more than $ 30 billion over the next five years to modernise its largely Soviet - era weapons systems and is also launching its first military spy satellite next year .
But experts said a slow bureaucratic process could still delay modernisation efforts .
India seldom spends its entire budget allocation for defence because of red tape associated with arms purchases , and analysts said unless it clears pending deals faster , the budgetary allocation would not make any difference .
“ We are confronted with a massive deficit in capacity in terms of requirement and in terms of current strategic needs and global attention , ” said Ajai Sahni of New Delhi ’s Institute for Conflict Management .
“ We still have to see how it is spent . ”
India is planning one of its biggest ever arms purchases , a $ 10 billion deal to buy 126 fighter jets .
It is also building five nuclear submarines for $ 2.9 billion and spending an additional $ 1 billion on a domestic weapons development programme .
Some analysts said there was a positive intent to spend more on defence after the recent militant strikes and the budgetary allocation was a reflection of that change in India ’s attitude .
“ It is a reasonable increase and will help India deal with the inventory gap , as we have a number of items in terms of inventory replacement for the three armed forces , ” Uday Bhaskar , a strategic analyst said .
A charter boat crew member choked to death after swallowing a bait fish as a joke in front of elementary schoolchildren during a field trip to the Port of Long Beach , authorities said Wednesday .
Jeff Twaddle , 54 , of Huntington Beach , “ was trying to be lighthearted when he put this thing in his mouth ” on Friday , said Long Beach Fire Department Chief Frank Hayes .
“ But it became an airway obstruction , and he lost consciousness and went into full cardiac arrest . ”
Other crew members on board the Gale Force , which had been chartered by the Los Angeles Unified School District to take 20 students on a fishing trip along the breakwater , tried to dislodge the fish and apply CPR but were unsuccessful , authorities said .
Twaddle was taken to St. Mary Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead at 1:15 p.m. Friday , according to Los Angeles County coroner ’s Lt. Fred Corral .
An autopsy determined that “ this was an accident , ” he said .
“ The cause of death was listed as aspiration of fish . ”
School district officials sent letters to parents about the incident and offered crisis counseling to the students who were on board the vessel , authorities said .

Apparently the service on PS3 would require a one - time purchase of a $ 9.99 " Netflix Instant Streaming Disc " that must be inserted to stream video , but would be free otherwise .
The survey asks for your favorite console , and then asks if you'd be interested in the service for it ; presumably the Wii would be eligible as well .
We 've got to consider this a rumor as of now : Nobody has officially confirmed this , and our brothers from other mothers at Kotaku report that streaming on the Wii , at least , would be a " long time off . "
Here 's the complete survey .
Imagine that , as an added benefit to DVDs by mail , Netflix offers its subscribers the ability to watch movies & TV episodes instantly on their TV via their PS3 , choosing from a library of over 12,000 choices .
There are no advertisements or trailers and movies start in as little as 30 seconds .
You can fast - forward , rewind , and pause or watch again .
The movies & TV episodes you watch instantly are included in your Netflix membership for no additional service fee .
To take advantage of this Netflix functionality , you will need : * A Netflix subscription
* A Netflix Instant Streaming Disc ( one - time fee of $ 9.99 ) .
This disc must be put into your PS3 whenever you want to instantly watch movies and TV episodes from Netflix over the Internet
* Your PS3 must be connected to the Internet Netflix offers the following unlimited DVD plus unlimited streaming plans : * 1 Unlimited : Rent as many DVDs as you want , 1 DVD out at a time , plus an unlimited number of movies & TV episodes that you can watch instantly on your TV via your PS3 .

The original Star wars I realized that talk of money is thrown around quite a lot but you never actually see it ( other than Han flipping the bartender a coin after shooting Greedo ) .
I thought it would be cool to design a piece of Imperial currency as I saw it .
I designed it mostly after American money but used some European influences as well .
Hope you dig !-MarkMyspace : myspace.com/markbrooksartStar
Wars and all characters are copyright LucasfilmEDIT :
Thanks for all the comments guys !
I did n't really expect this type of response from the piece but I 'm happy you guya are digging it .
Just to answer a couple of questions I 've seen repeated a lot , Darth Vader was used on the 1 credit bill for the same reason the most famous American , George Washington , was used on the one dollar bill .
It 's the first standard credit the Empire uses to measure it's rate to other currency so I used the most recognizable figure from Star Wars .
The Death Star is is under construction instead of a completed Death Star to show the growth of the Empire and it's ever expanding reach .
It 's symbolic more than anything else .
Yes , they probably used universal credit cards or something else but I thought this would be cool , nothing more , nothing less .
Dick Cheney is one who should share a jail cell with Bernie Madoff .
He , more than anyone else , was the main cheerleader for the invasion of Iraq .
Well , 8 long years can be a bitch and in the end he left as one of the most disgraced Vice - Presidents EVER .
Well , what can I write ?
He 's back .
Cheney surely does not like Barack Obama and was a heavy pusher of total partisianship during his tenure .
The word " bi " was not even in his vocabulary .
He believed in us vs. them , which is why many Americans see such vitriol in Washington , DC .
He had a lot to do with it and Bush just followed behind .
Towards the end of the Bush Administration it was written and rumored that Cheney tried very hard to get former President Bush to pardon , MANY .
In fact , he wanted pre-pardons , for the likes of , um like , disgraced and dumb former Attorney General Alberto Gonazles , but it did not happen .
Cheney really wanted a full pardon for Scooter Libby , but Bush just said NO , to all of the above .
In other words , those who thought they may be saved , were left hanging out to dry by the former president .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney said he and former President George Bush had “ a fundamental difference ” over pardoning Scooter Libby .
“ I was clearly not happy that we in effect left Scooter hanging in the wind , which I do n’t think was appropriate , ” Cheney said .
Cheney pressed for a pardon for Libby , his former chief of staff convicted in 2007 of perjury in connection with the CIA leak case .
Bush declined to issue the pardon .
Cheney said the details of his disagreement with Bush are “ best left to history ” – or his upcoming memoir , which will cover his 40 years in Washington .
Cheney and Bush have spoken by phone three times since leaving office , the former vice president said .
“ We traveled a long way together in eight years , ” Cheney said .
Do n't blame the Bush administration for all the country 's economic problems .
That 's the message from former Vice President Dick Cheney .
President Barack Obama constantly talks about the enormous economic troubles that he inherited when he took office in January .
Cheney agrees that Obama did indeed came into power amid very difficult economic circumstances .
But Cheney says he does n't think the Bush administration can be blamed for creating the economic woes .
Cheney says it 's a global financial problem .
He says the idea that fault can assigned to the previous administration is " interesting rhetoric " but he does n't think people care about that .
And of course , Cheney does not believe the economic failure was on the Bush - Cheney watch .
Why would he ?
This man benefited and profited from this economy , especially the Iraq War .
A war that bankrupted this country .
So , of course he do n't give a damn .
While the Republicans wither every time Rush Limbaugh opens his mouth , they wither even harder when the " old administration by the name of Bush or Cheney " comes skipping out to any microphone so they can say their peace .
In other words , when Bush - Cheney left the White House , the Republicans said , " Good riddance " .
So , Cheney maybe you should continue to remain in your undisclosed location , either way your opinions are really not relevant any longer .
More from CNNs State of the Union , Iraq War : After watching this , Dick Cheney as George W. Bush , were two elected officials who left this country in shambles and will continue to try to clean their image up .
But like Herbert Hoover , when you leave a catastrophe on the desk for the man behind you to clean up , the only thing that will be remembered is what you DID or DID NOT do to put this country on the course it is on .
As for John King , CNNs interviewer , I am sure he is in the running for one of the WORST INTERVIEWS , EVER .
PITTSBURGH 
In a scene that neighbors described as a war zone , a gunman fatally shot three police officers on Saturday morning as they responded to a domestic dispute between a mother and her son .
Chief Nathan Harper of the Pittsburgh police said the gunman , Richard Poplawski , 22 , surrendered after a nearly four - hour standoff with SWAT team officers .
“ We have never had to lose three officers in the line of duty in one call , ” Chief Harper said at a news conference in the lobby of police headquarters on the North Side of the city .
The American flag and the Pittsburgh flag flew at half - staff just outside the building to honor the slain officers .
They were Eric Kelly , a 14 - year veteran of the force and married father of three daughters , and a pair of two - year department veterans , partners Stephen Mayhle , a married father of two daughters , and Paul Sciullo III , who was engaged to be married .
You must have experienced that a steam - rolling attack generates more spectator interest than an equally effective but subtle positional maneuvers to gain advantages .
This may be the reason that beginners ’ games often become hammer and tongs all the way .
No harm if you want to make attack your preferred style , but you should know how to prevail upon your opponent with your attack lest it ends up in a whimper !
Here are some points for you to consider to launch an effective attack .
What does an attack mean ?
It means checks , captures or creating threats to that effect .
Examine these possibilities carefully .
A most important aspect of attack to get a fair chance of success is timing .
A premature attack will soon run out of steam and you will be left with a weaker position .
As a footboard for launching attack , your pieces must be developed and coordinating among themselves .
You should be able to bring a greater concentration of power to bear on the attacked squares , either through your own development or exploiting your opponent ’s lack of development .
Your attack has a greater chances of success if enemy pieces are undeveloped or in a position from where they cannot join the battle readily when you start your attack .
Look for this opportunity .
Once an attack is launched , you will not find much scope of retreat , so try to analyze all likely variations beforehand .
Assuming that both players have handled their opening moves correctly , it is likely that kings have castled .
So you may have to plan to attack the castled king .
This means looking for weaknesses ( or creating weaknesses ) in the castled position .
Remember that any pawn advance from the row in front of the castled position creates some weakness but may be justified if it is a calculated move to start an attack .
If the opponent has castled kingside with a fianchettoed bishop , the advance of the NP to g6 is a weakness .
If you can exchange the enemy King Bishop , the weakness will become apparent readily .
If you are defending such a position , avoid the exchange of this bishop .
In castled position , the advance of RP to h6 also creates weakness at g6 square and along b1 - h7 diagonal .
Often a sacrificial attack on h6 pawn can completely ruin the castled position .
The importance of controlling the center was mentioned in the 50 tips on chess strategy , A breakthrough in the center often precedes an attack on the castled king .
You may also lock the center to facilitate pawn storming on the flanks .
Gaining a tempo is also an important part of attack .
A gain in tempo gives the effect of having two moves against the opponent ’s one .
During attack , a tempo gains you time , the importance of which was mentioned at the beginning .
Make maximum use of open or semi-open diagonals and files , particularly those leading to the castled king , by using bishops , rooks and queen as appropriate .
Look for the chance of eliminating the best defender , which is often a knight on f6 or bishop on g7 .
If you cannot directly eliminate the key piece (s ) , think of luring those away from their posts by offering something difficult to refuse !
If the players have castled on the opposite sides , it opens the chance for pawn advance towards enemy king to initiate the attack .
Many successful attacks have a surprise element .
A move that is practically unexpected may throw the opponent ’s thinking out of gear .
Such unexpected moves often come in the form of a sacrifice .
Look out for such surprise moves .
You can also think of a zwischenzug ( intermediate move ) as an element of surprise .
This is often made by changing your sequence of moves from what can normally be expected by the opponent .
But while attacking , do n’t be blind to possible counter - attacks by your opponent , which may upset your plans .
The news came just after halftime last night :
There were 55,571 tickets sold for the Impact ’s CONCACAF quarterfinal game against Mexico ’s Club Santos Laguna at Olympic Stadium .
That ’s more than four times the 13,000 capacity of nearby Saputo Stadium where the Impact play regular - season games .
( Though they might want to consider increasing that after all the demand this game has sparked . )
Of course , all that came secondary to ending the 90 minutes ( plus three minutes added time ) with a 2 - 0 lead on Santos Laguna .
Both teams play the second game in Mexico and whichever team has more goals at the end of both games advances to the semifinal .
That means the Impact can lose by a goal in that second game and still advance .
Good news .
To me , more interesting than the game itself ( the first goal came in the first five minutes , the second at the 77th minute , so there was a lot of dead time in between ) was seeing the Olympic Stadium filled with fans for a soccer game .
Those familiar with its sorry history know that this kind of activity is the exception rather than the rule .
It ’s rare even that the top balcony is opened up .
But this time it was nearly full , with only the very far corners having empty seats .
To be sure , the Grey Cup last fall had more people , though those tickets were n’t sold for $ 10 apiece .
I spent $ 20 on my ticket in the 300 level , in a small room ( about 100 seats ) near the press box .
It had the advantage of being able to see the whole field while not being too far away from it .
But I was a bit far away from the crazy fans , who emptied cans of blue smoke , set off flares and held their arms forward as if to bestow spiritual essence descended from Jesus himself onto the players on the pitch .
In the far corner , an ambulance ( and its first responders ) stood ready in case of any medical emergency .
With that many fans in attendance , the stadium became the size of a small city .
A small city that wants $ 4 for a coke or a hot dog .
I ’ll spare you photos of the game itself .
Professional photographers lining the pitch had a better angle and better cameras .
Instead , I ’ll give you an idea of what 55,571 people look like :
It was only when I got to the platform at Berri-UQAM that I remembered that tens of thousands of people heading to a soccer game causes a bit of a traffic jam .
The STM added extra trains to and from the stadium , but even then I had to wait for the third train before I could get aboard .
After being crammed into a metro car from Berri to Pie -IX , getting a bit too familiar with random people around me , I got off and joined another sea of fans trying to get from the metro to the stadium .
Pie -IX is specially designed to handle large crowds , but it was easily overwhemled during the hour before the game .
I found myself stuck in a giant crowd of people in the hall leading to the stadium , with only minutes to go until the scheduled kickoff , mentally berating myself for not having left earlier .
In the end , the traffic cleared up a lot easier than I had anticipated , and there was no line at the ticket office , so minutes later I was searching for my seat ( holding an Impact T - shirt that I ’d just bought at the only slightly overpriced rate of $ 20 ) .
I ended up missing the first five minutes , but catching the first goal as I was locating my seat .
After the game , the same thing in reverse .
Many decided that taking the tunnel to the metro would take forever , and instead opted to go outside .
I was one of those people .
Rather than take staircases to get to the footpath , lots of ( young ) people climbed walls and steep hills in the snow .
I ended up freezing a couple of fingers trying to get my grip on the ice .
They stung for a few hours but appear to have fully recovered .
Once I found my way to the metro , it was the same thing again .
Fortunately the STM were out in full force along with local police , and the process was smooth .
* Of course , not all of the 55,571 people were Impact fans .
Some were cheering Santos Laguna .
And they got some good - natured ribbing from the local hooligans after the game .
Sounds of the game
My personal media player has recording capabilities , so I decided to test them out .
It ’s actually not all that bad .
So here ’s two minutes of the most cliché crowd sounds you can hear :
" Die Europäische Kommission hat aktiv zur Krise beigetragen " Jan Pehrke
Wirtschaftswissenschaftler kritisieren die Deregulierungspolitik der EU und fordern einen Kurswechsel .
Das EuroMemorandum 2008/2009 attestiert der Europäischen Union Systemversagen .
Der von linken Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern aus Italien , Ungarn , Deutschland und anderen Ländern gemeinsam herausgegebene Report macht die neoliberale Politik der Kommission mitverantwortlich für die Wirtschaftskrise und schlägt „ Alternativen zum finanzmarkt - getriebenen Kapitalismus “ vor .
Ihre Counterparts um den ehemaligen IWF - Direktor Jacques de Larosière und den bundesdeutschen Monetaristen Otmar Issing kommen in dem für die EU erstellten Bericht zur Reform der Finanzaufsicht überraschenderweise zu ganz ähnlichen Befunden .
Allerdings rät die Gruppe zu einer konservativeren Therapie .
„ Europas wirtschaftliche und monetäre Integration ist den politischen Institutionen davongeeilt .
Die Ökonomien der europäischen Länder sind so stark miteinander verbunden wie die der US - amerikanischen Bundesstaaten (... ) .
Aber im Gegensatz zu den Vereinigten Staaten verfügt Europa nicht über Institutionen , die mit der Krise umgehen können “ , hat der Wirtschaftswissenschaftler Paul Krugman unlängst festgestellt .
Deshalb gibt es auch kein gesamteuropäisches Krisenmanagement .
Das von Kommissionspräsident José Manuel Barroso im November präsentierte gemeinsame Konjunkturpaket bestand im Wesentlichen aus der Addition der nationalen Konjunkturpakete , wobei dann auch noch Länder wie etwa Italien als Summanden ausfielen .
Gerade mal fünf Milliarden Euro zusätzlich machte die Union auf ihrem Frühjahrsgipfeltreffen im März locker .
Ansonsten mussten ein paar Finanzspritzen für die notleidenden Mitgliedsstaaten Ungarn und Lettland genügen .
Das EuroMemorandum
„ Strukturell schwach “ nennt Krugman die EU , was diese lange als ihre eigentliche Stärke begriffen hat .
Mit der Lissabon - Strategie wollte die Kommission Europa zum „ leichtesten Ort der Welt zum Geschäftemachen “ befördern , und die Rolle der Politik beschränkte sich dabei auf ein „ Wir machen den Weg frei “ .
Nach Meinung der Wirtschaftswissenschaftler der EuroMemorandum - Gruppe hatte das fatale Auswirkungen .
„ Die Europäische Kommission hat durch ihre besessene Liberalisierungs - , Marktöffnungs - und Deregulierungspolitik aktiv zur Krise in Europa beigetragen “ , heißt es im EuroMemorandum 2008 /09 .
So galt Barroso & Co. in ihrem Bestreben , einen einheitlichen europäischen Finanzmarkt zu schaffen , der Bankplatz England als Vorbild .
Staatliche Kreditinstitute wie die bundesdeutschen Stadtsparkassen passten da nicht ins Konzept , weshalb Brüssel Beihilfe - Verfahren eröffnete .
Sogar das Hypothekenkredit- Geschäft beabsichtigte man , für Europa zu erschließen .
Natürlich völlig losgelöst .
„ Die Erfahrungen der USA zeigen , dass gesetzliche oder andere Beschränkungen für die geographische Ausdehnung von Banken die Effizienz der Hypothekenbanken vermindern “ , befand ein Gutachten von 2005 .
Der Kapitalverkehrsfreiheitsrausch trieb die Liberalisierungsjunkies sogar zu einem ganz besonderen Vorschlag , nämlich dem , „ einen Subprime - Markt zu entwickeln und so das Volumen von Hypothekenkrediten zu erweitern “ .
Aber glücklicherweise mahlen die Brüsseler Mühlen nur langsam , denn als die „ Integration der Hypothekenmärkte “ anstand , gab es diese Märkte bereits nicht mehr , weil in den USA die Immobilienblase geplatzt war .
So verschwanden die EU - Pläne letztes Jahr wieder in der Schublade .
Die Europäische Zentralbank ( EZB ) durfte bei dem bunten Liberalisierungstreiben nur zuschauen , monieren die EuroMemorandler , zu denen unter anderem die bundesdeutschen Wissenschaftler Elmar Altvater , Joachim Bischoff und Frieder Otto Wolf zählen .
Sie hatte nur über die Preisstabilität zu wachen und keinerlei Aufsichtspflichten .
Als Alexandre Lamfalussy gemeinsam mit anderen Experten in seinem Bericht zur Liberalisierung der Wertpapiermärkte warnte : „ Stärkere Integration der Wertpapiermärkte bedeuten mehr grenzüberschreitende Verflechtungen zwischen Finanz - Intermediären , und dies verstärkt ihre Anfälligkeit gegenüber gemeinsamen Schocks “ und „ eine dringende Notwendigkeit “ erkannte , steuernd einzugreifen , winkte die EU ab .
„ Man schlug uns höflich aber bestimmt vor , das Thema fallen zu lassen “ , so der frühere Direktor der Bank für internationalen Zahlungsausgleich .
Der Larosière - Report
Der am 25 .
Februar veröffentlichte Larosière - Report kommt zu einem ähnlichen Befund wie das EuroMemorandum , obwohl die Autoren in Wort und Tat eher als Vertreter der reinen Marktwirtschaftslehre hervortraten .
So kann Jacques de Larosière auf Erfahrungen als geschäftsführender Direktor des Internationalen Währungsfonds und Consultant der Investmentbank BNP Paribas zurückblicken , während sein deutscher Kollege Otmar Issing in einem „ lockeren Beratungsverhältnis “ zu Goldman Sachs stand , in dem der ehemalige Chefvolkswirt der Europäischen Zentralbank seine angebotstheoretischen Ansichten sicherlich nicht verleugnen musste .
Das hinderte die Gruppe nicht an harschen Urteilen .
„ Auch wenn Europa die aktuelle Finanzkrise nicht zu verantworten hat , hat es doch zu ihr beigetragen und ist schwer von ihr getroffen “ , konstatiert der Bericht .
Die Finanzfachleute kritisieren das unkoordinierte Vorgehen der Kommission , das für einige Mitgliedsstaaten unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen habe , und führen es auf eine „ inadäquate Krisenmanagement - Infrastruktur “ zurück .
Auch die Europäische Zentralbank setzen de Larosière & Co. auf ihre Mängelliste , weil diese streng monetaristisch nur über die Inflationsgefahr wachte .
In ihrer Fokussierung auf die Konsumentenpreise hat die EZB alle sonstigen Entwicklungen auf den Geld - und Kreditmärkten aus den Augen verloren , urteilt der Report .
Gerade durch die krisenbedingten Fusionen auf den Finanzmärkten sieht die Arbeitsgruppe die Gefahr von Instabilitäten noch wachsen .
Die Konglomerate seien nicht nur „ too big to manage “ und „ too big to fail “ , sondern auch „ too big to save “ , befürchten die Finanzprofis .
Trotz der Marktdominanz dieser Big Player und bestehender Antitrust - Gesetze machen sie sich allerdings nicht allzu viel Hoffnung auf Besserung : „ Es ist wenig wahrscheinlich , dass große Finanz - Institutionen in ihre Einzelbestandteile aufgespalten werden . “
Dieser resignative Gestus beherrscht auch die Reformvorschläge der Runde .
Obwohl sie nicht glaubt , „ dass Regulation all diese Probleme lösen kann “ , beschränken sich ihre Empfehlungen neben der Forderung nach mehr Transparenz im Wesenlichen eben darauf .
Herzstück ihrer Agenda , die unverzüglicher Umsetzung bedarf - „ Work must begin immediately ! “ - ist die Einrichtung eines „ European Systematic Risk Councils “ ( ESRC ) unter dem Dach der Europäischen Zentralbank .
Dieses soll die bisher von der EZB so sträflich vernachlässigte makro - ökonomische Lage der Dinge analysieren und schnell potenzielle Gefahrenherde identifizieren .
Zudem rät der Larosière - Bericht zu einer strengeren Kontrolle der Rating - Agenturen und des „ parallelen Banksystems “ , also der Investment - und Hedge - Fonds .
Derivate und Zertifikate bedürfen ebenso einer intensiveren Überwachung .
Die Banken müssen nach Meinung der Sachverständigen für solche Produkte mehr Sicherheiten ausweisen und auch sonst ihre Eigenkapital - Ausstattung verbessern .
Darüber hinaus legen sie den Geldhäusern nahe , ihre internen Risiko - Modelle mit externen zu verbinden .
Stimmt die EuroMemorandum - Gruppe in der Analyse der Schwachstellen des Systems weitgehend mit de Larosières Mannen überein , so zieht sie doch weit radikalere Schlussfolgerungen .
Ihr Glaube an die Regulierbarkeit des ganzen Kasinobetriebs ist begrenzt .
Auch erwarten die Wissenschaftler nicht , dass ein besserer Informationsfluss und mehr Transparenz viel zur Schadensbegrenzung beitragen .
Die solchen Ansätzen innewohnende Logik , nach der der homo oeconomicus schon auf den Pfad der Vernunft zurückkehren wird , wenn er erstmal wieder den Wald vor lauter Bäumen sehen kann , teilen die EuroMemorandler offensichtlich nicht .
„ Für das Bankensystem reicht es bei weitem nicht aus , die Transparenz zu erhöhen “ , schreiben die Ökonomen und treten für eine Verstaatlichung der Banken , ein Verbot von Hedge - Fonds und Schuldverbriefungen , eine Börsenumsatzsteuer sowie für eine Schließung der Off - Shore - Zentren ein . „ Entschleunigung “ ist für sie das Gebot der Stunde und Umverteilung ein Mittel dazu , denn die in den letzten Jahren stark gewachsenen privaten Vermögen haben nach ihren Beobachtungen einen immensen Druck auf die Finanzmärkte ausgeübt .
Insgesamt plädieren die Forscher dafür , das Bankensystem stärker auf gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgaben zu verpflichten .
So sollte die EZB , statt einseitig nur auf Preisstabilität fixiert zu sein , auch Verantwortung für ausgeglichenes Wachstum , Beschäftigung und stabile Finanzmärkte übernehmen , meinen sie .
Dafür müsste Brüssel sich ihrer Ansicht nach allerdings vom „ Stabilitäts - und Wachstumspakt “ lösen .
Bleibt alles anders
Dazu dürfte die EU kaum bereit sein .
Eine „ flexible Anwendung “ des Stabilitätspaktes - mehr wollte die Kommission im Rahmen ihres Krisenmanagements nicht zugestehen .
„ Der Stabilitäts - und Wachstumspakt bleibt der Grundpfeiler der Budget - Richtlinien der EU “ , bekräftigte der Europäische Rat im Dezember letzten Jahres .
So gehen dann auch die Defizit - Verfahren , die im Moment gegen Spanien , Frankreich , Irland und Griechenland laufen , munter weiter ihren juristischen Gang .
In die Lissabon - Strategie mit ihrem Ziel , die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Mitgliedsländer zu steigern , muss sich der „ Recovery Plan “ ebenfalls einfügen , so der Rat .
Nach Meinung des Bochumer Professors für Öffentliches Recht , Andreas Fisahn , kann die Europäische Union auch gar nicht anders als neoliberal .
Während der Kapitalismus es hierzulande nicht zum Verfassungsrang gebracht hat , verpflichten die Verträge von Nizza und Lissabon die Europäische Union auf den „ Grundsatz einer offenen Marktwirtschaft mit freiem Wettbewerb “ .
Und für den Kapitalverkehr gilt Fisahn zufolge sogar eine Liberalisierungspflicht .
Allerdings lässt der Artikel 65 „ aus Gründen der öffentlichen Ordnung und Sicherheit “ Ausnahmen zu , worauf das EuroMemorandum jedoch keine allzu großen Hoffnungen setzt .
Am Beihilferecht hat der Europäische Rat indessen schon gedreht und den Unterstützungsrahmen für Unternehmen auf 500.000 Euro ausgeweitet , obwohl die EU sonst kein Pardon kennt und beispielsweise der WestLB mit Verweis auf dieses Rechtsinstitut das Leben weiterhin schwer macht .
Ein sozialeres Europa ?
Aber in den „ Trotz alledem “ - Beschwörungen der „ Lissabon - Strategie “ und des Stabilitätspakts nebst „ flexibler Anwendungen “ drückt sich bereits die leise Ahnung aus , im Angesicht der Weltwirtschaftskrise mit der bisherigen Politik an eine Grenze gestoßen zu sein .
Auf der Konferenz „ Für ein soziales Europa “ , welche die der Linkspartei nahe stehende Rosa - Luxemburg - Stiftung am 21 .
März in Düsseldorf organisiert hatte , erkannte der bündnisgrüne Europa - Kandidat Sven Giegold dann auch „ Chancen jenseits der Verträge “ .
Annelie Buntenbach vom DGB - Vorstand setzte derweil neben der europa - weiten Großdemonstration der Gewerkschaften im Mai auf die Initiative , eine Verpflichtung zum sozialen Fortschritt in den Lissabon - Vertrag aufzunehmen , um dem Europäischen Gerichtshof , der schon das Streikrecht beschnitt , Mindestlöhne verbot und eine Arbeitszeitrichtlinie mit einer Höchstgrenze von 65 Wochenstunden absegnete , die Rechtsgrundlage zu nehmen .
Euroskeptizismus ward in Düsseldorf derweil nicht gesehen .
Wenn sich die Proteste auf die nationale Ebene beschränkten , bleibe man immer in der Logik von Wettbewerbsstaaten , hielt Richard Detje von der Zeitschrift „ Sozialismus “ mit Blick auf Opel fest .
Der Linkspartei -Kandidat für Straßburg , Jürgen Klute , teilte diese Auffassung : „ Es geht nicht darum , ob wir Europa wollen , sondern welches Europa wir wollen “ .
Ob das gewünschte Europa allerdings mit der Wahl vom 7 .
Juni kommt , steht einigermaßen in Frage , denn Beobachter räumen der konservativen Fraktion keine schlechten Chancen ein , ihre Mehrheit zu verteidigen .

A Descent into Limbo

ABSTRACT
‘‘ If , reader , you are slow now to believe
What I shall tell , that is no cause for wonder ,
For I who saw it hardly can accept it . ’’
Dante Alighieri , Inferno , Canto XXV .
Limbo is a new programming language , designed by Sean Dorward , Phil Winterbottom , and Rob Pike .
Limbo borrows from , among other things , C ( expression syntax and control flow ) , Pascal ( declarations ) , Winterbottom ’s Alef ( abstract data types and channels ) , and Hoare ’s CSP and Pike ’s Newsqueak ( processes ) .
Limbo is strongly typed , provides automatic garbage collection , supports only very restricted pointers , and compiles into machine - independent byte code for execution on a virtual machine .
This paper is a brief introduction to Limbo .
Since Limbo is an integral part of the Inferno system , the examples here illustrate not only the language but also a certain amount about how to write programs to run within Inferno .
1. Introduction
This document is a quick look at the basics of Limbo ; it is not a replacement for the reference manual .
The first section is a short overview of concepts and constructs ; subsequent sections illustrate the language with examples .
Although Limbo is intended to be used in Inferno , which emphasizes networking and graphical interfaces , the discussion here begins with standard text - manipulation examples , since they require less background to understand .
Modules :
A Limbo program is a set of modules that cooperate to perform a task .
In source form , a module consists of a module declaration that specifies the public interface - the functions , abstract data types , and constants that the module makes visible to other modules - and an implementation that provides the actual code .
By convention , the module declaration is usually placed in a separate .m file so it can be included by other modules , and the implementation is stored in a .b file .
Modules may have multiple implementations , each in a separate implementation file .
Modules are always loaded dynamically , at run time : the Limbo load operator fetches the code and performs run-time type checking .
Once a module has been loaded , its functions can be called .
Several instances of the same module type can be in use at once , with possibly different implementations .
Limbo is strongly typed ; programs are checked at compile time , and further when modules are loaded .
The Limbo compiler compiles each source file into a machine - independent byte - coded .
dis file that can be loaded at run time .
Functions and variables :
Functions are associated with specific modules , either directly or as members of abstract data types within a module .
Functions are visible outside their module only if they are part of the module interface .
If the target module is loaded , specific names can be used in a qualified form like sys -> print or without the qualifier if imported with an explicit import statement .
Besides normal block structure within functions , variables may have global scope within a module ; module data can be accessed via the module pointer .
Data :
The numeric types are :
The size and signedness of integral types are as specified above , and will be the same everywhere .
Character constants are enclosed in single quotes and may use escapes like ’
’ or ’ \udddd ’ , but the characters themselves are in Unicode and have type int .
There is no enumeration type , but there is a con declaration that creates a named constant , and a special iota operation that can be used to generate unique values .
Limbo also provides Unicode strings , arrays of arbitrary types , lists of arbitrary types , tuples ( in effect , unnamed structures with unnamed members of arbitrary types ) , abstract data types or adt ’s ( in effect , named structures with function members as well as data members ) , reference types ( in effect , restricted pointers that can point only to adt objects ) , and typed channels ( for passing objects between processes ) .
A channel is a mechanism for synchronized communication .
It provides a place for one process to send or receive an object of a specific type ; the attempt to send or receive blocks until a matching receive or send is attempted by another process .
The alt statement selects randomly but fairly among channels that are ready to read or write .
The spawn statement creates a new process that , except for its stack , shares memory with other processes .
Processes are pre-emptively scheduled by the Inferno kernel .
( Inferno processes are sometimes called ‘‘ threads ’ ’ in other operating systems . )
Limbo performs automatic garbage collection , so there is no need to free dynamically created objects .
Objects are deleted and their resources freed when the last reference to them goes away .
This release of resources happens immediately ( ‘ ‘ instant free ’ ’ ) for non-cyclic structures ; release of cyclic data structures might be delayed but will happen eventually .
( The language allows the programmer to ensure a given structure is non-cyclic when required . )
Operators and expressions :
Limbo provides many of C’s operators , but not the ? : or ‘ comma ’ ( sequential execution ) operators .
Pointers , or ‘ references ’ , created with ref , are restricted compared to C : they can only refer to adt values on the heap .
There is no & ( address of ) operator , nor is address arithmetic possible .
Arrays are also reference types , however , and since array slicing is supported , that replaces many of C ’s pointer constructions .
There are no implicit coercions between types , and only a handful of explicit casts .
The numeric types byte , int , etc. , can be used to convert a numeric expression , as in
nl := byte 10 ;
and string can be used as a unary operator to convert any numeric expression to a string ( in %g format ) and to convert an array of bytes in UTF - 8 format to a Limbo string value .
In the other direction , the cast array of byte converts a string to its UTF - 8 representation in an array of bytes .
Statements :
Statements and control flow in Limbo are similar to those in C .
A statement is an expression followed by a semicolon , or a sequence of statements enclosed in braces .
The similar control flow statements are
if ( expr ) stat
if ( expr ) stat else stat
while ( expr ) stat
for ( expr ; expr ; expr ) stat
do stat while ( expr ) ;
return expr ;
exit ;
The exit statement terminates a process and frees its resources .
There is also a case statement analogous to C’s switch , but it differs in that it also supports string and range tests , and more critically , control flow does not ‘‘ flow through ’’ one arm of the case to another but stops without requiring an explicit break ( in that respect it is closer to Pascal ’s case statement , hence the change of name ) .
A break or continue followed by a label causes a break out of , or the next iteration of , the enclosing construct that is labeled with the same label .
Comments begin with # and extend to the end of the line .
There is no preprocessor , but an include statement can be used to include source code , usually module declaration files .
Libraries :
Limbo has an extensive and growing set of standard libraries , each implemented as a module .
A handful of these ( notably Sys , Draw , and Tk ) are included in the Inferno kernel because they will be needed to support almost any Limbo program .
Among the others are Bufio , a buffered I/O package based on Plan 9’s Bio ; Regex , for regular expressions ; and Math , for mathematical functions .
Some of the examples that follow provide the sort of functionality that might be a suitable module .
2. Examples
The examples in this section are each complete , in the sense that they will run as presented ; I have tried to avoid code fragments that merely illustrate syntax .
2.1 . Hello , World
The first example is the traditional ‘ ‘ hello , world ’ ’ , in the file hello.b :
implement Hello ;
include " sys.m " ;
sys : Sys ;
include " draw.m " ;
Hello : module
{
init : fn( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string ) ;
} ;
init ( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys -> PATH ;
sys -> print ( " hello , world
" ) ;
}
An implementation file implements a single module , named in the implement declaration at the top of the file .
The two include lines copy interface definitions from two other modules , Sys ( which describes a variety of system functions like print ) , and Draw ( which describes a variety of graphics types and functions , only one of which , Context , is used here ) .
The module declaration defines the external interface that this module presents to the rest of the world .
In this case , it ’s a single function named init .
Since this module is to be called from a command interpreter ( shell ) , by convention its init function takes two arguments , the graphical context and a list of strings , the command - line arguments , though neither is used here .
This is like main in a C program .
Essentially all of the other examples begin with this standard code .
Commands are unusual , though , in that a command ’s module declaration appears in the same file as its implementation .
Most modules have a more extensive set of declarations ; for example , draw .m is 298 lines of constants , function prototypes , and type declarations for graphics types like Point and Rect , and sys.m is 160 lines of declarations for functions like open , read , and print .
Most module declarations are therefore stored in separate files , conventionally suffixed with .m , so they can be included in other modules .
The system library module declaration files are collected in the module directory at the root of the Inferno source tree .
Modules that are components of a single program are typically stored in that program ’s source directory .
The last few lines of hello.b are the implementation of the init function , which loads the Sys module , then calls its print function .
By convention , each module declaration includes a pathname constant that points to the code for the module ; this is the second parameter Sys -> PATH of the load statement .
Note that the Draw module is not loaded because none of its functions is used , but it is included to define the type Draw -> Context .
Compiling and Running Limbo Programs
With this much of the language described , we can compile and run this program .
On Unix or Windows , the command
$ limbo -g hello . b
creates hello.dis , a byte - coded version of the program for the Dis virtual machine .
The -g argument adds a symbol table , useful for subsequent debugging .
( Another common option is -w , which causes the compiler to produce helpful warnings about possible errors . )
The program can then be run as hello in Inferno ; this shows execution under the Inferno emulator on a Unix system :
$ limbo -g hello . b
$ emu
; /usr/bwk/hello
hello , world
;
From within Inferno , it ’s also possible to run a program by selecting it from a menu .
In any case , as the program runs , it loads as necessary other modules that it uses .
2.2 . A Graphical " Hello World "
The following module creates and displays a window containing only a button with the label ‘ ‘ hello , world ’ ’ as shown in the screen shot in Figure 1 .
implement Hello2 ;
include " sys.m " ;
sys : Sys ;
include " draw.m " ;
draw : Draw ;
include " tk.m " ;
tk : Tk ;
include " tkclient.m " ;
tkclient : Tkclient ;
Hello2 : module
{
init : fn( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string ) ;
} ;
init ( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys -> PATH ;
tk = load Tk Tk -> PATH ;
tkclient = load Tkclient Tkclient->PATH ;
tkclient -> init( ) ;
( t , nil ) := tkclient -> toplevel ( ctxt , " " , " Hello " , Tkclient -> Plain ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " button .b - text {hello , world} " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " pack .b " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " update " ) ;
tkclient -> onscreen(t , nil ) ;
sys -> sleep ( 10000 ) ; # wait 10 seconds
}
Figure 1 . ‘ Hello , world ’ button .
This is not very exciting , but it illustrates the absolute minimum required to get a picture on the screen .
The Tk module is modeled closely after John Ousterhout ’s
Tk interface toolkit , but Limbo is used as the programming language instead of Tcl .
The Inferno version is similar in functionality to the original Tk but it does not support any Tcl constructs , such as variables , procedures , or expression evaluation , since all processing is done using Limbo .
There are ten functions in the Tk interface , only one of which is used here : cmd , which executes a command string .
( It is the most commonly used Tk function . )
Tk itself displays graphics and handles mouse and keyboard interaction within a window .
There can however be many different windows on a display .
A separate window manager , wm , multiplexes control of input and output among those windows .
The module Tkclient provides the interface between the window manager and Tk .
Its function toplevel , used above , makes a top - level window and returns a reference to it , for subsequent use by Tk .
The contents of the window are prepared by calls to tk -> cmd before the window is finally displayed by the call to onscreen .
( The second parameter to onscreen , a string , controls the position and style of window ; here we take the default by making that nil . )
Note that Tkclient must also be explicitly initialized by calling its init function after loading .
This is a common convention , although some modules do not require it ( typically those built in to the system , such as Sys or Tk ) .
The sleep delays exit for 10 seconds so the button can be seen .
If you try to interact with the window , for instance by pressing the button , you will see no response .
That is because the program has not done what is required to receive mouse or keyboard input in the window .
In a real application , some action would also be bound to pressing the button .
Such actions are handled by setting up a connection ( a ‘ channel ’ ) from the Tk module to one ’s own code , and processing the messages ( ‘ events ’ ) that appear on this channel .
The Tk module and its interface to the window manager is explained in more detail later , as are a couple of other constructions , after we have introduced processes and channels .
2.3 . Echo
The next example , echo , prints its command - line arguments .
Declarations are the same as in the first example , and have been omitted .
# declarations omitted ...
init ( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys -> PATH ;
args = tl args ; # skip over program name
for ( s := " " ; args != nil ; args = tl args )
s += " " + hd args ;
if ( s != " " ) # something was stored in s
sys -> print ( " %s
" , s [ 1 : ] ) ;
}
The arguments are stored in a list .
Lists may be of any type ; args is a list of string .
There are three list operators : hd and tl return the head and tail of a list , and :: adds a new element to the head .
In this example , the for loop walks along the args list until the end , printing the head element ( hd args ) , then advancing ( args = tl args ) .
The value nil is the ‘‘ undefined ’ ’ or ‘‘ explicitly empty ’’ value for non-numeric types .
The operator := combines the declaration of a variable and assignment of a value to it .
The type of the variable on the left of := is the type of the expression on the right .
Thus , the expression
s := " "
in the for statement declares a string s and initializes it to empty ; if after the loop , s is not empty , something has been written in it .
By the way , there is no distinction between the values nil and " " for strings .
The + and += operators concatenate strings .
The expression s [ 1 : ] is a slice of the string s that starts at index 1 ( the second character of the string ) and goes to the end ; this excludes the unwanted blank at the beginning of s .
2.4 . Word Count
The word count program wc reads its standard input and counts the number of lines , words , and characters .
Declarations have again been omitted .
# declarations omitted ...
init ( nil : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys -> PATH ;
buf := array [ 1 ] of byte ;
stdin := sys -> fildes( 0 ) ;
OUT : con 0 ;
IN : con 1 ;
state := OUT ;
nl := 0 ; nw := 0 ; nc := 0 ;
for ( ; ; ) {
n := sys -> read ( stdin , buf , 1 ) ;
if ( n <= 0 )
break ;
c := int buf [ 0 ] ;
nc ++;
if ( c == ’
’)
nl ++;
if ( c == ’ ’ || c == ’ \t ’ || c == ’
’)
state = OUT ;
else if ( state == OUT ) {
state = IN ;
nw ++;
}
}
sys -> print ( " %d %d %d
" , nl , nw , nc ) ;
}
This program contains several instances of the := operator .
For example , the line
nl := 0 ; nw := 0 ; nc := 0 ;
declares three integer variables and assigns zero to each .
A Limbo program starts with three open files for standard input , standard output , and standard error , as in Unix .
The line
stdin := sys -> fildes( 0 ) ;
declares a variable stdin and assigns the corresponding file descriptor to it .
The type of stdin is whatever the type of sys -> fildes ( 0 ) is , and it ’s possible to get by without ever knowing the name of that type .
( We will return to this shortly . )
The lines
OUT : con 0 ;
IN : con 1 ;
declare two integer constants with values zero and one .
There is no enum type in Limbo ; the con declaration is the closest equivalent .
When the values are arbitrary , a different form is normally used :
OUT , IN : con iota ;
The operator iota , when used in con declarations will produce the sequence of values 0 , 1 , .... , one value in turn for each name declared in the same declaration .
It can appear in more complex expressions :
M1 , M2 , M4 , M8 : con 1 << iota ;
N1 , N3 , N5 , N7 : con ( 2*iota ) +1 ;
The first example generates a set of bitmask values ; the second generates a sequence of odd numbers .
Given the declarations of IN and OUT , the line
state := OUT ;
declares state to be an integer with initial value zero .
The line
buf := array [ 1 ] of byte ;
declares buf to be a one - element array of byte s. Arrays are indexed from zero , so buf [ 0 ] is the only element .
Arrays in Limbo are dynamic , so this array is created at the point of the declaration .
An alternative would be to declare the array and create it in separate statements :
buf : array of byte ; # no size at declaration
buf = array [ 1 ] of byte ; # size needed at creation
Limbo does no automatic coercions between types , so an explicit coercion is required to convert the single byte read from stdin into an int that can be used in subsequent comparisons with int ’s ; this is done by the line
c := int buf [ 0 ] ;
which declares c and assigns the integer value of the input byte to it .
2.5 . Word Count Version 2
The word count program above tacitly assumes that its input is in the ASCII subset of Unicode , since it reads input one byte at a time instead of one Unicode character at a time .
If the input contains any multi - byte Unicode characters , this code is plain wrong .
The assignment to c is a specific example : the integer value of the first byte of a multi- byte Unicode character is not the character .
There are several ways to address this shortcoming .
Among the possibilities are rewriting to use the Bufio module , which does string I/O , or checking each input byte sequence to see if it is a multi - byte character .
The second version of word counting uses Bufio .
This example will also illustrate rules for accessing objects within modules .
# declarations omitted ...
include " bufio.m " ;
bufio : Bufio ;
Iobuf : import bufio ;
init ( nil : ref Draw -> Context , nil : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys -> PATH ;
bufio = load Bufio Bufio-> PATH ;
if ( bufio == nil ) {
sys-> fprint(sys ->fildes ( 2 ) , " wc : ca n’t load %s : %r
" , Bufio -> PATH ) ;
raise " fail:load " ;
}
stdin := sys -> fildes( 0 ) ;
iob := bufio-> fopen ( stdin , bufio-> OREAD ) ;
if ( iob == nil ) {
sys -> fprint(sys ->fildes ( 2 ) , " wc : ca n’t open stdin : %r
" ) ;
raise " fail:open " ;
}
OUT , IN : con iota ;
state := OUT ;
nl := big 0 ; nw := big 0 ; nc := big 0 ;
for ( ; ; ) {
c := iob.getc ( ) ;
if ( c == Bufio -> EOF )
break ;
nc ++;
if ( c == ’
’)
nl ++;
if ( c == ’ ’ || c == ’ \t ’ || c == ’
’)
state = OUT ;
else if ( state == OUT ) {
state = IN ;
nw ++;
}
}
sys -> print ( " %bd %bd %bd
" , nl , nw , nc ) ;
}
The lines
include " bufio.m " ;
bufio : Bufio ;
include the declarations from bufio.m and declare a variable bufio that will serve as a handle when we load an implementation of the Bufio module .
( The use of a module ’s type in lower case as the name of a loaded instance is a common convention in Limbo programs . )
With this handle , we can refer to the functions and types the module defines , which are in the file / usr / inferno / module / bufio.m ( the full name might be different on your system ) .
Parts of this declaration are shown here :
Bufio : module # edited to fit your screen
{
PATH : con " /dis/bufio.dis " ;
EOF : con - 1 ;
Iobuf : adt {
fd : ref Sys -> FD ; # the file
buffer : array of byte ; # the buffer
# other variables omitted
getc : fn( b : self ref Iobuf ) : int ;
gets : fn( b : self ref Iobuf , sep : int ) : string ;
close : fn( b : self ref Iobuf ) ;
} ;
open : fn( name : string , mode : int ) : ref Iobuf ;
fopen : fn( fd : ref Sys-> FD , mode : int ) : ref Iobuf ;
} ;
The bufio module defines open and fopen functions that return references to an Iobuf ; this is much like a FILE * in the C standard I /O library .
A reference is necessary so that all uses refer to the same entity , the object maintained by the module .
Given the name of a module ( e.g. , Bufio ) , how do we refer to its contents ?
It is always possible to use fully - qualified names , and the import statement permits certain abbreviations .
We must also distinguish between the name of the module itself and a specific implementation returned by load , such as bufio .
The fully - qualified name of a type or constant from a module is
Modulename -> name
as in Bufio -> Iobuf or Bufio -> EOF .
To refer to members of an adt or functions or variables from a module , however , it is necessary to use a module value instead of a module name : although the interface is always the same , the implementations of different instances of a module will be different , and we must refer to a specific implementation .
A fully - qualified name is
moduleval -> functionname
moduleval -> variablename
moduleval -> adtname .
membername
where adt members can be variables or functions .
Thus :
iob : ref bufio-> Iobuf ;
bufio->open (... )
bufio->iob.getc ( )
bufio->iob.fd
It is also legal to refer to module types , constants , and variables with a module handle , as in bufio->EOF .
An import statement makes a specific list of names from a module accessible without need for a fully - qualified name .
Each name must be imported explicitly , and adt member names can not be imported .
Thus , the line
Iobuf : import bufio ;
imports the adt name Iobuf , which means that functions within that adt ( like getc ) can be used without module qualification , i.e. , without bufio -> .
( It is still necessary to say iob.getc ( ) for reasons given below . )
In all cases , imported names must be unique .
The second parameter of load is a string giving the location of the module implementation , typically a . dis file .
( The string need not be static . )
Some modules are part of the system ; these have location names that begin with $ but are otherwise the same for users .
By convention , modules include a constant called PATH that points to their default location .
The call to bufio -> fopen attaches the I/O buffer to the already open file stdin ; this is rather like freopen in stdio .
The function iob.getc returns the next Unicode character , or bufio->EOF if end of file was encountered .
A close look at the calls to sys -> print shows a new format conversion character , %r , for which there is no corresponding argument in the expression list .
The value of %r is the text of the most recent system error message .
Several other small changes were made as realistic examples : it keeps the counts as big to cope with larger files ( hence the use of % bd as the output format ) ; it prints diagnostics on the standard error stream , sys -> fildes ( 2 ) , using sys -> fprint , a variant of sys -> print that takes an explicit file descriptor ; and it returns an error status to its caller ( typically the shell ) by raising an exception .
2.6 . An Associative Array Module
This section describes a module that implements a conventional associative array ( a hash table pointing to chained lists of name - value strings ) .
This module is meant to be part of a larger program , not a standalone program like the previous examples .
The Hashtab module stores a name - value pair as a tuple of ( string , string ) .
A tuple is a type consisting of an ordered collection of objects , each with its own type .
The hash table implementation uses several different tuples .
The hash table module defines a type to hold the data , using an adt declaration .
An adt defines a type and optionally a set of functions that manipulate an object of that type .
Since it provides only the ability to group variables and functions , it is like a really slimmed - down version of a C++ class , or a slightly fancier C struct .
In particular , an adt does not provide information hiding ( all member names are visible if the adt itself is visible ) , does not support inheritance , and has no constructors , destructors or overloaded method names .
It is different from C or C++ , however : when an adt is declared by a module declaration , the adt ’s implementation ( the bodies of its functions ) will be defined by the module ’s implementation , and there can be more than one .
To create an instance of an adt ,
adtvar := adtname ( list of values for all members , in order ) ;
adtvar := ref adtname ( list of values for all members , in order ) ;
Technically these are casts , from tuple to adt ; that is , the adt is created from a tuple that specifies all of its members in order .
The Hashtab module contains an adt declaration for a type Table ; the operations are a function alloc for initial allocation ( in effect a constructor ) , a hash function , and methods to add and look up elements by name .
Here is the module declaration , which is contained in file hashtab .m :
Hashtab : module
{
PATH : con " /usr/bwk/hashtab.dis " ; # temporary name
Table : adt {
tab : array of list of ( string , string ) ;
alloc : fn( n : int ) : ref Table ;
hash : fn( ht : self ref Table , name : string ) : int ;
add : fn( ht : self ref Table , name : string , val : string ) ;
lookup : fn( ht : self ref Table , name : string ) : ( int , string ) ;
} ;
} ;
The implementation is in file hashtab.b :
implement Hashtab ;
include " hashtab.m " ;
Table.alloc(n : int ) : ref Table
{
return ref Table ( array [n ] of list of ( string , string ) ) ;
}
Table.hash ( ht : self ref Table , s : string ) : int
{
h := 0 ;
for ( i := 0 ; i < len s ; i++ )
h = ( h << 1 ) ^ int s[i ] ;
h %= len ht.tab ;
if ( h < 0 )
h += len ht.tab ;
return h ;
}
Table.add ( ht : self ref Table , name : string , val : string )
{
h := ht.hash ( name ) ;
for ( p := ht.tab[h ] ; p != nil ; p = tl p ) {
( tname , nil ) := hd p ;
if ( tname == name ) {
# illegal : hd p = ( tname , val ) ;
return ;
}
}
ht.tab[h ] = ( name , val ) :: ht.tab[ h ] ;
}
Table.lookup( ht : self ref Table , name : string ) : ( int , string )
{
h := ht.hash ( name ) ;
for ( p := ht.tab[h ] ; p != nil ; p = tl p ) {
( tname , tval ) := hd p ;
if ( tname == name )
return ( 1 , tval ) ;
}
return ( 0 , " " ) ;
}
This is intentionally simple - minded , to focus on the language rather than efficiency or flexibility .
The function Table.alloc creates and returns a Table with a specified size and an array of elements , each of which is a list of ( string , string ) .
The hash function is trivial ; the only interesting point is the len operator , which returns the number of items in a string , array or list .
For a string , len s is the number of Unicode characters .
The self declaration says that the first argument of every call of this function is implicit , and refers to the value itself ; this argument does not appear in the actual parameter list at any call site .
Self is similar to this in C ++.
The lookup function searches down the appropriate list for an instance of the name argument .
If a match is found , lookup returns a tuple consisting of 1 and the value field ; if no match is found , it returns a tuple of 0 and an empty string .
These return types match the function return type , ( int , string ) .
The line
( tname , tval ) := hd p ;
shows a tuple on the left side of a declaration - assignment .
This splits the pair of strings referred to by hd p into components and assigns them to the newly declared variables tname and tval .
The add function is similar ; it searches the right list for an instance of the name .
If none is found ,
ht.tab[h ] = ( name , val ) :: ht.tab[ h ] ;
combines the name and value into a tuple , then uses :: to stick it on the front of the proper list .
The line
( tname , nil ) := hd p ;
in the loop body is a less obvious use of a tuple .
In this case , only the first component , the name , is assigned , to a variable tname that is declared here .
The other component is ‘‘ assigned ’ ’ to nil , which causes it to be ignored .
The line
# illegal : hd p = ( tname , val ) ;
is commented out because it ’s illegal : Limbo does not permit the assignment of a new name - value to a list element ; list elements are immutable .
To create a new Table , add some values , then retrieve one , we can write :
nvtab = Table.alloc( 101 ) ; # make a Table
nvtab.add ( " Rob " , " Pike " ) ;
nvtab.add ( " Howard " , " Trickey " ) ;
( p , phil ) := nvtab.lookup ( " Phil " ) ;
( q , sean ) := nvtab.lookup ( " Sean " ) ;
Note that the ref Table argument does not appear in these calls ; the self mechanism renders it unnecessary .
Remember that a module using
Table must import it from some instance of Hashtab , or qualify all references to it by a module value .
2.7 . An AWK - like Input Module
This example presents a simple module based on Awk ’s input mechanism : it reads input a line at a time from a list of of files , splits each line into an array of NF+1 strings ( the original input line and the individual fields ) , and sets NF , NR , and FILENAME .
It comes in the usual two parts , a module :
Awk : module
{
PATH : con " /usr/bwk/awk.dis " ;
init : fn( args : list of string ) ;
getline : fn( ) : array of string ;
NR : fn ( ) : int ;
NF : fn( ) : int ;
FILENAME : fn( ) : string ;
} ;
and an implementation :
implement
Awk ;
include " sys.m " ;
sys : Sys ;
include " bufio.m " ;
bufio : Bufio ;
Iobuf : import bufio ;
iobuf : ref Iobuf ;
include " awk.m " ;
_NR : int ;
_NF : int ;
_FILENAME : string ;
args : list of string ;
init ( av : list of string )
{
args = tl av ;
if ( len args == 0 ) # no args => stdin
args = " - " :: nil ;
sys = load Sys Sys-> PATH ;
bufio = load Bufio Bufio-> PATH ;
}
getline ( ) : array of string
{
t := array [ 100 ] of string ;
fl : list of string ;
top :
while ( args != nil ) {
if ( _FILENAME == nil ) { # advance to next file
_FILENAME = hd args ;
if ( _FILENAME == " - " )
iobuf = bufio-> fopen ( sys -> fildes (0 ) , bufio-> OREAD ) ;
else
iobuf = bufio->open( _FILENAME , bufio->OREAD ) ;
if ( iobuf == nil ) {
sys->fprint(sys ->fildes ( 2 ) , " ca n’t open %s : %r
" , _FILENAME ) ;
args = nil ;
return nil ;
}
}
s := iobuf.gets ( ’
’) ;
if ( s == nil ) {
iobuf.close ( ) ;
_FILENAME = nil ;
args = tl args ;
continue top ;
}
t [ 0 ] = s[ 0:len s - 1 ] ;
_NR ++;
( _NF , fl ) = sys -> tokenize ( t [ 0 ] , " \t
\r " ) ;
for ( i := 1 ; fl != nil ; fl = tl fl )
t [ i++] = hd fl ;
return t[ 0 :i ] ;
}
return nil ;
}
NR ( ) : int { return _NR ; }
NF ( ) : int { return _NF ; }
FILENAME ( ) : string { return _FILENAME ; }
Since NR , NF and FILENAME should not be modified by users , they are accessed as functions ; the actual variables have related names like _NF .
It would also be possible to make them ordinary variables in the Awk module , and refer to them via a module value ( i.e. , awk - > NR ) .
The tokenize function in the line
( _NF , fl ) = sys -> tokenize ( t [ 0 ] , " \t
\r " ) ;
breaks the argument string t[ 0 ] into tokens , as separated by the characters of the second argument .
It returns a tuple consisting of a length and a list of tokens .
Note that this module has an init function that must be called explicitly before any of its other functions are called .
2.8 . A Simple Formatter
This program is a simple - minded text formatter , modeled after fmt , that tests the Awk module :
implement Fmt ;
include " sys.m " ;
sys : Sys ;
include " draw.m " ;
Fmt : module
{
init : fn( nil : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string ) ;
} ;
include " awk.m " ;
awk : Awk ;
getline , NF : import awk ;
out : array of string ;
nout : int ;
length : int ;
linelen := 65 ;
init ( nil : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string )
{
t : array of string ;
out = array [ 100 ] of string ;
sys = load Sys Sys-> PATH ;
awk = load Awk Awk -> PATH ;
if ( awk == nil ) {
sys-> fprint(sys ->fildes ( 2 ) , " fmt : ca n’t load %s : %r
" ,
Awk -> PATH ) ;
raise " fail:load " ;
}
awk - > init ( args ) ;
nout = 0 ;
length = 0 ;
while ( ( t = getline ( ) ) != nil ) {
nf := NF ( ) ;
if ( nf == 0 ) {
printline ( ) ;
sys -> print ( "
" ) ;
} else for ( i := 1 ; i <= nf ; i++ ) {
if ( length + len t[ i ] > linelen )
printline ( ) ;
out [ nout ++] = t[i ] ;
length += len t[i ] + 1 ;
}
}
printline ( ) ;
}
printline ( )
{
if ( nout == 0 )
return ;
for ( i := 0 ; i < nout - 1 ; i++)
sys -> print ( " %s " , out [ i ] ) ;
sys -> print ( " %s
" , out [ i ] ) ;
nout = 0 ;
length = 0 ;
}
The functions getline and NF have been imported so their names need no qualification .
It is more usual Limbo style to use explicit references such as sys -> read or Bufio ->EOF for clarity , and import only adts ( and perhaps commonly used constants ) .
2.9 . Channels and Communications
Another approach to a formatter is to use one process to fetch words and pass them to another process that formats and prints them .
This is easily done with a channel , as in this alternative version :
# declarations omitted ...
WORD , BREAK , EOF : con iota ;
wds : chan of ( int , string ) ;
init ( nil : ref Draw -> Context , nil : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys-> PATH ;
bufio = load Bufio Bufio-> PATH ;
stdin := sys -> fildes( 0 ) ;
iob = bufio-> fopen ( stdin , bufio-> OREAD ) ;
wds = chan of ( int , string ) ;
spawn getword ( wds ) ;
putword ( wds ) ;
}
getword ( wds : chan of ( int , string ) )
{
while ( ( s := iob.gets ( ’
’ ) ) != nil ) {
( n , fl ) := sys -> tokenize(s , " \t
" ) ;
if ( n == 0 )
wds <-= ( BREAK , " " ) ;
else for ( ; fl != nil ; fl = tl fl )
wds <-= ( WORD , hd fl ) ;
}
wds <-= ( EOF , " " ) ;
}
putword ( wds : chan of ( int , string ) )
{
for ( length := 0 ; ; ) {
( wd , s ) := <- wds ;
case wd {
BREAK =>
sys -> print ( "
" ) ;
length = 0 ;
WORD =>
if ( length + len s > 65 ) {
sys -> print ( "
" ) ;
length = 0 ;
}
sys -> print ( " %s " , s ) ;
length += len s + 1 ;
EOF =>
sys -> print ( "
" ) ;
exit ;
}
}
}
This omits declarations and error checking in the interest of brevity .
The channel passes a tuple of ( int , string ) ; the int indicates what kind of string is present - a real word , a break caused by an empty input line , or EOF .
The spawn statement creates a separate process by calling the specified function ; except for its own stack , this process shares memory with the process that spawned it .
Any synchronization between processes is handled by channels .
The operator <-= sends an expression to a channel ; the operator <- receives from a channel .
( Receive is combined here with := to receive a tuple , and assign its elements to newly - declared variables . )
In this example , getword and putword alternate , because each input word is sent immediately on the shared channel , and no subsequent word is processed until the previous one has been received and printed .
The case statement consists of a list of case values , which must be string or numeric constants , followed by => and associated code .
The value * ( not used here ) labels the default .
Multiple labels can be used , separated by the or operator , and ranges of values can appear delimited by to , as in
’a ’ to ’z ’ or ’ A ’ to ’ Z ’ =>
Remember that control does not flow from one case arm to the next , unlike C , thus no break statements appear .
2.10 . Tk and Interface Construction
Inferno supports a rather complete implementation of the Tk interface toolkit developed by John Ousterhout .
In other environments , Tk is normally accessed from Tcl programs , although there are also versions for Perl , Scheme and other languages that call Ousterhout ’s C code .
The Inferno Tk was implemented from scratch , and is meant to be called from Limbo programs .
As we saw earlier , there is a module declaration tk.m and a kernel module Tk .
The Tk module provides all the widgets of the original Tk with almost all their options , the pack command for geometry management , and the bind command for attaching code to user actions .
It also provides a grid command to simplify the common case of objects arranged in a matrix or grid .
In this implementation Tk commands are written as strings and presented to one function , tk -> cmd ; Limbo calls this function and captures its return value , which is the string that the Tk command produces .
For example , widget creation commands like button return the widget name , so this will be the string returned by tk -> cmd .
There is one unconventional aspect : the use of channels to send data and events from the interface into the Limbo program .
To create a widget , as we saw earlier , one writes
tk -> cmd ( " button .b - text { Push me} - command { send cmd .bpush} " ) ;
to create a button .b and attach a command to be executed when the button is pushed .
That command sends the ( arbitrary ) string . bpush on the channel named cmd .
The Limbo code that reads from this channel will look for the string . bpush and act accordingly .
The function tk -> namechan establishes a correspondence between a Limbo channel value and a channel named as a string in the Tk module .
When an event occurs in a Tk widget with a - command option , send causes the string to be sent on the channel and the Limbo code can act on it .
The program will often use a case to process the strings that might appear on the channel , particularly when the same channel is used for several widgets .
We observed earlier that Tk provides a user interface for an application ’s window , but there might be many windows on the screen .
Normally , a graphical application is meant to run under the window manager wm as a window that can be managed , reshaped , etc .
This is done by calling functions in the module Tkclient , which provides the interface between Tk and wm .
Several functions must be called to create a window , put it on the screen , and start giving it input .
We have already seen Tkclient ’s toplevel for window creation and onscreen to give a window space on the screen .
Input arrives from several sources : from the mouse and keyboard , from the higher - level Tk widgets such as buttons , and from the window manager itself .
In Limbo , each input source is represented by a channel , either given to the program by the window manager , or associated with one by namechan , as above .
This is all illustrated in the complete program below , which implements a trivial version of Etch - a - Sketch , shown in action in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . Etch -a - Sketch display .
implement Etch ;
include " sys.m " ;
sys : Sys ;

include " tkclient.m " ;

Etch : module
{
init : fn( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string ) ;
} ;
init ( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , nil : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys-> PATH ;
tk = load Tk Tk -> PATH ;
tkclient = load Tkclient Tkclient->PATH ;
tkclient -> init( ) ;
( t , winctl ) := tkclient -> toplevel ( ctxt , nil , " Etch " , Tkclient -> Appl ) ;
cmd := chan of string ;
tk ->namechan(t , cmd , " cmd " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " canvas .c - height 400 - width 600 - background white " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " frame .f " ) ;

tk -> cmd(t , " update " ) ;
tkclient -> startinput(t , " ptr " :: " kbd " :: nil ) ;
tkclient -> onscreen(t , nil ) ;
lastx , lasty : int ;
for ( ; ; ) {
alt {
s := <- cmd =>
( nil , cmdstr ) := sys-> tokenize(s , " \t
" ) ;
case hd cmdstr {
" quit " =>
exit ;
" clear " =>
tk -> cmd(t , " .c delete all ; update " ) ;
" b1down " =>
lastx = int hd tl cmdstr ;
lasty = int hd tl tl cmdstr ;
cstr := sys -> sprint ( " .c create line %d %d %d %d - width 2 " ,
lastx , lasty , lastx , lasty ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , cstr ) ;
" b1 motion " =>
x := int hd tl cmdstr ;
y := int hd tl tl cmdstr ;
cstr := sys -> sprint ( " .c create line %d %d %d %d - width 2 " ,
lastx , lasty , x , y ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , cstr ) ;
lastx = x ; lasty = y ;
}
p := <- t.ctxt.ptr =>
tk ->pointer(t , * p ) ;
c := <- t.ctxt.kbd =>
tk ->keyboard(t , c ) ;
ctl := <- winctl or
ctl = <- t.ctxt.ctl or
ctl = <- t.wreq =>
tkclient -> wmctl(t , ctl ) ;
}
tk -> cmd(t , " update " ) ;
}
}
The function toplevel returns a tuple containing the Tk -> Toplevel for the new window and a channel upon which the window manager will send messages for events such as hitting the exit button .
An earlier example assigned the channel value to nil , discarding it ; here it is assigned the name winctl .
The parameters to toplevel includes a graphics context ctxt where the window will be created , a configuration string ( simply nil here ) , the program name ( which appears in the window ’s ‘ ‘ title bar ’’ if it has one ) , and a value Tkclient -> Appl that denotes a style of window suitable for most applications .
Note that ctxt was one of the arguments to init .
( We do not use the argument list for init , and so declare it as nil ) .
The program creates a canvas for drawing , a button to clear the canvas , and a button to quit .
The sequence of calls to tk -> cmd creates the picture and sets up the bindings .
The buttons are created with a - command to send a suitable string on channel cmd , and two bind commands make the same channel the target for messages about mouse button presses and movement in the canvas .
Note the %x and %y parameters in the latter case to include the mouse ’s coordinates in the string .
The window manager sends keyboard and mouse input to the currently selected window using two more channels t.ctxt.kbd and t.ctxt.ptr .
A further channel t.wreq is used by the Tk module itself to request changes to the window displaying Toplevel t .
Now there are many channels watching events : one for the buttons and canvas created by the drawing program itself , one for the mouse , and three for window management .
We use an alt statement to select from events on any of those channels .
The expression
s := <- cmd
declares a variable s of the type carried by the channel cmd , i.e. , a string ; when a string is received on the channel , the assignment is executed , and the subsequent case decodes the message .
The channel t.ctxt.ptr carries references to Draw -> Pointer values , which give the state and position of the pointing device ( mouse or stylus ) .
They are handed as received to tk -> pointer for processing by Tk. Similarly , Unicode characters from the keyboard are given to Tk using tk -> keyboard .
Internally ,
Tk hands those values on to the various widgets for processing , possibly resulting in messages being sent on one of the other channels .
Finally , a value received from any of the winctl , t.ctxt.ctl or t.wreq channels is passed back to Tkclient ’s wmctl function to be handled there .
As another example , here is the startup code for an implementation of Othello , adapted from a Java version by Muffy Barkocy , Arthur van Hoff , and Ben Fry .
init ( ctxt : ref Draw -> Context , args : list of string )
{
sys = load Sys Sys-> PATH ;
tk = load Tk Tk -> PATH ;
tkclient = load Tkclient Tkclient->PATH ;
sys->pctl( Sys->NEWPGRP , nil ) ;
tkclient -> init( ) ;
( t , winctl ) := tkclient -> toplevel ( ctxt , nil , " Othello " , Tkclient -> Appl ) ;
cmd := chan of string ;
tk ->namechan(t , cmd , " cmd " ) ;

tk -> cmd(t , " frame .f " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " label .f.l - text { Othello?} - background white " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " button .f.c - text { Reset} - command { send cmd Reset} " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " button .f.d - text { Quit} - command { send cmd Quit} " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " pack .f.l .f.c . f.d - side left - fill x - expand 1 " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " pack .c .f - side top - fill x " ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " bind .c < ButtonRelease - 1> { send cmd B1 up %x %y} " ) ;
for ( i := 1 ; i < 9 ; i++)
for ( j := 1 ; j < 9 ; j++ ) {
coord := sys -> sprint ( " %d %d %d %d " ,
SQ*i , SQ*j , SQ *( i+1 ) , SQ * ( j+1 ) ) ;
tk -> cmd(t , " .c create rectangle " + coord +
" - outline black - width 2 " ) ;
}
tk -> cmd(t , " update " ) ;
lasterror (t , " init " ) ;
tkclient -> startinput(t , " ptr " :: " kbd " :: nil ) ;
tkclient -> onscreen(t , nil ) ;
board = array [ 10 ] of {* => array [ 10 ] of int} ;
score = array [ 10 ] of {* => array [ 10 ] of int} ;
reinit ( ) ;
for ( ; ; ) {
alt {
s := <- cmd =>
( n , l ) := sys -> tokenize (s , " \t " ) ;
case hd l {
" Quit " =>
exit ;
" Reset " =>
reinit ( ) ;
" B1 up " =>
x := int hd tl l ;
y := int hd tl tl l ;
mouseUp ( int x , int y ) ;
}
p := <- t.ctxt.ptr =>
tk ->pointer(t , * p ) ;
c := <- t.ctxt.kbd =>
tk ->keyboard(t , c ) ;
ctl := <- winctl or
ctl = <- t.ctxt.ctl or
ctl = <- t.wreq =>
tkclient -> wmctl(t , ctl ) ;
}
}
}
Figure 3 . Screen shot of Inferno display showing Othello window .
If some call to the Tk module results in an error , an error string is made available in a pseudo - variable lasterror maintained by Tk .
When this variable is read , it is reset .
The function lasterror shows how to test and print this variable :
lasterror (t : ref Tk -> Toplevel , where : string )
{
s := tk -> cmd(t , " variable lasterror " ) ;
if ( s != nil )
sys -> print ( " %s : tk error %s
" , where , s ) ;
}
In general , the Inferno implementation of Tk does not provide variables except for a few special ones like this .
The most common instance is a variable that links a set of radiobuttons .

What do you see in this image ?
You saw a couple in an intimate pose , right ?
Interestingly , research has shown that young children cannot identify the intimate couple because they do not have prior memory associated with such a scenario .
What they WILL see , however , is the nine dolphins in the picture !
So , I guess we 've already proven you 're not a young innocent child ... now ...
If it 's hard for you to find the dolphins within 6 seconds , your mind is indeed corrupted and you may
need help
