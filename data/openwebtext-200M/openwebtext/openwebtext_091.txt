The National Association of Evangelicals ( NAE ) , which represents about 45,000 churches across America , endorsed a declaration against torture drafted by 17 evangelical scholars .
The authors , who call themselves Evangelicals for Human Rights and campaign for " zero tolerance " on torture , say that the US administration has crossed " boundaries of what is legally and morally permissible " in the treatment of detainees .
" Tragically , documented cases of torture and inhumane and cruel behaviour have occurred at various sites in the war on terror , and current law opens procedural loopholes for more to continue , " the NAE said last night .
The strong alliance between Christian evangelicals and Mr Bush , an important key to his electoral successes , has been tested in recent months with the Mark Foley scandal over his attraction towards male teenage pages in Congress , and perceived corruption in parts of the Republican party .
One in three white evangelicals voted for Democratic candidates in last November 's mid-term elections , a rise on the 2004 presidential elections .
But Christian criticism has tended to come from the right of the Bush administration .
Yesterday 's statement on torture suggested a new determination on the part of the evangelical churches to detach themselves from the Republican party and stake their independence - even if it is from a position more traditionally associated with the left .
A leading figure within the NAE , Rev Richard Cizik , told the Associated Press that the statement condemning torture was not intended as a criticism of the Bush administration .
But he added : " There is a perception out there in the Middle East that we 're willing to accept any action in order to fight this war against terrorism .
We are the conservatives — let there be no mistake on that — who wholeheartedly support the war against terror , but that does not mean by any means necessary . "
The document on human rights quotes the Bible , Pope John Paul II and Elie Wiesel among other authorities .
It particularly condemns the indefinite detention of suspects without trial .
" As American Christians , we are above all motivated by a desire that our nation 's actions would be consistent with foundational Christian moral norms , " the document says .
" We believe that a scrupulous commitment to human rights , among which is the right not to be tortured , is one of these Christian moral convictions . "
The normal activity on our Sun is puny in comparison
Our Sun also flares when twisted magnetic field lines in the solar atmosphere suddenly snap - but this was on a far bigger scale , scientists say .
The energy released by the II Pegasi star was equivalent to about 50 million trillion atomic bombs , they calculate .
If the Sun was ever to produce such an outburst , it would blast the Earth with radiation and almost certainly cause a mass extinction .
Fortunately , there is no trace in the geologic record that our Sun has ever let go in this fashion , and Earth 's magnetic field does a robust job of deflecting most of the high - energy particles and radiation our star will hurl at the planet in a normal flare .
Nonetheless , researchers are keen to learn more about the type of " super flares " seen by Swift , and the orbiting observatory 's ability to turn its instruments rapidly on interesting cosmic events has revealed new data about the emission of X - rays in the earliest stages of this colossal phenomenon .
Rachel Osten of University of Maryland and the US space agency 's Goddard Space Flight Center has been presenting details of her team 's Swift study to the Cool Stars 14 meeting in Pasadena , California .
" The flare was so powerful that , at first , we thought it was a star explosion , " she said .
" We know much about solar flares on the Sun , but these are samples from just one star .
This II Pegasi event was our first opportunity to study details of another star 's flaring as if it were as close as our Sun . "
Lobster survey
Scientists in Europe are hopeful of launching an X - ray telescope early in the next decade that will survey the sky for super flares as part of its mission .
" We simply do n't have good statistical data on these flares ; so one of the things Lobster is designed to do is survey the whole sky for these big flashes of light , " said Dr Paul O'Brien , a scientist working on both the Lobster and Swift projects at the UK's University of Leicester .
" It has been suggested that such events would sterilise planets and so knowing how often they occur would put limits on how many civilisations might be out there .
Presumably , our own Sun does n't do it , otherwise we would n't be here . "
Dr O'Brien said the latest study underlined again Swift 's remarkable versatility .
The observatory was launched to hunt down gamma-ray bursts , the extremely intense but fleeting flashes of even higher energy light thought to signal the cataclysmic collapse or giant stars .
" Swift has the ability to turn around very quickly and look at something else on the way to studying another gamma - ray burst , and it's not a waste of observing time because it only took a minute to get there , " the Leicester scientist said .
Swift was launched to observe gamma-ray bursts
II Pegasi is a two - star , or binary , system that is 135 light - years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus .
The star that produced the giant flare is 0.8 times the mass of the Sun ; its companion is 0.4 solar masses .
The stars are close , only a few stellar radii apart .
As a result , tidal forces cause both stars to spin quickly , rotating in step once in seven days compared to the Sun 's 28 - day rotation period .
Fast rotation is thought to be conducive to strong stellar flares .
The woman cannot speak any intelligible language , police say
The girl is believed to be Rochom P'ngieng , who disappeared while tending buffalo on the edge of the jungle in remote northern Rattanakiri province .
Her father says he has identified her through scars and will have DNA tests taken to prove she is his daughter .
But the BBC's Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh says there are other possibilities to her identity .
Members of Vietnamese hill tribes often cross into Cambodia through the jungles , he says .
Many are seeking asylum from religious persecution and are keen to avoid contact with the authorities , he adds .
' Bare bones '
Local police said the woman was " half - human and half - animal " and could not speak any intelligible language .
Her plight came to light when a villager noticed some of his food had been taken and staked out the area , which is 350 km ( 220 miles ) north - east of Phnom Penh .
She was shaking and picking up grains of rice from the ground to eat
Sal Lou , father
Deputy provincial police chief Chea Bunthoeun told Associated Press news agency : " He spotted a naked human being , who looked like a jungle person , sneaking in to steal his rice . "
The villager and some friends then caught the woman .
Sal Lou , a village policeman , said he recognised the woman as his daughter from a scar on her right arm .
He said : " When I saw her , she was naked and walking in a bending - forward position like a monkey ...
She was bare bones .
" She was shaking and picking up grains of rice from the ground to eat . "
Mr Sal Lou said the family was now watching her closely after she took her clothes off and suggested she would return to the jungle .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers who wanted to find out why it is not only taboo to kiss your sister , but also disgusting , said on Wednesday they have discovered why in a discovery that challenges some basic tenets of Freudian theory .

The instinct evolved naturally and cannot be taught , John Tooby and Leda Cosmides of the University of California Santa Barbara wrote in their report in the journal Nature .
Spending time in the same household and watching your mother care for your brother or sister is all it takes .
This is all subconscious , of course , reported the researchers , who worked with Debra Lieberman of the University of Hawaii .
“ We went in search of a kin detection system because some of the most important theories in evolutionary biology said such a thing should exist , ” Cosmides said in a telephone interview .
“ It should regulate both altruism and incest disgust . ”
Humans have an inbuilt system that does both , they found .
“ This data shows that the degree to which we feel those things is governed by these cues that , for hunter - gatherers , predict whether somebody is a sibling .
And it works regardless of your beliefs -- who you are told who your siblings are , ” she said .
Cosmides and her colleagues tested 600 volunteers , asking them all sorts of questions jumbled together so they would not know what was being studied .
“ We asked them how many favors did you do for this particular sibling in a month .
We asked if this sibling needed a kidney , how likely would you be to donate this sibling a kidney . ”
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
And they asked about all sorts of ethical dilemmas , including questions about sexual relationships with siblings .
Among the volunteers were people who had never shared a home with their siblings -- for instance , full - or half - siblings born 10 or even 20 years apart .
What determined incest disgust and altruism was the same -- how much time an older sibling spent watching his or her mother care for a younger one , or how much time the two spent together in the same household .
“ If you co-resided with them for a long time as a child , you ’d treat them as you ’d treat any full sibling .
This seems to operate non-consciously , ” Cosmides said .
Especially strong was the effect of watching one ’s mother care for a younger child .
“ They would be very altruistic toward that baby and they ’d be grossed out at the idea of sex with that baby as an adult , ” Cosmides said .
Women are especially sensitive to this , added Cosmides , a cognitive psychologist .
“ One whiff of possible siblinghood and that ’s it for you if you are a woman , ” she said .
The study contradicts the teachings of Sigmund Freud , who described Oedipal urges and conflicts , Cosmides said .
“ He thought you are attracted to your relatives and your siblings and parents and it takes the force of culture and society to keep you from committing the incest that is in your heart , ” she said .
Cosmides said Freud had a possible reason for his own feelings -- he had a wet nurse who cuddled and breastfed him :
“ Who their brain thinks is mom is different from who they consciously believe is mom .
For them it is quite reasonable that they have an attraction to their mothers . ”
This article , while brilliant for its time , is now outdated .
( Use CSS3 gradients instead . )
Recently , while trying to implement a few different navigation ideas that a designer had thrown my way , I became frustrated with my weak image editing skills .
The design was gradient - heavy , so a traditional approach to navigation markup and styling would require a dozen or so background - image slices to meet the varying colors and height requirements .
Article Continues Below
After spending a mortifying amount of time creating the images — I ’m a programmer by trade , so anything more complicated than MS Paint gives me the willies — I had to take a step back and figure out a better way .
What if , after finishing , I needed to tweak the height ?
Or , God forbid , the color palette ?
My head was going to explode if I had to open an image editor again , so the Super Easy Blendy Backgrounds technique was born .
The blendy way #section2
Almost all the gradients in the design given to me were blended to white , so I figured that if I created a PNG that was blended from transparent to white , I could use the PNG as a background image and rely on the background - color style to provide the other half of the blend .
I fired up my trusty image editor and fumbled around until I had created two PNG images : a 100×100 px white - to - transparent blend , and a 100 ×100 px black - to - transparent blend .
( I did n’t need the black for this application , but I wanted to see what it would look like . )
My two transparent - blend images , built in The Gimp
Using those images , I quickly threw together the CSS , and voila !
Beautiful blendy backgrounds .
( IE 6 users , hang on ; we ’ll get it working for you , we promise . )
Here ’s the CSS :
. blue { background - color : # 2382a1 ; } .green { background - color : # 4be22d ; } .pink { background - color : # ff009d ; } .gradwhite { background - image : url( grad_white.png ) ; } .gradblack { background - image : url( grad_black.png ) ; } .box { border : solid orange 2 px ; float : left ; height : 100 px ; margin : 1 px ; width : 175 px ; }
Here ’s the markup :
< div class= " box gradwhite blue " ></div > < div class= " box gradwhite green " ></div > < div class= " box gradwhite pink " ></div > < div class= " box gradblack blue " ></div > < div class= " box gradblack green " ></div > < div class= " box gradblack pink " ></div >
In this example and those that follow , we ’re using color - based style definitions to make the example easier to understand — but we all know not to use presentation - specific words in our actual class names , right ?
Right .
Here ’s example one , which produces this result :
A PNG gradient used as a background
After giving myself a congratulatory pat on the back , I tried to scale that div to the size that I wanted .
And , as you ’ve probably already figured out , the background gradient did n’t scale .
Argh !
I could force the background image to repeat horizontally or vertically ( using repeat - x or repeat -y ) , but there was no way to scale the background .
( See example two if you want to feel the pain . )
CSS3 is going to implement a background - size attribute , but since CSS3 has an ETA of never , that ’s no help now .
So what do we do ?
Well , we use something that will scale , like the img element .
Instead of using a background to display the PNG blend , we can use an img element , and set the width and the height to 100 % .
You can check it out in example three , which produces this result :
Successful scaling — woohoo !
Here ’s the new CSS ( overwriting what we had before ) :
. blue { background - color : # 2382a1 ; } .green { background - color : # 4be22d ; } . pink { background - color : # ff009d ; } .gradwhite img , .gradblack img { background - color : transparent ; height : 100 % ; left : 0 px ; position : absolute ; top : 0 px ; width : 100 % ; } .box2 { border : solid orange 2 px ; float : left ; height : 150 px ; margin : 1 px ; position : relative ; width : 84 px ; }
Here ’s the markup :
< div class = " box2 gradwhite blue " > < img src= " /grad_white.png " /> </div > < div class = " box2 gradwhite green " > < img src= " /grad_white.png " /> </div > < div class = " box2 gradwhite pink " > < img src= " /grad_white.png " /> </div > < div class = " box2 gradblack blue " > < img src= " /grad_black.png "/></div> < div class = " box2 gradblack green " > < img src= " /grad_black.png " /> </div > < div class = " box2 gradblack pink " > < img src= " /grad_black.png " /> </div>
The image is showing up on top of my text !
What gives ?
#section4
Now that we have these sweet blendy backgrounds , let ’s try to put some text in them .
The first thing we need to do is make the boxes scale when the user resizes the text .
We ’ll do that by dropping the height declaration and then adding a conditional comment as a favor to IE 7 , which apparently looks to the parent element for a height if none is specified .
You can read more about conditional comments at Quirksmode .
Note :
In real life , you ’d probably want to simply include a CSS file that targets a compliant browser like Firefox and then include two more ( using conditional comments that target IE 6 and IE 7 ) .
But for now , here ’s that comment :
<!--[ if IE 7 ] > < style type =" text /css " >.box { border : solid red 2 px ; height : 2.5em ; } </style > <![ endif ] -->
Text showing up behind the PNG gradient
You can follow the attempt in progress in example four .
The absolutely positioned image is showing up in front of the text .
To correct that , we use the universal selector to select any descendents of . gradwhite , position them relatively ( greater specificity could , of course , override this as necessary ) , and give them a z - index of 1 .
Giving the img a z - index of 0 then keeps it from popping to the surface .
While we ’re at it , we ’ll add a little style to the paragraphs to set them off .
Text correctly appearing in front of the PNG gradient
Example five does the trick .
Here ’re the new and updated rules :
. gradwhite img , .gradblack img { height : 100 % ; left : 0 px ; position : absolute ; top : 0 px ; width : 100 % ; z - index : 0 ; } .gradwhite * { position : relative ; z- index : 1 ; } .gradwhite p { margin : 0 px ; padding : 3 px ; } .box3 { border : solid orange 2 px ; float : left ; margin : 1 px ; padding : 5 px ; position : relative ; width : 256 px ; }
And here ’s the markup :
< div class = " box3 gradwhite pink " > < img src= " /grad_white.png " /> < p
> This text is in front of the image .
</ p> </div>
Do you realize none of this works in IE 6?#section5
We all know that IE 6 and prior versions do n’t support PNG transparencies .
And since IE 7 wo n’t have the majority market share for awhile , you ’re probably thinking that this is a great exercise in something your boss will never let you use , right ?
Well , IE has this great little thing called the AlphaImageLoader filter , which is explained in ALA ’s “ Cross - Browser Variable Opacity with PNG : A Real Solution . ”
The pertinent part is that you can load a PNG image and set the filter to “ scale , ” thus eliminating ( for IE ) the need for the workarounds we used for Firefox .
So how do we make this work in both IE and Firefox at the same time ?
Well , we can target our styles for Firefox , and then use the star - HTML hack to override them for IE 6 .
I ’m using the star - CSS hack here more in the interest of clarity than anything else ; I think it helps to see everything together , plus it ’s easier to cut and paste .
When I use this technique in a production environment , I prefer to use conditional comments to target browsers .
After all , hacks are hacks , and they are n’t guaranteed to work in perpetuity .
Technique working in IE6
Example six puts it all together .
Here ’s the CSS to add .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
. gradwhite { filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft . » AlphaImageLoader(src='grad_white.png ' , » sizing Method= ' scale ' ) ; } * html . gradwhite img { display : none ; }
And here ’s the markup .
( Do n’t stare too long at the ugly inline styles — they ’ll be gone in just a second . )
< div class= " box gradwhite pink " >
< p
> Wow , maybe this will actually work !
</ p> </div>
Wrapping everything up#section6
Finally , we ’ll add one more star- HTML rule ( position : static applied to the box class ) to deal with a nasty IE6 bug that keeps links from working with AlphaImageLoader in certain circumstances .
Example seven shows our final cross - browser Super - Easy Blendy backgrounds , which look like this :
Super - easy blendys in all their glory
Here ’s the final CSS in its entirety .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< style type =" text /css " >. grad img { height : 100 % ; left : 0 px ; position : absolute ; top : 0 px ; width : 100 % ; z - index : 0 ; } .box { border : solid orange 2 px ; float : left ; margin : 1 px ; position : relative ; width : 165 px ; padding : 5 px ; } .box * { margin : 0 px ; position : relative ; z- index : 1 ; } * html .grad { filter : progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImage » Loader ( src='grad_white.png ' , sizing Method= ' scale ' ) ; } * html . grad img { display : none ; } * html .box { position : static ; } .blue { background - color : # 2382a1 ; } .green { background - color : # 4be22d ; } . pink { background - color : # ff009d ; } </style ><!--[ if IE 7 ] > < style type =" text /css " > .box { border : solid red 2 px ; height : 2.5em ; } </style > <![ endif ] -->
The final markup :
< div class= " box grad blue " > < img src=" grad_white.png " alt =" blur gradient box " /> < p >< a href= " # " > Ooo , linked text </a>!</p></div> < div class= " box grad pink " > < img src=" grad_white.png " alt = " pink gradient box " /> < p >< a href= " # " > Ooo , linked text ! </div > < div class= " box grad green " > < img src=" grad_white.png " alt =" green gradient box " /> < p >< a href= " # " > Ooo , linked text </a>!</p> </div>
That ’s it !
In Part Two of this two - part series , I ’ll explain how to work this technique into visually sophisticated layouts .

Vietnam 's communist authorities have banned two newspapers from publishing for a month because of their reporting about the country 's new bank notes .
The ministry of culture said the two papers published inaccurate information about alleged mistakes in the notes .
It says the papers ignored government instructions to stop making the claims .
Vietnam is rapidly replacing its paper money with notes made from plastic polymers because it claims the move will save the country money .
The Vietnamese press has run a series of stories about mistakes made in the printing of the notes and about some notes being the wrong size .
Others focus on so - far unproven allegations that the son of the central bank governor made money from the printing contract .
The ministry of culture has decided that it has all gone too far and ordered two papers to stop printing for a month from next Wednesday .
It is also considering further measures against the two newspapers , Thanh Nien and Tuoi Tre , which have become most vocal in criticising corruption and government failures .
Every publication in Vietnam has to be registered with an organisation controlled by the Communist Party - but journalists working on them are increasingly pushing at the boundaries of what is allowed to be printed .
State control
Earlier this year , in the run-up to the Communist Party Congress , the papers were given the green light to print stories about corruption and they have exposed a series of scandals at local and national levels .
However , some journalists fear that the party may now try to rein in the media to prevent the criticism getting out of hand .
One of the newspapers which is being suspended was registered with the Supreme Court ( Cong Ly or Justice ) and the other with the body which manages relations with foreign organisations ( Thoi Dai or Times ) .
They are not particularly high profile publications but their suspension will be taken as a warning by many other newspapers and magazines .

Covering Studio 54 was like covering the big bang .
On April 26 , 1977 — a long time before superstar D.J. ’s , before velvet ropes , before anyone had ever heard of “ club drugs ” like XTC , 2CB , and special K— Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager let there be light and speed and spectacle so preternaturally pleasurable that it had to fall apart .
But while the ball lasted , there was no more thrilling nightlife than the dance on West 54th Street .
I know , because I was there .
Studio 54 was my beat as the “ Intelligencer ” columnist .
Go forth and party with Halston , Bianca , Andy , and Liza , said my editor , and bring back the buzz .
Temperamentally unfit to record the glow of celebrity , I marveled more at the sexual politics .
While homosexuality was outlawed at Plato ’s Retreat , where the dancing was seriously dirty , Rubell invited the Friends of Frederick the Great to the party .
“ It ’s bisexual , ” Rubell told Interview .
“ Very bisexual .
And that ’s how we choose the crowd , too .
In other words , we want everybody to be fun and good - looking . ”
And have sex and do drugs in the balcony .
How long did the gods allow such défi ?
About three years .
Rubell and Schrager pleaded guilty in November 1979 for skimming a million dollars , and both were eventually imprisoned for thirteen months .
But Rubell ’s greatest crime went unpunished : a last - ditch snitch on Hamilton Jordan , Jimmy Carter ’s White House chief of staff , for allegedly doing lines in the basement .
This squeeze play was the brainchild of Joe McCarthy ’s bottom , Roy Cohn , the hard - partying lawyer for Studio .
Who else ?
Karma caught up with Rubell .
He succumbed to AIDS in 1989 .
His partner , of course , has had a successful second act .
And we who danced to 54 ’s tune , what about us 30 years far and beyond ?
It does n’t seem like yesterday , but I wish it were .

Exceptionally smooth , well - rounded quartz sand comprised of similarly sized grains ( sand does not have to be on a steep surface such as a dune )
Surface sand should be hot and dry ( wet sand can sometimes work , too , but neither wet nor dry sand should be tightly packed if sand is to produce noise because packed sand cannot easily be displaced )
A foot , hand , or stick with which to step on , sweep , or poke the sand ( one could also collect the sand in a container and shake )
A sand dune , preferably one that has recently undergone a strong , avalanche - producing sandstorm and has not yet stabilized A large volume of uncommonly smooth sand with virtually no protrusions on the grain surfaces
Sand grains that are very round and dry ( moisture on the dune 's surface can cause sand to clump together , inhibiting avalanching )
Grains on the dune 's surface that are " well sorted , " meaning they are all similar in size A band of hard - packed sand grains below the surface made wet from percolating rainwater
An avalanche , natural or manmade Wind , preferably moving at 14 mph or more A warm , dry climate ( Killpecker Dunes in Wyoming or the Great Sand Dunes in Colorado , two usually cool climates , can work in a pinch )
When he heard them in the Gobi Desert , Marco Polo believed they were spirit voices .
Ancient Chinese literature describes ritual celebrations of their divine power .
In 1941 , after crossing the Sahara , British engineer and explorer R. A. Bagnold was captivated by their spell .
The " weird chorus " of sound - emitting desert sands was , he wrote , " the song of sirens who lure travelers to a waterless doom , the toiling of underground bells in sand - engulfed monasteries . "
After generations of mystical interpretations , researchers are finally closing in on a scientific explanation for the acoustics of sand .
They now agree that the phenomenon of noisemaking sand is made possible by the action of displacement , which produces musical instrument - like vibrations in sand grains .
The exact recipe for noisy sands is still only wholly known in Mother Nature 's kitchen , but here are the necessary ingredients and right conditions experts have deduced so far for the two main varieties .
Sands that Croak , Whistle , Squeak , Bark , Burp , etc .
Listen to croaking sand
Unlike the haunting so - called booming sands that Marco Polo and others discovered among the isolated dunes of storied deserts , the noises sand makes are not always mellifluous .
Some relatively ordinary beach sands on the shores of oceans , lakes , and rivers make mundane noises .
Generally called squeaking sands , these common cousins of booming sands work like this :
By stepping on a stretch of beach or dune , moving across it with your hand , or poking it with a stick , pencil , or other such object , you can , given the right kind of sand ( see ingredient list at left ) , produce peals of sound at very high frequencies — between 500 and 2,500 hertz — lasting less than a quarter of a second .
These bursts result from the friction produced when the pressure of applied weight causes surface sand to displace and rapidly rub against the surrounding sand .
The kind of sound produced depends on the texture and size of the sand grains .
Sands That Go Boom
Listen to booming sand Only around 30 " booming " dunes are known worldwide — in deserts and on beaches in Hawaii , North and South America , Africa , the Middle East , and Asia .
The sounds of booming dunes have been compared to a variety of instruments , including violins , cellos , trumpets , bells , organs , and didgeridoos , which are Australian aboriginal wind instruments .
Booming sand dunes sound like instruments because , as opposed to squeaking sands , the noise they produce lasts longer ( up to 15 minutes in large dunes ) and it emanates at a single , steady musical tone .
How all the factors that produce booming sands mingle to affect the nature of their song is still a mystery , but here is what 's known : Booming sand starts with a dune made of sand that has traveled long distances from its original source .
The sand 's lengthy , windy journey means that grains deposited on the surface of the dune are extremely round , smooth , and uniform .
Next , a desert rainstorm must take place , washing dust and other foreign particles from among the surface grains .
The topmost sand must then dry out over a period of weeks while the sand beneath remains relatively moist .
In squeaking sand , noise - producing displacement can occur merely by stepping on the sand with your foot .
Booming sand requires the shearing action of a sand avalanche .
Avalanches can begin only after a dry desert sand dune has built up to an angle of about 35 degrees and only when a sufficient amount of wind provides enough force to begin the avalanche .
During an avalanche , surface layers of dry sand slip over the lower layers of the dune .
Individual grains of loose surface sand bounce up and down over the compacted lower layers of the dune , which have a higher moisture content .
The interaction between the upper - and lower - layer sand grains produces vibrations that make sound , much as a violin string does as a bow passes over it .
Booming sand makes loud , low - frequency sounds of 50 to 300 hertz .
During a large avalanche , the booming can be heard more than six miles away and standing near its locus can be deafening .

A couple of weeks ago , I heard about an interesting experiment .
The researchers took some rats and divided them into two groups .
Rats in both groups were individually placed in a tank of water that had been made opaque by adding milk , so the rats could n’t see what was in the water .
For one of the groups , however , there was a kind of “ island ” in the tank : a raised section of the bottom that was high enough that the rats could place their hind feet on it , to get some rest from swimming .
The other group was in a tank with no island ; they had no place to rest .
In a relatively short amount of time , the “ island ” rats learned to swim straight for the island .
The control group , of course , just flailed wildly , trying to stay above water .
Then came the experiment ’s payoff : both groups of rats were individually placed in a tank with no island , and the amount of time it took them to give up and sink beneath the water was measured .
( They were , of course , promptly rescued by the scientists . )
The result ?
The “ island ” rats lasted almost twice as long as the control rats , swimming frantically in search of the island they knew must be there – an island that really only existed within them .
So , the part I find compelling is this : sometimes it ’s better to believe a false good thing , than to believe a true bad one .
One imagines the rats thinking , “ I know that island is here somewhere !
Just a little bit more and I can rest … just a little bit longer now … ”
Of course , there are also true good things , and false bad ones in this world .
The islands within us may be places of fear or sorrow that we constantly swim away from , even when they never existed at all .
Indeed , we so often live on these future islands we fear or yearn for , that we scarcely notice the water we ’re treading in right now .
The Content of Your Mind is the Quality of Your Life
About a year ago , my wife and I signed a contract for a roofer to replace our house ’s roof , damaged by last year ’s hurricanes .
A year and several thousand dollars later , we still do n’t have our roof finished , as the job became unprofitable for the roofer , who therefore has no incentive to finish it .
We ’ve spent so much time worrying and stressing about this , and wondering what we can do about it .
But just a few days ago , it occurred to me for the first time that maybe we ’ve been spending so much time trying to swim away from an island of fear , that it never occurred to us the worrying is much worse than the things we ’ve been worrying about .
We do n’t actually have any roof leaks right now – that we know of , anyway .
Hurricane season is over .
The worst that ’s likely to happen right now is that we might have to hire somebody else and waste several thousand dollars .
Sure , that stuff ’s all bad , but the worrying has been much worse , in terms of quality of life .
Those things , if they happen , will only happen the once , but our worrying has been weekly and sometimes daily , for most of the year !
In retrospect , I wish we ’d just hired someone else months ago ; the quality of life improvement would ’ve been more than worth it .
So , for the first time , I acquired a personal perspective on that old saw about the coward dying a thousand deaths , and the brave man only one .
It does n’t matter how hard you swim away from the island , it still remains within you .
But if you cross over the island , you ’ll leave it behind you when you go .
As the saying goes , you can touch a thistle and it pricks you , but grasp it boldly and the spines crumble .
So , it ’s also literally true what Bobby McFerrin sang so many years ago :
In every life you got some trouble , When you worry , you make it double .
Except that next it ’s triple , then quadruple , quintuple , and so on , each and every time you worry .
And it ’s an even worse ratio if the worrying is more painful than the actual thing you ’re worrying about !
My spirits buoyed by this insight , I found myself thinking … what if you could turn it around ?
If your life experience can be so thoroughly overwhelmed by worry about negative things , could you equally overwhelm it with positive ones ?
In other words , what is the opposite of worry ?
The Opposite of Worrying
Are you thinking about it ?
Would n’t it be cool to know what it is ?
Do n’t you wish I ’d tell you ?
Are you looking forward to finding out ?
Have you guessed it yet ?
That ’s right : it ’s anticipation .
I probably would n’t have thought of it myself , if I had n’t been talking with my wife about Christmas presents the night before , just after she ’d been watching a “ Queer Eye ” episode where they helped a guy give his fiancee a surprise wedding , of all things .
Now , I do n’t know about you , but I winced as soon as I heard this concept .
“ Are they nuts ? ” I said .
“ A lot of women have been looking forward to their wedding almost their entire lives .
They ’re going to rob her of weeks of anticipation and obsessing over every detail . ”
( And yes , the fiancee definitely looked like she ’d have been a lot happier with more advance notice . )
Anyway , after that we talked briefly about Christmas presents , and I was thinking about how my wife loves to obsess over what a present might be , which is why I usually try to tease her a little bit ahead of Christmas or her birthday with impossible hints and enigmatic clues that she has no chance of figuring out .
From experience , I know that she loves the anticipation far more than the momentary enjoyment of the actual presents .
So the next day when I thought about the worry equation , it pretty quickly came to mind that the opposite of worry – in content , not structure – is anticipation .
When you anticipate a thing , you follow the exact same structure as worry : you imagine something you think might happen , and then feel how you think you would feel if the real thing happened .
So , whether the thing you ’re imagining is good or bad , the result of doing it repeatedly is to magnify the effect of the experience on your life , if only because of the repetition .
But that does n’t entirely explain it , because the truth is that you ’re not actually responding the way you would if the real thing happened .
When real bad things happen , we normally just get focused on fixing them .
And when real good things happen , it ’s quite nice , to be sure , but it ’s nothing like the ecstasy or fervor of some good anticipation !
The secret , I think , is that when we imagine the future – whether good or bad – we leave out a significant amount of context .
We see only the bad thing or the good thing itself , floating like an island in the oceans of our consciousness .
We do n’t see ourselves fixing a problem , we just see the problem itself .
We do n’t look at the drawbacks or limitations of an anticipated future either , like kids not thinking beforehand about having to clean up all the wrapping paper and boxes on Christmas day .
Not that that ’s a bad thing , mind you , at least where anticipation is concerned .
I ’ve spent too much of my life avoiding good things in order not to have to clean up after them , metaphorically speaking .
It ’s just that I ’m realizing now that all those people babbling about “ it ’s the journey , not the destination ” actually have a much bigger point than I had previously been aware of .
Small Goals Have No Power To Move Men ’s Hearts
You see , big goals are useful because they give you something powerful to look forward to for a long time , not because their momentary result is so valuable .
You can work for a lifetime and never actually achieve your goals , yet nonetheless have a wonderful life in the process .
( For example , it ’s unlikely that any golfer will ever shoot a perfect game , nor any batter achieve a perfect 1.000 average , but that does n’t make anybody quit playing golf or baseball . )
Paul Graham advises that , in general , we should all work on the hardest problems available to us , in the fields we believe we can make a contribution to .
I think that this is true , for no other reason than that it ’s the what makes the most rational sense for improving the quality of your spiritual and emotional life , regardless of whether you actually solve the problem or not .
The flip side of anticipation , you see , is that it supports involvement in what you ’re doing and how you live your life .
It gives you a chance to see the island and to be thoroughly invested in your swim towards it .
No mere amusement or pleasure is a substitute for involvement , and games are only fun when they capture enough of your attention to make you invest yourself in them this way .
Before my 2.0 upgrade , I mostly feared such involvement , because the idea of losing always seemed worse than the idea of not playing .
And to the extent that I understood the nature of anticipation and the idea of “ the journey , not the destination ” , I rejected them as a kind of cheat or self - delusion .
By now , however , it has become clear to me that appropriate self - delusion is n’t just a good idea , it ’s pretty much a necessity for actually accomplishing anything !
Sure , you can go too far with it ( cough George Bush cough ) , but what ca n’t you go too far with , really ?
On the other hand , self - delusion is a relative concept .
The truth is that the messages our senses receive are always subject to interpretation .
What we think an event “ means ” is inherently delusional , in the sense that our interpretations were never reality to start with .
Does a problem in the middle of your attempt to do something “ mean ” the effort is doomed to failure ?
That you should try harder ?
That you should think smarter ?
Every answer to the question of what an event “ means ” is ultimately a delusion !
So , to the extent that we assign the meanings , we control the meaning and quality of our lives , in an emotional and spiritual sense at least .
I ’m not talking here about trying to control the behavior of the universe through thought or creative manifestation or any of that stuff ; I just mean that what you think about and how you do it will entirely determine how you feel about your life .
That may in turn cause you to do things differently , for better or worse , but that ’s beside the point ; your quality of life was already affected by your thoughts before you ever acted on them !
Is Anything Really Worth Worrying About It ?
It ’s easy to shrug this idea off ; I was first exposed to it maybe 25 years ago , when I first read Maxwell Maltz ’ “ Psycho - Cybernetics ” .
But it was just intellectual knowledge , something that became part of my consulting repertoire , not something I really connected with or lived .
But if you can make this a part of your understanding of life now , then you can really feel how worrying saps the life out of you piece by piece , and you can become aware that the worrying is nearly always worse than whatever you ’re worrying about .
And even if it is n’t to start with , it will be as soon as you worry about it enough times !
So if you can make this a part of your experience – not just your knowledge – then you will be in a position to make a very real improvement in your day - to - day quality of life .
As for me , I ’m now thinking about how I can use anticipation to make additional improvements .
The trick seems to be that you need something you really believe will or can happen , but it does n’t necessarily need a concrete time frame to happen in .
And it ’s helpful if it ’s connected to the processes of your life , so that you can experience at any moment a connection to that dream and believe you ’re moving towards it .
Thus , the secret of successful people everywhere is that they actually reverse the usual way of looking at reality .
Instead of considering the “ real ” world to be the fixed and unchanging truth , they realize that the only place where truth is fixed is inside us .
It ’s only our external reality that moves from day to day , not the constant compass of the soul .
Magnetic north will jitter and shift as you move about the globe , but true north is always in your heart .
So build as you will , your castles in air ; as long as there ’s room for an island beneath .
And although you ’ll still swim through the thick and the thin , your life ’s really lived on the island within .
Radical ' Ballistic Computing ' Chip Bounces Electrons Like Billiards
Computer designers at the University of Rochester are going ballistic .
" Everyone has been trying to make better transistors by modifying current designs , but what we really need is the next paradigm , " says Quentin Diduck , a graduate student at the University who thought up the radical new design .
" We 've gone from the relay , to the tube , to semiconductor physics .
Now we 're taking the next step on the evolutionary track . "
That next step goes by the imposing name of " Ballistic Deflection Transistor , " and it's as far from traditional transistors as tubes .
Instead of running electrons through a transistor as if they were a current of water , the ballistic design bounces individual electrons off deflectors as if playing a game of atomic billiards .
Though today 's transistor design has many years of viability left , the amount of heat these transistors generate and the electrical " leaks " in their ultra - thin barriers have already begun to limit their speed .
Research groups around the world are investigating strange new designs to generate ways of computing at speeds unthinkable with today 's chips .
Some of these groups are working on similar single - electron transistors , but these designs still compute by starting and stopping the flow of electrons just like conventional designs .
But the Ballistic Deflection Transistor adds a new twist by bouncing the electrons into their chosen trajectories �using inertia to redirect for " free , " instead of wrestling the electrons into place with brute energy .
Researchers Martin Margala , Yonathan Shapir , Paul Ampadu , and Marc Feldman are teaming together to develop the Ballistic Deflection Transistor technology .

Such a chip would use very little power , create very little heat , be highly resistant to " noise " inherent in electronic systems , and should be easy to manufacture with current technologies .
All that would make it incredibly fast .
The National Science Foundation is so impressed with the idea that it just granted the University of Rochester team $ 1.1 million to develop a prototype .
" We 've assembled a unique team to take on this chip , " says Marc Feldman , professor of computer engineering at the University .
" In addition to myself and Quentin , we have a theoretical physicist , a circuit designer , and an expert in computer architecture .
We 're not just designing a new transistor , but a new archetype as well , and as far as I know , this is the first time an architect has been involved in the actual design of the transistor on which the entire architecture is built . "
The team has already had some luck in fabricating a prototype .
The ballistic transistor is a nano - scale structure , and so all but impossible to engineer just a few years ago .
Its very design means that this " large " prototype is already nearly as small as the best conventional transistor designs coming out of Silicon Valley today .
Feldman and Diduck are confident that the design will readily scale to much smaller dimensions .
There 's one hurdle the team is n't quite as confident about : " We 're talking about a chip speed measured in terahertz , a thousand times faster than today 's desktop transistors " Diduck says .
" We have to figure out how to test it because there 's no such thing as a terahertz oscilloscope ! "
The Science Behind the Ballistics
The Ballistic Deflection Transistor ( BDT ) should produce far less heat and run far faster than standard transistors because it does not start and stop the flow of its electrons the way conventional designs do .
It resembles a roadway intersection , except in the middle of the intersection sits a triangular block .
From the " south " an electron is fired , as it approaches the crossroads , it passes through an electrical field that pushes the electron slightly east or west .
When the electron reaches the middle of the intersection , it bounces off one side of the triangle block and is deflected straight along either the east or west roads .
In this way , if the electron current travels along the east road , it may be counted as a zero , and as a one if it travels down the west road .
A traditional transistor registers a " one " as a collection of electrons on a capacitor , and a " zero " when those electrons are removed .
Moving electrons on and off the capacitor is akin to filling and emptying a bucket of water .
The drawback to this method is that it takes time to fill and empty that bucket .
That refill time limits the speed of the transistor �the transistors in today 's laptops run at perhaps two gigahertz , meaning two billion refills every second .
A second drawback is that these transistors produce immense amounts of heat when that energy is emptied .
The BDT design should also be able to resist much of the electrical noise present in all electronic devices because the noise would only be present in the electrical " steering " field , and calculations show the variations of the noise would cancel themselves out as the electron passes through .
The BDT is " ballistic " because it is made from a sheet of semiconductor material called a " 2D electron gas , " which allows the electrons to travel without hitting impurities , which would impede the transistor 's performance .
The BDT prototype was fabricated at the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility with the support provided by the Office of Naval Research .
The $ 1.1 million is an NSF Nanotechnology Integrated Research Team grant , which is only awarded to promising research .
The team is comprised of Marc Feldman , professor of electrical and computer engineering , Martin Margala and Paul Ampadu , assistant professors of electrical and computer engineering , and Yonathan Shapir , professor of physics and astronomy .
Revellers caused £ 20,000 of damage to the £ 230,000 property after the invitation for the Easter Monday celebration was posted on the popular site as a " Skins Unofficial Party " - a reference to the controversial Channel 4 series which featured scenes where a teenage get - together got out of hand .
Partygoers allegedly urinated on the mother 's wedding dress and children 's clothes ; stole cash and jewellery ; ripped light fittings from the ceiling by swinging on them ; stubbed out cigarettes on the carpet ; vomited throughout the house and barricaded the back door to prevent neighbours from intervening .
Worried neighbours in the quiet cul - de-sac in Woodstone , near Houghton - le - Spring , County Durham , repeatedly called police as hordes of drunken youths caused chaos from 10.30 pm on the Bank Holiday to 3 am on Tuesday .
The sixth former 's parents returned that day to find a trail of devastation .
They have been forced to move out of their home while it is professionally cleaned .
" The girl 's parents were away , she invited people around and it spiralled out of her control , " a Durham police spokesman said .
" It was a private house party and we 've been told it was advertised on MySpace .
" We had a large number of complaints from neighbours and at various points we had to intervene . "
Officers left the house when the partygoers turned the music down , only to be called back later when the party resumed to full effect .
On another occasion they found scores of youngsters roaming the modern estate .
The police spokesman said many of the people at the party were not local - with two reportedly travelling from London for the bash - and had no way to get home .
He said the force made no arrests on the night but will attempt to trace all the partygoers while investigating the allegations of criminal damage .

BBC News , Baghdad
Detainees told of beatings and being given electric shocks
One man said he had been whipped with a cable and then had salt rubbed in the wound , while another said his captors had tried to pull out his toenails .
The BBC was also shown inside a Baghdad bunker at the centre of a scandal over detainee abuse by Iraqi forces .
More than 170 prisoners were found there last week , showing signs of malnourishment and torture .
A government - ordered inquiry is under way and Interior Minister Bayan Jabr has said torture will not be tolerated .
But he has also brushed aside reports of abuse , saying they have been exaggerated .
There are calls for an independent inquiry from Iraqis who do not trust the government to investigate itself .
There have been no findings yet .
The UN has expressed concern over the number of Iraqi detainees being held and the government faces growing international pressure over their treatment .
Overcrowded
The prisoners have now been moved from the interior ministry bunker in Baghdad , as have any traces of what they went through .
Many raised their hands when asked if they had been tortured
But the smell of overcrowding still hung in the air in some of the four rooms shown to journalists .
The general in charge admitted that some of the detainees had had skin rashes and diarrhoea .
He acknowledged that one of them was paralysed , although he said that had happened before the prisoner arrived at the bunker .
At the other detention centre , one prisoner said he had had electric shocks to his genitals .
When we asked who else had been tortured , there was a big show of hands .
Even in a facility opened up to journalists , it was so crowded there was barely room for all the prisoners to sit , let alone lie down .
What does the inside of a Blackwater training facility look like ?
Defense reporter Nathan Hodge ( and husband of DANGER ROOM contributor ) gives our readers an exclusive glimpse inside the company 's 7,000 training facility in North Carolina .
Read on .....
It 's like a military base – without the golf course .
And more construction was underway .
Earth movers and dumptrucks rumbled around the property , where a new runway and hangars were being built .
Blackwater was even building a chapel : the company has its own staff chaplain .
After a safety orientation , we headed out to the range .
It 's hard to understate how massive the Moyock facility is .
The place has 34 shooting ranges , three driving tracks and an airfield .
It boasts several " shoot houses " ( for indoor shooting drills ) , a maritime training facility ( for hostile boarding practice ) and a breaching facility ( for breaking down doors ) , as well as a full armory .
Our small press delegation was composed largely of professional gun reviewers , defense trade reporters and a writer / photographer team from the Washington Times .
Still , we began the morning by signing a sheaf of waivers – agreements that presumably would release Blackwater and HK from liability in the event of an accidental firearms discharge .
A Blackwater camera operator would tag along on the morning excursion .
" We 're glad you 're here , " he says .
" It will help dispel the myths about Blackwater . "
But first , the ground rules .
Number one : no unauthorized photography .
Blackwater trains military and law enforcement personnel , many of whom serve in harm 's way ; the company , Taylor stressed , respected the need to protect their identities .
Blackwater seemed to be counting on a cooperative audience .
It was a rare glimpse inside the Blackwater 's 7,000 - acre training facility .
Perhaps like no other private security firm , Blackwater projects a certain mystique ; and even when the gates were open to a visiting group of reporters , an atmosphere of high secrecy surrounded the place .
Chris Taylor , Blackwater 's vice president for strategic initiatives , greeted our group in the lobby of the company 's vast new headquarters building , which bears an odd resemblance to a Cabela 's retail outlet .
Since September 11 , 2001 , Blackwater has seen a surge in demand for its services , including a major State Department security contract .
In that respect , the Blackwater / HK training venture was a classic exercise in " cross- branding . "
By joining with Heckler & Koch , Blackwater leveraged the name recognition of a firearms manufacturer that provides high - end weapons to military and law enforcement customers around the globe .
That marketing message was driven home on the shooting range , where Heckler & Koch instructors give a live fire demonstration of the HK hardware , including the HK45 , a .45 caliber pistol developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol ( a recently suspended U.S. military competition ) and the 4.6 mm MP7A1 Personal Defense Weapon , a compact , concealable weapon that packs nearly the same punch as a assault rifle .
It was impressive , though one of the gun writers complained he could n't get a good three - round burst out of the rapid - fire weapon .
For the experts , the real stars of the show were the HK416 and HK417 rifle and carbine systems .
Heckler & Koch developed the HK416 as an " off - the - shelf " alternative to the 5.56 mm M16 rifle and M4 carbine in service with the U.S. military ( The HK417 , a prototype chambered for the NATO 7.62 cartridge , was also on display ) .
Visitors handled the weapons with appreciation :
They eliminate a major design flaw in the M16 / M4 family , a direct gas impingement system that makes the rifles require constant cleaning and lubrication .
One of the HK instructors put on a show , immersing the HK416 in a container of water , then covering it with sand .
After grabbing the rifle out of the sandbox , he gave it a quick shake and then fires off a magazine on full auto .
It 's like a lethal version of a vacuum cleaner demonstration , and much more convincing .
The training venture was about more than just HK weapons : there was also the merchandise .
Blackwater and HK are marketing brand - name apparel stitched with the logos of each company , and the junketeers went home with some excellent swag , including a fleece embroidered with the Blackwater HK International Training Services logo .
Their gift bag also included Blackwater ball cap , an HK pen , and – for the men at least – a pair of cufflinks with the Blackwater bear paw logo .
It 's more than just trade shows tchotchkes .
Blackwater also has a separate line of business marketing its own brand name tactical gear .
This includes load bearing vests , magazine pouches and slings .
It 's very much the style of the US contractor : accoutred with the latest in high - speed tactical equipment .
It 's exactly the image Blackwater wants to present ; a company on the " Fast 50 " list with a proud and recognizable brand and a long list of government customers .
The company 's prominence , however , cuts both ways :
For anti-war activists , Blackwater now ranks up with Halliburton subsidiary KBR in the rogue 's gallery of war profiteers .
Left - leaning websites vilify Blackwater founder Erik Prince and his family for their Republican party ties .
Litigation is also a sensitive topic .
Blackwater first made major headlines in 2004 , when four of its contractors were killed in a gruesome ambush in Fallujah , and the company has been tied up in a wrongful death suit with the families of the four men .
An aircraft accident in Afghanistan also prompted a lawsuit .
In that respect , Blackwater has done itself few favors when it comes to managing its image , whether it was hiring the Alexander Strategy Group ( a casualty of the Abramoff lobbying scandal ) to shape its message in Washington , retaining Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr to help make its case before the Supreme Court , or simply putting Bush / Cheney ' 04 bumper stickers on its vans .
While it may be a sound business move to avoid comment on litigation , it presents an image that is vulnerable to caricature : secretive , militaristic , pro-Republican .
So what will happen with Blackwater 's expansive vision ?
Much may come down to politics .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) recently singled out Blackwater in an oversight hearing on Iraq contracting practices .
During that hearing – which featured testimony from families of Fallujah ambush victims – a company attorney confirmed that one of its contract employees had shot and killed an Iraqi security guard in the protected International Zone .
The company whisked the contractor out of the country ; no charges against the shooter have been made public .
The killing could make an interesting test case for new laws governing contractors on the battlefield .
The legal environment is shifting rapidly for companies like Blackwater , and a recent change in law – quietly inserted into a defense authorization bill by Sen.
Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) – would place contractors operating in places like Iraq under military jurisdiction .
It may also help close the legal loophole that allowed contractors , previously exempt from Iraqi law , to escape prosecution for wrongdoing .
Such cases may prompt the military toward a broader re-think of its dependence on the private sector in conflict zones .
( A recent case in point : Two Air Force lieutenant colonels faced prosecution after a " road rage " incident in Kabul that involved a Blackwater contractor . )
So while Blackwater was opening itself up a little , company leaders have been keen to stay on message .
As Taylor said in welcoming us : " Today is about HK and Blackwater .
This is not a free - for - all ; this is not an opportunity to ask questions about litigation or the future of Blackwater . "

The road to the future of medicine is being paved by clever engineers - the folk who use new tools and knowledge to build impressive new technologies .
As the capabilities of biotechnology advance , so too does the quality of the engineering ; it 'll really take off once the cost drops to the point at which the talented amateurs join the party .
There 's no such thing as too many cooks when it comes to progress .
A couple of good examples of clever medical engineering caught my eye today , starting with another piece on developments contributing towards the future development of artificial eyes - to go alongside the few noted at the Longevity Meme in past weeks .
Development Could Lead To Creation Of An Artificial Retina
The process starts with a glass plate and then builds a layer - by - layer sandwich of two kinds of ultra - thin films , one made of mercury - tellurium nanoparticles and another of a positively charged polymer called PDDA .
The scientists then added a layer of ordinary clay and a cell - friendly coating of amino acid , and placed cultured neurons on the very top .
When light shines on them , the mercury - tellurium nanoparticle film layers produce electrons , which then move up into the PDDA film layers and produce an upward - moving electrical current .
" As you build up the layers of this , you get better capabilities to absorb photons and generate voltage , " said UTMB research scientist Todd Pappas , lead author on the Nano Letters paper .
" When the current reaches the neuron membrane , it depolarizes the cell to the point where it fires , and you get a signal in the nerve . " ...
The researchers caution that despite the great potential of a light - sensitive nanoparticle - neuron interface , creating an actual implantable artificial retina is a long - range project .
But they 're equally hopeful about a variety of other , less complex applications made possible by a tiny , versatile light - activated interface with nerve cells - such things as new ways to connect with artificial limbs and other prostheses , and revolutionary new tools for imaging , diagnosis and therapy .
This second release is illustrative of a range of inventive work that is taking place in the cancer research community these days .
Researchers Wake Up Viruses Inside Tumors To Image And Then Destroy Cancers
Researchers have found a way to activate Epstein - Barr viruses inside tumors as a way to identify patients whose infection can then be manipulated to destroy their tumors .
...
A variety of blood and solid cancers are more likely to occur in people who have been infected with the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) , but not everyone with these cancers has such infections .
For those who do , researchers , such as Hopkins oncologist and co-author Richard F. Ambinder , M.D. , Ph.D. , have been working on ways to activate the reproductive , or " lytic " cycle , within the virus to make it replicate within the tumor cell .
When enough viral particles are produced , the tumor will burst , releasing the virus .
In animal experiments , this experimental therapy , called lytic induction therapy , results in tumor death .
Other groups are achieving similar results with other viruses - everything in biochemistry can be a tool for medicine when viewed by the right set of eyes .
Technorati tags : biotechnology , medical research
When the sleek Motorola Razr V3 cellphone first hit the stores just over two years ago , it carried the price tag of a must - have status symbol : $ 500 .
Now ?
About $ 30 with a two - year service contract .
Motorola ’s fortunes have plunged along with the price of its Razr .
Its profits have collapsed , and it announced plans last month to lay off 3,500 workers .
Since last October , its stock has dropped 30 percent , attracting the attention of the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn , who bought 40 million shares last week on a bet that he could push the company to do better .
At first glance , the company ’s troubles are puzzling .
Almost one billion mobile phones are sold worldwide each year , and Motorola has almost a quarter of the market .
Consumers are also replacing their phones faster , on average less than every two years .
But the cellphone business is still relatively young , and Motorola is learning a cruel new lesson about consumer tastes in phones .
An industry that has focused more on microchips , screen size and data speed is finding it has more in common with the fashion business .
It is worth remembering , as we look at the history of crude stocks over the past year that , about twelve months ago we were looking into a future that was anticipating a second bad hurricane season , as well as the usual geo-political machinations and technical problems that would combine to limit crude oil supplies .
In the end these were not as severe as we had expected , and the precaution of building oil stocks for the summer was not , this past year , needed as we had a more benign summer than usual .
I was reading the story that Leanan had posted on the IEA estimate for oil demand , and it struck me that we are in that navel gazing part of the year where we try and estimate what will happen to oil supply and prediction .
Since it helps to have data , let ’s see what the crude oil and gasoline situation looks like , using the EIA data .
In addition , the increase in price , helped to increase domestic production a little over that from this time last year , although the overall trend , taken from 2005 is still down ( and this time last year we were still seeing some effects from the three hurricanes of 2005 ) .
Crude imports have been a little more volatile over the past year , perhaps reflective of the price swings that we have seen .
On the other hand , when one considers that all this has to go through the refineries to be converted into something useful , one sees that the flows have been a little more stable .
Although it is worthy of note that we have only increased production over the previous year , since September .
Looking at the resulting gasoline production , this has been significantly above last year , though , again , some of this reflects the restoration of refining capacity .
When taken with the changes in the amount of gasoline that is imported :
which has also shown some recent volatility , means that there has been an increase in demand , that this combined production must meet .
This is now running about 400,000 bd ahead of this time last year , indicating , perhaps that the public may now consider that we have weathered “ the latest energy crisis . ”
Well , while this may prove the fickleness of the popular attention span , peak oil is perhaps not the only issue so treated .
As the weather has got worse over the last month , returning to more of a normal pattern , so global warming has dropped a little in popularity according to blogpulse although that and climate change are now much more of a topic of conversation than peak oil .
We will see how that works out over the course of the rest of the year .
It is a bit of a change from this time last year .
However we have still to start looking at what the forecasts are going to be for hurricanes , this year , and whether we will end up having a good , or a bad , season .
We shall see .
A plant chamber used to investigate methane formation in plants -- in this example , in ryegrass ( Lolium perenne ) .
Image : Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics .
In the last few years , more and more research has focused on the biosphere ; particularly , on how gases which influence the climate are exchanged between the biosphere and atmosphere .
Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics have now carefully analysed which organic gases are emitted from plants .
They made the surprising discovery that plants release methane , a greenhouse gas - and this goes against all previous assumptions .
Equally surprising was that methane formation is not hindered by the presence of oxygen .
This discovery is important not just for plant researchers but also for understanding the connection between global warming and increased greenhouse gas production ( Nature , January 12 , 2006 ) .
Methane is the greenhouse gas which has the second greatest effect on climate , after carbon dioxide .
The concentration of methane in the atmosphere has almost tripled in the last 150 years .
Methane is best known as natural gas , currently an important energy source .
Nonetheless , only part of the methane uptake in the atmosphere is due to industrial activities connected to energy production and use .
More important for the increase of methane in the atmosphere is the increase in so - called " biogenic " sources , e.g. , rice cultivation or domestic ruminants related to the rise in the world 's population .
Nowadays , methane in the atmosphere in fact is largely of biogenic origin .
Until now , it has been assumed that biogenic methane is formed anaerobically , that is , via micro-organisms and in the absence of oxygen .
In this way , acetate or hydrogen and carbon dioxide are transformed into methane ; they themselves are created in the anaerobic decomposition of organic materials .
The largest anoxic sources of methane are wetlands and rice fields , as well as the digestion of ruminants and termites , waste disposal sites , and the gas produced by sewage treatment plants .
According to previous estimates , these sources make up two - thirds of the 600 million tonnes worldwide annual methane production .
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics have now discovered that plants themselves produce methane and emit it into the atmosphere , even in completely normal , oxygen - rich surroundings .
The researchers made the surprising discovery during an investigation of which gases are emitted by dead and fresh leaves .
Then , in the laboratory and in the wild , the scientists looked at the release of gases from living plants like maize and ryegrass .
In this investigation , it turned out that living plants let out some 10 to 1000 times more methane than dead plant material .
The researchers then were able to show that the rate of methane production grew drastically when the plants were exposed to the sun .
Although the scientists have some first indications , it is still unclear what processes are responsible for the formation of methane in plants .
The researchers from Heidelberg assume that there is an unknown , hidden reaction mechanism , which current knowledge about plants cannot explain - in other words , a new area of research for biochemistry and plant physiology .
In terms of total amount of production worldwide , the scientists ' first guesses are between 60 and 240 million tonnes of methane per year .
That means that about 10 to 30 percent of present annual methane production comes from plants .
The largest portion of that - about two - thirds - originates from tropical areas , because that is where the most biomass is located .
The evidence of direct methane emissions from plants also explains the unexpectedly high methane concentrations over tropical forests , measured only recently via satellite by a research group from the University of Heidelberg .
But why would such a seemingly obvious discovery only come about now , 20 years after hundreds of scientists around the globe started investigating the global methane cycle ?
" Methane could not really be created that way , " says Dr. Frank Keppler .
" Until now all the textbooks have said that biogenic methane can only be produced in the absence of oxygen .
For that simple reason , nobody looked closely at this . "
The fact is that , in order to determine the quantity of emissions , scientists indeed have to make very careful measurements .
The researchers from Heidelberg conducted most of their experiments in methane - free air , in order to factor out the high natural background of methane .
Furthermore they used isotope analysis to show beyond doubt that this was an undiscovered process of methane production .
By " looking closely " - despite established opinion - they made a discovery that will require textbooks to have their passages about methane production rewritten .
Following up on this discovery , the scientists now will continue laboratory work , as well as field and remote sensing studies , to better quantify the strength of these methane emissions .
A related exciting question is which role the biosphere has played in methane production in the history of the earth , and what kind of influence rising global temperatures and carbon dioxide concentration have on the production of methane from plants .
Answers to these questions are important for understanding the feedback mechanisms between climate change and greenhouse gas production .

How to harness the power of biosolids to make hydrogen
An Italian company has begun marketing a cement that is capable of absorbing pollution from vehicles .
Italcementi , which spent 10 years developing its TX Active , said the building material is capable of reducing urban pollution by more than 40 percent , the Italian news agency ANSA reported Tuesday .
Tests on a road near Milan showed TX Active cut the level of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide by as much as 65 percent .
It functions via a chemical process called photocatalysis , whereby sunlight triggers a chemical reaction when titanium dioxide on the surface of the cement comes into contact with pollutants in the air .
TX Active works most effectively in bright sunlight .
Italcementi said test results have been verified by independent bodies like the National Research Council .
TX Active cement has already been used on a number of buildings , including Air France 's new headquarters at Paris ' Charles de Gaulle Airport , Rome 's Dives in Misericordia church and Bordeaux 's Hotel de Police .

Happy as a pig ...
Lung cancer patients treated with " friendly " bacteria normally found in the soil have anecdotally reported improvements in their quality of life .
Mice exposed to the same bacteria made more of the brain 's " happy " chemical serotonin , the Bristol University authors told the journal Neuroscience .
Common antidepressants work by boosting this brain chemical .
Dirty play
A lack of serotonin is linked with depression in people .
The scientists say more work is now needed to determine if the bacterium Mycobacterium vaccae has antidepressant properties through activation of serotonin neurons .
Lead researcher Dr Chris Lowry said : " These studies help us understand how the body communicates with the brain and why a healthy immune system is important for maintaining mental health .
" They also leave us wondering if we should n't all spend more time playing in the dirt . "
The work could also help experts ' understanding of why an imbalance in the immune system leaves some individuals vulnerable to mood disorders like depression , he added .
Mood and immunity
Canadian researchers have also been exploring the links between serotonin , mood and immunity .
A team at Georgetown University Medical Center recently discovered serotonin is passed between key cells in the immune system , and that the chemical can activate an immune response .
This suggests that serotonin may restore a healthy immune function in people who are depressed and prone to infections .
On the flip side , it is also possible that serotonin , and serotonin - boosting antidepressants , end up bolstering immunity to the point that they trigger autoimmune disease where the body attacks itself .
Gerard
Ahern , lead researcher on the study , explained : " At this point we just do n't know how these drugs might affect immunity , so we really need to clarify the normal role of serotonin in immune cell functioning . "

One of the reasons that defenders of the current patent system often give for the importance of keeping the system , is the idea that it benefits society by revealing ideas that otherwise would be kept secret .
That is , indeed , one of the benefits ... if those ideas would n't have come out otherwise and if the publication of the patent actually revealed anything about the invention in question .
All too often we 've seen that this second part is missing .
Patents describe something extremely broad and general , so as to reveal as little as possible , but make sure as much as possible infringes on it .
It seems like it would be a reasonable " test " of the validity of a patent to see if someone could use just the patent itself to replicate the invention in question .
It seems like some judges in the UK agree .
The Court of Appeals in England has ruled against two software patents , specifically noting that someone who knows the basic subject area should be able to replicate what 's described in the patent with just the patent alone -- and these patents fail that test .
In fact , the ruling said : " that the patent was missing vital details , contained wrong equations , demanded a higher level of expertise than allowed and that it relied on material external to the patent . "
In other words , the patent itself did not actually explain the invention it was trying to cover , but rather hinted at what it might be .
With the huge awards for patent infringement going around , an increasing number of patents seem to be written the same way -- so it would be nice to see more examinations of patents that look at this particular factor and whether or not the patent actually does try to explain the invention for others to use , or simply word it broadly enough to catch random infringers .
It 's ( Not ) All Been Done By Herb Sutter Every decade or so we have a major revolution in the way we develop software and the environments we develop for .
But , unlike the object and web revolutions , we can see the concurrency revolution coming .
A briefer version of this article appeared in Dr. Dobb's Journal , 31 ( 9 ) , September 2006 .
This is a wonderful time to be a software engineer .
Every new frontier is the exhilarating domain of inventors and explorers .
Life on the frontier can be primitive and even dangerous , but in return the pioneers have an overwhelming compensation :
There ’s so much room , so much uncharted territory , and everything is just waiting to be discovered and invented .
The 1950s and 1960s were like that .
Computer science was new , and you know the pioneers — names like Edsger Dijkstra and Sir Tony Hoare .
But have you ever felt that all the cool stuff was already done back in the 1950s and 1960s , back when electronic computers were new ?
Consider that all of the major “ new ” technologies of the past 15 years were originally invented in those early days : Garbage collection ?
Java did n’t invent it ; McCarthy invented it for Lisp in 1958 , and published his paper in 1960 .
Object oriented programming ?
Smalltalk and C++ did n’t invent it ; Simula did , vintage 1965 , and released in 1967 .
Parameterized generic types ?
Ada and C++ did n’t invent those ; Strachey did , also in 1967 .
Incidentally , 1967 was a banner year ; it also saw the first design meetings for the ARPANET .
But bringing those technologies to mainstream programmers required developing them further , including doing new research and development to make the technologies more broadly usable ( e.g. , think Mosaic ) , and making them into widely usable polished products .
Languages like Smalltalk , C++ , Java , C# , Python , and many others , and all the smart people who developed them and worked on their many implementations , deserve huge credit for making that huge engineering leap .
So , yes , it surely is humbling to realize that all the hot stuff that seems so brand new today actually existed back when our parents still had to carry their stacks of punched cards to school in snow up to their armpits and uphill both ways .
( And that assumes our parents were one of the lucky few to have shared access to a mainframe computer that was far less powerful than your PDA . )
But Java brought garbage collection to the mainstream , Smalltalk did the same for objects , C++ did the same for generic types — and next we ’re going to do the same for concurrency and parallel programming .
For the first time in the history of computing , mainstream computers are no longer von Neumann machines , and never will be again Just think :
For the first time in the history of computing , mainstream computers are no longer von Neumann machines , and never will be again — they are parallel .
We have already largely succeeded with the quest to put a computer in every home and purse ; now we ’re effectively going to be putting a Cray into every den and pocket .
Given that our applications are going to run on parallel machines , this is a time of enormous opportunity , along with a great deal of work .
Sure , concurrency has been done before ; parallel computing was researched by some the very people already mentioned ( e.g. , Hoare ’s seminal paper on “ Communicating Sequential Processes ” ) , and companies like Cray have been doing it for years .
But the mainstream programmer and mainstream environments have most certainly not been doing it routinely , and we have only now just begun the process of bringing concurrency and parallel programming to the mainstream .
At the end of 2004 in " The Free Lunch Is Over — A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software , " I wrote that “ the biggest sea change in software development since the OO revolution is knocking at the door , and its name is Concurrency . ”
The concurrency revolution now getting underway will be as significant as the object revolution of the late 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s in its impact on programming languages and development tools .
Just as during the early 1990s we attended conference sessions with breathless topics like “ what is an object ” and “ what is a virtual function , ” in coming years we ’ll attend conference sessions with breathless topics like “ what is an active object ” and “ what is a future . ”
This has already begun .
Centuries ago , Galileo invented the telescope , and Newton the theory of gravitation .
For the century or three after that , undoubtedly some researchers felt that they were “ merely ” making incremental improvements .
But the truth is that there was still much to do ; just ask Albert Einstein , Robert Goddard , and Wernher von Braun .
Yes , Galileo was the first to see the lunar surface was irregular and that the Milky Way was a densely packed gauze of stars .
Yet some of our contemporaries have walked on the face of that moon , while others are mapping distant galaxies , superclusters of galaxies , and the universal background radiation .
Galileo could see individual stars perhaps halfway across our galaxy , and so we know he could see on the order of 50,000 years into the past ; today , we estimate that we can peer back in time as far as several billion years ago .
We can be glad Einstein and von Braun did n’t decide to pursue some other field because it seemed Galileo and Newton had already done all the interesting stuff .
And likewise Galileo and Newton happily did n’t decide physics was just sooo over because all the cool stuff had already been accomplished by Euclid and Archimedes .
For the rest of this decade and into part the next , we ’re going to do for concurrency what we did for objects and garbage collection Sometimes it might seem that all the cool stuff was invented in the 1950s and 1960s , and that the pioneers had all the fun when everything was new and waiting to be discovered .
The truth is that our industry is still in its infancy .
We can admire the contributions of the Galileos and the Newtons , but they themselves stood on the shoulders of earlier giants just as we will stand on theirs .
Yes , this is a wonderful time to be a software engineer .
For the rest of this decade and into part the next , we ’re going to do for concurrency what we did for objects and garbage collection and the web :
Stand on the results of past giants , develop their ideas still further , and bring the concepts into the mainstream .
It ’ll require using the best techniques of the past , developing new ones , and a pile of work to turn it all into broadly usable products .
But , unlike the object and web revolutions , we can see the concurrency revolution coming .
Every decade or so we have a major revolution in the way we develop software and the environments we develop for .
Each time , we carefully navigate a turn and then accelerate down the next straightaway :
We turned the corner into the structured programming revolution , then the PC revolution , then the OO revolution , then the Internet revolution .
Now , we ’re just navigating the twists and turns of Parallel Alley and getting ready to open our throttle again down the next chunk of open road .
Pedal to the metal , everyone .
The new world awaits .
Django and NIH
Just so you know , Django is a smug , arrogant framework that does n’t play nice with others .
The developers are smug , arrogant assholes who do n’t care what anyone else does or what other tools are available , and who always insist on doing things their way .
Django absolutely refuses to support cool “ standard ” Python tools and libraries unless they were implemented first for Django .
Just stay the hell away from it , and teach those goddamned Django people a lesson by doing so !
Or at least , that ’s the impression you ’d get from reading the rants some people periodically launch against it .
I understand why this particular dead horse gets dragged out and flogged every once in a while ( and I understand why , on several occasions , the flogging has been done by developers of other Python web frameworks ) , but understanding why it happens does n’t make it any less wrong .
And of course there ’s an entry in the Django FAQ about why we ’ve “ reinvented ” a number of things , and has been pretty much since day one , but for some reason people either do n’t read it or just dismiss it out of hand .
So let me try to set the record straight .
NIH Syndrome
The “ NIH ” stands for “ Not Invented Here ” , and is a common ingredient of bad software projects — rather than looking at what ’s available and figuring out what they can re-use , such projects ignore existing work and proceed to re-invent everything for their own use .
If it did n’t come out of the project originally , it does n’t get used .
From the outside , especially now , it ’s easy to fling that accusation at Django : we have our own object - relational mapper , our own templating system , our own middleware system … it sure looks like we ’re suffering from a major case of NIH .
But that ’s a misleading impression , and to understand why we have to go back a ways in time .
Django began its life a number of years ago and coalesced , one piece at a time , out of the needs of the developers here at World Online .
The key word here is “ a number of years ” ; components of Django predate a lot of the things we ’re often accused of “ reinventing ” .
That shoots a big , gaping hole in the NIH argument , because it ’s really hard to use a third - party tool that does n’t exist yet .
Moving forward
Django has certainly evolved a lot since then , and high - quality tools have come into existence and matured independently of Django , and — in my own admittedly biased opinion — I think we ’re doing an OK job of appropriately using them as we go .
For example :
In the Great Leap Forward from Django 0.91 to Django 0.95 , we bundled PyDispatcher rather than implement our own internal communications .
Not long after the initial public release , we picked up support for running under WSGI servers .
servers .
We ’ve got a branch going right now to integrate SQLAlchemy as an option for ORM .
.
We ’ve pulled in SimpleJSON for object serialization .
From the earliest public releases , we ’ve used standard third - party database adapter modules instead of writing our own .
We ’ve gained an internationalization system that ’s based on gettext .
.
We ’ve opened up our authentication system ; you can now use any authentication source you want by writing a single , simple class that tells Django how it works .
I could keep going on and on about the various third - party tools and standards Django uses and all the ways you can integrate more stuff if you want to , but hopefully the above will be enough to indicate that anyone accusing us of having NIH blinkers is full of it .
Nevertheless , there are two things that keep coming up over and over again …
WSGI middleware versus Django middleware
One thing people ask a lot ( well , one particular person asks it a lot , at least ) is why , since Django can speak WSGI , it implements its own middleware system instead of taking advantage of the existing ecosystem of WSGI middleware .
This seems like classic developer arrogance , right ?
Well , not really .
If you want to use WSGI middleware instead of Django ’s , then go for it — we wo n’t yell at you if use a WSGI gzip module instead of Django ’s GzipMiddleware , for example .
The problem is that you ca n’t always use WSGI middleware or other common WSGI tools .
Django is heavily committed to also working under mod_python ; if nothing else , it ’s the standard deployment setup here at World Online , and the one we recommend to our clients when we sell them Django - based applications .
And mod_python , according to its official FAQ , does n’t really do WSGI yet ; if you need mod_python and WSGI , you need to go fetch a third - party module and set it up yourself .
It ’s kind of hard to use WSGI middleware when you do n’t have a WSGI server .
And it ’s a very good argument in favor of Django having its own middleware system which implements common needs like content encoding , caching , error handling , etc .
It ’s also why Django has two slightly different entry and exit points — one speaks mod_python and the other speaks WSGI .
It ’s not fun or pretty to need that , but what are you gonna do ?
Templating
It ’s true that now there are approximately eleventy billion Python templating toolkits out there , and some of them are pretty darned good .
So why does Django still have its own different templating system ?
Off the top of my head , I can think of a few good reasons :
Speed .
Most Python templating systems are heavily based on XML , which means you get the overhead of XML processing on every request .
For some situations that overhead is n’t significant , but when you start serving a few million hits you start noticing how long it takes to parse those templates .
Django ’s template language , on the other hand , can be tokenized using a single , short , compiled regular expression .
That makes it blazing fast ; to steal a line from the Rails guys , Django can render and return a page several times over while other templating systems are still doing XML sit-ups .

Flexibility .
That ’s another problem with tying yourself to XML — it gets ugly when you want output that is n’t an XML - ish or SGML - ish format .
Django ’s templating system , on the other hand , can and happily will output all sorts of formats that do n’t involve any angle brackets at all .
You want CSV ?
You got it .
You want plain - text email ?
You got it .
You want LaTeX ?
You got it .
XML would make all of those things harder for no good reason .

Balance .
Designing a templating language means walking a fine line : you have to keep business logic cleanly separated from the templating system , allow presentational logic and keep the whole thing simple enough to be picked up by someone who ’s not a professional programmer .
Django ’s templating system does a better job of this than most of the other Python template kits I ’ve seen , so I ’d vote to keep it on this factor alone .
It ’s also kind of amusing that some people apparently like Django ’s template system so much that they ’ve built standalone versions of it for use elsewhere ( even in other languages — there ’s a templating system available now for Rails that uses identical syntax to Django’s ) .
Can we put this to rest , then ?
There ’s a big difference between NIH and “ we looked at what was available already and did n’t find anything suitable ” .
There are a number of places where Django has chosen to do its own thing , but those have been informed choices , made with an understanding of what existing tools were available .
So could we stop flogging the dead horse ?
Microsoft Rips Off Apple ’s Workgroup Manager Icon
Go to this page on Microsoft.com for Vista Business edition .
Click the “ Buy ” tab or “ Buy Now ” button .
The page content changes , to reveal this icon : Go to this page on Apple.com for Mac OS X Server .
Scroll down and observe this icon for Apple ’s Workgroup Manager app : Go “ Hmm … ” .
Think of a snarky comment making fun of the fact that Microsoft ca n’t even copy an icon without screwing it up by resizing it .
Bonus points if you can work in a crack about the misspelling ( “ Busines ” ) in Microsoft ’s web page title .
( Thanks to astute DF reader Humberto Becerra for discovering this . )
Update 1 : At some point late this afternoon , Microsoft replaced their ripped - off copy of Apple ’s Workgroup Manager icon with this gem :
Judging by the appalling anti-aliasing ( look at the edges of the front two displays against the blue screen of the back one ) , it would appear this replacement icon was rather hastily assembled .
Good thing I saved a copy of the original GIF file here .
( By the way : GIF ?
In 2006 ? )

Veteran technology firm Commodore has launched a new generation of high - end gaming computers at the Cebit trade fair in Germany .
The company released its first home computer , the PET , in 1977 .
It had a monochrome display and a " datasette " for storing information .
The Vic 20 arrived in the US and Europe in 1981 , and was one of the first home computers to feature a colour display .
Owners could expand its 5 K RAM with expansion cartridges .
The C64 became a 1980s icon .
It remains the biggest - selling computer model of all time , selling more than 17 m units worldwide .
Despite its name , the Commodore 64 had only 38 K of usable RAM for programming in the BASIC language .
Thousands of games were released for the Commodore 64 including the split - screen driving game Pitstop II .
Many veteran gamers still play Commodore 64 games like Impossible Mission on PCs using emulation software .
1985 saw the launch of the Amiga .
The successor to the Commodore 64 , the Amiga was designed to compete with Atari's ST computers .
Despite selling well in Europe , the Amiga CD32 did not perform well enough globally to stave off Commodore 's 1994 collapse .
The Commodore brand has been resurrected in recent years , and has now released a new range of high - end gaming PCs .
The new machines have two video cards , up to 4GB of RAM and customised artwork on the outer case .

Django 0.95.1 released
We 've just rolled out Django 0.95.1 , a new minor release of Django which includes fixes for several bugs discovered in the original 0.95 release ; 0.95.1 includes :
A patch for a small security vulnerability in the script Django 's internationalization system uses to compile translation files ( changeset 4360 in the " 0.95 - bugfixes " branch ) .
A fix for a bug in Django 's authentication middleware which could cause apparent " caching " of a logged - in user ( changeset 4361 ) .
A patch which disables debugging mode in the flup FastCGI package Django uses to launch its FastCGI server , which prevents tracebacks from bubbling up during production use ( changeset 4363 ) .
It 's recommended that anyone using the official 0.95 release upgrade to 0.95.1 to get these fixes , or apply the patches from the changesets linked above .

Technorati Tags :
The first thing I noticed about The Experience Project was its tag cloud with the wordsbeing the largest tag .
At that moment , I knew this site had to be worth a look around .
The Experience Project bills itself as social networking for discreet people , meaning those who actively want to shelter their real identities online .
In fact , on the registration page , there 's this helpful function :
There 's a flavor reminiscent of PostSecret about the Experience Project ( I 'll call it TEP from now on ; it 's a little long to type each time ) ; getting things off your chest , sharing secrets , exposing yourself without exposing your true self to the world .
However , whereas PostSecret allows only a unidirectional flow of information ( secret sharer to world ) , TEP is more dynamic since it allows communities to be formed around topics of shared interest like all good social networking sites .
There 's something about TEP whether it's the site design or the sun person logo that really appeals to me .
I think it activates the avidly voyeuristic part of the mind that wants to know what the neighbors are up to .

Strains of tuberculosis ( TB ) that are resistant to both first - line and second - line drugs could threaten the success of not only tuberculosis programs , but also HIV treatment programs worldwide , according to an article published online this week in The Lancet .
The report details a study by a team of investigators from the United States and South Africa , who found that highly resistant strains of TB were more common than previously thought in a rural area of KwaZulu Natal , South Africa , and were associated with high death rates in patients with HIV infection .
TB accounts for approximately 1.7 million deaths worldwide , each year , and is the leading cause of death in HIV - infected patients in low - income countries .
In the study , presented by Dr. Neel Gandhi , assistant professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University , the researchers tested patients with suspected tuberculosis for MDR and XDR strains .
They found that of 1,539 patients , 221 had MDR tuberculosis , and 53 of these had XDR tuberculosis .
The prevalence rates in a group of 475 patients with confirmed tuberculosis were 39 % for MDR and 6 % for XDR tuberculosis — higher rates than previously reported in the area .
All patients with XDR disease who were tested for HIV were co-infected with the virus , and all but one died .
( Dr. Gandhi conducted this research while he completing fellowships at Yale University School of Medicine and Emory University .
He joined the Einstein faculty in August 2006 . )
Further complicating the problem posed by multidrug - resistance is the fact that the epidemics of tuberculosis and HIV in South Africa are closely linked .
Risk of tuberculosis disease is greatly increased in people with HIV infection , and multidrug - resistant ( MDR ) tuberculosis is emerging as a major cause of death in these patients .
The term extensively drug- resistant ( XDR ) tuberculosis has recently been used to describe strains that are resistant to second - line drugs — i.e. , drugs that are used if the recommended first drug treatment regimen fails .
Investigation of the patients ’ histories and the genetic makeup of the infecting bacteria suggested that transmission of XDR strains had occurred recently , that transmission between individuals had occurred , and that some patients had been infected while in hospital .
The researchers say that these findings are worrying , since hospitals in low - income countries have limited infection - control facilities and a high proportion of susceptible HIV - infected patients .
They recommend action to tackle the problem of resistant strains that could jeopardise attempts to control tuberculosis and prevent mortality in HIV patients .
In addition to Dr. Gandhi , other researchers involved in the collaborative project were Dr. Gerald Friedland , director of the AIDS Program at Yale University ; Dr. Tony Moll , of the Church of Scotland Hospital in Tugela Ferry , South Africa ; and Drs. Willem Sturm , Robert Pawinksi and Umesh Lalloo , of the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine , in Durban , South Africa .
Optimism is a key to success , but it does n’t necessarily work so well when it comes to VC .
Because this is a cottage industry with thousands of players , all with different objectives , it ’s very easy to keep knocking on doors , just waiting to find the right match .
It ’s also easy to spend a year or more adjusting your business to what each VC asks for ( " bring me the broomstick of the wicked witch ! " while you could have been out there building a real organization . )
Here are a bunch of conditions that you ought to take seriously before you invest the time and the energy to track down outside money for your great idea :
Investors like to invest in categories they ’ve already invested in .
If your business is so new that it ’s never been tested before , or is in a category VCs hate , think twice .
Investors want you to sell out .
As soon as possible .
For as much as possible .
They have no desire to own part of your company forever .
Investors want to invest in a project that ’s tested .
If you ca n’t make it work in the ‘ small ’ , why do you think it ’ll work when it ’s big ?
Being a little better than the market leader is worthless .
Investors do n’t want you to use their money to cover your losses .
They want you to build an asset ( a patent , an audience , channel relationships ) that ’s actually worth something .
Investors want someone to run your company who has successfully run a company before .
Investors want to be able to come to one of your board meetings and still make it home in time for dinner .
VCs like curves more than they like cliffs .
There are actually very very few business problems that can be solved with money .
You will probably have to replace many of your employees if you raise money from someone .
VCs understand that being the best in the world ( #1 ) is the place with the biggest rewards , so it ’s unlikely they will settle for any performance ( even a profitable one ) that puts you in second or third place .
VCs are very smart and very connected , but they ’re smart enough to know that their connections and their insights ca n’t fix a broken business .
Investors are very focused on the company , not you .
They ’re not interested in having you take out your original investment or paying you a large salary as profits go up .
Business plans are bogus .
The act of writing one is critical , but no one is going to read more than three pages of what you write before they make a decision .
The companies that VCs most want to invest in are the companies that do n’t need their investment to survive .

You can't help looking straight down to where Mr Cockburn says a colleague suggested they paint the outline of a fallen body .
Before the glass clears , you hear the sounds of creaking chains and breaking glass .
" We 're trying to go … from comfortable to scary , " Mr Cockburn says .
Of why the bossa nova hit The Girl from Ipanema is playing , he says : " We 're kind of sadistic , I suppose . "
We 're 30 metres higher than the previous highest vantage point in Melbourne , the observation deck on the 55th level of the Rialto Towers .
The 2.1 by 2.6 - metre cube of glass and reinforced steel , likened to a " giant matchbox " , is designed to take up to 12 passengers at a time and hold at least 10 tonnes .
Organisers hope this world - first attraction will become one of Melbourne 's biggest tourist drawcards .
It will be open to the public from May 15 , running from 10 am to 10 pm daily , except when winds exceed 70 km/h .
Visitors take a lift ( $ 16.50 per adult , $ 11 concession , $ 9 children ) that deposits you on the 88th floor in 40 seconds .
There you can wander about and , for an extra fee ( $ 12 , $ 10 , $ 8 ) , enjoy " the Edge experience " .
" The ones who scream their hearts out when they get in this thing just make me so happy , " Mr Cockburn tells media on a guided preview .
He dobs in several people who have declined to enter the cube .
State Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu is one who apparently baulked at the prospect .
" It 's very , very safe , " Mr Cockburn says .
The experience is " fairly roller - coaster - like " .
He concedes that he has been trying to overcome a fear of heights .
" I 've been skydiving and bungee - jumping , " he says .
" Work on this project has almost cured me , but not quite . "

CAPE CANAVERAL - NASA aimsto sideline shuttle Atlantis in 2008 , but a senior agency official said Fridaythat no job cuts are expected at Kennedy Space Center as a result .
In an all - hands meeting atKSC , NASA shuttle program manager Wayne Hale told workers that Atlantis wouldserve as a " parts donor " between 2008 and the shuttle fleet ' sscheduled retirement in September 2010 .
The $ 2 billion spaceshiphad been slated to undergo a lengthy overhaul beginning in 2008 and would nothave been ready to fly again until the very end of the shuttle program , hesaid .
" We 're going to keepit in as near flight - ready condition as we can without putting it through an( overhaul ) so we can use those parts , " Hale said .
NASA plans between 16 and 18 missions to finish assembly of the International Space Station , and likelywill launch another flight to service the Hubble Space Telescope .
Atlantis is scheduled tofly five missions between July and mid-2008 .
Sister ships Discovery and Endeavour will be used to complete construction of the orbiting outpost afterthat .
The vast majority of the 14,500 NASA and contractor employees at KSC work on the shuttle or spacestation programs .
Hale said he did n't expect significant job reductions at KSCduring the final years of the shuttle program .
" Most of the workforce , particularly at Kennedy Space Center , is going to stay on the shuttlepayroll until the day the wheels stop on the last orbiter , " he said .
" I think there aremore jobs than we have people to fill them right now .
That 's my observation .
Soif you are worried about finding work , I would say you are worried about thewrong thing . "

I 'm a 27 - year - old programmer .
When I 'm 55 - - in 2031 -- I want to still be a programmer .
And in 2031 , I want to love my job as much as I do today .
What will 2031 look like ?
Right now , two groups are offering their visions for the future : Microsoft and the open source movement .
A third group is conspicuously silent : small , independent developers .
What do the Microsoft and open source futures look like ?
Will the independent developers speak up ?
Which future should I fight for ?
My choices , and the choices of hundreds of thousands of people like me , will help determine which future we get .
So let 's take a look and start talking .
The Microsoft Future
Microsoft offers me a single , unified platform for writing software , with officially blessed tools and technologies : Visual Studio , C++ , C# , Microsoft SQL Server .
Having a single , dominant operating system is not a bad thing : I only have to write my software once , and I can sell it to a billion people .
No porting , no lowest - common - denominator , and no hard choices about what to support .
And once .NET destroys Delphi , all my development tools will come from Microsoft .
So where do I fit in this future ?
I 'll need to get an MSCE certificate , which says that Microsoft approves of me .
I 'll build my software by plugging together components .
Instead of spending three days writing a library , I 'll buy it off the shelf for $ 200 dollars ( a good deal , if it works ) .
Every five years , I 'll throw away all my skills and prepare for the next generation of technology .
If I want , I can make good money by writing libraries for other developers , or by plugging together libraries to build in - house business applications .
OK , that sounds boring .
What if I 've got a great new idea , and I want to change the world ?
I can always start a software company .
I can make a great product , sell it to users , make a fortune , and retire to a sunny island somewhere .
Well , this is the traditional theory , and it used to work .
But the dead and dying carcasses of Netscape , Borland , and a hundred minor ISVs suggest that if I succeed , Microsoft will offer to buy me out .
And if I do n't sell my company , Microsoft will crush me .
Parents will whisper my story in the dead of night to scare their children .
I guess I could take my good idea to Microsoft .
There , at least , I could change the world .
If I 'm good , a hundred million people will use my software .
( As one of my Microsoft friends used to say : " Join me , Luke .
Together , we can rule the galaxy . " )
That 's not so bad .
But if only people at Microsoft can innovate , there wo n't be any innovation .
All of Microsoft 's truly great software -- Word , Excel , Windows , Internet Explorer and C# -- was created when Microsoft 's platform was threatened .
Now , Word are Excel languishing .
Each version of Windows looks like the one before .
Internet Explorer is moribund .
And C# is unlikely to improve much if Delphi and Java die .
And as Microsoft 's competitors die off , Microsoft will squeeze everybody harder and harder .
We 'll all be forced to switch to a subscription model , and to pay for our software again and again .
Our computers will include unbreakable Digital Rights Management -- which means that our computers will serve Hollywood and Microsoft , and not us .
And if Microsoft 's hand gets too heavy , our only hope will be government regulation of software .
The Microsoft future can only end in two ways :
The grey death of total platform monopoly , or the sucking pit of government regulation .
I do n't want either choice when I'm 55 .
The Open Source Future
If I listen to Linus Torvalds , Eric Raymond , and Richard Stallman , they 'll tell me I have another choice .
Linux , open source software and the GNU Project are -- combined -- the single biggest threat to Microsoft .
The open source movement has hundreds of thousands of developers , millions of dedicated supporters , and a shocking rate of improvement .
Open source software can't compete in every market today , but it 's moving a lot faster than the competition .
Open source is hard to kill , because it 's hydra - headed , and because it 's probably an undead creature risen from the grave of Unix .
OK , OK .
Open source software is also a warm and fuzzy attempt to liberate humanity from evil platform vendors , and a libertarian - approved technique for cutting your corporate bottom line .
But will open source software let me make money and have fun ?
Let 's ask the experts .
Richard Stallman , founder of the Free Software movement :
Restricting copying is not the only basis for business in software .
It is the most common basis because it brings in the most money .
If it were prohibited , or rejected by the customer , software business would move to other bases of organization which are now used less often .
There are always numerous ways to organize any kind of business .
Probably programming will not be as lucrative on the new basis as it is now .
But that is not an argument against the change .
Eric Raymond , the leading philosopher of the open source movement :
Open source turns software into a service industry .
Service - provider firms ( think of medical and legal practices ) can't be scaled up by injecting more capital into them ; those that try only scale up their fixed costs , overshoot their revenue base , and starve to death .
The choices come down to singing for your supper ( getting paid through tips and donations ) , running a corner shop ( a small , low - overhead service business ) , or finding a wealthy patron ( some large firm that needs to use and modify open - source software for its business purposes ) .
I 've been thinking about open source software for the past six years , and I think Eric Raymond is right .
Tipping seems unlikely to catch on , so I can either run " a small , low - overhead service business " ( translation : I can write custom business applications as a consultant , which I did in 2000 - 2001 ) , or I can enhance open source software for a large employer ( which is what I do right now ) .
These options are n't sexy -- and they wo n't make me filthy rich -- but the pay is n't bad , and I do have some fun .
( In my current job , I get to hack on multimedia software , 3D game engines , and advanced programming languages . )
What if I have a great idea , and I want to change the world ?
I can work on my great idea during nights and weekends .
Once I get something working , I can recruit volunteers -- which is the most fun a programmer can have , I think .
And if our work is good enough , we can improve the lives of a hundred million people , write a book for O'Reilly and someday get paid to improve our creation .
The open source future is lacking in entrepreneurial zest and multi-million dollar fortunes .
But it 's a lot more appealing than the Microsoft vision .
I think I could live with the open source future when I'm 55 .
The Missing Future
But there 's one group we have n't heard from yet :
The small software developers .
For 25 years , these people were the lifeblood of the personal computer revolution .
Their old vision is still the sexiest : Build great , innovative software , sell it to the users at a reasonable price , make millions of dollars , benefit humanity , retire young .
And if you mistreat your users , you 'll loose them , because you have a hundred competitors .
The old Silicon Valley was built on this dream , and it worked for two decades .
But this dream is nearly gone .
It 's getting crushed between the awful power of Microsoft , and the onrushing juggernaut of open source .
A 30 - person company can't compete with Microsoft .
And a 30 - person company will have a hard time competing with 300 open source contributors giving software away for free and making their living as in - house developers ( though it can be done ) .
By itself , a 30 - person company is such a tiny force .
And each of these little companies is proudly independent , and each is too focused on destroying other little companies to see the giants all around them .
Individually , the little companies will be trampled upon , unseen .
They have no philosophers to speak for them , and nobody to defend their role .
The small companies offer me no visions .
They can't build platforms ; they can't challenge Microsoft , and if they keep squabbling with each other , they can't even create simple standards .
The press and the business world wo n't even look at their technology until after it has been co-opted by the big players .
If you want my support , and the support of others like me , propose a vision .
Show me you can co-operate , show me you can build platforms , and show me you can drive back Microsoft without becoming the next Microsoft .
Tell me a tale of 2031 , and what I 'll be doing when I'm 55 .
You may have allies in the open source world ( Richard Stallman will never like you , but Linus Torvalds may buy your software ) .
You may have allies in the press .
You may even have allies in big business .
But if you want to be anything other than niche players , you 're going to have to speak up .
The world is listening .
Responses .
Update on 31 Nov 2005 : Since I wrote this article , there 's been a great resurgence in small developers , both in the traditional ISV market and in new ( profitable ) software - as - a - service markets .
And Paul Graham has lately been writing eloquently about startups .
Since 9/11 , 283 World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers have been diagnosed with cancer , and 33 of them have died of cancer , says a lawyer for the ailing responders .
David Worby , a lawyer for 8,000 World Trade Center responders , including cops , firefighters and construction workers , said the cases blood - cell cancers such as leukemia , lymphoma , Hodgkin ’s and myeloma .
Doctors say the cancers can strike three to five years after exposure to toxins such as benzene , a cancer - causing chemical that permeated the WTC site from burning jet fuel .
“ One in 150,000 white males under 40 would normally get the type of acute white blood - cell cancer that strikes a healthy detective , ” said Worby , whose first client was NYPD narcotics cop John Walcott , now 41 .
Walcott spent months at Ground Zero and the Fresh Kills landfill .
The father of three is fighting leukemia .
“ We have nearly 35 of these cancers in the family of 50,000 Ground Zero workers .
The odds of that occurring are one in hundreds of millions , ” Worby said .
Others suffer tumors of the tongue , throat , testicles , breast , bladder , kidney , colon , intestines , and lung , said Worby , of Worby , Groner , Edelman , & Napoli , Bern , which filed the class - action suit .
WTC workers who have died of cancer include paramedic Deborah Reeve , 41 ( mesothelioma ) ; NYPD Officer Ronald Weintraub , 43 ( bile - duct cancer ) ; and Stephen “ Rak ” Yurek , 46 , a Port Authority emergency technician ( brain cancer ) .
The families say they were healthy before 9/11 .
Dr. Robin Herbert , a director of WTC medical monitoring at Mount Sinai Hospital , said some of the nearly 16,000 responders screened to date are getting cancer .
“ We do not know at this point if they are WTC - related , but some are unusual cancers we see as red flags , ” Herbert said .
Dr. Iris Udasin , principal investigator for the Mount Sinai screening of 500 in New Jersey , said the 9/11 link is “ certainly a possibility , ” she said .
“ It ’s what we worry about , and what we fear . ”
Will ATI Deliver The R600 In May ?
It has been a really long wait for the ATI R600 VPU .
Delayed time and time again , even ATI 's staunchest fans are beginning to wonder if the R600 will ever see the light of day .
Yes , even though these fans may vehemently denied it , deep in their hearts lurks a nagging feeling that the R600 was beginning to feel like another Duke Nukem Forever .
In fact , when we poked fun at the R600 earlier this month , many ATI fans actually rejoiced ; triumphant that their long wait had not been in vain , and that AMD and ATI had intentionally delayed it to deliver their killing stroke in the form of the Excellon and RenderX chips .
Does that read like a bad kungfu movie ?
Well , it does but many ATI fans still tried to pre-order those chips !
Evidently , they have been waiting for the R600 way too long ...
But ATI may now be quite close to a final launch date .
Although yours truly is not privy to ATI 's secret plans , we do know that ATI has invited a bunch of tech journalists to an R600 Tech Day in Sunnyvale , California from April 26 - 27 .
There , ATI intends to demonstrate the R600 to those fortunate few .
Does this mean that the R600 will be released in May ?
Well , we heard that ATI intends to launch it somewhere in the middle of May , with some giving May 14th as a tentative date , but that 's just another rumour in a long line of rumours .
Given the fact that ATI has not been shy in postponing the launch of the R600 on numerous occasions , it 's not inconceivable they will do it again .
Although we will not be in Sunnyvale for the event , we wish those journalists all the best .
We hope they come back from ATI 's HQ packing some review samples .
That would be a clear sign that ATI is ready to launch sometime in May .
Since it 's a two - day event and AMD / ATI is actually flying them all the way to California , it 's very likely a serious pre-launch affair , and not just another preview .
So , watch out for news on the ATI R600 on April 28 , or perhaps even as early as April 26 or 27 .
If this is merely another show - and - tell session , then tech publications invited to the event will be posting what they learned at the R600 Tech Day .
If so , we probably wo n't be see the R600 launched until June or July .
But if there is nothing but silence on April 28 , then you know they are all under NDA and ATI will be launching the R600 very soon .
Middle of May would be a good time , giving these lucky websites a shot at some serious test sessions before launch date .
So , it 's going to a pretty tense weekend as we wait to see which way the dice fall .
It 's Confirmed !
Okay , we can more or less confirm that the ATI R600 will see the light of day on May 14th , 2007 !
Yes , it 's FINALLY going to be launched for real !
Will it be the GeForce 8800 killer that ATI has been saying it is ?
Or will NVIDIA have something up their sleeves to spoil ATI 's fun ?
We can't say more but May is going to be a month of interesting thrusts and parries by NVIDIA and ATI .
Keep a close eye on Tech ARP when May begins .
We are going to have some juicy stuff for you guys then !

WASHINGTON —
If we are what we eat and we eat what is advertised , then American children are facing death by junk food .
Half of all the advertising time on children ’s television shows is devoted to food ads , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study of food advertising aimed at kids .
And what do the commercials pitch ?
Candy , cereal , fast - food and other restaurants , soda and other sweetened drinks .
Just as surely as the tobacco industry tried for years — and succeeded — in hooking young kids on its deadly weed , the food industry is spending billions to advertise products that will make the next generation look and live like its porky parents : overweight , and at great risk of debilitating disease and early deaths linked to obesity .
Concerned by the lack of publicly available information about food advertising to kids , the Kaiser foundation went well beyond the 40 to 50 hours of programming that had typically been reviewed in earlier studies and examined 1,600 hours of TV fare .
More important , the foundation reviewed all types of programs that children see — not just cartoons and other children ’s shows , but sitcoms , reality shows , movies and others that older children prefer .
The result is an alarming portrait of kids who are bombarded with precisely the opposite message about food and fitness than the one the government and the medical profession agree is needed for good health .
Children between ages 2 and 7 see 12 food ads per day — that ’s more than 4,000 per year .
Those in the next age group — the pre-adolescent “ tweens ” between 8 and 12 — see even more .
They ’re tuned in to 21 food ads every day , or more than 7,000 every year .
Teenagers see somewhat fewer ads , but even they will view 17 food ads a day .
The foods that star in the ads are n’t broccoli or even bread .
Kids are pitched a super - sized lineup of ads for candy and snack food , which account for 34 percent of food ads aimed at them .
Another third of the ads are for cereal — and not the low - sugar kind .
While young children might beg parents for Pop - Tarts instead of oatmeal , the apparent targeting of pre-adolescents is aimed at a group that is just beginning to get out on its own , have its own pocket money , and begin choosing what to eat .
“ The tweens are really a big target of food advertising , ” says Vicky Rideout , director of the Kaiser foundation ’s Program for the Study of Entertainment Media and Health .
And while a tween sees as many as 21 ads a day for sweets or sugary sodas , the same kid is exposed to only one public service announcement promoting fitness and health every two to three days .
“ There are very few of them on the air , ” Rideout says .
Baby boomer parents who remember Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit may not leap to concern .
But they might also recall those long after - school bike rides and endless afternoons of neighborhood kickball — not hour upon hour plopped in front of video games or the television .
The combination of saturation advertising for junk food and the sedentary lives that today ’s kids lead already has caused an unprecedented jump in childhood obesity — more than 30 percent of children between 6 and 11 are overweight and 15 percent are obese .
The diseases they develop , such as diabetes and high blood pressure , were n’t commonly seen in kids a generation ago .
Treating them already is costing insurers , employers and taxpayers billions .
It took more than four decades from the time of the earliest government warnings about tobacco ’s ill health effects to bring that industry under what is a minimal level of control — and even that came only after lawsuits , some of them still moving slowly through the courts .
The food industry should n’t follow this contentious path .
It must step up what are now only preliminary efforts to voluntarily change the content of the ads it produces for children .
Otherwise it too could stand accused of killing our kids for profit .
There ’s no way to sugarcoat that .

I got your cheese right here
THERE ARE TWO kinds of people in this nation : those who know about " Who Moved My Cheese ? " and those who do n't .
The people who know can produce long and sometimes angry monologues about it ; the people who do n't know are totally bewildered .
" This is real ? " they ask .
I aim to bridge the gap .
" Who Moved My Cheese ? " is a 97 - page book with large type and big margins .
It was written by Spencer Johnson , M.D. , in 1998 .
It costs $ 19.95 retail , indicating that Dr. Johnson , at least , has some notion as to the location of his cheese .
" Who Moved My Cheese ? " is much used in corporate settings .
Employees are ordered to read the book , to write reports about the book , to break into groups and discuss the book .
The principles of the book are referred to in meetings .
It is a huge hit among managers , and a huge pain for employees .
The heart of " Who Moved My Cheese " is a lengthy fable .
It concerns four characters , two mice named " Sniff " and " Scurry " and two " littlepeople " named " Hem " and " Haw . "
These " littlepeople " are just scaled - down humans .
All four of these characters operate in the same maze .
They seek cheese .
Then someone , some unseen hand , moves the cheese .
The mice sniff and scurry , you see , and find where the cheese has gotten to .
The littlepeople hem and haw ,
and therefore find themselves way behind in the search for the cheese .
Slowly ,
they learn how to find the cheese .
The author seems to think that " cheese " is a metaphor for " success in business , " but the employees forced to read the book know the truth : " Cheese " is a metaphor for " continued employment . "
Indeed , anecdotal evidence suggests that a flurry of cheese sessions often precedes layoffs .
So iconic has the book become , employees are judged on how well they handle the cheese seminars .
THERE IS
A perfectly good life lesson inside the cheese story : " All life is change . "
That 's four words , and they did not cost you $ 19.95 .
The problem with the book lies elsewhere .
Employees are encouraged to emulate the mice and / or learn from the travails of the littlepeople .
These are interesting choices of role models -- small and powerless things who forever run around a maze because they need cheese .
" Whining " and " complaining " are not encouraged .
They are taken as signs of a lack of spiritual growth .
The good mice sniff out the new location of the cheese and scurry toward it ; the bad littlepeople ask pointless questions and fail to seek the cheese aggressively .
Neither mice nor littlepeople are encouraged to ask why they are in a maze at all , or to question the task , or to consider that maybe running after cheese is a lame substitute for having a life , in a world with garlic fries and roast duck and peach pies .
AND THE EMPLOYEES get the message .
No matter how wrapped up in New Age jargon it is , the message is :
Ask only small questions .
Accept whatever you are told .
If it 's cheese day at the office , say " thank you " and give a nice cringing presentation about moving with the times .
And let go of that useless nostalgia for , say , times when everyone was on the medical plan , when the concept of " overtime " was meaningful , when memos made sense , when cowardly consultants were not creeping around figuring out whom to fire , when there was a leader in the company who welcomed challenges , had fun doing the job and did not need a dopey little book , because the job itself had meaning .
Reading " Who Moved My Cheese ? "
I was reminded of another book about " littlepeople " who were constantly required to survive in a mazelike environment characterized by cruel and arbitrary change , another place where the search for cheese was constant .
That book is " The Gulag Archipelago . "
Nothing really serious going on , just mice learning how to hack the maze .
It seems obvious that cities would want to switch the majority of their lights over to LED’s .
Not only do they last longer , but they use less energy as well .
This saves the city money both in energy and in labor time spent replacing bulbs .
I am not the only one that thinks so , the city of Raleigh , N.C. has recently started switching some of its city owned lights to LED’s .
[ Raleigh , N.C. ] , which is in the center of the state ’s tech hub , is conducting experiments to see if it can cut energy consumption and maintenance costs by replacing conventional public light fixtures with ones based around light - emitting diodes .
In December , Raleigh–in conjunction with LED manufacturer Cree–replaced high - pressure sodium lights in a downtown parking garage with LED lights .
Although the LED lamps cost substantially more than regular sodium lamps , they require less electricity and need to be replaced far less often .
Early projections indicate that the expense of retrofitting the garage ’s lighting system will get recovered in cost savings in two to three years , said Mayor Charles Meeker .
“ We are saving over 40 percent of the energy we would otherwise use , ” said Meeker ( via )
They go on to point out how much money they will save .
Next , Raleigh will kick off a pilot program with LED streetlights and will also seek funds to convert the city ’s other parking garages .
If all seven municipal parking lots in the city were retrofitted , it could save the city $ 100,000 a year in energy consumption and decreased maintenance , he said .
The lights in stadiums , gyms , schools , parks and other public venues could be next .
On Cape Cod , where I live , ten of the 15 towns retrofitted their stop lights in 2003 with LED ’s and have since saved a bunch .
The retrofit was put into motion by the Cape Light Compact , a regional energy efficiency agency that is in charge of regional energy policy .
The Cape Light Compact energy efficiency program for Cape Cod and Marthaâ€™s
Vineyard , will begin to help ten member towns – Barnstable , Bourne , Brewster , Dennis , Falmouth , Harwich ,
Orleans , Sandwich , Truro , and Yarmouth replace their energy - inefficient incandescent traffic signals with LED
( Light - Emitting Diode ) signals .
LEDs generally use 80 - 90 % less energy and last 10 times longer than
incandescents .
Additionally , incandescents last about a year before needing replacement while LEDs last
between seven and ten years .
Along with the reduced maintenance and replacement costs and annual energy
savings , the LED Traffic Signals provide a brighter and purer color that remains consistent , even in direct
sunlight .
With the retrofit project , the towns will not only save money and electricity , but will also provide a safer environment .
The entire cost of replacing the traffic signals will be paid by the Cape Light Compact RESULTS
Starting in late 2003 , over 900 traffic signals will be replaced in Cape Cod member towns with the more efficient
LEDs through a contract with Republic Electric East .
Each installation will displace an average of
330kWh per year .
The annual energy savings are approximately 300,000 kWh annually , equivalent to $ 37,000 .
With the rebates from Cape Light Compact , the measures and retrofit costs totaling over $ 114,000 will be fully
paid for by the Compact for the member towns .
The total cost savings over the lifetime of the fixture is estimated to be approximately $ 260,000 . ( via )
So lets take a look at that math .
Replacing the lights costs $ 114,000 , you save 37,000 dollars a year on energy cost , so that means that in about 3 years the improvement has paid for itself .
Not a bad option for cities that already have shrinking budgets .
Sure it costs a little more now , but in three years you have an extra 37,000 dollars in the budget you can use for something else .
The fight against global warming ( and ballooning city budgets ) is going to be one by the one - two punch of efficiency , and renewable energy .
Content analysis of O'Reilly 's rhetoric finds spin to be a ' factor '
Commentator uses name - calling more than once every seven seconds in ' Talking Points Memo '
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 2 , 2007
Editors "
This study , published in the academic journal Journalism Studies , was conducted and released without any involvement of any special interest group .
The researchers received no grant funding for this study .
Additional data , charts and the full text of the study are available online at https://journalism.indiana.edu/papers/oreilly.html.
BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
Bill O'Reilly may proclaim at the beginning of his program that viewers are entering the " No Spin Zone , " but a new study by Indiana University media researchers found that the Fox News personality consistently paints certain people and groups as villains and others as victims to present the world , as he sees it , through political rhetoric .
The IU researchers found that O'Reilly called a person or a group a derogatory name once every 6.8 seconds , on average , or nearly nine times every minute during the editorials that open his program each night .
" It 's obvious he 's very big into calling people names , and he 's very big into glittering generalities , " said Mike Conway , assistant professor in the IU School of Journalism .
" He 's not very subtle .
He 's going to call people names , or he 's going to paint something in a positive way , often without any real evidence to support that viewpoint . "
Maria Elizabeth Grabe , associate professor of telecommunications , added , " If one digs further into O'Reilly 's rhetoric , it becomes clear that he sets up a pretty simplistic battle between good and evil .
Our analysis points to very specific groups and people presented as good and evil . "
For their article in the spring issue of Journalism Studies , Conway , Grabe and Kevin Grieves , a doctoral student in journalism , studied six months worth , or 115 episodes , of O'Reilly 's " Talking Points Memo " editorials using propaganda analysis techniques made popular after World War I .
A 2005 Annenberg Public Policy Center survey found that while 30 percent of Americans viewed Washington Post and Watergate reporter Bob Woodward as a journalist , 40 percent of respondents considered O'Reilly to be a journalist .
" We chose Bill O'Reilly because he has one of the most powerful political voices in the media today , " Conway said .
" But we wanted to get beyond the left versus the right finger - pointing , which seems to dominate most of the discussion of O'Reilly and other media pundits . "
Grabe added , " The promo of his show as a No Spin Zone -- that 's where he opened the door for us . "
What the IU researchers found in their study , " Villains , Victims and Virtuous in Bill O'Reilly 's ' No Spin Zone ' : Revisiting World War Propaganda Techniques , " was that he was prone to inject fear into his commentaries and quick to resort to name - calling .
He also frequently assigned roles or attributes -- such as " villians " or downright " evil " -- to people and groups .
Using analysis techniques first developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis , Conway , Grabe and Grieves found that O'Reilly employed six of the seven propaganda devices nearly 13 times each minute in his editorials .
His editorials also are presented on his Web site and in his newspaper columns .
The seven propaganda devices include :
Name calling -- giving something a bad label to make the audience reject it without examining the evidence ;
Glittering generalities -- the opposite of name calling ;
Card stacking -- the selective use of facts and half - truths ;
Bandwagon -- appeals to the desire , common to most of us , to follow the crowd ;
Plain folks -- an attempt to convince an audience that they , and their ideas , are " of the people " ;
Transfer -- carries over the authority , sanction and prestige of something we respect or dispute to something the speaker would want us to accept ; and
Testimonials -- involving a respected ( or disrespected ) person endorsing or rejecting an idea or person .
The same techniques were used during the late 1930s to study another prominent voice in a war - era , Father Charles Coughlin .
His sermons evolved into a darker message of anti-Semitism and fascism , and he became a defender of Hitler and Mussolini .
In this study , O'Reilly is a heavier and less - nuanced user of the propaganda devices than Coughlin .
Among the findings :
Fear was used in more than half ( 52.4 percent ) of the commentaries , and O'Reilly almost never offered a resolution to the threat .
For example , in a commentary on " left - wing " media unfairly criticizing Attorney Gen.
Alberto Gonzales for his role in the Abu Ghraib scandal , O'Reilly considered this an example of America " slowly losing freedom and core values , " and added , " So what can be done ?
Unfortunately , not much . "
The researchers identified 22 groups of people that O'Reilly referenced in his commentaries , and while all 22 were described by O'Reilly as bad at some point , the people and groups most frequently labeled bad were the political left -- Americans as a group and the media ( except those media considered by O'Reilly to be on the right ) .
Left - leaning media ( 21.6 percent ) made up the largest portion of bad people / groups , and media without a clear political leaning was the second largest ( 12.2 percent ) .
When it came to evil people and groups , illegal aliens ( 26.8 percent ) and terrorists ( 21.4 percent ) were the largest groups .
O'Reilly never presented the political left , politicians / government officials not associated with a political party , left - leaning media , illegal aliens , criminals and terrorists as victims .
" Thus , politicians and media , particularly of the left - leaning persuasion , are in the company of illegal aliens , criminals , terrorists -- never vulnerable to villainous forces and undeserving of empathy , " the authors concluded .
According to O'Reilly , victims are those who were unfairly judged ( 40.5 percent ) , hurt physically ( 25.3 percent ) , undermined when they should be supported ( 20.3 percent ) and hurt by moral violations of others ( 10.1 percent ) .
Americans , the U.S. military and the Bush administration were the top victims in the data set , accounting for 68.3 percent of all victims .
One of O'Reilly 's common responses to charges of bias is to come up with one or two examples of " proof " that he is fair to all groups .
For example , in October 2005 , Dallas Morning News columnist Macarena Hernandez accused O'Reilly of treating the southern border " as the birth of all American ills . "
O'Reilly responded by showing a video clip in which he had called Mexican workers " good people . "
He called for a boycott of the newspaper if it did not retract Hernandez ' column .
" Our results show a consistent pattern of O'Reilly casting non-Americans in a negative light .
Both illegal aliens and foreigners were constructed as physical threats to the public and never featured in the role of victim or hero , " the authors concluded .
An earlier version of the study won a top faculty award from the Journalism Studies Division of the International Communication Association .
1 . Is the energy source sustainable ?
2 . What are the potential negative externalities of producing / using this energy source ?
3 . What is the EROEI ?
4 . Is it affordable ?
5 . Are there better alternatives ?
6 . Are there other special considerations ?
7 . In summary , are the advantages of the source large enough to justify any negative consequences ?
A question was once posed here :
What is the most important question concerning ethanol production ?
That got me to thinking about important questions regarding not only ethanol , but all of our energy sources .
There are a number of issues that we must carefully consider for any of our potential energy sources .
For the purposes of this essay , I want to focus on energy sources for transportation .
Let ’s look at some options , and get a better handle on why we have opted for the energy sources we presently use .
I will not cover all of the options .
In fact , nuclear , which is likely to play a bigger part in the future , is not discussed simply because I do n't know enough about it .
A few comments here , as some of the questions warrant additional comment .
With respect to sustainability , just because a fuel is not sustainable does not immediately disqualify it from consideration .
It just means that there must eventually be something else to take its place .
This could even be another unsustainable option , but these unsustainable options are unsustainable for a reason .
It would be preferable to move to something sustainable .
Likewise on the negative externalities .
There are negative externalities that we can tolerate , and some we can ’t , but most fall in between .
Is increased pollution a tolerable negative externality ?
It obviously depends on the level and type of pollution .
If the pollution level for a relatively benign substance goes from undetectable to barely detectable , that is probably an externality that we can live with .
Others are n’t so clear cut , but all need to be weighed against the perceived benefits .
The question of affordability is a really loaded question , as this will mean different things to different people .
Does affordability mean that I can commute in a Hummer 40 miles one way to work with minimal economic impact ?
Or does it mean that I can continue to drive my subcompact a few miles per week while still being able to afford food ?
These are issues that we can discuss .
Liquid Fossil Fuels
1. Clearly not sustainable .
2 . The potential negative externalities are many .
Among them are Global Warming , increased pollution , using our military to keep supply options open , and potentially enabling the earth to be populated beyond its carrying capacity .
3 . The energy return on fossil fuels is quite high .
Despite publications that have suggested that the energy return on fossil fuels is less than 1.0 , the actual energy return ( from oil in the ground to fuel in the tank ) is in the range of 6.0 – 7.0 .
That is , for 1 BTU of energy expended , at least 6 BTUs of fossil fuel can be extracted from the ground and processed into liquid fuels for a net of 5 BTUs .
4 . Yes , this is our most “ affordable ” energy option with respect to the price we pay at the pump .
5 . It depends on the definition of “ better . ”
If better means a cheap option that supplies the U.S. with the current level of energy consumption , then “ No . ” But I would define better such that the source is sustainable and negative externalities are minimized .
In that case , there are better alternatives , which will be covered .
6 . One special consideration here is the relying on fossil fuels puts our energy security squarely in the hands of the Middle East , an intolerable situation in my opinion .
7. No .
I did not break out GTL and CTL via Fischer - Tropsch separately , although perhaps I should have .
I have voiced my concerns about those in a previous essay - XTL : Promise and Peril .
Grain Ethanol
1 . Not sustainable .
2. Again , many potential negative externalities .
Among them are loss of topsoil , increased pollution from pesticide and herbicide runoff , aquifer depletion , and an increase in food prices due to increased grain demand ( a positive externality to those who farm ) .
3 . The energy return on grain ethanol is very low .
Published studies put this number at around 1.3 , but the return for fossil fuels in and ethanol out averages less than 1.1 .
Animal feed byproduct that is given a BTU value pushes the EROEI up to 1.3 .
Therefore , for 1 BTU of energy expended , less than 1.1 BTUs of ethanol can be produced , along with an additional 0.2 BTUs of animal feed .
The net is then 0.3 BTUs with the byproduct credit , or about 1/17th of the fossil fuel net .
4 . It is affordable , due to direct subsidies .
But based on the current spot price of ethanol , it is slightly over twice the cost of regular unleaded gasoline on a BTU equivalent basis .
5 . Yes .
Even staying within the ethanol category , there are better choices .
6 . The business of grain ethanol has revitalized many rural communities , and has made farming much more profitable .
However , it also encourages farmers to preferentially plant corn instead of less environmentally harmful crops .
The fossil fuel inputs into ethanol production are also largely non-liquid ( natural gas and coal ) .
In the case of natural gas , this makes a fine transportation fuel .
But some ethanol supporters correctly point out that we have lots of coal , and we could use that as our primary energy source for ethanol production .
Just do n't tell me it 's renewable in that case !
7. No .
Grain ethanol is not sustainable for primarily 2 reasons .
First , it involves a loss of topsoil , and in many areas a depletion of fossil aquifers .
The amount of topsoil loss has been subject to much debate , but it will vary based on many factors .
Some areas are certainly more sustainable than others .
The other concern is the high degree of embedded ( and unsustainable ) fossil fuels required for grain ethanol production .
This means that in addition to the direct negative externalities , you can add secondary negative externalities caused by the usage of the fossil fuels .
The pollution issue , in my opinion , is quite serious but is typically ignored by ethanol boosters .
This issue was discussed last year in an article in CorpWatch .
After discussing the “ carbon monoxide , methanol , toluene , and volatile organic compounds ” emitted by ethanol plants , the article addressed the issue of pollution caused by corn farming :
Modern corn hybrids require more nitrogen fertilizer , herbicides , and insecticides than any other crop , while causing the most extensive erosion of top soil .
Pesticide and fertilizer runoff from the vast expanses of corn in the U.S. prairies bleed into groundwater and rivers as far as the Gulf of Mexico .
The nitrogen runoff flowing into the Mississippi River has fostered a vast bloom of dead algae in the Gulf that starves fish and other aquatic life of oxygen .
To understand the hidden costs of corn - based ethanol requires factoring in " the huge , monstrous costs of cleaning up polluted water in the Mississippi River drainage basin and also trying to remedy the negative effects of poisoning the Gulf of Mexico , " says Tad Patzek of the University of California 's Civil and Environmental Engineering department .
" These are not abstract environmental effects , " Patzek asserts , " these are effects that impact the drinking water all over the Corn Belt , that impact also the poison that people ingest when they eat their food , from the various pesticides and herbicides . "
Corn farming substantially tops all crops in total application of pesticides , according to the US Department of Agriculture , and is the crop most likely to leach pesticides into drinking water .
While banned by the European Union , atrazine is the most heavily used herbicide in the United States - primarily applied to cornfields - and the EPA rates it as the second most common pesticide in drinking wells .
The EPA has set maximum safe levels of atrazine in drinking water at 3 parts per billion , but scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey have found up to 224 parts per billion in Midwestern streams and 2,300 parts per billion in Corn Belt irrigation reservoirs .
In my opinion , these are negative externalities just as serious as those posed by fossil fuel usage .
Yet this is the alternative that we are scaling up just as fast as we possibly can .
The real problem is that the negative externalities do n't directly and immediately impact most people 's lives , so they pay no heed to them .
Sure , increased ethanol production might cause atrazine levels in drinking wells to increase , but it 's in someone else 's water .
" It 's not my problem if it 's not in my water " is the attitude of most people .
But I doubt anyone personally affected by this is going to consider it an acceptable externality .
Sugarcane Ethanol
1. Sustainable , for reasons I outlined in this article .
2 . Few potential negative externalities to my knowledge .
I have heard mention that expanded sugarcane production will be at the expense of rain forest , but the sugarcane plantations in Brazil are not near the rain forests .
I do not know if rainforests in other tropical countries may be put in danger by expanded sugarcane production .
3 . The energy return on sugarcane ethanol appears to be in the 8/1 range , which would make it better than gasoline .
More on that below .
4 . It is affordable , but in the U.S. we punish Brazilian ethanol with a $ 0.54 / gallon tariff to protect our unsustainable corn ethanol production .
5 . For a liquid fuel that will fit in the current transportation infrastructure , I do n’t think sugarcane ethanol can be beaten with existing technology .
But it can't provide our current level of energy usage .
6 . The industry can provide an economic boost to tropical countries , where it is sorely needed .
7 . In my opinion , the advantages of sugarcane ethanol justify the costs , provided habitat is not being destroyed to grow more sugarcane .
I find it shameful that the U.S. subsidizes an unsustainable and polluting industry like grain ethanol , and punishes a sustainable industry like sugarcane ethanol .
Yet even with those tariffs in place , Brazil can still ship their ethanol to the U.S. and compete with homegrown corn ethanol prices .
The energy return on sugarcane ethanol as it has been calculated does appear to be in the 8/1 range , which would make it better than gasoline .
On the face of it , this seems absurd .
Nature has already done the major processing for fossil fuels , and turned ancient plant material into long - chain , energy dense compounds .
In the case of sugarcane ethanol , a lot of energy inputs are required , especially for purifying the ethanol , but those inputs are being satisfied by burning the sugarcane ethanol residues to produce process heat .
Therefore , they are not being counted against the energy output .
However , gasoline accounting is not done in this manner .
When oil is refined to liquid fuels , a lot of fuel gas is produced .
That fuel gas tends to be burned in the refinery to produce process heat , but I have still charged that against the energy balance I calculated above .
If I had done the energy accounting as is done with sugarcane ethanol , one could state that the energy return of gasoline is actually only the initial energy required to get the oil out of the ground , which averages about 17/1 worldwide .
The refining step would get a free pass , since the energy in the oil is ultimately used to refine the oil .
So no , the energy balance of sugarcane ethanol is not in fact better than that for gasoline .
Despite that , I believe sugarcane ethanol is a good option for mitigating a portion of our fossil fuel usage because it is renewable , and it lacks the negative externalities of fossil fuels .
However , our present usage is much too great to be offset with sugarcane ethanol alone .
Cellulosic Ethanol
1. Sustainable .
2 . Few potential negative externalities depending on the biomass source .
3. Unknown .
4 . Presently , despite frequently optimistic claims , it costs significantly more to produce cellulosic ethanol than to produce corn ethanol .
5 . Yes .
6 . There are numerous sources of biomass that could be used to produce cellulosic ethanol .
7 . Time will tell , but cellulosic ethanol did not just come onto the scene .
Researchers have been trying to commercialize it for many years without much success .
It will require several breakthroughs , none of which are certain to occur , before cellulosic ethanol contributes to our energy requirements .
Due to the lack of commercial cellulosic ethanol plants , the energy return is largely unknown .
On the one hand , fossil fuel inputs for growing the biomass will likely be much lower than for corn .
However , the ethanol concentration yielded from a cellulosic ethanol process tends to be significantly lower than the concentration obtained in a conventional ethanol production .
A presentation at last year 's St. Louis Renewable Energy Conference from Keith Collins , Chief Economist at the USDA , showed that corn ethanol yields 14 - 20 % ethanol , while cellulosic is a paltry 4 % .
That means a lot more energy for purification .
In addition , more processing steps are required .
I have seen EROEI estimates for cellulosic ethanol that range from less than 1 to greater than 8 .
Based on the factors mentioned here , the true estimate is likely to be closer to 1 .
But the truth is we just wo n't know until some commercial facilities are up and running .
I do n't discount that technical improvements will occur with cellulosic ethanol .
But many people who do n't understand the nature of the challenges ( or who have a vested interest not to ) have presumed technical breakthroughs of a practically magical nature .
If I announced that we would be making regular trips to Mars within 1o years , most people would reject this because they have some understanding of both the technical difficulty involved , and they understand that the costs would be enormous .
Yet those same people may have no problem believing that we are going to transition our fossil fuel infrastructure to a cellulosic ethanol infrastructure .
Yet the technical challenges involved are of the magnitude of ferrying us all back and forth to Mars .
Biodiesel
1 . It depends on the source .
2. Biodiesel in general suffers from far fewer negative externalities than most biofuels , but palm oil gets mixed reviews .
On the one hand , it is a tropical crop like sugarcane ethanol , and the EROEI appears to be very good .
On the other , rainforest is being destroyed to grow new palm oil plantations .
3 . By most accounts , the EROEI is greater than 3 , which is respectable for a biofuel .
4 . It is more expensive than conventional diesel .
Current subsidies make it affordable .
5. Biodiesel can be a sustainable contributor toward energy security .
6. Diesel engines are much more efficient than gasoline engines , which reduces the overall fuel requirement .
7. Again , it depends on the source .
If we are going to chop down rainforest to plant palm oil plantations , then no .
If we are going to use waste oils and existing high oil - yielding crops ( grown sustainably ) , then yes .
I think the U.S. made a mistake by not favoring the diesel engine over the gasoline engine as has been done in many other countries .
Diesels are much more efficient than gasoline engines , so a diesel fleet would stretch the fuel supply .
Biodiesel can be produced sustainably , but caution is warranted .
We first need to make sure that absolutely all of the waste vegetable oil in the country gets collected and turned into biodiesel .
But even growing crops for biodiesel may be done sustainably .
Biodiesel derived from soybeans , while expensive to produce , comes at a much lower environmental price and a much better EROEI than corn ethanol .
Then there is the added benefit of 1 ) .
A higher BTU value per gallon ; and 2 ) .
The higher efficiency of the diesel engine .
These factors combined mean that we would need less than half the biodiesel to drive the same amount of miles we could if using ethanol .
At this stage , I would put algal biodiesel in the same category as cellulosic ethanol : Technically feasible , sustainable , but it may not be commercially feasible .
Also as in the case of cellulosic ethanol , there is much hype but much of it is without merit at this time .
Magical technical breakthroughs are again being presumed as a given by many people .
I have even been guilty of this to some extent .
Biomass Gasification
1. Sustainable .
2. Care has to be taken with respect to the source used for gasification .
There are also potential air quality issues from a large - scale gasification program .
3 . I have not seen an EROEI calculation , but I expect it to be much higher than for cellulosic ethanol .
I would estimate an EROEI in the 6 - 10 range ( based on the method I use for calculating a fossil fuel EROEI ) .
4. Currently capital costs are too high to enable biomass gasification to compete .
5 . Biomass gasification has a chance to be a highly sustainable contributor toward our energy demands .
6. Biomass gasification could be used either to produce electricity ( e.g. , use biomass instead of coal in a power plant application ) or as the first step in a liquid - fuels program .
More below .
7. Yes .
I have described what I believe are the advantages of biomass gasification over cellulosic ethanol previously in Cellulosic Ethanol vs. Biomass Gasification .
Briefly , cellulosic ethanol converts a small portion of the available biomass .
Gasification converts all of it into syngas , which can then be used to make a wide variety of chemicals , including methanol , ethanol , or diesel .
The main problem with implementing a large scale biomass gasification is that it is presently just too expensive .
The capital costs associated with processing the biomass are very high .
Current estimates , which I documented in the afore - mentioned article , put the cost of a biomass gasification plant at about 7 times the per barrel cost of a conventional oil refinery or grain ethanol plant , and double the costs of a coal - to - liquids plant .
At some point we may be willing to pay these costs for our fuel , but it wo n't be until other options are largely exhausted .
Wind and Solar
1. Sustainable .
2 . Few potential negative externalities to my knowledge .
Wind turbines have been implicated in the deaths of some bats and birds , and there may be some increased pollution as a result of solar panel manufacture .
3 . The energy returns have been calculated in a number of different ways , but most sources show an energy balance more favorable than that of most liquid fuels .
4. Wind - generated electricity is affordable , but solar is still out of reach for the average person .
5 . For electricity generation , I think these are the best , most sustainable options .
6 . There are a number of special considerations for this option .
First , wide - spread electric transport – an absolute must in my opinion - is not yet a reality .
Battery technology still does n’t quite have the cost / benefit ratio that many consumers desire .
Also , if the U.S. moves toward more electric transportation a lot of infrastructure will need to be upgraded .
There are also currently issues with a shortage of silicon for making solar cells , which is keeping prices elevated .
Finally , there is the issue of intermittency for both of these sources .
Improvements in storage technology ( such as compressed air energy storage ) are needed .
7 . I believe that we need to move toward transportation electrification , which in my opinion would make wind and solar power more attractive options than any of the liquid fuel options ( with the possible exceptions of sugarcane ethanol and waste - derived biodiesel ) .
The potential advantages of a solar and wind - powered transport system are so great that our current infatuation with grain ethanol is a tremendous misallocation of resources .
My vision for the future would involve some solar panels on the vast majority of houses around the world providing the electricity to run our small PHEVs .
I truly believe this is the model that we will eventually implement .
Conservation
This essay would n't be complete without a discussion on conservation .
Consider that we could save more fuel , while stretching our budgets , by choosing to embrace conservation .
If we chose more fuel - efficient cars , slowed down , took fewer trips , and walked or rode a bike instead of driving , just think about the fuel we could save .
We would immediately reduce our dependence on the Middle East , because we just would n't need as much oil .
We would increase the chance that some combination of alternatives could supply a level of energy that would allow us to maintain a decent standard of living .
Yet in this rush to alternatives , conservation is typically given just a bit of lip service .
Our politicians will say " Ethanol , ethanol , ethanol , and yeah , we should conserve . "
But money is not being thrown at conservation .
Imagine if instead of spending over $ 2 billion a year in direct ethanol subsidies , we directed that money into conservation measures .
We could offer everyone in the country direct tax breaks for purchasing fuel efficient vehicles .
To me , such a policy would make a much greater contribution toward our energy independence than the policies we currently have in place .
I believe we have to demand that our political leaders put more emphasis on conservation as a piece of our energy puzzle .
And do n't give me Jevon 's Paradox .
If as a result of increased conservation in the U.S. , China happens to consume the energy we saved , that 's ultimately too bad for China .
We will have still reduced our energy dependence and taken a step toward sustainability .
When the full force of Peak Oil hits , those who have thrown out Jevon 's Paradox as a reason not to conserve will finally understand the foolishness of such reasoning .
What is going to matter is that we have a small energy footprint and are as sustainable as we can possibly be .
Throwing out Jevon 's Paradox as an argument that conservation is ultimately futile will never allow us to prepare for the effects of oil depletion on society .
When we are serious about attacking our energy dependence , we will go after the demand side .
I believe that a revenue neutral gas tax would seriously cut into our demand over time .
This is , of course , the main reason for Europe 's success in maintaining a much lower level of energy usage .
Such an approach works , and Europeans enjoy a nice standard of living .
Perhaps we will decide to take this proven approach for reducing consumption before declining oil production forces higher prices on us before we have time to prepare .
Computerized Etch A Sketch
Anyone who has tried to use an Etch A Sketch knows that a good deal of co-ordination is needed in order to draw anything but horizontal and vertical lines .
It quickly becomes obvious that a computer would be far better at controlling the horizontal and vertical knobs than a human .
Accordingly , I pulled the knobs off of an Etch A Sketch and attached it to two stepper motors which in turn are attached to the parallel port of a computer .
This gives one the ability to control the plotter 's movements with a mouse or joystick ( more intuitive interfaces than the knobs ) .
Having a computer in the loop also allows one to record what movements are done , so one can edit them and play them back .
This robotic device is also capable of erasing the Etch A Sketch by flipping the whole contraption upside down and tilting it back and forth .
The assembly has been carefully counterbalanced so that it only takes a tiny motor to flip it .
A pair of mercury switches let the computer know which way is up , so that the board can be rotated to the correct positions .
The framework is built from Meccano , though there are so few moving parts that it could have easily been made of wood .
The electronics are compactly built yet surprisingly complex .
A C version of the software allows for control using a serial mouse .
A Python version of the software allows for control using a USB joystick .
One of my goals is to draw fractals on the Etch A Sketch .
Legal statements required by Ohio Art :

Alcohol is not the only factor in the beer goggles formula
The drink - fuelled phenomenon is said to transform supposedly " ugly " people into beauties - until the morning after .
Researchers at Manchester University say while beauty is in the eye of the beer - holder , the amount of alcohol consumed is not the only factor .
Additional factors include the level of light in the pub or club , the drinker 's own eyesight and the room 's smokiness .
The distance between two people is also a factor .
KEY TO FORMULA
An = number of units of alcohol consumed S = smokiness of the room ( graded from 0 - 10 , where 0 clear air ; 10 extremely smoky ) L = luminance of ' person of interest ' ( candelas per square metre ; typically 1 pitch black ; 150 as seen in normal room lighting )
Vo = Snellen visual acuity ( 6/6 normal ; 6/12 just meets driving standard ) d = distance from ' person of interest ' ( metres ; 0.5 to 3 metres )
They all add up to make the aesthetically - challenged more attractive , according to the formula .
The formula can work out a final score , ranging from less than one - where there is no beer goggle effect - to more than 100 .
Nathan Efron , Professor of Clinical Optometry at the University of Manchester , said : " The beer goggles effect is n't solely dependent on how much alcohol a person consumes , there are other influencing factors at play too .
" For example , someone with normal vision , who has consumed five pints of beer and views a person 1.5 metres away in a fairly smoky and poorly lit room , will score 55 , which means they would suffer from a moderate beer goggle effect . "
The research was commissioned by eyecare firm Bausch & Lomb PureVision .
A poll showed that 68 % of people had regretted giving their phone number to someone to whom they later realised they were not attracted .
A formula rating of less than one means no effect .
Between one and 50 the person you would normally find unattractive appears less " visually offensive " .
Non-appealing people become suddenly attractive between 51 and 100 .
At more than 100 , someone not considered attractive looks like a super model .

Democratic Party / Republican National Committee
The Democratic party website uses XHTML 1.0 Transitional , CSS based layout , and runs Apache 2.x/ PHP 5
The Republican National Committee website uses HTML 4.01 Transitional ( though some xhtml - like self - closing < img / > and < input /> appear ) , table based layout , and runs Microsoft IIS 6.0 / ASP.NET 1.1.4322 .
Source on the homepage indicates :
< meta content = " Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 7.1 " name = " GENERATOR " / > < meta content = " C# " name = " CODE_LANGUAGE " / >
Note : Self closing added by myself due to technical limitations here .
They appear as “ > ” rather than “ / > ”
Perhaps all the above alludes to the idea of Democrats being more progressive , such as using open source php and Apache , xhtml ( since xhtml was supposed to be easier to parse due to it ’s relationship to xml … though that ’s debatable ) , and the newer css based layout technique .
The GOP on the other hand stuck with more traditional html4 and table based layouts .
Not sure what to make of the Microsoft use , but I guess some could link it to the United States decision to no longer seek breaking up the company during a Republican administration .
Ironically despite the contrasts here , the Democrats website is still showing 2006 as the copyright year , while Republicans updated to 2007 .
BEIRUT — Sheik Hassan Nasrallah ’s face filled the television above the bar , and the upscale , secular crowd at Lina ’s shushed itself into silence .
For 30 minutes , young and fashionable Beirut listened intently to his address , nodding from time to time and even applauding when the head of Hezbollah threatened to retaliate against Israel with strikes on Tel Aviv .
Before the war , or even in its early days , this well - heeled audience would have paid Sheik Nasrallah scant attention .
But after weeks of fighting , the leader has won over new supporters , far from his usual power base among Lebanon ’s poor and rural Shi’ite Muslims .
The development is especially troubling to Christians and Sunni Muslims who believe Hezbollah provoked an unnecessary and devastating war without the support of the government or the people .
Yet even among these communities , which have struggled to escape the political stranglehold of Hezbollah ’s close ally Syria , there is an undeniable admiration for the militia ’s monthlong stand against the Israeli Defense Forces .
“ Israel has proved it is an aggressive neighbor , and it ’s proven the logic of Hezbollah ’s resistance , ” said political analyst Amal Saad - Ghorayeb , a professor at the Lebanese American University in Beirut .
“ The resistance was the only capable source of confronting Israel .
No single Arab army has been able to win against Israel militarily . ”
Fawsi Issa is frightened by what he is seeing .
“ It alarms me , that they can do this , ” said the retired carpenter who lives in Ashrafiya , the Christian section of Beirut .
“ I do not like Israel , what they have done to us ?
But why did Hezbollah have to wake the beast ? ”
Hezbollah , which controls two Cabinet ministries and 14 of 128 seats in the parliament , has already leveraged its military strength into political power .
Although the government agreed after a five - hour session on Saturday to ratify a cease - fire , it was unable to agree yesterday on how to deploy the Lebanese Army along the border or to divest Hezbollah of its heavy weapons .
Mr. Issa and others like him say the government has been impotent during the crisis , unable to join the fight militarily and ineffective in securing international support to end it .
It has not even been able to help many of the hundreds of thousands displaced by the fighting , with most of the relief help coming from college students , Hezbollah affiliates and foreign organizations .
Most here expect Hezbollah will refuse to disarm , delaying or even derailing the deployment of an international stabilization force to buttress an expanded U.N. peacekeeping mission .
The right of resistance to Israeli occupation in the south or in the contested eastern hillsides called Shebaa Farms is enshrined in Lebanese law .
Hezbollah is unlikely to lay down its arms while Israeli soldiers still hold border towns and Marjeyoun .
A few weeks ago , the talk was of what would happen if Hezbollah was vanquished by Israel , its missiles destroyed and its supply lines compromised .
Some projected a civil war in which rival militias tried to cut into its turf and claim its mantle of resistance .
Today , the same people are talking about the problems posed by Hezbollah ’s increased popularity for other Arab nations , which have their own sectarian divisions and armed Islamic groups .
“ Hassan Nasrallah has won militarily and politically and has become a new leader like [ Gamal Abdel ] Nasser , ” Druze leader Walid Jumblatt , a harsh critic of Hezbollah ’s alliance with Iran and Syria , said in a television interview .
He was referring to the former Egyptian president , who became a hero to many Arabs with a failed attack on Israel in the Sinai Peninsula in 1967 .
Jordan , Egypt and Bahrain all joined Saudi Arabia in denouncing Hezbollah ’s “ unexpected , inappropriate and irresponsible acts ” in kidnapping two Israeli soldiers on July 12 .
But last week , they joined other Arab League powers at the United Nations in demanding changes in the original cease - fire resolution to make it more favorable to Lebanon .

April 10 , 2007  --
It was a simple letter , just more than 100 words on two pieces of paper .
But this singular document became one of the key pieces of evidence , the smoking gun , touted by the Bush administration to justify the invasion of Iraq .
It 's also the same piece of " evidence " that led to a perjury conviction for Vice President Dick Cheney 's former top aide , I. Lewis Libby .
The July 2000 letter , which was obtained from Italian intelligence services , appeared to be an official correspondence from the Niger government to the president of Iraq , confirming a deal to sell 500 tons of pure uranium to Iraq annually .
But if the CIA had done a simple Internet search on some of the terms used in the letter , the agency would have quickly learned that it was a forgery .
Instead , the letter was later cited by President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address as proof that Saddam Hussein was determined to build nuclear weapons , justifying a preemptive invasion of the country .
That revelation is one of the central themes of " The Italian Letter , " a new book by Washington Post editor Peter Eisner and journalist Knut Royce .
" That document has mistakes in it that are sufficient to show that it 's impossible that this operation could be real , " Eisner told ABCNEWS.com .
" Anybody , you or I , could have taken this and fact - checked this thing and we would have learned that this was nonsense .
We would have learned that the organization in the letterhead had n't been in existence for many years , that the person who signed it last served in that post in 1989 and that the court in Niger had been renamed in 1990 . "
If the CIA had done a Google search on the documents , it could have altered the course of history , according to Eisner and Royce .
Although the CIA was highly suspicious of the claims in the letter and did n't include it in a public white paper on Iraq 's WMD arsenal , the letter was included in a report from the agency 's Rome station .
That report was picked up by the Defense Intelligence Agency , which highlighted the erroneous claims about the agreement to sell 500 tons of uranium to Baghdad , and quickly caught the attention of Cheney .
But even if the letter had been sufficiently fact - checked , confirmation that the letter was a forgery might not have been enough to stop the administration 's determination to unseat Saddam , according to the author .
" The Bush administration was looking for a way to go to war , " Eisner said .
" And they were looking at every possible means to go to war . "
Some intelligence analysts are more skeptical about the ease with which the document could have been exposed and its potential impact on the path to war .
Anthony Cordesman , an ABC News consultant and the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , believes that the story told in " The Italian Letter " is accurate and that " some people knew early on that this was not authentic and that this should have been communicated to the highest levels . "
But he emphasizes that uncovering that the letter was a forgery might not have been as simple as a Google search .
" Most people ca n't detect a forgery , " Cordesman said .
" You are talking about a Third World country whose letterheads are uncertain at best .
It 's a country that many people do n't know very much about . "
And it 's very unlikely that the letter 's exposure could have stopped the drive to invade Iraq , he said .
" It would have been just one of many , many indicators that people were discounting -- it was used because it was there .
If it had not been in the presentation , it frankly would n't have mattered very much . "
The documents had been peddled by rogue Italian intelligence agents to fellow spies and journalists , including Elisabetta Burba , a reporter for the Italian magazine Panorama , according to Eisner and Royce .
After getting the documents from one - time security officer Rocco Martino , Burba found major flaws after 15 minutes of browsing the Internet .
When Bush cited the claims in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 28 , 2003 , Burba could n't believe his words .
" That was a story she 'd had and had n't written because she 'd determined the information it was based on was bogus , " according to the book .
Cheney 's role as a cheerleader for the war almost ended up toppling him , the authors say .
" Before the 2004 election , Karl Rove , the president 's powerful political adviser , privately sounded out social and fiscal conservative activists who were unhappy with America 's foreign adventurism , about the possibility of dumping Cheney as Bush 's running mate . "
The vice president soon found out about Rove 's secret conversations and he was not happy .
In the end , of course , Cheney stayed on the ticket .
The White House has denied this account in the past .
" This is ridiculous , " spokesman David Almacy told ABCNews.com .
So , who wrote the letter and why did the media seem to accept its claims ?
" Who wrote it ?
That 's still unclear , " Eisner said .
" What is clear is that there was a rogue operation within SISMI [ Italian military intelligence agency ] that produced this material .
There is a group of people inside SISMI running a secret safe house doing all kinds of operations and they 've only been willing to speak to parliamentary inquests in Italy . "
Although much of the mainstream media reported the explosive claims as fact , some TV outlets and newspapers expressed doubts .
" Many were sold a deal the same way that the administration did that to the Congress and to the American people , " Eisner said .
" The media loses some of its critical analysis in a run-up to war and instead there was a drumbeat -- the words ' mushroom cloud ' were used repeatedly , battering the airwaves . "
WASHINGTON , April 12 — The White House said today that it might be missing e-mails relating to the firing of eight United States attorneys , as lawmakers on Capitol Hill gave themselves the authority to subpoena more government documents and testimony linked to the controversy .
“ It ca n’t be ruled out , ” Scott Stanzel , the deputy White House press secretary , told reporters this morning when asked if some of the missing e-mails included those related to the dismissals .
At the same time , the Senate Judiciary Committee empowered its chairman , Senator Patrick J. Leahy , to serve subpoenas for documents that may explain the firings , and to compel testimony from Scott Jennings , a deputy political director in the White House whose e-mails , on a Republican National Committee account , have set off a separate inquiry into the use of political e-mail accounts for official government business .
On the Senate floor , Mr. Leahy was skeptical that the e-mails are indeed missing .
“ You ca n’t erase e-mails , not today , ” he said .
“ They ’ve gone through too many servers . ”
Math for the Masses
Odd as it may sound , I miss all the equations from my days in grad school , so I decided that what WordPress.com needed most was a hot , niche feature that maybe 17 people would use regularly :
For those that do n’t know , is a typesetting system particularly well suited for documents of a mathematical persuasion .
It ’s used almost exclusively by many technical , scientific and mathematical disciplines both in academia and industry .
It also looks really good ; I , among many , consider Donald E. Knuth a personal hero .
For those that do know , it ’s now ridiculously easy to include inline formulas in your blog posts .
The syntax is reminiscent of ‘s inline math mode : $ latex your - latex - code - here $ , and it allows you to produce most any equation .
For example , the following code
$ latex i\hbar\frac{\partial} { \partial t}\left| \Psi(t ) \right >=H\left| \Psi(t ) \right >$
yields
.
Pretty sweet , huh ?
To further whet your appetite , these few standards show a bit more about what ’s now possible on WordPress.com .
UPDATE : There ’s a new LaTeX on WordPress.com FAQ entry that describes the “ hidden ” size and color options .
HISTORY is perhaps on their side after all .
At their annual conference next month , delegates from 70 - odd Communist parties will be in a buoyant mood .
Memories of Soviet crimes are fading , America 's stock is falling and the injustices of global capitalism make an increasingly easy target .
Communists always had good songs .
Their political tunes of justice and solidarity may still sound hollow to some , but they now resonate more widely .
The comrades ' label has become remarkably elastic .
Some retain both a monopoly of power and a belief in socialism ( eg , Cuba ) ; some are dictatorial , but enthusiastic capitalists ( China , Vietnam ) .
Those that had a monopoly of power but lost it sometimes stay true to old beliefs ( like the Czech party ) .
Others have kept the name but dumped everything else ( Moldova 's Communists , uniquely for eastern Europe , regained power through the ballot box , promised to create another Cuba , and then turned pro-Europe and anti-Kremlin ) .
Another group spent much of their lives as the persecuted opposition to an undemocratic regime , and retain an aura of heroism as they operate out in the open ( South Africa , Iraq ) .
Lastly come those who have simply won a share of power in an established democracy ( Italy , India ) .
Without a Soviet Union to act as ideological enforcer , the communist tribe is more scattered than ever , and differences matter much less .
Boundaries that were once stark are now fuzzy .
India 's once - warring Communist parties are now electoral allies and coalition partners .
Babis Angourakis , the international officer of Greece 's party , the KKE , says that origins are no longer an issue : any party “ still fighting for a socialist transformation of society and defending the proletarian revolution described by Marx , Engels and Lenin ” is welcome at the annual gatherings that his party launched in 1998 .
Eurocommunists can rub shoulders with Stalinists who would once have called them traitors ; even different brands of Maoists turn up , ranging from the Chinese party to former admirers of Albania 's Enver Hoxha .
Friendship has its limits .
Nepal 's Maoists , who have taken power in large parts of the country after a lengthy rebellion , have little to do with their nominal mentors in China .
They will not be present at this year 's get - together ; other parties view their armed struggle with distaste .
One difficulty is which model to defend .
Almost all communists praise Cuba , the last outpost of what was once the Soviet empire .
But North Korea 's bizarre mixture of personality cult and paranoia is a harder sell : most defend it as a victim of American imperialism ; only a small minority insist that it is a workers ' paradise .
The world 's biggest communist country , China , looks like the sort of society Marx criticised , not the one that he wanted to create .
Libero Della Piana , the national organiser of America 's Communist Party , says dryly that the Chinese enthusiasm for profit “ is a source of discussion in the world movement ” .
But the biggest problem , history , is no longer such a vote - loser .
Many who lived in their shadow may regard the hammer and sickle as akin to the swastika , but elsewhere communism prompts not revulsion but an attractive frisson of naughtiness .
It is a good way of annoying conservatives , Atlanticists and plutocrats .
European communists such as Mr Angourakis are cock - a- hoop about their success in blunting an attempt by the centre - right parties in the European Parliament last year to equate communism with Nazism .
No more tradition 's chains shall bind us
In much of the former Soviet empire , relabelled former communists plus their intelligence officers and other henchmen hold power .
The Hungarian prime minister , Ferenc Gyurcsany , infuriates his anti-communist opponents ( who boycotted this week 's official commemoration of the 1956 uprising ) with his close family ties to the old Soviet - installed regime .
Nobody else seems to care .
Reuters
Give me that old - time religion
Some of that hold on power is fuelled by communist slush funds adeptly recycled into capitalist business .
Hundreds of millions of dollars of such money have been flooding into Romania and Bulgaria as they prepare to join the European Union .
“ They 're not stupid , these guys ” , says one Balkan security official .
“ They got the money out to Austria before they lost power .
And now they are sure that it will be a safe investment here , they are bringing it back again . ”
The most spectacular example of the erosion of the anti-communist taboo is in Italy , historically the home of the most powerful communists in an advanced economy .
No fewer than three parties with communist roots are part of Romano Prodi 's left - of - centre government .
Giorgio Napolitano , Italy 's president , and Massimo D'Alema , the foreign minister , were both leading members of the old Italian Communist Party .
Its Eurocommunist members mostly re-emerged as the Democrats of the Left , the biggest party in Mr Prodi 's coalition .
But two groups of hardliners are also in the government .
Communist Refoundation , the bigger of the two , got its best result for years in the parliamentary election in April , 7.2 % in the election to the Senate , giving it 27 seats out of 315 .
Its leader , Fausto Bertinotti , is a strikingly patrician figure ( a habitual feature of Italian proletarianism ) .
He successfully appealed to a generally leftist constituency of pacifists , anti-globalisers and gay and lesbian campaigners .
The party 's most flamboyant lawmaker is a transvestite actor and singer .
All very different from the puritan spirit of traditional communism .
The Refounded Communists have muscles to flex .
Mr Bertinotti took from the Democrats of the Left the speakership of the lower house , a post that brings prestige and influence over the parliamentary timetable .
Italy 's tax - and - spend budget shows his influence , as does the halt to privatisation , which would have hurt his core constituency of public - sector employees .
In South Africa , by contrast , leading members of the Communist Party have turned into stern fiscal conservatives in the African National Congress - led government .
But the rank and file , often active in the trade - union movement , is blocking labour - market reform , and chafing at an orthodox economic policy that it sees as too harsh on the poor and unemployed .
The party is threatening to stand on its own in future elections , an option that would look more realistic if the ANC were to split .
India 's two Communist parties are more powerful and more contradictory .
Both use communist symbolism , but in practice support the mixed economy and rule of law .
Their nationwide appeal means that they are an important electoral force at national level ; their block of 50 - odd seats forms a key part of the governing coalition led by the Congress party .
They also run three states : Kerala , Tripura and West Bengal .
This latter state has been ruled by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) for 29 years , with a remarkable mixture of strong party discipline and ruthless electoral tactics .
Traditional left - wing policies such as land reform have now been supplemented under the state 's chief minister , Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee , by a keen search for foreign investment , and support for privatisation — ideas that the party shuns at a national level .
Solid pragmatism in south Asia does little to excite the comrades in the wider world .
Mr Angourakis reserves his greatest enthusiasm for the onward march of radical leftism in South America .
In Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , once a hardline leader of the Soviet - backed Sandinista regime , is the favourite in the presidential election on November 5th .
Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez calls himself a “ 21st century socialist ” but is adored by communists round the world , and returns the favour with subsidies for Cuba and comrades elsewhere in Latin America , especially Nicaragua .
Mr Angourakis says prospects are at their brightest since the “ collapse ” of 1991 .
The fate of hundreds of millions of people has worsened since the “ counter - revolution ” of that year , he says .
Now the failure of “ imperialist wars ” in Afghanistan and Iraq creates new opportunities .
Hang on — the Iraqi and Afghan Communist parties were among the most determined foes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban respectively ; America 's invasion has put the Iraqi Communists in government .
But on another point , most communists are clear ; they eschew any alliance with jihadism or Islamic fundamentalism .
Such opportunism , says one true believer disdainfully , is only for Trotskyists .
A retired US judge is himself before the beak in Bristow , Oklahoma , " on charges he used a penis pump on himself in the courtroom while sitting in judgment of others " , AP reports .
The trial of Donald D Thompson , 59 , has reportedly provoked much courtroom merriment as the jury has been entertained by both a defence attorney and prosecutor indulging in " pantomime masturbation " and a former juror in Thompson 's court identifying the sound of the pump because " he had seen such devices in Austin Powers and Dead Man on Campus " .
A key witness in the trial has been former court reporter Lisa Foster .
In giving testimony , she " wiped away tears as she described tracing an unfamiliar ' sh - sh ' in the courtroom to her boss " .
Foster alleges that between 2001 and 2003 she saw the judge expose himself " at least 15 times " , adding : " I was really shocked and I was kind of scared because it was so bizarre . "
Foster further testified that during a 2002 trial , she heard the pump " during the emotional testimony of a murdered toddler 's grandfather " .
She continued : " The grandfather was getting real teary - eyed , and the judge was up there pumping on that pump .
It was sickening . "
Thompson 's pneumatic proceedings came to an end after a police officer heard the pump 's distinctive signature during a case , and photographed the device during a recess .
Thompson was charged with four counts of indecent exposure - each carrying a 10 - year maximum sentence - and faces the possible withdrawal of his substantial $ 7,489.91 a month pension if found guilty .
From the witness box , Thompson claimed the pump was " a gag gift from a longtime friend with whom he had joked about erectile dysfunction " .
He admitted keeping it under the bench or in his office , but denied he 'd ever used it .
He added : " In 20 - 20 hindsight , I should have thrown it away . "
Moments of light relief in the trial have included the aforementioned Austin Powers connection , offered by Daniel Greenwood , and expert witness Dr S Edward Dakil who " repeatedly prompted laughter " with his urology testimony .
When challenged by defense attorney Clark Brewster that the penis pump was " an out - of - date treatment for erectile dysfunction " , Dakil asserted : " I still use those . "
After a suitable pause , Brewster enquired : " Not you , personally ? " to which Dakil responded to jury laughter : " No. I recommend those as a urologist . " ®
Vox Day accuses Pajamas Media of taking Ron Paul ’s name out of their online Presidential Straw Poll because he was consistently beating all the other candidates and that was n’t too the liking of PM ’s conservative owners :
[ T ]he truth is that there are alternatives , genuine alternatives to the three - part multiple choice quiz , but the mainstream media is , as always , doing its best to prevent anyone from considering them .
And in their best freshmen - at - the - frat - house fashion , Pajamas Media is playing precisely the same game , as evidenced by their 2008 Pajamas Media Presidential Straw Poll .
PAJAMAS MEDIA PRESIDENTIAL STRAW POLL has officially begun .
Bill Richardson and Rudy Giuliani were again winners in the seventh week with over 70,000 votes now cast .
Barack Obama and Newt Gingrich ( undeclared ) were runners - up on the Democratic and Republican sides respectively .
What the headline fails to mention is that in the Feb.
19 Pajamas Media poll , Ron Paul , the Texas congressman and now a declared candidate for the Republican nomination , roundly defeated Rudy Giuliani , 43.1 percent to 20.1 percent .
Moreover , he did so by winning more votes , 1,769 , than Giuliani subsequently did in winning the Mar. 4 ( 1,431 ) and Mar. 11 polls ( 1,158 ) .
The innocent observer might wonder how Ron Paul could slip so much in three weeks that Giuliani could surpass him with fewer votes , or that a disgraced adulterer and non-candidate for president like Newt Gingrich could claim second place .
Did his actual declaration of his candidacy on Mar. 11 somehow inspire a backlash against him ?
No , the truth is much more simple .
Because they did n’t like the results , Pajamas Media simply dropped Ron Paul from the poll , while retaining the likes of George Pataki , Tommy Thompson and other no-hopers who are n’t even running for president !
Science snapshot : Early humans hunted , not hunters By Dan Vergano , USA TODAY WASHINGTON D.C. 
Hunting as the 9 - to - 5 job of early humans , striding off from the ole ' cave to clobber a mastadon for dinner , is a popular notion for explaining how people survived in prehistory .
But some anthropologists are suggesting that being hunted , rather than hunting , was the daily fare of humanity 's ancestors .
And they argue that trying not to be eaten played a significant role in human evolution .
At a presentation here at the American Anthropological Association 's annual meeting , anthropologist Donna Hart of the University of Missouri in St. Louis argued that fossil evidence and the experience today of monkeys and apes , the closest relatives to humans , " supports a ' Man , the Hunted ' theory of evolution . "
About 174 predators prey on these primates today all over the world , even the chimps ( which face leopords and lions ) and gorillas ( hunted by leopords ) that are most closely related to humans .
Looking at fossils of early humans more than a million years old , Hart and her colleague , Robert Sussman of Washington University , argue that numerous examples of skulls bearing bite marks , some the kind made by saber - toothed cats and leopards , show up from sites in Asia and Africa .
Further , the evidence for weapons — needed to hunt down that mastadon — and control of fire — needed to turn that mastodon into a meal — do n't turn up much later in the archaeological record .
Instead , as omnivores without teeth designed for cutting up prey , modern humanity 's ancestors likely spent a lot of time in large groups for protection .
And they likely used excess male members of the species as sentinels in an atmosphere of intense social cooperation , like other prey animals .
Rather than humans originating as the noble hunter of yore , our earliest ancestors probably spent a lot of time evolving into a creature that survived being on the run , they suggest .

For some a battle between science and religion is being fought for the soul of America .
The Creationists argue God created the world in six days and want their beliefs given equal status to evolutionary science .
Across the divide - evolutionist Scott with creationist Ham
For the rest , it is just 10 minutes from Cincinnati International Airport .
That is why it was picked as the site for a new museum , due to open in a couple of months .
We enter the landscaped grounds through gates flanked by wrought iron stegosaurs .
The lobby is modelled on a cliff in the Grand Canyon .
But this is no ordinary museum of science and geology .
It is the dream of Ken Ham , president of Answers in Genesis , a Christian ministry that promotes the idea that the Biblical book of Genesis should be taken literally in describing the creation of the world , life and humans as carried out by God over a six - day period a few thousand years ago .
We get as far as the museum bookshop - already well - stocked with creationist titles - but no further .
Officials tell us that state regulations forbid it .
It is still under construction and closed to visitors .
In the card game of creationism , the Bible trumps science every time
Eugenie Scott
Sharp teeth
So , it is round the back to the offices , to receive Ken Ham 's crushingly sincere handshake .
He came to the US from Australia 20 years ago , founded Answers in Genesis and never left .
He lectures or broadcasts almost daily and clearly has the charisma to raise $ 27 m ( £ 14 m ) for this ambitious museum .
He is also not afraid to show us what is inside , and turns on the animatronic dinosaurs .
Creationists say T. rex and the humans co-habited Earth
Most geologists would say humans and dinosaurs were separated by more than 60 million years .
And those dinosaurs have very sharp teeth !
" So do bears " , says Ken , " but they eat nuts and berries !
Remember , before the sin of Adam , the world was perfect .
All creatures were vegetarian . "
One of the dinosaurs lets out a rather contradictory roar .
Everyone is entitled to their beliefs , but what annoys Eugenie Scott is the way in which the received wisdom of Genesis is given equal or higher status to scientific evidence ; and the way in which the latter is used selectively .
" In the card game of creationism , the Bible trumps science every time , " she says .
But in her game , science is dealt a hand that is purely materialistic .
Ideas of a supernatural being belong in a different game , be it philosophy or theology .
" Steve Steve " the panda is intended as a parody
It is introduced to me as Professor Steve Steve .
Creationists are fond of lists of " scientists who doubt Darwin " .
Many thousands more support evolution , but rather than play the same game , Eugenie has parodied the lists by concentrating on scientists named Steve ( Stephanies are also eligible ) .
So far , more than 700 have signed up .
Their mascot is a panda because of a notorious creationist text entitled " Of Pandas and People " .
Steve was picked in honour of the late evolutionary biologist Stephen J Gould .
Steve Steve because - well , all pandas have double names .
Noah 's Ark
Much of the Creation Museum in Kentucky is still under construction and we were not able to go on to see the section through Noah 's Ark or the model of the Grand Canyon .
Instead , we visited the real thing - the Canyon , not the Ark !
For the creationists , Noah 's flood IS science
Not so , say " Young Earth " creationists .
All those rocks were deposited by flood waters at the time of Noah .
Though the Bible does not mention them directly , Ken Ham thinks there is no reason to suppose that dinosaurs were not still around at the time of the flood .
Indeed , he speculates that two of each may have been taken aboard the Ark ( newly hatched dinosaurs are quite small so fitting them in would not have been a problem ) .
And what about the animals from other continents ?
Did Noah sail to Australia to drop off the kangaroos ?
No , the flood waters lubricated a process called runaway subduction in which the continents subsequently drifted apart at a sprint !
Challenged with this scenario , a uniformed park guide says that , while everyone is entitled to their belief , he prefers to stick to accepted science .
For the creationists , Noah 's flood IS science .
For them , the Canyon is a gash in the surface of the Earth left by that flood , representing the wrath of God against the sins of mankind .
Here at least , sin and anger have turned into something surprisingly beautiful !

In Depth : Google Discloses Plans For Long - Awaited Office Suite , First Components Due This Week
Google will try to capitalize on collaboration options that Microsoft Office is lacking .
But Microsoft has its own plans to shore up the vulnerability .
For such sharp rivals , the contests between Google and Microsoft have been laughably lopsided .
Even as they jostle for users and software developers , Google has run away with the search traffic market while Microsoft has kept a lock on desktop software -- like they 're hardly even playing the same game .
That 's about to change , as Google readies a long - rumored push to assemble its E-mail , word processing , and spreadsheet apps into a Web - based suite that sounds more like Microsoft Office with each addition .
Google this week will launch Google Apps for Your Domain , a software bundle aimed at small and midsize companies .
The free , ad - supported package combines Google 's E-mail , calendar , and instant messaging with Web site creation software .
It will be hosted in Google 's data center , branded with customers ' domain names , and packaged with management tools for IT pros .
That 's the first step .
Later this year , Google plans to add its Writely word processor and Google Spreadsheets to the suite , build online collaboration features that work across its applications , and market the whole package to large companies for a fee .
Google will include IT - friendly features such as APIs , directory - server integration , guaranteed performance levels , and telephone tech support .
Advantages ?

Instead of trying to displace the hundreds of millions of copies of Office installed on business PCs , Google will try to snare users once they start sharing the Word and Excel files they 've created .
" The right way to view Writely and Google Spreadsheets , especially in the context of a larger business , is n't necessarily as a replacement for Word or Excel , " says Matt Glotzbach , head of enterprise products at Google .
" They 're the collaboration component of that . "
Collaboration , though , is exactly where Microsoft sees its best growth prospects for Office .
It plans to sell higher - priced versions of Office plus add - on servers with built - in collaboration features when it launches Office 2007 later this year .
Google 's plans include prompting people who send Microsoft Office documents using Gmail to translate those files into Google 's formats for editing on Google.com , presumably in a forum where ad space is up for sale .
Gmail messages that include attached files currently prompt users with links to download the documents or view them on the Web .
Glotzbach envisions a third link to edit the documents online and generate E - mail to other users in a group when the edits are done .
Writely can read files created by Microsoft Word , and Google Spreadsheets can read and create Excel files and formulas , though it 's unable to handle more complex Excel functions such as macros .
" That 's a brilliant idea , because it would allow them in a way to shanghai Microsoft 's corporate customers into the Google fold , " says Tim Bajarin , president of consulting company Creative Strategies .
Google is increasingly using its applications to entice Internet users to store more personal and business data on Google 's servers , Bajarin says .
There , the company can correlate the information with online advertisements users are most likely to click on .
It already does this with apps like Gmail and the Google Desktop search tool .
But there 's much room for expansion .
In June , it introduced the ability to store digital photos managed in Google 's desktop Picasa software on company servers .
Bajarin predicts hosted storage for digital music and other files can't be far off .
" Their goal is to be the hosted back end for your digital life , " he says .
" Microsoft will fight tooth and nail to keep this from happening to their corporate apps . "
Microsoft , Google , and other tech companies are racing to design tools that can uncouple data from PCs and store it on servers accessible by multiple users over the Web .
The trend is affecting everything from consumer software to the design of business applications .
Office 2007 , which has collaborative work at its center , could come out about the same time as Google 's full desktop suite , bringing with it new features for sharing Excel spreadsheets and other files in a way that does n't involve E- mailing them back and forth .
A showdown looms .
Collaboration Battle
Microsoft 's Office products generated $ 11.7 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30 and nearly $ 8.3 billion in profit .
The vast majority of sales came from the company 's core desktop suite .
Microsoft is trying to reap more revenue from Office - branded server software such as SharePoint Server for hosting project Web sites , and Live Communications Server for managing phone calls , E- mails , and instant messages from a common in - box .
Jeff Raikes , president of Microsoft 's business division , acknowledged at an analyst meeting last month that Google is " dabbling in Web - based productivity " and expanding its presence in corporate intranet search software .
Microsoft 's answer , he said , will be its upcoming Office SharePoint 2007 product .
Would - Be Desktop Kings
Many have tried , but Office still reigns Lotus Symphony
The follow - up to killer app 1 - 2 - 3 , this ' 80s package never took off WordPerfect
It lost the race to Word ; bought by Corel , it 's now a niche player StarOffice
Sun 's great open source hope , the commercial version of OpenOffice still is waiting for a breakthrough AppleWorks Apple 's own suite survives on Mac OS X , but its reach is narrow Web 2.0 startups
No strong suite has emerged ; Web - based word processor Writely , bought by Google , shows the potential
Microsoft sees the integration of features among its products , and the vast network of independent software vendors that sell add - ons to its software , as advantages .
For example , financial services companies that are heavy users of Excel have access to a niche market for plug - in applications that can analyze the performance of stocks , derivatives , and other securities .
The Office apps also include many more complementary features than Google 's software .
And they offer the ability to work offline -- a big drawback of Google 's applications , which need to be exported to Word or Excel to go local .
" The Google solution is what I 'd call patchwork , or Frankenstein , software , " says Tom Rizzo , a director for Office SharePoint Server at Microsoft .
" You have to put it all together yourself . "
Microsoft 's response to Google extends beyond Office , too .
Windows Vista , due in January , includes a new Windows Calendar that users of the same PC can share .
Under its Live brand of Internet software , Microsoft is developing an " Office calendar service " for business users who want to share their Outlook calendars on the Web .
Microsoft also plans to expand its Office Live Web software to become a central place for small and midsize companies to share documents and host online meetings .
A Microsoft Weak Spot
Make no mistake , Microsoft is vulnerable in collaboration offerings , where its Live software has been underwhelming and poorly marketed .
" That 's the place Microsoft 's weakest right now : co-developing document content , " says Michael Saucier , CEO of startup Transpara , which makes business intelligence software for handheld computers based on Excel , SQL Server , and other Microsoft products , and which is part of Microsoft 's ISV program .
" Google is ready to come out swinging at Microsoft with hosted apps , and they 're going right at the Live brand . "
Still , as long as people need Word and Excel to work offline , Microsoft has a huge advantage .
Google 's connectivity requirement presents a problem for mobile users .
Wireless broadband access is spotty and slow , and Wi-Fi - or WiMax - blanketed cities are years away at best .
Furthermore , business technology buyers could be reluctant to switch from standard Office software , even if Google 's products are marginally better at some functions .
That works in Microsoft 's favor as it ramps up its online software , Saucier says .
Plenty of companies , including IBM , Sun Microsystems , and a host of startups , have tried -- and failed - - to chip away at Microsoft 's imposing 95 % market share for productivity software .
But Google differs in a few important ways .
Its massive infrastructure of data centers could let it serve millions of users with little degradation in performance ( see story , Google Revealed : The IT Strategy That Makes It Work ) .
" We do n't see any ceiling " to the number of potential users of Apps for Your Domain , Glotzbach says .
A closed beta test of a more limited product , Gmail for Your Domain , has garnered hundreds of thousands of users since February , and Gmail serves tens of millions of ac- tive accounts .
Google 's computing capacity also could help it beat competitors on price and features -- Apps for Your Domain will include 2 Gbytes of storage , and the paid big - business version will likely include more .
What 's more , all the applications in Google 's suite are based on Ajax technology - - a combo of JavaScript and XML that makes their user interfaces nearly as snappy as applications that live on a PC 's hard drive .
Finally , Google is starting to assemble a roster of tech company partners that can get its apps more exposure -- taking a page from Microsoft 's playbook .
It 's paying Dell to preload its Google Desktop and Google Toolbar software on PCs , and Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in May that the company plans to pitch Google Desktop For Enterprises , which includes admin controls , to Dell 's small and midsize business customers .
Last fall , Google unveiled a deal with Sun to include its desktop toolbar with downloads of Java , though other elements of the agreement , such as Google 's agreement to promote Sun's OpenOffice suite , have yet to pan out .
In its latest deal , CRM vendor Salesforce.com last week unveiled the capability for its customers to create ads on Google and manage Google marketing campaigns from within their Salesforce environments .
The online service , initially priced at $ 300 a month , is powered by software from Kieden , a startup Salesforce bought last week that specializes in linking Salesforce and Google apps .
Salesforce 's AppExchange online software store also distributes Writely , which Google got when it acquired software company Upstartle in March .
Salesforce CEO
Marc Benioff says he 's lobbied Google to market Writely to business customers , and he says he 's demonstrated it to execs at General Motors , GE , and DuPont .
" They 're handicapped because they do n't have a way to market Writely into the enterprise , " says Benioff , who hopes to provide that market access .
The Office stronghold makes this Microsoft 's game to lose , but the company 's been slow to embrace the Web 's collaboration potential with the suite .
Google has proven it can deliver captivating , cutting - edge online software , but most of it has n't been tuned for business use .
Who can patch up their weak spots best ?
With the companies moving quickly toward the exact same turf , the coming collision will tell .

Sir Michael said the government had to admit defeat in Iraq
Gen Sir Michael
Rose also told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the US and the UK must " admit defeat " and stop fighting " a hopeless war " in Iraq .
Iraqi insurgents would not give in , he said .
" I do n't excuse them for some of the terrible things they do , but I do understand why they are resisting . "
The total number of UK troops killed in operations in Iraq stands at 147 .
' Admit defeat '
Sir Michael has written a book drawing similarities between the tactics of insurgents and George Washington 's men in America 's War of Independence .
He told Newsnight : " As Lord Chatham said , when he was speaking on the British presence in North America , he said ' if I was an American , as I am an Englishman , as long as one Englishman remained on American native soil , I would never , never , never lay down my arms ' .
It is the soldiers who have been telling me from the frontline that the war they have been fighting is a hopeless war
Gen Sir Michael Rose
" The Iraqi insurgents feel exactly the same way . "
He said it was time to bring troops home .
" It is the soldiers who have been telling me from the frontline that the war they have been fighting is a hopeless war , that they cannot possibly win it and the sooner we start talking politics and not military solutions , the sooner they will come home and their lives will be preserved . "
This meant the UK government would have to admit defeat , he added .
" The British admitted defeat in North America and the catastrophes that were predicted at the time never happened , " the ex-Bosnia UN chief said .
" The catastrophes that were predicted after Vietnam never happened .
" The same thing will occur after we leave Iraq . "
Youtube is foolishly heading towards using pre roll advertising .
I have my opinion on prerolls but I can’t wait to see the users revolt over this .
I sure as heck hope its user optional otherwise users will surely head somewhere else .
According to the BBC :
YouTube founder Chad Hurley confirmed to the BBC that his team was working on a revenue - sharing mechanism that would “ reward creativity ” .
The system would be rolled out in a couple of months , he said , and use a mixture of adverts , including short clips shown ahead of the actual film .
サンフランシスコ発--Sun Microsystems はJavaをオープンソース化する予定であり、あとはその方法を検討するだけだと、同社の幹部が米国時間5月16日に語った。
ここ数年間、オープンソース支持者らはSunにJavaプログラミング言語をオープンソース化するよう強く求めてきたが、互換性やコントロール権が失われるおそれがあるとして、同社はこれを固辞してきた。だがここへきて、SunはようやくJavaのオープンソース化を確約した。
Sunのソフトウェア部門の新たなエグゼクティブバイスプレジデントに就任したRich Green氏は、現地で同社が主催している開発者向けの年次カンファレンス「JavaOne」で、「現時点における問題点は、オープンソース化するか否かではなく、いかにオープンソース化するかということだ」と述べた。
ただし、従前からあった懸念が解消されたわけではないと、5月初旬にSunに再入社したGreen氏は釘を刺している。同氏によれば、Javaのオープンソース化を求める勢力と、互換性問題に不安を抱く一派の「2つの意見がせめぎ合っている」のが現状だという。「われわれは、こうした状態を収束していかねばならない」（Green氏）
Green氏は 、Sunの取り組みに関して、その期限や具体的な内容については明らかにしなかった。続いて、Sunの最高経営責任者（CEO）であるJonathan Schwartz氏が登壇し、Green氏と同様の発言をした際には、聴衆から歓声が上がった。「オープンソース化の是非ではなく、方法を検討する段階に入っている」と、Schwartz氏はあらためて宣言した。
JavaOneでの基調講演後に記者会見を開いたSchwartz氏とGreen氏からは、ほかにも情報を得ることができた。Green氏は、「あらゆる開発コミュニティが関係してくる取り組みになる。まるで上司が1人から数千人に増えたような気分だ。いずれにしろ、この取り組みは組織的に進めなければならない」と話した。
また、単純な仕事ではないので、いつまでに終わらせるといった期限は提示できないと同氏は述べた。Schwartz氏はこれに対し、「なるべく早く完了するよう努力する、という意味だ」と補足している。
Sunは 、JavaをOSI
（Open Source Initiative）ライセンスに基づいて公開することで、ユーザー数の増加が見込めると期待している。「少なくとも、JavaがOSIライセンスに準拠するまでは利用しないと決めていた人々を取り込むことができるだろう。OSIはJavaコミュニティの規模を拡大させる選択肢である」（Schwartz氏）
RedMonkのアナリストであ るJames Governor氏は、Schwartz氏の考えは的を射ていると話す。「信念の問題からJavaを利用しないという人々が存在しているなら、オープンソース化の意義は非常に大きいと言える」と同氏は指摘したが、Javaの企業ユーザーにとっては互換性が深刻な問題となるので、Sunは慎重に対応していかなければならないと述べた。
But this is not just President Ahmadinejad .
The antipathy goes back to colonial times , and the long and tortured history of British intervention in Iran .
This anti-British sentiment is shared by ordinary Iranians .
Its resonance defies boundaries of age , education , social class or political affiliation .
In the eyes of a broad cross-section of the population , Britain - as much , or even more than , the US - is the real enemy .
Four decades after the sun set on its imperial might , the Machiavellian instincts of the " old coloniser " are believed to be alive , well and still acting against the interests of Iran .
For every mishap - whether a bombing , rising living costs or simply the advent of an unpopular government - a hidden British hand is often thought to be at work .
I first became aware of this conviction 18 months ago on a visit to Ahvaz , capital of the south - western province of Khuzestan .
A bomb attack - the latest in a series - had killed six people in the city 's main street .
The incident seemed to be linked to Arab separatists in the mainly Arabic - speaking province , but the Iranian authorities blamed Britain , pointing to the British military presence across the border in southern Iraq .
Eulogists at public mourning ceremonies organised by the revolutionary guards railed against " criminal England " .
When I visited Ali Narimousayi , whose 20 - year - old daughter , Ghazaleh , had been blown up in the blast , it became clear that the message carried a wider currency .
" We know they want to come here and take our oil for free and we wo n't let them , " he said .
" Why is Britain so against our nuclear programme ?
Have we ever mistreated their ambassador or their people ?
What have we ever done to them ?
Go back to Britain and tell [ the politicians ] to be in good relations with Iran . "
This was not just grief talking .
When I expressed amazement to my Iranian mother - in - law at the belief in the existence of an omnipotent Britain , she smiled knowingly and said : " You are the masters and we are the servants . "
The view was evident in Tehran this week , despite low public awareness of the sailors ' plight ( partly because of the current no rouz ( ( new year ) ) holiday ) .
Shahim Nouri , 24 , working in an optician 's across from the British Council in Shariati Street , summed up the views of many affluent anti-regime Iranians .
" I 'm not old enough to know the history but everybody says Britain is behind the clerical regime .
If it is not behind the mullahs , it is definitely in a relationship with them , " he said .
Iranians ' belief in the power of the British is " psychological and cultural " , according to Issa Sakharhiz , a political analyst .
" Much of it stems from historical matters and the British role in third - world countries , especially Iran , over the past 100 years , " he says .
" It 's been reinforced by the closeness of Britain 's relationship with the US in the past two decades , particularly its involvement in the military occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan .
There are also lingering feelings over the western - backed war Saddam Hussein waged against Iran in the 1980s - the British were heavily involved in that .
In the past 20 years , these suspicions have been exaggerated because everybody knows the US is in the frontline working against the benefits of the third world countries and that Britain does n't have its previous power .
But that psychological and cultural relationship that Iranians have towards Britain and the belief that it is behind everything is very important .
It will take decades of quiet ( Anglo - Iranian ) relations to change it . "
Quiet has seldom been an apt description of the British relationship with Iran in modern times .
It started during the 19th century as Iran - along with Afghanistan - became a pawn in the imperial Great Game between Britain and Tsarist Russia .
The British sought successfully to use Iran as a buffer to bolster its position in India against the tsarist empire .
In doing so , however , they created an enmity supplanting the traditional Iranian fear and loathing of Russia .
Fuelling it was a quickly acquired habit of meddling in Iranian politics and a pattern of monopolising the country 's vital natural resources .
Relations quickly soured after a succession of monarchs - wanting to finance lavish courts - granted economic concessions to British entrepreneurs .
In 1872 , Nasser Al - din Shah granted Baron Paul Julius de Reuter - the founder of the Reuters news agency - exclusive rights over extensive parts of the economy , including railways , roads , tramways , irrigation works and all minerals except gold and silver .
In 1896 , the shah granted the forerunner of British Imperial Tobacco rights over the production , sale and export of Iranian tobacco .
The move triggered mass protests led by Iran 's Shia clergy and was supported by merchants in the bazaars .
Police fired on one demonstration in Tehran , killing several unarmed protesters .
Amid the outcry , the concession was cancelled , leaving Iran with its first foreign debt - £ 500,000 borrowed to compensate the British tobacco company - and a deep reservoir of anti-British feeling .
But the most important concession concerned a substance whose importance was lost on Iran 's rulers - oil .
In 1901 , William Knox D'Arcy , a London - based lawyer and businessman , was granted exploration rights in most of Iran 's oil fields for the princely sum of £ 20,000 .
It took several years for D'Arcy 's investment to bear fruit but when it did - after he struck oil in Masjid-e Suleiman in 1908 - its effect was enduring and fateful .
It turned out to be the world 's largest oil field to date and a year later , D'Arcy 's concession was merged into the Anglo - Persian Oil Company ( APOC ) .
In 1913 , with war clouds gathering in Europe , the British admiralty - under Winston Churchill - discarded coal in favour of oil to power its battleships .
To safeguard the decision , the government bought a 51 % stake in APOC .
The importance of oil - and Iran - in British imperial expansion was now explicit .
It was a priority of which Churchill , for one , would never lose sight .
For the next four decades , the oil company and Britain remained close to the heart of Iranian political and economic life and became twin sources of burning national resentment .
In 1921 , the British - seeking a strongman ruler to replace the teetering Qajar dynasty - threw its weight behind a charismatic colonel , Reza Khan , commander of the powerful Cossack brigades .
Within four years , Khan had seized power , anointed himself Reza Shah and instituted the Pahlavi monarchy .
With British acquiescence , he ushered in a reign of repressive modernisation which , among other things , outlawed women 's Islamic hijab and repressed the clergy .
He thus gave the religious establishment reason to suspect and detest Britain .
He did not , however , do Britain 's bidding .
During the 1930s , Reza Shah developed an admiration for Hitler and turned towards Germany , who had offered to build modern railways - an idea the British feared as a potential invasion route of India .
As a result , Britain invaded Iran in 1941 and occupied the southern half of its territory .
At the same time , it deposed Reza Shah and replaced him with his 21 - year - old son , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .
Despite his accession to the Peacock Throne , the young monarch never forgave his benefactors for their treatment of his father .
Neither did the monarchists loyal to Reza Shah .
Britain had alienated yet another sector of Iranian society .
Meanwhile , anger over the arrogant behaviour of the now - renamed Anglo - Iranian Oil Company - it later became BP - was leading inevitably to a fateful confrontation between Britain and Iran .
Resentment over Iran 's paltry share of company profits had festered for years .
In 1947 , out of an annual profit of £ 40 m , Iran received just £ 7 m .
Iranian anger was further fuelled by the treatment of oil - company workers who were restricted to low - paid menial jobs and kept in squalid living conditions , in contrast to the luxury in which their British masters lived .
Attempts at persuading the oil company to give Iran a bigger share of the profits and its workers a fairer deal proved fruitless .
The result was a standoff that created conditions ripe for a nationalist revolt .
Into this ferment walked Mohammad Mossadegh , a lawyer and leftwing secular nationalist politician fated to go down as perhaps Iranian history 's biggest martyr before British perfidy .
Mossadegh was elected prime minister in 1951 advocating a straightforward solution to the oil question - nationalisation .
It was a goal he carried out with single - minded zeal while lambasting the British imperialists in tones redolent of a later Iranian leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Within months , he had ordered the Iranian state to take over the oil company and expelled its British management and workers .
The company and the British government reacted furiously .
The Labour government of Clement Attlee imposed a naval blockade in the Gulf and asked the UN security council to condemn Iran .
Instead , the council embarrassingly came out in Iran 's favour .
Meanwhile , Mossadegh - who often did business in his pyjamas - embarked on an American tour in the naive belief that the US would back him against the British " colonisers " .
It was a serious misjudgment .
The oil company 's executives were clamouring for a coup to overthrow Mossadegh .
Attlee rebuffed the idea but when a Conservative government took office in October 1951 , led by Churchill , it fell on more sympathetic ears .
With British power in decline , however , Churchill was unable to mount such a venture alone .
American help would be needed .
The result was Operation Ajax , a CIA - MI6 putsch that co-opted a loose coalition of monarchists , nationalist generals , conservative mullahs and street thugs to overthrow Mossadegh .
With the economy teetering in the face of the British blockade , Mossadegh was ousted after several days of violent street clashes .
The shah , at that time a weak figure , had fled to Rome fearing the coup would fail .
When he heard the news of Mossadegh 's demise , he responded : " I knew they loved me . "
He subsequently returned to install a brutally repressive regime - maintained in power by the notorious Savak secret police - backed to the hilt by both America and Britain for the next 25 years .
The British remained loyal to the shah throughout the violent upheavals that presaged his own overthrow in January 1979 .
The Labour foreign secretary of the time , David Owen , gave the monarch vocal support even as millions took to the streets in Tehran to demand an end to the dictatorship .
Britain 's stance provoked a brief takeover of its Tehran embassy by opposition protesters in November 1978 .
The shah , however , was unconvinced .
In the final days of his reign , beleaguered and bewildered at the forces ranged against him , he told the US ambassador , William Sullivan , that he " detected the hand of the English " behind the demonstrations .
Sullivan could n't believe his ears but it is a view still held by royalists a generation later .
After the revolution , the Islamic authorities continued to draw on national resentment at more than a century of British interference , damning Britain as the " little Satan " ( the US was the " Great Satan " ) .
Such feelings were further fed by London 's support for Saddam Hussein during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war , despite Baghdad having started the war and subsequently resorting to chemical weapons .
London and Tehran were at loggerheads again in 1989 after the revolution 's spiritual leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , issued a fatwa ( religious edict ) sentencing the British author , Salman Rushdie , to death for blasphemy over his novel , The Satanic Verses .
The antipathy resurfaced most recently in June 2004 in an incident with uncanny parallels to the current stand - off .
Then , eight British sailors were seized and paraded blindfold on state TV after allegedly straying into Iranian waters in the Shatt al - Arab waterway , where the 15 currently in detention were intercepted and arrested last Friday .
On the previous occasion , the Britons were released following an apology from the foreign secretary at the time , Jack Straw .
The Anglo - American invasions of both Iraq and Afghanistan have once again brought British troops to Iran 's borders .
Although Iran opposed the invasion of Iraq , it gave the occupation forces few problems in the early years , as it built up its influence in the Shia areas controlled by Britain in the south .
That has all changed in the past year or so , as Iranian - backed militias have increasingly challenged the British occupation forces , both politically and militarily .
The British RAF personnel and marines in Iran 's captivity may well be oblivious to the long - accumulated resentments that have provided the backdrop to their detentions .
Perhaps they are learning something of this tortured history from their captors .
By James Helm
BBC Dublin correspondent
As a much - loved institution , it 's been imitated around the world , from San Francisco to Sydney , and plenty of places in between .
The Irish pub is alive and well .
In Ireland itself , once you have left the cities and headed into the green landscapes and small communities where agriculture is key , it is a different picture .
That trademark Irish venue , the country pub - renowned as a place to chat , have a pint , hear some music and soak up the atmosphere - is facing challenging times .
Recent figures suggest that many rural pubs are shutting their doors , their owners selling up and moving out .
One report put the figure at a pub closing every day .
In 2005 , almost 440 fewer pub licences were issued .
In the year up to November 2006 , more than 60 pubs shut down in two of the bigger counties - 20 in Clare , 42 in Cork .
Gradual decline
Pubs are privately run here , rather than being owned by big brewery chains .
Many have been passed down through generations of the same family , whose name appears on the front .
Dunne 's Bar in Stradbally , County Laois , has been in the family for nearly a century .
Richard Dunne took it over in 1980 .
It is one of four bars in this town of around 1,600 people , an hour 's drive west of Dublin .
The culture is changing in that there 's a drift towards people having parties at home , and maybe just having a few drinks at home at the weekend before going to the bigger towns
Richard Dunne Jr
Here , the decline has been gradual rather than sudden , but there were once nine pubs on the long main street .
Richard stresses that country pubs are much more than simply places to get a drink .
They are central to rural life .
" The whole ethos of the rural pub is not just from a drinking point of view , " he says .
" It was a place where people met , it was a place where people celebrated football games , where they celebrated weddings , where they came after funerals , where they came after births .
It was a way of life . "
In the early evening on a weekday in the main bar , seven or eight regulars are chatting with staff .
At weekends , and after local sports matches , the place would be far busier .
Richard says he has not struggled in the way that many of his colleagues are around the country have .
However , like many he cut back his opening hours .
Last year he bought a van so he can ferry home his regular customers late at night .
" I purchased an 8 - seater mini-bus and it allows me to bring my customers home in a 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - mile radius , " he says .
" I have basically guaranteed that if people come to the pub they will be able to get home safe and sound . "
Smoking ban
Publicans point to three main factors for dwindling trade in rural areas .
One is the smoking ban which was introduced three years ago .
While many , such as health campaigners , view it as a success , many pub owners say it has damaged their trade .
Then there are new drink - driving laws .
Random breath tests were introduced last year , allowing police to stop drivers at their discretion .
Publicans are keen to stress that they do not object to tighter drink - driving rules , and certainly do not condone driving under the influence .
Smoking was banned at pubs in the Irish Republic in 2004
But the new rule , they say , has meant fewer people going to the pub in remote areas , especially during the week .
Finally , habits are changing .
Much of the evidence here may be anecdotal , but it seems more young people are either buying alcohol at the off licence , or heading to the larger towns to smarter , bigger bars .
For some , perhaps , the attraction of the traditional old country pub is fading .
Richard 's son , Richard Junior , helps out part - time behind the bar , and he sees the trend .
" The culture is changing in that there 's a drift towards people having parties at home , and maybe just having a few drinks at home at the weekend before going to the bigger towns , " he says .
One plan is to use public money to fund a night - time transport network for country areas .
Supporters say such buses would help whole communities rather than just struggling pubs .
Joe Callanan is a politician and farmer from the west of Ireland , and he has researched the issue .
A non -drinker himself , he believes the night transport service is much - needed .
" This would n't be a ' boozer 's bus ' , " he says .
" It would be a bus to bring you anywhere at night , even if it's to the bingo or for a game of cards .
" I think it 's important that where the pub is a focal point it would be helped out by this rural transport . "
SEA OF LIES
The inside story of how an America naval vessel blundered into an attack on Iran Air 655 at the height of tensions during the Iran - Iraq War , and how the Pentagon tried to cover its tracks after 290 innocent civilians died .
Newsweek , July 13 , 1992
Exclusive --
On July 3 , 1988 , and American warship shot down an Iranian airliner , killing 290 civilians .
This is the true story of how it happened -- and how the Pentagon tried to cover up the tragic blunder .
The modern navy has many ladders .
Its officers can earn their stripes at sea or in the air .
They can prosper by navigating the shoals of technocracy .
But the one sure path to glory is the same as in the Roman times : victory at sea .
Sailing in harm 's way is a matter of vocation .
Capt .
Will Rogers III , USN , spent his career preparing for combat .
Winning his commission in December 1965 at the age of 27 , Rogers came late to the navy , but he made up for lost time with a gung - ho attitude and - after a spell on the staff of the chief of naval operations - friends in high places .
In 1987 , Rogers won command of the navy 's most prized high - tech warship , an Aegis cruiser .
The billion - dollar Vincennes seemed a sure ticket to flag rank .
But Rogers , who like many peacetime naval officers had never been under fire , longed to see action .
On July 3 , 1988 Captain Rogers got his wish .
He sought out and engaged the enemy in a sea battle in the Persian Gulf .
From the captain 's chair of a warship combat information center , he made life - and - death decisions in the heat of conflict .
It was the moment he had yearned and trained for , and it should have been the apex of his life in the service .
Only it was n't much of a battle .
Rogers had blundered into a murky , half - secret confrontation between the United States and Iran that the politicians did not want to declare and the top brass was not eager to wage .
The enemy was not a disciplined naval force but ragtag irregulars in lightly armed speedboats .
Fighting them with an Aegis cruiser was like shooting at rabbits with a radar - guided missile .
And when it was over , the only confirmed casualties were innocent civilians : 290 passengers and crew in an Iranian Airbus that Captain Rogers 's men mistook for an enemy warplane .
The destruction Iran Air Flight 655 was an appalling human tragedy .
It damaged America 's world standing .
It almost surely caused Iran to delay the release of the American hostages in Lebanon .
It may have given the mullahs a motive for revenge and provoked Tehran into playing a role in the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 .
For the navy , it was a professional disgrace .
The navy 's most expensive surface warship , designed to track and shoot down as many as 200 incoming missiles at once , had blown apart an innocent civilian airliner in its first time in combat .
What 's more , NEWSWEEK has learned , the Vincennes was inside Iranian territorial waters a the time of the shoot - down - in clear violation of international law .
The top Pentagon brass understood from the beginning that if the whole truth about the Vincennes came out , it would means months of humiliating headlines .
So the U.S. Navy did what all navies do after terrible blunders at sea : it told lies and handed out medals .
This is the story of a naval fiasco , of an overeager captain , panicked crewmen , and the cover - up that followed .
A NEWSWEEK investigation , joined by ABC News 's " Nightline , " encountered months of stone - walling by senior naval officers .
Some of the evasions were products of simple denial ; a number of the seamen and officers aboard the Vincennes that morning in July 1988 are still in therapy today , wrestling with guilt .
But the Pentagon 's official investigation into the incident , the Fogarty Report , is a pastiche of omissions , half - truths and outright deceptions .
It was a cover - up approved at the top , by Adm.
William Crowe , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Captain Rogers insisted to " Nightline " last week that he had made the " proper decision . "
He had opened fire only to protect his ship and crew , he said .
But drawing on declassified documents , videotapes and audiotapes from the ships involved in the incident , and well over 100 interviews , NEWSWEEK has pieced together an account that belies the skipper 's stoic defense .
It is almost a parable for an era of " limited " warfare , with its blurry rules of engagement and its lethal technology in frightened young hands .
It is as well an age - old story of hubris , of a warrior who wanted war too much .
A MURKY MORNING
At 6:33 local time on the Vincennes , on the morning of July 2 , the phone buzzed in Will Rogers 's cramped sleeping quarters .
The captain was shaving .
Already , just two hours after the sunrise , the 100 - degree heat of the sun was overwhelming the ship 's air - conditioning systems .
Fine - grained sand whipped across the gulf from the Arabian Desert , creating a yellowish haze .
Rogers picked up the phone .
It was the duty officer in the ship 's combat information center , the nerve center two decks below Rogers 's sea cabin : " Skipper , you better come down .
It sounds like the Montgomery has her nose in a beehive . "
Some 50 miles to the northeast , the U.S. Navy frigate Montgomery was coming through the western entrance of the Strait of Hormuz .
Everyday , tankers bearing half the world 's imported oil wend their way through the strait , only 32 miles wide at its choke point .
The Iran - Iraq War had turned the strait into a gauntlet .
Gunboats of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , based on the islands of Hengam and Abu Musa , had been attacking tankers and merchantmen bound to and from Kuwait , Iraq 's main ally in the war .
Anxious to keep Kuwait 's oil flowing , the United States had agreed to provide escort to Kuwait tankers registered under the U.S. flag .
On this July morning , the Montgomery spotted a half - dozen Revolutionary Guard launches venturing out from the island hideouts .
On this own , Rogers decided to enter the fray .
At 6:33 the Vincennes log records , he ordered " all ahead flank . "
The cruiser 's four massive gas - turbine engines cranked up to 80,000 horsepower and sent the warship smashing through the waves at 30 knots .
By 6:50 - according to the official version of events later offered by the navy - the Montgomery had spotted 13 Iranians gunboats in the strait .
Several were said be milling about near a Liberian tanker called the Stoval .
At 7:11 , the Montgomery reported hearing " five to seven " explosions coming from the vicinity of the tanker .
It was only when the radio crackled with the report of these mysterious explosions that the fleet headquarters in Bahrain thought to call the Vincennes .
Rear Admiral Anthony Less , the commander of the Joint Taskforce - Middle East , ordered the cruiser northeast to support the Montgomery .
The Bahrain command was n't interested in drawing the Vincennes into action , however .
Admiral Less merely wanted to dispatch the Vincennes 's helicopter on a reconnaissance mission .
So Capt .
Richard McKenna , Less 's chief of surface warfare , relayed what he thought were clear orders to Rogers : send your helo north to investigate , but keep your ship farther south , in case more boats emerge from the Revolutionary Guard base on Abu Musa .
At 7:22 , the Vincennes 's SH - 60B Seahawk helicopter lifted off and sped north ; within 20 minutes it was circling over the Iranian gunboats .
The pilot of Ocean Lord 25 , Lt. Mark Collier , found the gunboats hovering around a German cargo vessel , the Dhaulagiri .
They were n't shooting .
It was a common harassment tactic .
In Bahrain , as he listened to the radio traffic , Capt .
Richard Watkins , Admiral Lee 's chief of staff , decided that the situation was , as he later put it , " defusing . "
He left the flag plot to do some paperwork .
But aboard the Vincennes , things were just heating up .
With a blast of the klaxon , Rogers sent his crew to battle stations and ordered the small arms stations along the sides of his ship into readiness against small - craft attack .
The Vincennes had a dubious reputation inside the U.S. fleet in the gulf .
Officers on other ships sarcastically referred to the ship as " Robocruiser . "
In deskbound war games in San Diego , just before the Vincennes left for the gulf , Rogers consistently pushed beyond the exercise 's rules of engagement , according to another participant .
At a Subic Bay , Philippines , briefing on the rules of engagement in the Persian Gulf , the most senior officer attending from the Vincennes was a lieutenant .
In early June , Rogers infuriated Capt .
Roger Hattan , the commander of the frigate USS Sides , by ordering him to close in on an Iranian warship in a way he deemed provocative .
Hattan refused - and fleet headquarters in Bahrain backed him up .
By early July , Rogers was widely regarded as " trigger happy , " according to several high - ranking officers .
He was unquestionably eager to get at the gunboats trailing after the Mongtomery , Onward the Vincennes charges , past the German merchantman ( which nonchalantly flashed an " A - OK " signal ) until it drew abreast of the Montgomery at 8:38 .
By now Oman 's coast guard was on the radio , ordering the Revolutionary Guard boats to head home .
The Omanis wanted the Vincennes to leave , too .
" U.S. Navy warship , " an Omani officer intoned over the radio , " maneuvering at speeds up to 30 knots are not in accordance with innocent passage .
Please leave Omani water . "
By chance , a navy cameraman named Rudy Pahoyo was aboard the Vincennes that day , shooting videotape on the bridge .
His video captures the officers ' response to the Omani request .
They smirked at each other , and did not bother to reply .
The Omanis were n't the only ones who wanted the Vincennes out of the area .
At 8:40 , Captain McKenna in Bahrain returned to his command center and was startled to see that the Vincennes was on the top of the Omani peninsula - about 40 miles north from where he believed he had ordered Rogers to remain .
In some irritation , McKena called Rogers and asked what he was doing .
Rogers reported that he was supporting his helo , and that he'd been having communication problems .
Unimpressed , McKenna told him to head back toward Abu Musa .
" You want me to what ? "
Rogers bristled over the circuit , McKenna could hear chortles of laughter from the Vincennes combat information center .
Now angry , McKenna delivered a flat order : the Vincennes must come south - and the Montgomery too .
He was furious at the attitude of the captain and officers of the hotshot billion - dollar cruiser .
" Aegis arrogance , " he muttered to himself .
Rogers grudgingly obeyed the order - but he left his helo behind to watch the Iranian boats .
It was to be a fatal mistake .
In the cockpit of Ocean Lord 25 , pilot Mark Collier could not resist the temptation to follow the gunboats north , as they retreated toward their island lair .
He later explained that he wanted to drop down and see how many men were aboard the launches , and how they were armed .
He almost found out the hard way .
As he banked around them , Collier saw what he later describes as " eight to 10 bursts of light " and " sparks ... just a big spark " in the sky 100 yards from his helo .
He though for a moment it was the sun glinting off of a boat , but then he saw puffs of smoke .
" Did you see that ? "
Collier , called out to Petty Officer Scott Zilge .
" Yeah , " Zilge replied .
" Let 's get out of here .
That was an airburst - antiaircraft fire . "
As Colier dropped the helo to the safety of 100 feet , the aircraft 's commander , Lt. Roger Huff , sitting in the co-pilot 's seat , radioed the Vincennes : " Trinity Sword .
This is Ocean Lord 25 .
We 're taking fire .
Executing evasion . "
In the combat information center , this was all Rogers needed .
At last the gunboats had committed a hostile act .
Under the navy 's rules of engagement in the gulf , Rogers could order hot pursuit .
" General Quarters , " he snapped .
" Full power . "
Once again , the Vincennes forged north at 30 knots .
Meanwhile , some 200 miles to the southeast , on station just inside the mouth of the Gulf of Oman , lay the aircraft carrier USS Forestall .
In his flag plot , Rear Admiral Leighton ( Snuffy ) Smith , commander of Carrier Battle Group 6 , heard the Vincennes 's breathless news that its helo had been fired upon , and that the cruiser was pursuing the attackers .
At 9:14 , Smith ordered the launch of two F - 14 fighters and two A - 7 attack planes .
By 9:28 , they had blasted off from the carrier deck .
The planes were not to jump onto the fight : that was a sure recipe for " blue on blue " as the navy terms U.S. warships shooting down U.S. aircraft .
Rather the warplanes headed for Point Alpha , a rendezvous point 50 miles outside the Strait of Hormuz .
Once there , they would be less than 80 miles - seven minutes flying time - from the Vincennes .
But Rogers was not thinking about air support at that moment .
He was intent on the Iranian gunboats swirling ahead .
The task as not easy .
Aegis cruisers were not designed for small - craft battles .
They were built to take on the Soviet Navy in the North Atlantic .
The Aegis 's ultra -high tech radar system is designed to track scores of incoming missiles and aircraft in a major sea battle .
The Iranian launches were so small that as they bobbed on the swell , they flickered in and out of the Vincennes 's surface search radar , showing up not as separate targets but as a single symbol on the radar screen .
Impatiently , Rogers turned to his tactical action officer , Lt. Cmdr. Victor Guillory .
" Can the bridge see anything ? " he demand .
The bridge reported that it could occasionally glimpse the wakes of a few boats as flashes through the haze .
At 9:39 , still lacking a clear target , Rogers radioed fleet headquarters and announced his intention to open fire .
In Bahrain , Admiral Lee 's staff was uneasy .
Captain Watkins quizzed Rogers on his position and the bearing of the gunboats .
Finally , he asked " Are the contacts clearing the area ? "
The question could have been a show stopper .
Judging from later testimony , few in the Vincennes CIC that day believed that the ship was under attack .
In fact , the gunboats were just slowly milling about - evidently under the impression that they were safe in their own territorial waters .
Through the haze , it is doubtful that the low - slung launches could have seen the Vincennes .
Rogers , however , continued to argue for permission to shoot .
On the bridge , the lookouts reported that though their giant " Big Eyes " - they could see the launches ' wake more clearly now , turning randomly this way and that .
A couple seemed to be heading in the direction of the Vincennes .
For Rogers , that was enough .
He reported to Bahrain that he gunboats were gathering speed and showing hostile intent .
Again , he announced his intention to open fire .
Aboard his command ship , Less finally concurred .
The time was 9:41 .
On the bridge , the chief quartermaster had just called out that the Vincennes had now crossed the 12 - mile limit off the coast - into Iranians waters .
the Vincennes was operating in violation of international law , but Rogers was not paying attention to juridical niceties .
Commander Guillory ordered the Vincennes 's guns to fire when ready .
Two minutes later the ship 's five - inch gun opened up on its first target , a launch 8,000 yards away .
Some 25 miles to the east , aboard the frigate USS Sides , Capt .
David Carlson listened and watched Rogers 's maneuvering with mounting incredulity .
" Why does n't he just push his rudder over and get his ass out of there ? " muttered one of the frigate 's officers .
When Carlson heard Less assent to Rogers 's request to open fire , Carlson turned to his number two , Lt. Commander Gary Erickson , and gave two thumbs down .
Carlson thought there was going to be a massacre .
He had no idea .
FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER
Some 55 miles to the northeast , at precisely 9:45:30 , Iran Air Capt .
Mohsen Rezaian announced to the tower at Bandar Abbas airport that his A300B2 Airbus was ready for takeoff .
A minute later , he throttled up his two General Electric CF6 engines and lifted the airline into the haze .
His course would take the plane and its human cargo southwest to Dubai , in the United Arab Emirates .
Though Rezaian could not know it , his flight path would also go almost directly over the USS Vincennes .
At that moment Captain Rogers was sitting in his own cockpit - the darkened , windowless combat information center of the Vincennes , directing a sea battle by remote control .
To the uninitiated , the CIC of an Aegis cruiser looks like a luxury video arcade .
Rows of operators hunch over radio consoles , each monitoring one element of the battle .
All the information from their screens is then integrated by the mighty Aegis computer into , literally , the " big picture " - thrown up as symbols on maps displayed on four giant 42 - inch - by - 42 - inch screens at the head of the room where the captain and his two " battle mangers " sit .
The $ 400 million Aegis system can track every aircraft within 300 miles .
Its computers tag each contact with the symbol for " friendly , " " hostile " or " unidentified " ( chart , page 32 ) .
In war at sea , Aegis is expected to seek and identify all airborne threats to an entire carrier battle group , to display the speed and direction of each , and to rank them by the danger they present .
Aegis is so powerful that it can not only track up to 200 incoming enemy aircraft or missiles , but also command missiles to shoot them down .
In the full - scale war against the Soviet Union for which Aegis was designed , the captain and the crew would have had little choice but to switch the system to automatic - and duck .
In the cramped and ambiguous environment of the Persian gulf , however , Rogers chose to rely on his own judgment and the combat skills of his crew .
Those skills had never been tested .
Indeed , some experts question whether even the best - trained crew could handle , under stress , the torrent of data that Aegis would pour on them .
A 1988 Government Accounting Office report accused the navy of rigging Aegis sea trials by tipping the crews off to the precise nature the " threats " they were to face .
The navy could not afford to risk failure in the trails for fear that Congress would stop funding the Aegis program .
Some of the Vincennes 's most senior officers were less than adept at computerized warfare .
Under normal procedures , Captain Rogers rarely touched his console .
He could have delegated the battle against the launches to Guillory , his tactical officer for surface warfare .
But Rogers did n't entirely trust Guillory , a former personnel officer who was uncomfortable with computers ( His fellow officers in personnel snickered because , one said , instead of plotting job changes by computer spreadsheet , he used his computer screen as a surface for " self - stick " notes . )
In essence , the skipper pushed Guillory aside and ran the battle himself .
Rogers set the range on the " big picture " display screen in front of him to 16 miles , to focus on the gunboats .
He was oblivious to anything beyond .
At 9:47 , the Vincennes 's powerful Spy radar picked up a distant blip - a plane lifting off from the airport at Bander Abbas .
The blip was in fact Iran Air's Flight 655 on its twice - a- week milk run to Dubai .
But since Bander Abbas is a military as well as a civilian airport , any flights out over the gulf was automatically " tagged " by the navy ships as " assumed hostile . "
At his computer console in the Vincennes 's CIC , Petty Office Andrew Anderson saw the blip for an incoming bogey go up on one side of the big blue screens .
Anderson 's job in " Air Alley , " the row of operators who handled air warfare , was to identify any air traffic within range of the ship .
He told the Aegis system to query the incoming plane : Identify , Friend or Foe ?
By standard practice , all planes carry a transponder that automatically answers the IFF query with Mode 1 or 2 ( military ) , or Mode 3 ( civilian ) .
Anderson got a Mode 3 . " Commair " ( commercial airliner ) he figured .
He reached beside his console for the navy 's listing of commercial flights over the gulf .
But as he scanned the schedule , he missed Flight 655 .
Apparently , in the darkness of the CIC , its arc lights flickered every time the Vincennes 's five - inch gun fired off another round at the hapless Iranian gunboats , he was confused by the gulf 's four different time zones .
Anderson turned to the petty officer next to him in Air Alley , John Leach , and wondered aloud if the blip could be an Iranian warplane - an F - 4 or F - 14 perhaps ?
Their boss in Air Alley , Lt. Clay Zocher , overheard the two enlisted men talking , Zocher was already nervous .
He had stood on this watch only twice before during General Quarters and he'd never mastered the computer routines for his console .
He was worrying at the moment about an Iranian P - 3 patrol plane that was making its way down the Iranian coastline .
Could the P - 3 be coordinating an attack on the Vincennes with the unidentified bogey ?
Zocher decided to pass the chatter in Air Alley up the chain of command to his boss , Lt. Cmdr. Scott Lustig , the Vincennes ' tactical commander for air warfare .
Lustig ordered Zocher to flash the incoming plane a warning : " Unidentified aircraft ... You are approaching a United States naval warship in international waters . "
It was the standard challenge , broadcast over the international distress frequencies routinely monitored by military and commercial aircraft .
Briefly , Lustig considered another option .
On the display screen in front of him Lustig could see that the Forestall 's F - 14s where circling just five minutes away .
There was enough time - barely - to call them in to check out the bogey .
The Forestall , too , had seen the blip on its radar screens .
In the air , the F - 14 pilots were itching to close in ; a bogey out of Iran , heading for an American warship , are a rare opportunity for combat - hungry aviators .
Aboard the carrier , Admiral Smith held them off .
His staff was telling him that the blip was most likely a commercial airliner .
But Smith stuck to the navy rule that the captain on the spot makes the decisions .
He decided to let Rogers fight his own battle .
Aboard the Vincennes , it was now 9:49 .
Rogers was totally consumed with his fire fight against the gunboats .
He was shouting for the five - inch - gun crew to load faster , and ordered hard - right rudder to bring his stern gun to bear .
The ship shuddered and heeled to starboard .
Military theorists write about " friction " , the inevitability of error , accident and miscalculation in the stress of combat .
The architects of modern warfare have tried to use the technology to minimize battlefield blindness .
But the electronic babble in a combat information center can be just as confusing .
Officers and men communicate by headphones over several channels , with left and right ears usually listening to different circuits .
Rogers and his key officers in the CIC were all on the same circuit - but so was half of the ship .
Ingenious crewmen had discovered they could tap into the " command net " to hear the action over their Sony Walkmans .
But in so doing , they drained power and the volume faded .
Whenever it got too low , Lustig had to yell " Switch " so everyone could turn to an alternate command circuit .
Then the hackers would switch to that channel , too .
Over this erratic " net , " a few seconds after 9:50 , someone called out that the incoming plane was a " possible Astro " - the code word for an F - 14 .
No one was ever able to find out who .
In Air Alley , the operators thought the word came from the technicians in the ship 's electronic - warfare suite .
The technicians thought the warning came from Air Alley .
Galvanized by this warning , Petty Officer Anderson again beamed out an IFF query .
Ominously , the response he know got back was different .
Upon his console flashed Mode 2 : military aircraft .
Only much later did the investigators figure out that Anderson had forgotten to reset the range on his IFF device .
The Mode 2 did not come from the Airbus , climbing peacefully above the gulf , but from an Iranian military plane , probably a military transport , still on the runway back in Bander Abbas .
" Possible Astro ! " Anderson sang out , at a moment of near chaos in the CIC .
It was 9:51 .
Having swung full circle , Rogers was now bringing his reloaded forward gun to bear on the Iranian launches .
The gun fired off 11 rounds - and jammed .
The skipper again ordered the rudder hard over .
The stern swung around , and in the CIC , papers and books toppled of consoles as the ship heeled over .
At his station to Rogers 's left , Lustig looked at his screen .
The incoming plane was 32 miles away .
What do we do ?
he asked Rogers .
His commanding officer was not too overwhelmed by the Iranian speedboats to forget the woeful example of Capt .
Glenn Brindel , the skipper of the USS Stark .
A year earlier , Brindel had been in the head when his ship was struck and almost sunk by a pair of anti-ship missiles fired by the pilot of a lone Iraqi Mirage F - 1 .
Rogers decided that the Vincennes fire control radar would " paint " any possible hostile plane that got within 30 miles .
At 20 miles , the Vincennes would shoot it down .
Rogers was not absolutely sure that his ship did face an enemy warplane .
The plane seemed too high - some 7,000 feet - for an attack approach .
At his rear , another officer , Lt. William Mountford , warned " possible commair . "
Three more times , the warnings went out : " Iranian fighter ... you are steering into danger and are subject to United States naval defensive measures . "
Then something happened that psychologists call " scenario fulfillment " - you see what you expect .
Petty Officers Anderson and Leach both began singing out that the aircraft , now definitively tagged on the big screen as an F - 14 , was descending and picking up speed .
The tapes of the CIC 's data later showed no such thing .
Anderson 's screen showed that the plane was travelling 380 knots at 12,000 feet and climbing .
Yet Anderson was shouting out that the speed was 455 knots , the altitude 7,800 feet and descending .
Rogers had to make a decision .
An F - 14 could do little damage to the Vincennes .
The version that Washington sold to its ally the Shah of Iran in the early 1970's was purely a fighter plane , not configured to strike surface targets .
Still , if Rogers meant to attack it with a missile , he had to fire before the aircraft closed much within 10 miles .
At 9:54:05 , with the plane 11 miles away , Rogers reached up and switched the firing key to " free " the ship 's SM - 2 antiaircraft missiles .
In Air Alley , Zocher had been given the green light to fire .
The young lieutenant was so undone , however , that he pressed the wrong keys on his console 23 times .
A veteran petty officer had to lean over and hit the right ones .
In the CIC , the lights dimmed momentarily , like a prison 's during an electrocution .
Some 10 miles away , Captain Rezaian of Iran Air was calmly reporting to Bander Abbas that he had reached his first check - point crossing the gulf .
He heard none of the Vincennes warnings .
His four radio bandwidths were taken up with air - control chatter .
" Have a nice day , " the tower radioed .
" Thank you , good day , " replied the pilot .
Thirty seconds later , the first missile blew the left wing off his aircraft .
On the Vincennes 's bridge , cameraman Rudy Pahayo was still filming .
His audio captured a babble of voices : " Oh , dead ! " " Coming down ! " " We had him dead on ! "
One voice commanded : " Hold the noise down , knock it off ! "
Another shouted , " Direct hit ! " then a lookout came in from the wing of the bridge .
The target could n't have been an F - 14 , he said .
The wreckage falling from the sky , he murmured to the Vincennes 's executive officer , Cmdr. Richard Foster , is bigger than that .
A few miles away , on the bridge of the Montgomery , crewmen gaped as a large wing of a commercial airliner , with an engine pod still attached , plummeted into the sea .
Aboard the USS Sides , 19 miles away , Captain Carlson was told that his top radar man reckoned the plane had been a commercial airliner .
Carlson almost vomited , he said later .
On the Vincennes , there was an eerie silence .
The five - inch guns ceased their pounding .
None of the Revolutionary Guard boats had come within 5,000 yards of the cruiser .
No one was sure how many had been hit ; perhaps one , perhaps more .
Rogers gave the order to head south , out of Iranian waters .
ANATOMY OF A COVER-UP
In Washington , almost 11 hours later , at 1:30 pm EST , Adm .
William Crowe , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , stepped to the podium in the Pentagon press room .
Formal in his summer whites , the admiral told reporters there had been a terrible accident .
Stressing that the information was incomplete , relying on what he had been told by Captain Rogers , Crowe said that the Iranian airliner was flying outside the commercial air corridor and had failed to respond to repeated warnings .
The plane had been descending and picking up speed when it closed in on the Vincennes .
Rogers had only been protecting his ship .
A large map showed the position of the Vincennes at the time of the shoot - down .
It was well within international waters .
At the United Nations , the Iranians compared the tragedy to the Soviet shoot - down of Korea Air Lines 007 in 1983 .
The White House decided that Vice President George Bush should defend the United States before the U.N. Security Council .
The job of preparing the case fell to Richard Williamson , the assistant secretary of state for international organizations .
He found it exceedingly difficult to get answers out of Crowe 's staff , who were handling the affair at the Pentagon .
Suspicious , he warned the vice president 's chief of staff , Craig Fuller , to be very careful about committing Bush to any facts .
Fuller 's reaction was that he never trusted the Pentagon anyway .
Bush 's speech focused on the need to end the Iran - Iraq War .
But what facts it did include were wrong .
The vice - president claimed that the Vincennes had rushed to defend a merchantman under attack by Iran .
By July 14 , the day of Bush 's speech , the Pentagon knew the truth but failed to share it with the vice president .
The tapes of the Vincennes Aegis system , with its combat and navigational data reached the United States on July 5 and what they showed was reported to the Pentagon on July 10 .
The Vincennes had been in Iranian territorial waters .
The Iranian airliner was well within the commercial air corridor and had been ascending , not descending .
There was no beleaguered merchant vessel .
The cover -up was compounded by the official report on the incident .
On July 3 , Crowe chose Rear Adm.
William Fogarty , a senior officer on the staff of Central Command , which controls military operations in the Middle East , to investigate .
Crowe sent his own legal advisor , Capt .
Richard DeBobes , to sit at Fogarty 's side at Centcom headquarters in Tampa as he prepared his report .
The investigation was notable for the questions it failed to ask .
The commanders on the carrier Forestall were never interviewed ; nor was Captain McKenna , the surface warfare commander in Bahrain whose orders Rogers ignored .
McKenna 's staff mailed a tape of his tense exchange with Rogers before the sea battle , but never received a response .
The report released to the public did not include any chart of navigational data to show the Vincennes ' position at the time of the shoot - down .
The map displayed by Fogarty when he briefed Congress in September placed the Vincennes and its helicopters well clear of Iranian waters and erroneously reported the position of the Montgomery .
Fogarty produced stills from the Aegis - generated map of events displayed in the Vincennes 's CIC .
According to three sources on board the Vincennes that day , the real map had shown Hengam Island , Iranian territory less than nine miles from the Vincennes at the time of the shootdown .
On the frames shown by Fogarty , the island was simply deleted - miraculously placing the Vincennes safely in international waters once more .
Asked about the Forestall 's aircraft by inquiring lawmakers , Fogarty put them 180 miles , then 250 miles away , even though those same Aegis stills show them clearly tagged only 75 miles from the Vincennes .
Most mysteriously , Fogarty told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Vincennes had been racing to rescue a Liberian tanker , the Stoval , that morning .
There is no such tanker reported in any ship registry .
According to two sources , including a naval officer involved in the investigation , the Stoval was a decoy , a phantom conjured up by fake radio messages to lure out the Iranian gunboats .
According to these sources , the Iranian aggression that Vice President Bush had so vigorously decried at the United Nations had in fact been in the trial run for an American sting operation .
The navy might have gotten away with all of these deceptions had it not been for the slow grinding of international law .
A lawsuit by the Iranian government has now forced Washington to admit , grudgingly , that the Vincennes was actually in Iranian waters - although Justice Department pleadings still claim the cruiser was forced there in self - defense .
The admission is contained in fine print in legal briefs ; it has never received public attention until Crowe , confronted with the evidence , conceded the truth last week on " Nightline . "
Crowe denies any cover - up ; if mistakes were made , he told NEWSWEEK , they were " below my pay grade . "
Rogers continues to insist that his ship was in international waters .
In the end , of course , Will Rogers will not get an admiral 's two - inch gold stripe .
He instructed navy captains in San Diego for two years before retiring honorably in August 1991 .
The men of the Vincennes were all awarded combat-action ribbons .
Commander Lustig , the air - warfare coordinator , even won the navy 's Commendation Medal for " heroic achievement , " his " ability to maintain his poise and confidence under fire , " enabled him to " quickly and precisely complete the firing procedure . "
Given the target he was firing at , the commendation seems rather surreal .
But so was the atmosphere in the Vincennes CIC that July morning , and the attempt , in months and years that followed , to cover up what happened there .
John Barry is NEWSWEEK 's national security correspondent .

Hermit , 72 , comes out after 40 years in wild ( China Daily )
Updated : 2007-03-09 09:21
A man emerged from his mountain home in Taiwan after 40 years of living as a hermit .
A farmer found the man , surnamed Peng , now 72 , who had lived alone , surviving by eating herbs and drinking spring water .
He lived in a room built of bamboo and wood .
A stove and knife were the only facilities he owned .
Peng lost a lawsuit in 1967 and , in his rage , ran into the wild , vowing never to return to the city .
After the farmer found him , Peng , for the first time in his life , had a chance to taste instant noodles .

" What do men and women bet on during their career growth ? "
The University of Maryland has conducted a three year research to establish the main differences between women 's and men's approaches towards their careers .
Men and women , having leading positions in the U.S. chemical industry were the researchers ' objects .
The scientists from have questioned 1800 women and 300 men , who have leading posts in the industry mentioned above .
26 women and 6 men have also agreed to be interviewed more thoroughly by the researchers .
It was determined that men and women chose absolutely contrary methods in building their careers .
For example women try to modify their goals depending on the still existing factor of sexual discrimination , whereas men put their mobility at stake .
Among the first and most important positions for a man 's career development was his mobility , so that his career would grow faster and more dynamically .
Women , on the other hand , believe that they should follow a certain , personal strategy in their behavior : they should participate in different forums , notorious projects where their qualities could be noticed and appreciated , and where was a greater possibility to achieve success .
Men have thumbed - down this idea and have put it at the end of their list .
Women have also mentioned the fact that they had to work harder to achieve any results in their career .
Men , however , did n't agree with the statement either and considered it of little importance for their career growth .
A very important fact that the questioned women mentioned was sexual discrimination on their jobs .
Women have emphasized that this fact had a great influence on their career achievements and growth .

Our interest [ in psychotomimetic drugs ] , so far , has been psychiatric and pathological , with only a hint that any other viewpoint is possible ; yet our predecessors were interested in these things from quite different points of view .
In the perspective of history , our psychiatric and pathological bias is the unusual one .
By means of a variety of techniques , from dervish dancing to prayerful contemplation , from solitary confinement in darkness to sniffing the carbonated air at the Delphic oracle , from chewing peyote to prolonged starvation , men have pursued , down the centuries , certain experiences that they considered valuable above all others .
The great William James endured much uncalled - for criticism for suggesting that in some people inhalations of nitrous oxide allowed a psychic disposition that is always potentially present to manifest itself briefly .
Has our comparative neglect of these experiences , recognized by James and Bergson as being of great value , rendered psychology stale and savorless ?
Our preoccupation with behavior , because it is measurable , has led us to assume that what can be measured must be valuable and vice versa .
During the twentieth century we have seen , except for a few notables such as Carl Jung , an abandoning of the psyche by psychologists and psychiatrists .
Recently they have been joined by certain philosophers .
Pavlov , Binet , Freud , and a host of distinguished followers legitimately limited the field to fit their requirements , but later expanded their formulations from a limited inquiry to embrace the whole of existence .
An emphasis on the measurable and the reductive has resulted in the limitation of interest by psychiatrists and psychologists to aspects of experience that fit in with this concept .
There was and is another stream of psychological thought in Europe and in the United States that is more suitable for the work that I shall discuss next .
James , in the United States , Sedgwick , Myers , and Gurney in Britain , and Carl Jung in Switzerland are among its great figures .
Bergson is its philosopher and Harrison its prophet .
These and many others have said that in this work , as in any other , science is applicable if one defines it in Dingle 's term , " the rational ordering of the facts of experience . "
We must not fall into the pitfall of supposing that any explanation , however , ingenious , can be a substitute for observation and experiment .
The experience must be there before the rational ordering .
Work on the potentialities of mescaline and the rest of these agents fell on the stony ground of behaviorism and doctrinaire psychoanalysis .
Over the years we have been deluged with explanations , while observation has become less sharp .
This will doubtless continue to be the case as long as the observer and the observed do not realize that splendor , terror , wonder , and beauty , far from being the epiphenomena of " objective " happenings , may be of central importance .
Accounts of the effect of these agents , ranging in time from that of Havelock Ellis in 1897 to the more recent reports of Aldous Huxley are many , and they emphasize the unique quality of the experience .
One or more sensory modalities combined with mood , thinking and , often to a marked degree , empathy , usually change .
Most subjects find the experience valuable , some find it frightening , and many say that it is uniquely lovely .
All , from Slotkin 's unsophisticated Indians to men of great learning , agree that much of it is beyond verbal description .
Our subjects , who include many who have drunk deep of life , including authors , artists , a junior cabinet minister , scientists , a hero , philosophers , and businessmen , are nearly all in agreement in this respect .
For myself , my experiences with these substances have been the most strange , most awesome , and among the most beautiful things in a varied and fortunate life .
These are not escapes from but enlargements , burgeonings of reality .
Insofar as I can judge they occur in violation of Hughlings Jackson 's principle , because the brain , although its functioning is impaired , acts more subtly and complexly than when it is normal .
Yet surely , when poisoned , the brain 's actions should be less complex , rather than more so !
I cannot argue about this because one must undergo the experience himself .
Those who have had these experiences know , and those who have not had them cannot know and , what is more , the latter are in no position to offer a useful explanation .
Is this phenomenon of chemically induced mental aberration something wholly new ?
It is not , as I have suggested earlier .
It has been sought and studied since the earliest times and has played a notable part in the development of religion , art , philosophy , and even science .
Systems such as yoga have sprung from it .
Enormous effort has been expended to induce these states easily so as to put them to use .
Although occasionally trivial and sometimes frightening , their like seems to have been at least part of the experience of visionaries and mystics the world over .
These states deserve thought and pondering because until we understand them no account of the mind can be accurate .
It is foolish to expect a single exploration to bring back as much information as twenty of them .
It is equally foolish to expect an untrained , inept , or sick person to play the combined part of observer , experienced and recorder as well as a trained and skilled individual .
Those who have no taste for this work can help by freely admitting their shortcomings rather than disguising them by some imposing ascription .
This may seem mere nonsense but , before closing his mind , the reader should reflect that something unusual ought to seem irrational because it transcends those fashionable ruts of thinking that we dignify by calling them logic and reason .
We prefer such rationalized explanations because they provide an illusory sense of predictability .
Little harm is done so long as we do not let our sybaritism blind us to the primacy of experience .
especially in psychology .
Psychoanalysts claim that their ideas cannot be fully understood without a personal analysis .
Not everyone accepts this claim , but can one ever understand something one has never done ?
A eunuch could write an authoritative book on sexual behavior , but a book on sexual experience by the same author would inspire less confidence .
Working with these substances , as in psychoanalysis , we must often be our own instruments .
Psychoanalysis resembles Galileo's telescope , which lets one see a somewhat magnified image of an object the wrong way round and upside down .
The telescope changed our whole idea of the solar system and revolutionized navigation .
Psychotomimetic agents , whose collective name is still undecided , are more like the radar telescopes now being built to scan the deeps of outer , invisible space .
They are not convenient .
One can not go bird watching with them .
They explore a tiny portion of an enormous void .
They raise more questions than answers , and to understand those answers we must invent new languages .
What we learn is not reassuring or even always comprehensible .
Like astronomers , however , we must change our thinking to use the potentialities of our new instruments .
Freud has told us much about many important matters .
However , I believe that he and his pupils tried illegitimately to extrapolate from his data far beyond their proper limits in an attempt to account for the whole of human endeavor and , beyond this , into the nature of man and God .
This was magnificent bravado .
It is not science , for it is as vain to use Freud 's system for these greatest questions as it is to search for the galaxies with Galileo 's hand telescope .
Jung , using what I consider the very inadequate tools of dream and myth , has shown such skill and dexterity that he has penetrated as deep into these mysteries as his equipment allows .
Our newer instruments , employed with skill and reverence , allow us to explore a greater range of experience more intensively .
There have always been risks in discovery .
Splendid rashness such as John Hunter 's should be avoided , yet we must be prepared for calculated risks such as those that Walter Reed and his colleagues took in their conquest of yellow fever .
The mind can not be explored by proxy .
To deepen our understanding , not simply to great madnesses but of the nature of mind itself , we must use our instruments as coolly and boldly as those who force their aircraft through other invisible barriers .
Disaster may overtake the most skilled .
Today and in the past , for much lesser prizes , men have taken much greater risks .
How Should We Name Them ?
If mimicking mental illness were the main characteristic of these agents , " psychotomimetics " would indeed be a suitable generic term .
It is true that they do so , but they do much more .
Why are we always preoccupied with the pathological , the negative ?
Is health only the lack of sickness ?
Is good merely the absence of evil ?
Is pathology the only yardstick ?
Must we ape Freud 's gloomier moods that persuaded him that a happy man is a self - deceiver evading the heartache for which there is no anodyne ?
Is not a child infinitely potential rather than polymorphously perverse ?
I have tried to find an appropriate name for the agents under discussion : a name that will include the concepts of enriching the mind and enlarging the vision .
Some possibilities are : psychephoric , mind moving ; psychehormic , mind rousing ; and psycheplastic , mind molding .
Psychezynic , mind fermenting , is indeed appropriate .
Psycherhexic , mind bursting forth , though difficult , is memorable .
Psychelytic , mind releasing , is satisfactory .
My choice , because it is clear , euphonious , and uncontaminated by other associations , is psychedelic , mind manifesting .
One of these terms should serve .
Epilogue
This , then is how one clinician sees these psychedelics .
I believe that these agents have a part to play in our survival as a species , for that survival depends as much on our opinion of our fellows and ourselves as on any other single thing .
The psychedelics help us to explore and fathom our own nature .
We can perceive ourselves as the stampings of an automatic socioeconomic process , as highly plastic and conditionable animals , as congeries of instinctive strivings ending in loss of sexual drive and death , as cybernetic gadgets , or even as semantic conundrums .
All of these concepts have their supporters and they all have some degree of truth in them .
We may also be something more , " a part of the main , " a striving sliver of a creative process , a manifestation of Brahma in Atman , an aspect of an infinite God imminent and transcendent within and without us .
These very different valuings of the self and of other people 's selves have all been held sincerely by men and women .
I expect that even what seem the most extreme notions are held by some contributors to these pages .
Can one doubt that the views of the world derived from such differing concepts are likely to differ greatly , and that the courses of action determined by those views will differ ?
Our briefs , what we assume , as the Ames demonstrations in perception * show , greatly influence the world in which we live .
That world is in part , at least , what we make of it .
Once our mold for world making is formed it most strongly resists change .
The psychedelics allow us , for a little while , to divest ourselves of these acquired assumptions and to see the universe again with an innocent eye .
In T. H. Huxley 's words , we may , if we wish , " sit down in front of the facts like a child " or as Thomas Traherne , a seventeenth - century English mystic , puts it , " to unlearn the dirty devices of the world and become as it were a little child again . " **
Mystic and scientist have the same recipe for those who seek truth .
Perhaps , if we can do this , we shall learn how to rebuild our world in another and better image , for the breakneck advance of science is forcing change on us whether we like it or not .
Our old faults , however , persisting in our new edifice , are far more dangerous to us than they were in the old structure .
The old world perishes and , unless we are to perish in its ruins , we must leave our old assumptions to die with it .
" Let the dead bury their dead " tells us what we must do .
While we are learning , we may hope that dogmatic religion and authoritarian science will keep away from each other 's throats .
We need not put out the visionary 's eyes because we do not share his vision .
We need not shout down the voice of the mystic because we cannot hear it , or force our rationalizations on him for our own reassurance .
Few of us can accept or understand the mind that emerges from these studies .
Kant once said of Swedenborg , " Philosophy is often much embarrassed when she encounters certain facts she dare not doubt yet will not believe for fear of ridicule . "
Sixty years ago orthodox physicists knew that the atom was incompressible and indivisible .
Only a few cranks doubted this .
Yet who believes in the billiard - ball atom now ?
In a few years , I expect , the psychedelics that I have mentioned will seem as crude as our ways of using them .
Yet even though many of them are gleanings from Stone Age peoples they can enlarge our experience greatly .
Whether we employ these substances for good or ill , whether we use them with skill and deftness or with blundering ineptitude depends not a little on the courage , intelligence , and humanity of many of us who are working in the field today .
Recently I was asked by a senior colleague if this area of investigation lies within the scope of science and , if it does not , should not religion , philosophy , or politics take the responsibility for it ?
But politics , philosophy , religion , and even art are dancing more and more to the tune of science , and , as scientists , it is our responsibility to see that our tune does not become a death march , either physical or spiritual .
We can not evade our responsibilities .
So far as I can judge , spontaneous experience of the kind we are discussing has always been infrequent , and the techniques for developing it are often faulty , uncertain , clumsy , objectionable , and even dangerous .
Our increasingly excellent physical health , with the steady elimination of both acute and chronic infections , the tranquilizers that enable us to neutralize unusual chemoelectrical brain activity , our diet , rich in protein and , especially , B - complex vitamins whose antagonism to LSD I have already discussed - all of these , combined with a society whose whole emphasis is on material possession in a brightly lit and brilliantly colored synthetic world , will make spontaneous experiences of the sort I have mentioned ever fewer .
As we grow healthier and healthier , every millimeter that we budge from an allotted norm will be checked .
I believe that the psychedelics provide a chance , perhaps only a slender one , for homo faber , the cunning , ruthless , foolhardy , pleasure - greedy toolmaker to merge into that other creature whose presence we have so rashly presumed , homo sapiens , the wise , the understanding , the compassionate , in whose fourfold vision art , politics science , and religion are one .
Surely we must seize that chance .
* ". . . the principle that what we are aware of is not determined entirely by the nature of what is out there or by our sensory processes , but that the assumptions we bring from past experience , because they have generally proved reliable , are involved in every perception we have . " ( back )
** Also Francis Bacon , the father of modern scientific method , in Novum Organum , wrote , " The entrance into the Kingdom of man , founded on the sciences , being not much other than the entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven , whereinto none may enter except as a little child . " ( back )
OK we all know that to become a celebrity the ability to be pushy , outrageous and grab the headlines in tabloids is the key to getting noticed but to become a true celebrity , that is someone with a real talent that gets noticed , requires a lot more than just playing up to the paparazzi .
It is a given that there are many , many people endowed with a god given gift as actors , artists , entertainers , brilliant novelists or even just stunningly beautiful that hardly ever hit the gossip columns or Hello Magazine despite their wonderful attributes .
It is also a given that there are an extraordinary number of celebrities , some of whom are very , very minor that have absolutely no other talent than the ability to get noticed .
As a result they can make a good living , go to all the best parties , or at least most of the well - publicized ones and the girls in particular have the opportunity to become trophy arm candy and even trophy wives .
Many of the truly talented are confident enough in their own abilities and success that they can afford to hide their light under a bushel but what of the rest .
The truth lies somewhere between having a strong desire to succeed in the material world , overwhelming self confidence , and recognizing that they are likely to come up short in the talent stakes .
Posh Spice , or is it Mrs. Beckham , comes to mind
Having ambition to get a better life is to be admired , even if many of us question the type of life that they aspire to , but then each to their own .
Self confidence is another attribute to admire , without it the road to success in any field is much harder to achieve and sustain .
That just leaves talent and if that is present it has to be nurtured , and who is to say that the ability to get to celebrity status , however minor , is not a talent ?
Celebrities have to start off with giving the impression of having an outgoing personality , whatever else they may lack , this is a must .
That does not mean that a celebrity has to be liked , the personality has to be noticed , so exceptional rudeness , ¨putting it about ¨ if you will excuse the expression , the guilty party in a high profile divorce , anything that can get noticed will do , the celebrity does not have to be likeable .
Think of Bill Clinton ’s dalliance , now that lady has done very well out of being a little naughty .
There was a toe sucker who was caught out with a not too significant politician who was able to cash in for years on a fairly innocuous ?? sexual aberration .
Not long afterward a Royal enjoyed the same experience and even though the attention given to the admirer of this lovely lady , he was not an attention seeker , in fact he was a wealthy and successful man , he reluctantly became an overnight celebrity but has now lived it down .
Having good looks helps a lot and is the next most important attribute necessary for a celebrity career .
Now a lot of women may have the personality , the self confidence and the desire to succeed in hitting the gossip columns on a permanent basis but feel a bit ´iffy ´ about their looks .
Seriously this is no problem if you have sufficient will to get regular mentions in Hello .
It might take a little help from your favorite plastic surgeon but think what its done for Jordan , this lady has had the complete makeover and what a success .
If you can find some ´before and after´ pictures this shows a complete transformation from ´ordinaire´ to utterly desirable .
No wonder she is in the papers or on TV or is in this glossy or the other and there is hardly a day when she does n’t get a mention .
And she has become a very successful lady !
Now we all know about breast enhancement and it is usually obvious , having the buns lifted and tummy tucks are not quite as noticeable but when the face goes under the knife as well then a ´dog´ can turn into the sexiest woman that no red blooded man could ignore – and men rule the media !
And here is the point of this article , it is the eyes and their surroundings that have the most impact , however perfect the body it is the face that is the turn on , can you imagine the paparazzi bothering to photograph anybody whose face is forgettable just because they have a body to die for ?
Well I ca n’t think of anybody – well maybe Arnie !
And the center of attention is always the eyes , it is not only when we meet people in the flesh , it is when we look at the photos of celebrities in the papers and magazines , or when they appear on TV we are all drawn to the eyes and their immediate surroundings .
So for any aspiring celebrities out there just make sure that your eyes look good , give them allure and mystery , then work on the other lifestyle ideas that we ’ve talked about .
If you get celebrity status let us know – we have ways and means of getting your name and face known worldwide .
If you do n’t ask you do n’t get and you have nothing to lose .
Editing Lisp Code with Emacs
Keyboard tips
Use the Standard US keyboard layout .
The US keyboard 's layout ( unlike the western European keyboard layouts ) makes typing the punctuation characters you need in programming languages easy .
Learn to touch - type .
Invest in a quality keyboard .
Key Swapping
Alt key for Meta , not Escape .
Turn Capslock into Control .
Here 's a complete keyboard layout suggested by a photo of a Lisp Machine keyboard :
Swap Capslock and Backspace ( Rubout in LM ) .
Swap parentheses and brackets ( US layout ) .
Alt and Altgr are now Control .
Win keys are now Meta
Control keys are now Alt
Menu key is Compose ( or Altgr ) .
Alt+arrows works like C - M-f , C - M-b , C - M-u , C - M-d , etc. ( like PLT DrScheme )
Using a European PC 105 keyboard , the less - than (
( I'm am using lately the layout : Alt / AltGr -> Control , Win -> Meta +Control , Control -> Meta .
It works for Emacs and most applications .
But I have problems with Xterm ( Control does not work anymore ) , Rxvt , etc. Outside Gnome and KDE , I must use Eterm ( or ansi- term within Emacs ) . )
Some xmodmap files that describe the Lisp machine keyboard on the picture above reasonably faithfully can be found here .
The xkeycaps program takes care of this on X , MacOS users can use uControl , Windows users can use XKeymacs .
In just about every programming language I 've ever used ( C , Java , Perl , bash and LISP ) , and in normal prose , parentheses occur far more often than the square bracket characters .
So it 's important to make typing the parenthesis easy :
( keyboard - translate ?\( ?\[ ) ( keyboard - translate ?\[ ?\( ) ( keyboard - translate ?\ ) ?\ ] ) ( keyboard - translate ?\ ] ?\ ) )
This assumes that the [ and ] are easy to reach unshifted chars .
The keyboard - translates above can interfere with pasting text using the mouse in emacs .
Another way to accomplish the same thing while limiting the effect to Slime is :
( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " [ " ) ' insert - parentheses ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " ] " ) ' move-past - close - and - reindent ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " ( " ) ( lambda ( ) ( interactive ) ( insert " [ " ) ) ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " ) " ) ( lambda ( ) ( interactive ) ( insert " ] " ) ) )
If using Paredit , this code can be used to swap parentheses and square brackets :
( define - key paredit - mode - map ( kbd " [ " ) ' paredit- open - round ) ( define - key paredit - mode - map ( kbd " ] " ) ' paredit - close - round ) ( define - key paredit - mode - map ( kbd " M - [ " ) ' paredit - wrap - round ) ( define - key paredit - mode - map ( kbd " ( " ) ' paredit-open - square ) ( define - key paredit - mode - map ( kbd " ) " ) ' paredit - close - square )
Structured editing
What is structured editing ?
Structured editing is a way of editing source code which attempts , as much as is possible , to keep the source code consistently valid .
This means , among other things , that the inserting of an open parenthesis should insert the closing one as well ( similarly for " ) .
Taylor R. Campbell ( Riastradh on # lisp ) has written a package of lisp editing code called paredit .
There also is the newer Parinfer , which helps to keep both indentation and parens balanced .
It is easy to get started and yet it provides advanced features à la Paredit , so you should definitely take a look .
The rest of this page uses functions defined in Paredit .
Start with paredit - open - list it inserts both the open and the closing parenthesis and then leaves the cursor between the two ( unless we 're in a comment or string , in which case it inserts a lone ( character ) .
After filling in the LISP form , use the paredit - close - list command which moves past the closing parenthesis and reindents the line .
Here 's my setup :
( define - key slime - mode - map [ ( ? \( ) ] ' paredit- open - list ) ( define - key slime - mode - map [ ( ?\ ) ) ] ' paredit - close - list ) ( define - key slime - mode - map [ ( return ) ] ' paredit - newline )
Unstructured editing
So how do you insert a simple , standalone " ( " or " ) " character ?
I happen to have the " = " character directly below " ) " and the " \ " character just to the left of that ; so here 's what I use :
( define - key slime - mode - map [ ( control ?\= ) ] ( lambda ( ) ( interactive ) ( insert " ( " ) ) ) ( define - key slime - mode - map [ ( control ?\\ ) ] ( lambda ( ) ( interactive ) ( insert " ) " ) ) )
Choose something that makes sense to use and which requires at most one key press ( though it will probably be modified ) .
Even with structured editing you 'll still need to insert a lone parenthesis every now and then .
Note :
You can also just as easily do C-q ( and C - q ) ; personally , I insert lone parentheses often enough that that 's too many keypresses for my tastes .
Splicing , Dicing and Moving Around
When editing LISP code , you should n't think of the source code as text , but as program structure ( SEXPs ) .
With parenthesis - aware editors , we get the same functionality used in IntelliSense ( otherwise a separate IDE component in other languages ) .
The basic lists / program manipulation commands ( basic EMACS bindings ) are :
transpose - sexps ( C - M-t ) - swap the sexp before point with the sexp after point .
) - swap the sexp before point with the sexp after point .
backward - sexp ( C - M-b ) - move to before the preceding sexp .
) - move to before the preceding sexp .
forward - sexp ( C - M -f ) - move after the following sexp .
) - move after the following sexp .
kill - sexp ( C - M-k ) - kill the following sexp .
) - kill the following sexp .
backward - up - list ( C - M-u ) - move point to the start of the enclosing list .
) - move point to the start of the enclosing list .
up - list ( not bound by default ) - move forward out of the current enclosing list .
) - move forward out of the current enclosing list .
down - list ( C - M-d ) - move the just after the open paren of the next list .
) - move the just after the open paren of the next list .
mark - sexp ( C - M-@ ) -
Keep the cursor at the start of an s-exp and executing this key strokes highlight the entire S - expression .
All of these functions take prefix args which specify how many sexps to move around .
backward - up - list can take a negative arg which moves out of the enclosing parens but forwards , basically simulating up - list .
When editing LISP code you will use these the forward / backward / transpose - sexp functions far more often the the char versions , I 'd suggest swapping them so that , for example , C - M-t ( transpose - sexp ) is C-t and C-t ( transpose - char ) is C - M-t :
( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " C-t " ) ' transpose - sexps ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " C - M-t " ) ' transpose - chars ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " C- b " ) ' backward - sexp ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " C - M - b " ) ' backward - char ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " C- f " ) ' forward - sexp ) ( define - key slime - mode - map ( kbd " C - M - f " ) ' forward - char )
Use the standard keybindings for a bit and after you 've figured out how they work and how often you use them , chose some keybindings based on your preferences .
For example , I have a Dvorak keyboard where the H , T , and N keys are located directly under the right hand , so I 've put the forward functions on then N key , the transpose functions on the T key , and the backward functions on the H key .
In addition , paredit provides the following commands :
paredit - open - list ( ( ) - Inserts a balanced parenthesis pair .
) - Inserts a balanced parenthesis pair .
paredit - close - list ( M-) ) -
Moves past one closing parenthesis and reindents .
) - Moves past one closing parenthesis and reindents .
paredit - close - list - and - newline ( ) ) -
Moves past one closing delimiter , adds a newline , and reindents .
) -
Moves past one closing delimiter , adds a newline , and reindents .
paredit - splice - sexp ( M-s ) -
Splices the list that the point is on by removing its delimiters .
) - Splices the list that the point is on by removing its delimiters .
paredit - backward - delete ( DEL ) - Deletes a character backward or moves backward over a delimiter .
) - Deletes a character backward or moves backward over a delimiter .
paredit - forward - slurp - sexp ( C - ) ) -
Adds the S - expression following the current list into that list by moving the closing delimiter .
) -
Adds the S - expression following the current list into that list by moving the closing delimiter .
paredit - backward - slurp - sexp ( C-( ) -
Adds the S - expression preceding the current list into that list by moving the closing ( ( sic ) opening ? ) delimiter .
) -
Adds the S - expression preceding the current list into that list by moving the closing ( ( sic ) opening ? ) delimiter .
paredit - forward - barf - sexp ( C-} ) - Removes the last S - expression in the current list from that list by moving the closing delimiter .
) - Removes the last S - expression in the current list from that list by moving the closing delimiter .
paredit - backward - barf - sexp ( C-{ ) -
Removes the first S - expression in the current list from that list by moving the closing ( ( sic ) opening ? ) delimiter .
) - Removes the first S - expression in the current list from that list by moving the closing ( ( sic ) opening ? ) delimiter .
paredit - wrap - sexp ( M-( ) -
Wraps the following S - expression in a list .
For example , leaving point inside the Sexp ( b c ) , slurping ( a ( b c ) d e f ) forward would result in ( a ( b c d ) e f ) , then ( a ( b c d e ) f ) , and finally ( a ( b c d e f ) ) .
Barfing reverses / undoes slurps .
Refer to the paredit.el package for more functions that are similar to text editing functions , but additionally respect parentheses ( and even quotes ) around SEXPs .
Indentation
A simple , consistent way to indent lisp code is using C - M-q at the begining of an s-exp .
Alternatively , use C - M-\ to re-indent the selected region .

Newspapers around the world are critical of the US government 's response to Hurricane Katrina , and its foreign and environmental policies more generally .
Links are made to regional concerns , with Asian papers recalling last December 's tsunami and African commentators highlighting the racial issue .
But some sympathy comes from Indonesia , and an Afghan newspaper takes pride in President Karzai 's offer of assistance .
China 's Renmin Wang
If the US could shift part of its astronomical military spending to counter - terrorism , guarding against natural disasters , epidemic disease control and other aspects , then the 9/11 attack , Hurricane Katrina , the spread of Aids and other tragedies could be avoided or mitigated .
Malaysia's Berita Harian
When the tsunami hit Asia last December , Bush succeeded in showing off his abilities by offering appropriate and well - organised humanitarian aid , but it seems he has been unresponsive , disorganised and discriminatory in dealing with the Katrina disaster .
Indonesia 's Suara Merdeka
People may hate the selfish US stance .
They may also condemn its military invasion of Iraq or criticise Washington 's threats to Iran , Syria and North Korea .
But , it is inhuman to be grateful for the American people 's disaster .
Indonesia , in particular , must not forget the services of the US military when the tsunami devastated Aceh .
Singapore 's The Straits Times
The dead are only beginning to be gathered up .
In Aceh and Thailand 's beach resorts , those killed by the tsunami last December received the due respect of swift recovery , followed by identification .
New Orleans people will not let Mr Bush forget this .
Australia 's The Age
President Bush is increasingly seen as out of touch with ordinary people and with reality on the ground - in New Orleans and Iraq - and also on issues such as climate change .
The president and , by association , Republicans are highly vulnerable for the first time in years .
How the Administration responds has broader implications , too - a deeply unpopular , lame duck president could alter the balance of global leadership .
Afghanistan's Eslah
President Karzai has pledged 100,000 dollars for the victims of Hurricane Katrina .
America has helped Afghanistan in various ways .
Even if the assistance promised to the victims of Hurricane Katrina seems a symbolic act , it nevertheless shows that our country has credibility and authority in the international community .
Nahum Barnea in Israel 's Yediot Aharonot
Just as 11 September 2001 changed the American agenda from internal matters to foreign policy and the war on terror , so Katrina is liable to take America back to its internal agenda : dealing with the environment , society , and the gaps between whites and blacks and between rich and poor .
Adli Sadiq in the Palestinian Al - Hayat al - Jadidah
After Hurricane Katrina , a new section of the American public is waking up to the wretchedness of the administration 's policies and to the disasters that have hit Americans as a result .
Today 's Iraq is worse than yesterday's , and there are not enough helicopters to tackle the hurricane .
Bush and his administration will be judged by history .
Iran 's Resalat
Katrina was a natural catastrophe , but many experts believe America 's policies have deepened the roots of the disaster .
America had allocated the budgets for these areas to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Nick Reimer in Germany 's die tageszeitung
New Orleans has already become a symbol : never before in human history has a natural disaster been predicted in such exact detail .
Despite this , the prediction had no effect .
It 's as if mankind has lost the power to correct its own mistakes :
In New Orleans , it slid into catastrophe submissively and with eyes wide open .
Climate change has already arrived .

Emergencies Ministry planes have been under starter 's orders for several days .
But the go - ahead from the other side of the ocean never came .
It leads you to think :
Is Washington afraid of having US citizens rescued by people who are not flying the stars and stripes ?
Are they trying to preserve the prestige of a state that does not take easily to accepting aid from a " third - world " country ?
But is n't the saving of human life more important than PR or ideological considerations ?

The death and destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina also revealed the racial fissures in American society .
Most of the hapless survivors who filled New Orleans ' Superdome were black .
Bush 's other weaknesses are his poor environment record and his management of the US economy .
Zimbabwe 's Herald
The fact that New Orleans is a southern town predominantly populated by African - Americans explains why President George W. Bush did not see the need to cut short his holiday .
All that Bush has done so far is to issue threats against the victims , and deploying trigger - happy American troops - fresh from abusing Iraqi prisoners - to go and " restore order " .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -
The prospect of a bird flu outbreak may be panicking people around the globe , but it 's proving to be very good news for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other politically connected investors in Gilead Sciences , the California biotech company that owns the rights to Tamiflu , the influenza remedy that 's now the most - sought after drug in the world .
Rumsfeld served as Gilead ( Research ) 's chairman from 1997 until he joined the Bush administration in 2001 , and he still holds a Gilead stake valued at between $ 5 million and $ 25 million , according to federal financial disclosures filed by Rumsfeld .
The forms do n't reveal the exact number of shares Rumsfeld owns , but in the past six months fears of a pandemic and the ensuing scramble for Tamiflu have sent Gilead 's stock from $ 35 to $ 47 .
That 's made the Pentagon chief , already one of the wealthiest members of the Bush cabinet , at least $ 1 million richer .
Rumsfeld is n't the only political heavyweight benefiting from demand for Tamiflu , which is manufactured and marketed by Swiss pharma giant Roche .
( Gilead receives a royalty from Roche equaling about 10 % of sales . )
Former Secretary of State George Shultz , who is on Gilead 's board , has sold more than $ 7 million worth of Gilead since the beginning of 2005 .
Another board member is the wife of former California Gov. Pete Wilson .
" I do n't know of any biotech company that 's so politically well - connected , " says analyst Andrew McDonald of Think Equity Partners in San Francisco .
What 's more , the federal government is emerging as one of the world 's biggest customers for Tamiflu .
In July , the Pentagon ordered $ 58 million worth of the treatment for U.S. troops around the world , and Congress is considering a multi-billion dollar purchase .
Roche expects 2005 sales for Tamiflu to be about $ 1 billion , compared with $ 258 million in 2004 .
Rumsfeld recused himself from any decisions involving Gilead when he left Gilead and became Secretary of Defense in early 2001 .
And late last month , notes a senior Pentagon official , Rumsfeld went even further and had the Pentagon 's general counsel issue additional instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond .
As the flu issue heated up early this year , according to the Pentagon official , Rumsfeld considered unloading his entire Gilead stake and sought the advice of the Department of Justice , the SEC and the federal Office of Government Ethics .
Those agencies did n't offer an opinion so Rumsfeld consulted a private securities lawyer , who advised him that it was safer to hold on to the stock and be quite public about his recusal rather than sell and run the risk of being accused of trading on insider information , something Rumsfeld does n't believe he possesses .
So he 's keeping his shares for the time being .

Here is the response from the State Department :
You may also recall that you wrote to Secretary of State Powell on July 21 , 2003 ...
Attached is a copy of the Department 's September 25 , 2004 reply to that letter .
As you know , the Commission on the Capabilities of the United States regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction exhaustively investigated the issues surrounding the intelligence on alleged Iraqi efforts to obtain uranium from Niger , including the status of the information at the time of the President 's January 2003 State of the Union Address .
I refer you to the Commission 's public report at pages 76 - 79 for its detailed findings on this subject .
Look , 1 ) we already did not answer your questions when Colin Powell was Secretary , 2 ) the Republicans in 2003 already looked at this , and 3 ) why do you keep asking us questions when we already did not answer them ?
The State Department 's response is a masterfully written stream of non sequitor gobbledygook .
The department cites not only the non-answer about the Niger Forgeries : the appointment of Ambassador Richard Jones , the MERC program , the Inter - American Telecommunication Commission , Croatia , needle exchange programs to prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS , and the failure of Ambassador Tim Carney to appear before the Committee regarding Iraq reconstruction .
The letter concludes , " I hope this response clarifies the points raised in your letter . "
Chairman Waxman responds :
On April 3 , 2007 , I did receive a letter from your assistant secretary for legislative affairs , Jeffrey Bergner .
Mr. Bergner 's letter does not answer many of the Committee 's questions , nor does it provide most of the information and documents the Committee requested .
As a result , I continue to request your appearance before the Committee on April 18 , 2007 .
Wow !
You mean all that other stuff does n't really relate to the Niger forgeries and the Iraqi WMD claims asserted to by the Secretary Rice and the White House ?
Furthermore , Chairman Waxman writes :
Rather than address any of these questions , Mr. Bergner forwarded copies of two old State Department letters that have no bearing whatsoever on your knowledge of , your role in , or your statements about the Niger claim .
Mr. Bergner also failed to respond to the Committee 's questions about the seemingly inconsistent way in which the White House has responded to leaks of classified information , such as the disclosure of the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
Waxman to Rice : Pay attention , because I want answers from you .
I am not to be ignored .
Waxman wants answers from Rice concerning :
Whether Secretary Rice had any knowledge that would explain why Bush cited the Niger forgeries in the State of the Union address .
Whether she knew before the State of the Union address of the doubts raised by the CIA and the State Department about the veracity of the Niger claim .
Whether there was a factual basis for her reference in her January 23 , 2003 , New York Times op - ed " Why We Know Iraq Is Lying " ( also archived at the White House website ) , to " Iraq 's efforts to get uranium from abroad " .
Whether she took appropriate steps to investigate how the Niger claim ended up in the State of the Union address after it was revealed to be fraudulent .
Chairman Waxman adds :
... the Committee will not withdraw the invitation for you to testify on April 18 , 2007 .
... As I wrote in my prior letter , the Committee staff is available to discuss an alternative date for the hearing if necessary given the demands on your time as Secretary of State .
It seems to me that Secretary Rice has two options : 1 ) answer Waxman 's questions , or 2 ) stay overseas .
I think if Rice keeps avoiding the Oversight Committee and chooses no .
2 , then Waxman is going to be forced to subpoena her majesty and compel her to testify .
It may seem like a slow dance , but Waxman is n't going to let up .
For more background in Waxman 's efforts to get Rice to answer the questions , see :
Update : Think Progress is reporting today that State Dept. Blows Off Waxman ’s Niger Inquiry , Falsely Claims Rice Has ‘ Answered In Full ’ ( hattip to Jeff in SF ) .
Newly released documents confirm that a Pentagon unit knowingly cooked up intelligence claiming a direct link between Iraq and al - Qaeda in order to win support for a preemptive strike against the country .
A report prepared by the Defense Department 's Inspector General for Carl Levin , the Democratic Chairman of the Armed Services Committee , explicitly shows how former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith used his Defense Department position to cook intelligence claiming a connection between the terrorist organization and Saddam Hussein 's regime .
The Inspector General 's report , " Review of the Pre-Iraqi War Activities of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , " focuses specifically on Feith 's intelligence gathering operations in the months prior to the March 2003 invasion .
An executive summary of the report was declassified in February .
The full report was declassified and released Thursday at Levin 's request .
" It is important for the public to see why the Pentagon 's inspector general concluded that Secretary Feith 's office ' developed , produced and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al - Qaeda relationship , ' which included ' conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community , ' and why the Inspector General concluded that these actions were ' inappropriate , ' " Levin said .
" Until today , those details were classified and outside the public 's view . "
Documents released in conjunction with the inspector general 's findings include a July 25 , 2002 memorandum and briefing from Feith 's Office of Special Plans titled " Iraq and al - Qaida : Making the Case " that claimed a " mature , symbiotic relationship [ between Iraq and al - Qaida ] " existed .
But according to the IG 's declassified report , " a Senior Intelligence Analyst working in the Joint Intelligence Task Force - Combating Terrorism ( JITF - CT ) countered point - by - point , each instance of an alleged tie between Iraq and al - Qaida ... "
According to the IG report , both the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) had throughly examined the possibility of an active relationship between Iraq and al - Qaida and determined there were " no conclusive signs [ of a relationship ] , " and " direct cooperation ... has not been established . "
Feith 's Office of Special Plans , however , created a briefing based on a previous report , " Assessing the Relationship Between Iraq and al Qaida . "
The presentation was aimed at discrediting the conclusions of the CIA and the DIA .
" The very title of the Feith briefing slides [ Assessing the Relationship Between Iraq and al Qaida ] contradicts his claim on February 16 , 2007 that ' we did n't do intelligence assessments , ' as well as his claim on February 14 , 2007 that the briefing was simply ' a critique of the CIA 's work on the Iraq - al - Qaeda relationship , ' and no more than an effort to ' raise questions about CIA work , ' " Levin said Thursday .
Specifically , one slide titled " Fundamental Problems with How Intelligence Community is Assessing Information , " called the expertise of the Intelligence Community into question .
According to the report , the Office of Special Plans , a policy shop with no official role in intelligence collection or vetting , " accuse [d ] the Intelligence Community of applying a standard requiring juridical evidence for reports , underestimating the importance for both Iraq and al - Qaida to keep their relationship hidden , and assuming that the two would not cooperate because of religious differences . "
This particular slide was omitted from the presentation when it was given to the directors of the CIA and the DIA .
In a statement released in February , Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) , Chairman of the Senate Committee on Intelligence , said , " the Senate intelligence committee was never informed of these activities .
Whether these actions were authorized or not , it appears that they were not in compliance with the law . "
The last slide of the presentation concludes with a hypothetical assertion that an Iraq / al - Qaida " relationship would be compartmented by both sides ; closely guarded secret ; indications of excellent operational security by both parties , " implying that this relationship existed but was so secret that it would be impossible for the CIA or DIA to discover it .
On August 15 , 2002 , a briefing on Feith 's findings was held by former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenent .
However , left out of the presentation was the slide titled " Fundamental Problems With How the Intelligence Community is Assessing Information , " because according to the IG report , Feith thought " it had a critical tone . "
After this briefing was presented to the DIA and CIA , Tenent told Feith , " get this back into analytical channels and out of policy channels . "
Despite being rebuked , Feith fast - tracked the information and presented the findings to then Deputy National Security Director Steven Hadley and I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , former chief of staff to Vice President Cheney
According to Thursday 's IG report , the briefing was altered to include not only the slide that was critical of the work done by the Intelligence Community , but also a new slide entitled " Facilitation : Atta Meeting in Prague . "
According to the IG report , this new slide " discussed the alleged meeting between [ al - Qaida hijacker ]
Mohammad Atta and [ Iraqi intelligence officer Ahmad ] al - Ani in April 2001 in Prague without caveats regarding Intelligence Community consesnus . "
But the IG states that the CIA " called the reporting on the alleged meeting between Atta and al - Ani as ' inconclusive , ' " yet Feith 's Office of Special Plans presented it to these top officials of the Bush administration as fact and it was subsequently used by President Bush and Vice President Cheney in speeches prior to the March 2003 invasion .
Long after the relationship between Iraq and al - Qaida was debunked , Bush continued to insist it existed .
On June 17 , 2004 , in response to the 9/11 Commission report , Bush said " The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al - Qaeda [ is ] because there was a relationship between Iraq and al - Qaeda . "

Getting Things DONE
President Bush and his advisers have made a lot of ridiculous charges about critics of the war in Iraq : they ’re unpatriotic , they want the terrorists to win , they do n’t support the troops , to cite just a few .
But none of these seem quite as absurd as President Bush ’s latest suggestion , that critics of the war whose children are at risk are too “ emotional ” to see things clearly .
The direct target was Matthew Dowd , one of the chief strategists of Mr. Bush ’s 2004 presidential campaign , who has grown disillusioned with the president and the war , which he made clear in an interview with Jim Rutenberg published in The Times last Sunday .
But by extension , Mr. Bush ’s comments were insulting to the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose sons , daughters , sisters , brothers and spouses have served or will serve in Iraq .
They are perfectly capable of forming judgments about the war , pro or con , on the merits .
But when Mr. Bush was asked about Mr. Dowd during a Rose Garden news conference yesterday , he said , “ This is an emotional issue for Matthew , as it is for a lot of other people in our country . ”
Mr. Dowd ’s case , Mr. Bush said , “ as I understand it , is obviously intensified because his son is deployable . ”
Hollywood has a thing for Al Gore and his three - alarm film on global warming , “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” which won an Academy Award for best documentary .
So do many environmentalists , who praise him as a visionary , and many scientists , who laud him for raising public awareness of climate change .
But part of his scientific audience is uneasy .
In talks , articles and blog entries that have appeared since his film and accompanying book came out last year , these scientists argue that some of Mr. Gore ’s central points are exaggerated and erroneous .
They are alarmed , some say , at what they call his alarmism .
“ I do n’t want to pick on Al Gore , ” Don J. Easterbrook , an emeritus professor of geology at Western Washington University , told hundreds of experts at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America .
“ But there are a lot of inaccuracies in the statements we are seeing , and we have to temper that with real data . ”
Mr. Gore , in an e-mail exchange about the critics , said his work made “ the most important and salient points ” about climate change , if not “ some nuances and distinctions ” scientists might want .
“ The degree of scientific consensus on global warming has never been stronger , ” he said , adding , “ I am trying to communicate the essence of it in the lay language that I understand . ”
Most ancient artifacts , no matter how strange they first appear , can eventually be explained and placed in their historical context by archaeologists and historians .
The artifacts below are the exceptions to this rule .
From mysterious metals to giant stone balls of amazing spherical precision , these objects remain perplexing to this day .
01 of 16 The Grooved Spheres Science informs us that man is a few million years old , and civilization just tens of thousands of years old .
Could it be , however , that conventional science is mistaken ?
There is some evidence that the history of life on earth might be far different than what current geological and anthropological texts tell us .
Consider these astonishing finds : Miners in South Africa have dug up mysterious metal spheres .
Of unknown origin , these spheres measure approximately an inch in diameter , and some are etched with three parallel grooves running around the equator .
Two types of spheres have been found : one is composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white , while the other is hollowed out and filled with a spongy white substance .
The kicker is that the rock in which they where found is Precambrian — and dated to 2.8 billion years old .
Who made them and for what purpose is unknown .
02 of 16 The Ica Stones Brattarb / Wikimedia Commons / CC SA BY 2.0 In the 1930s , Dr. Javier Cabrera received the gift of a strange stone from a local farmer .
The stone so intrigued the doctor that he began collecting others , eventually boasting a collection of more than 1,100 andesite stones .
Estimated to be between 500 and 1,500 years old , the stones have become known as the Ica Stones .
The stones bear etchings , many of which are sexually graphic .
Some depict idols , while others depict such practices as open - heart surgery and brain transplants .
The most astonishing etchings , however , clearly represent dinosaurs — brontosauruses , triceratopses , stegosauruses , and pterosaurs .
While skeptics consider the Ica Stones a hoax , their authenticity has neither been proved nor disproved .
03 of 16 The Antikythera Mechanism Tilemahos Efthimiadis // Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain
A perplexing artifact was recovered by sponge - divers from a shipwreck in 1900 off the coast of Antikythera , a small island northwest of Crete .
The divers brought up from the wreck a great many marble and bronze statues that had apparently been the ship 's cargo .
Among the findings was a hunk of corroded bronze that contained some kind of mechanism composed of many gears and wheels .
Writing on the case indicated that it was made in 80 B.C. , and many experts at first thought it was an astrolabe , an astronomer 's tool .
An x-ray of the mechanism , however , revealed it to be far more complex , containing a sophisticated system of differential gears .
Gearing of this complexity was not known to exist until 1575 .
It is still unknown who constructed this amazing instrument 2,000 years ago or how the technology was lost .
04 of 16 The Baghdad Battery Boynton / Flickr.com /CC
BY 2.0 Today , batteries can be found in any grocery , drug , convenience , and department store you come across .
Well , here 's a battery that 's 2,000 years old .
Known as the Baghdad Battery , this curiosity was found in the ruins of a Parthian village believed to date back to between 248 B.C. and 226 A.D.
The device consists of a 5 - 1/2 - inch clay vessel inside of which is a copper cylinder containing an oxidized iron rod .
Experts have concluded that the device needed only to be filled with an acid or alkaline liquid to produce an electric charge .
It is believed that this ancient battery might have been used for electroplating objects with gold .
If so , how was this technology lost ... and the battery not rediscovered for another 1,800 years ?
05 of 16 The Coso Artifact While mineral hunting in the mountains of California near Olancha during the winter of 1961 , Wallace Lane , Virginia Maxey , and Mike Mikesell found a rock that they thought was a geode — a good addition for their gem shop .
Upon cutting it open , however , Mikesell found an object inside that seemed to be made of white porcelain .
In the center was a shaft of shiny metal .
Experts estimated that , if this was a geode , it should have taken about 500,000 years for the fossil - encrusted nodule to form , yet the object inside was obviously of sophisticated human manufacture .
Further investigation revealed that the porcelain was surrounded by a hexagonal casing , and an x-ray revealed a tiny spring at one end , like a spark plug .
There 's a bit of controversy around this artifact , as you can imagine .
Some contend that the artifact was not inside a geode at all , but encased in hardened clay .
The artifact itself has been identified by experts as a 1920s - era Champion spark plug .
Unfortunately , the Coso Artifact has gone missing and cannot be thoroughly examined .
Is there a natural explanation for it ?
Or was it found , as the discoverer claimed , inside a geode ?
If so , how could a 1920s spark plug end up inside a 500,000 - year - old rock ?
06 of 16 Ancient Model Aircraft Olek95 / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain
There are artifacts belonging to ancient Egyptian and Central American cultures that look amazingly like modern - day aircraft .
This Egyptian artifact , found in a tomb at Saqquara in 1898 , is a 6 - inch wooden object that strongly resembles a model airplane , with fuselage , wings , and tail .
Experts believe the object is so aerodynamic that it is actually able to glide .
Estimated to be 1,000 years old , the small object is made of gold and could easily be mistaken for a model of a delta - wing aircraft — or even the Space Shuttle .
It even features what looks like a pilot 's seat .
07 of 16 Giant Stone Balls of Costa Rica Matthewobrien / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY SA 3.0 Workmen hacking and burning their way through the dense jungle of Costa Rica to clear an area for banana plantations in the 1930s stumbled upon some incredible objects : dozens of stone balls , many of which were perfectly spherical .
They varied in size from as small as a tennis ball to an astonishing 8 feet in diameter .
Although the great stone balls are clearly man-made , it is unknown who made them , for what purpose , and , most puzzling , how the creator (s ) achieved such spherical precision .
08 of 16 Impossible Fossils Fossils , as we learned in grade school , appear in rocks that were formed many thousands of years ago .
Yet there are a number of fossils that just do n't make geological or historical sense .
A fossil of a human handprint , for example , was found in limestone estimated to be 110 million years old .
What appears to be a fossilized human finger found in the Canadian Arctic also dates back 100 to 110 million years ago .
And what appears to be the fossil of a human footprint , possibly wearing a sandal , was found near Delta , Utah , in a shale deposit estimated to be 300 million to 600 million years old .
09 of 16 Out - of - Place Metal Objects
Humans were not even around 65 million years ago , never mind humans who knew how to work metal .
So how does science explain semi-ovoid metallic tubes dug out of 65 - million - year - old Cretaceous chalk in France ?
In 1885 , a block of coal was broken open to reveal a metal cube obviously worked by intelligent hands .
In 1912 , employees at an electric plant broke apart a large chunk of coal out of which fell an iron pot .
A nail was found embedded in a sandstone block from the Mesozoic Era .
And there are many , many more such anomalies .
10 of 16 Shoe Print in Granite
This shoe print fossil was discovered in a seam of coal in Fisher Canyon , Nevada .
The coal is believed to be 15 million years old .
Close - up examination of the fossil reveals traces of a double line of stitches around the perimeter .
It 's about a size 13 , and the right side of the heel appears to be more worn down than the left .
How does a modern shoe print become impressed in 15 - million - year - old material ?
Either the imprint was made recently and coal does not really take millions of years to form ( an explanation unsupported by science ) , there were people ( or something like people ) walking around in shoes 15 million years ago ( of which we have no historical record ) , time travelers went back in time and carelessly left this show print , or it is all an elaborate hoax .
The jury is still out .
11 of 16 Ancient Footprint
You could see a human footprint like this today on any beach or patch of mud .
But this footprint — clearly from the anatomy of a modern human — is fossilized in stone estimated to be about 290 million years old .
The discovery was made in New Mexico by paleontologist Jerry MacDonald in 1987 .
There were also fossil footprints of birds and other animals , but MacDonald was at a loss to explain how this modern footprint could possibly have been cast in Permian strata , which dates from 290 to 248 million years ago — long before man ( or even birds and dinosaurs for that matter ) existed on this planet .
In an article that Smithsonian Magazine ran in 1992 about the discovery , it was noted that paleontologists call such anomalies as " problematica . "
Big problems indeed for scientists .
12 of 16 Ancient Springs , Screws , and Metal
They look like objects you 'd find in any workshop or machine shop scrap bin .
They are obviously manufactured .
Yet this assortment of metal springs , eyelets , spirals , and other metal objects was found in layers of sediment dated up to 100,000 years old .
There were n't many metal foundries in those days .
Thousands of these things — some as small as 1/10,000th of an inch — were discovered by gold miners in the Ural Mountains of Russia in the 1990s .
Dug up from a depth of three to 40 feet in layers of earth dating back to the upper Pleistocene era , these curious objects could be anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 years old .
Are they evidence of a long - lost but advanced civilization ?
13 of 16 Metal Rod Encased in Stone
How can we explain a stone that appears to have formed around a mysterious metal rod ?
Found by rock collector Zhilin Wang in the Mazong Mountains of China , the hard black rock has embedded within it a metal rod of unknown origin and purpose .
The rod has screw - like threads , suggesting that it was manufactured , yet the fact that it was in the ground long enough for hard rock to form around it means that it must be millions of years old .
It has even been suggested that the rock is a meteorite that fell to Earth from space , making it extraterrestrial in origin .
14 of 16 Aiud Aluminum Artifact
This 5 - pound , 8 - inch object of solid , nearly pure aluminum was found in Romania in 1974 .
Workers digging a trench along the Mures River discovered a couple of mastodon bones and this enigmatic object , over which scientists have puzzled ever since .
Clearly manufactured , the artifact was sent for analysis and was found to be composed of 89 percent aluminum with traces of copper , zinc , lead , cadmium , nickel , and other elements .
Aluminum in this form is not found free in nature , but must be manufactured and was n't produced in quantity until the 1800s .
If it is the same age as the mastodon bones , that would make it at least 11,000 years old , when the last of that species went extinct .
An analysis of the oxidized layer coating the artifact dated it to 300 to 400 years old — still well before the aluminum manufacturing process was invented .
Who made this object ?
And what was it used for ?
There are those who are quick , of course , to suggest it is of extraterrestrial origin ... but the facts are still unknown .
15 of 16 The Piri Reis Map Heritage Images / Getty Images / Getty Images
This map , rediscovered in 1929 in a Turkish museum , is a puzzlement , not only for its remarkable accuracy , but also for what it shows .
Drawn on gazelle skin , the Piri Reis map is part of a larger map , but only one half has survived .
It was compiled in the 1500s from , according to writing on the map itself , other maps dating back to around the year 300 .
But how can this be , given that the map shows a partial view of a southern continent where we now know Antarctica to be ( Antarctica was not discovered until 1820 ) ?

A Google image search for " tiger " yields many tiger photos - but also returns images of a tiger pear cactus stuck in a tire , a racecar , Tiger Woods , the boxer Dick Tiger , Antarctica , and many others .
Why ?
Today 's large Internet search engines look for images using captions or other text linked to images rather than looking at what is actually in the picture .
Electrical engineers from UC San Diego are making progress on a different kind of image search engine - one that analyzes the images themselves .
This approach may be folded into next - generation image search engines for the Internet ; and in the shorter term , could be used to annotate and search commercial and private image collections .
" You might finally find all those unlabeled pictures of your kids playing soccer that are on your computer somewhere , " said Nuno Vasconcelos , a professor of electrical engineering at the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering , and senior author of a paper in the March 2007 issue of the IEEE journal TPAMI - a paper coauthored by Gustavo Carneiro , a UCSD postdoctoral researcher now at Siemens Corporate Research , UCSD doctoral candidate Antoni Chan , and Google researcher Pedro Moreno .
At the core of this Supervised Multiclass Labeling ( SML ) system is a set of simple yet powerful algorithms developed at UCSD .
Once you train the system , you can set it loose on a database of unlabeled images .
The system calculates the probability that various objects or " classes " it has been trained to recognize are present - and labels the images accordingly .
After labeling , images can be retrieved via keyword searches .
Accuracy of the UCSD system has outpaced that of other content - based image labeling and retrieval systems in the literature .
The SML system also splits up images based on content - the historically difficult task of image segmentation .
For example , the system can separate a landscape photo into mountain , sky and lake regions .
" Right now , Internet image search engines do n't use any image content analysis .
They are highly scalable in terms of the number of images they can search but very constrained on the kinds of searches they can perform .
Our semantic search system is not fully scalable yet , but if we 're clever , we will be able to work around this limitation .
The future is bright , " said Vasconcelos .
The UCSD system uses a clever image indexing technique that allows it to cover larger collections of images at a lower computational cost than was previously possible .
While the current version would still choke on the Internet 's vast numbers of public images , there is room for improvement and many potential applications beyond the Internet , including the labeling of images in various private and commercial databases .
The UCSD Supervised Multiclass Labeling system " ... outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin , not only in terms of annotation and retrieval accuracy , but also in terms of efficiency , " the authors write in their TPAMI ( IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence ) paper .
What does Supervised Multiclass Labeling mean ?
Supervised refers to the fact that the users train the image labeling system to identify classes of objects , such as " tigers , " " mountains " and " blossoms , " by exposing the system to many different pictures of tigers , mountains and blossoms .
The supervised approach allows the system to differentiate between similar visual concepts - such as polar bears and grizzly bears .
In contrast , " unsupervised " approaches to the same technical challenges do not permit such fine - grained distinctions .
" Multiclass " means that the training process can be repeated for many visual concepts .
The same system can be trained to identify lions , tigers , trees , cars , rivers , mountains , sky or any concrete object .
This is in contrast to systems that can answer just one question at a time , such as " Is there a horse in this picture ? "
( Abstract concepts like " happiness " are currently beyond the reach of the new system , however . )
" Labeling " refers to the process of linking specific features within images directly to words that describe these features .
Scientists have previously built image labeling and retrieval systems that can figure out the contents of images that do not have captions , but these systems have a variety of drawbacks .
Accuracy has been a problem .
Also , some older systems need to be shown a picture and then can only find similar photos .
Other systems can only determine whether one particular visual concept is present or absent in an image .
Still others are unable to search through large collections of images , which is crucial for use in big photo databases and perhaps one day , the Internet .
The new system from the Vasconcelos team begins to addresses these open problems .
To understand SML , you need to start with the training process , which involves showing the system many different pictures of the same visual concept or " class , " such as a mountain .
When training the system to recognize mountains , the location of the mountains within the photos does not need to be specified .
This makes it relatively easy to collect the training examples .
After exposure to enough different pictures that include mountains , the system can identify images in which there is a high probability that mountains are present .
During training , the system splits each image into 8 - by - 8 pixel squares and extracts some information from them .
The information extracted from each of these squares is called a " localized feature . "
The localized features for an image are collectively known as a " bag of features . "
Next , the researchers pool together each " bag of features " for a particular visual concept .
This pooled information summarizes - in a computationally efficient way - the important information about each of the individual mountains .
Pooling yields a density estimate that retains the critical details of all the different mountains without having to keep track of every 8 by 8 pixel square from each of the mountain training images .
After the system is trained , it is ready to annotate pictures it has never encountered .
The visual concepts that are most likely to be in a photo are labeled as such .
In the tiger photo , the SML system processed the image and concluded that " cat , tiger , plants , leaf and grass " were the most likely items in the photograph .
The system , of course , can only label images with visual concepts that it has been trained to recognize .
" At annotation time , all the trained classes directly compete for the image .
The image is labeled with the classes that are most likely to actually be in the image , " said Vasconcelos .
One way to test the SML system is to ask it to annotate images in a database and then retrieve images based on text queries .
In the TPAMI paper , the researchers illustrate some of their image annotation and retrieval results for searches for the following classes : blooms , mountain , pool , smoke and woman .
In their paper , Vasconcelos and colleagues also document the similarities between SML 's automated image labeling and labeling done by humans looking at the same pictures .
The SML system can also split up a single image into its different regions - a process known as " image segmentation . "
When the system annotates an image , it assigns the most likely label to each group of pixels or localized feature , segmenting the image into its most likely parts as a regular part of the annotation process .
" Automated segmentation is one of the really hard problems in computer vision , but we 're starting to get some interesting results , " said Vasconcelos .
The SML project was started in 2004 by Gustavo Carneiro who was then a post doctoral researcher in the Vasconcelos lab .
Dr. Carneiro currently works at Siemens Corporate Research in Princeton , New Jersey .
Doctoral student Antoni Chan , the second author on the paper , spent a summer at Google testing the system on a cluster of 3,000 state - of - the - art Linux machines .
Chan worked under the guidance of Dr. Pedro Moreno , a Google researcher and author on the paper .
The results from the Google work indicate that the system can be used on large image collections , Chan explained .
" My students go to Google and do experiments at a scale that they can't do here .
The collaboration with Google allows us to use their resources to do things we could n't do otherwise , " said Vasconcelos .

A majority of Americans say the federal government should guarantee health insurance to every American , especially children , and are willing to pay higher taxes to do it , according to the latest New York Times / CBS News Poll .
While the war in Iraq remains the overarching issue in the early stages of the 2008 campaign , access to affordable health care is at the top of the public ’s domestic agenda , ranked as far more important than immigration , cutting taxes or promoting traditional values .
Only 24 percent said they were satisfied with President Bush ’s handling of the issue , despite his recent initiatives , and 62 percent said the Democrats — not the Republicans — were more likely to improve the health care system .
Americans showed a striking willingness in the poll to make tradeoffs for a better health care system , including paying as much as $ 500 more in taxes a year and forgoing future tax cuts .
But the same divisions that doomed the last attempt at creating universal health insurance , under the Clinton administration , are still apparent .
Americans remain divided , largely along party lines , over whether the government should require everyone to participate in a national health care plan , and over whether the government would do a better job than the private insurance industry in providing coverage .
Looking ahead to the presidential campaign , 36 percent of Americans said they had confidence in the ability of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , the New York Democrat , to “ make the right decisions on health care , ” while 49 percent said they were uneasy about it .
But Mrs. Clinton , who presents herself as a sadder but wiser candidate on health care , retained the confidence of nearly 6 in 10 Democrats on the issue , despite the politically devastating collapse 13 years ago of the national health initiative she helped develop early in her husband ’s presidency .
Have you heard ?
Evolution was spread by Jews in order to bring Christians to the devil .
Well that ’s what Rep. Ben Bridges ( R - GA ) believes anyways .
In a memo sent to lawmakers in California and Texas :
“ Indisputable evidence – long hidden but now available to everyone – demonstrates conclusively that so - called ‘ secular evolution science ’ is the Big Bang , 15 - billion - year , alternate ‘ creation scenario ’ of the Pharisee Religion , ” the memo said .
“ This scenario is derived concept - for - concept from Rabbinic writings in the mystic ‘ holy book ’ Kabbala dating back at least two millennia . ”
Now I was n’t aware that Darwin was able to time travel– I guess that ’s another strike against him because that ’d make him a witch or something .
And you tell me that Christians are the most discriminated against group of people in the United States ?
Give me a break .
This is an elected official in Congress– he represents people– spreading hatred and ignorance .
Am I the only one who sees why this may be a problem ?
But it gets worse , the memo was circulated by another elected official in Texas .
The memo directs people to the Fair Education Foundation , a group in Georgia , and gave its Web address , fixedearth.com .
The site features items belittling the Holocaust and portraying Earth as stationary as depicted in the Bible , with Jewish thinkers like “ Kabbalist physicist Albert Einstein ” responsible for contrary scientific theories .
The Jewish watchdog group the Anti-Defamation League condemned the memo calling it “ highly offensive . ”
Yes , let ’s blame the Jews for being intellectuals and for actually accepting the world around them for what it is .
Yes , let ’s insult those who believe in evolution by calling them Jews .
I do n’t get it , were the words meant as an insult ?
Was it meant as a strike against Judaism and a way to preserve “ traditional ” Christian values ?
I really do not understand where these lawmakers are coming from .
It just proves how desperate some people in religion can be in order to preserve a point that does n’t hold up to common sense .
It ’s sad really .
Paul Graham のマイクロソフトは死んだ（とその解説）への反響の大きさはある程度予想していたとはいえ、やはり驚いた。
前者は当サイトの文章で三つ目となるブックマーク数400超えを達成した。はてなブックマークポイントをくださった方に感謝する（オレのことか？

今回は特にブログなどでの言及が多かったので、以下主だった反応を淡々と紹介させてもらう。見落としているものもあったら申し訳ない。
個人的には 、Paul Graham が手がける Y Combinator、並びにそこから投資を受けたスタートアップに興味を示す反応がなかったのは残念だった。まあ、それは仕方ないのだけど、Shiro Kawai さんから大変面白い話を伺ったので、そのあたり（Kawai さんも以前に少し書かれてますが）についてまた機会があったら書くかも。
あとから振り返れば 、IBMを脅かすことになるMSはIBM絶頂期の1975年に生まれ、MSを脅かすことになるグーグルは、MSの絶頂期である1998
年あたりに生まれていたのだけれど、グーグルが絶頂期になると思われる2010〜15年あたりに、グーグルを脅かすことになる企業が産声をあげることになるのかもしれないとも思う。
いや、今年から来年が絶頂期なので、その企業は産声をあげているのです。その名前は……

Paul Graham のMicrosoft is Deadを yomoyomoが翻訳したマイクロソフトは死んだがなかなか面白い。

それがスラドクオリティ。
私が異を唱えたいと思っているのは 、Graham が再三言っている 「 desktop is over 」という事 。
Microsoft が敗戦処理にやっきになっている間、漁夫の利を得たのはGoogle です。しか しMicrosoft を殺した犯人とまでは呼べないのではないでしょうか。Microsoft がコケタのは、あくま でWintel の相棒であ るIntel が（熱処理に）失敗したから 。

Macworld 2007 is just days away .
Here 's a look at what 's likely to be revealed , some promising ideas that are less likely to get delivered , and things that have no chance of happening .
Part one covers the iPod family .
Three Apple Platforms
Macworld is n't just about the Mac , it ’s about everything Apple .
Apple ’s initial new platform was QuickTime .
It ported the media middleware to Windows in an effort to establish a multimedia development platform .
After languishing throughout the late 90s , QuickTime turned out to be a key enabler in developing Apple 's third platform : the iPod .
The Mac , QuickTime , and the iPod all overlap and integrate together in various ways , but each has its own development focus and strategy for the future .
The iPod has the most speculative potential because we know little of Apple 's actual plans .
Macworld 2007 promises to shed a lot of light on what will be happening with the iPod , its cousin the iTV , and the long rumored iPod Phone .
Here 's what to expect .
Part 1 : iPod , Phone , iTV
New iPods have come out at Macworld before : the iPod mini in 2004 and the iPod Shuffle in 2005 .
At Macworld 2006 , the new Nano and 5G iPods had just been released a few months prior , making it too soon to announce any new hardware .
This last fall there was a similar refresh , making it tough to predict what will happen at Macworld .
With so much else to announce , Apple could certainly coast by on the news of the iTV and Leopard , leaving a major iPod refresh for later in the year , as has typically been the case for new full size iPods .
At the same time however , the Sept 2005 5G iPod was only conservatively refreshed in September 2006 , leaving open the possibility for a major new replacement , incessantly dubbed the “ True Video iPod ” in rumor circles .
New iPod Hardware
Despite all the talk , video is n't the most useful feature in a handheld iPod , a point Apple made before even releasing video playback features on the iPod .
Currently the iPod is all about music , which -- as the iPod Shuffle has proven - - does n't even require a screen .
If Apple were to introduce a new iPod model with a larger screen , it would need to offer a higher resolution display and applications that made use of it ; a slightly bigger screen with the same picture would only rob battery life , a point made in regard to the iPod - Killer .
Generation 6 iPods envisioned two potential iPod devices based on the same hardware , pushing the iPod into the future as a personal organizer with messaging features .
• the first focused on business applications , with text messaging , web browsing , organizer functions , and email • the second , called the iPod Blogger , targets video recording , journaling , messaging and media playback
Outside of an iPod Phone or the iTV , if Apple releases a significant new 6G iPod device , it likely wo n't be at Macworld .
However , along with the iTV , it is likely Apple will introduce new information about iPod software designed to run on all iPod family devices .
i Pod Software
The iPod itself is a closed software platform .
The only software users can put on it is QuickTime content in iTunes , with one exception : iPod games .
Apple added iPod games to the mix rather cautiously , conservatively venturing to even include several from third parties , including two more just recently released by EA Games : Sudoku and Royal Solitaire .
However , iPod games are digitally signed so that they have to be authorized and sold through iTunes .
There can be no iPod shareware , because game development is n’t open , or is the market for selling or distributing games .
This is similar to the practice common among hardware game consoles , where third party developers have to license software in order to develop titles .
In other words , developers can't just design a game , they have to license the right to participate with Nintendo , Sony or other console makers .
Proprietary Balance
Free software and homebrew projects offer the potential to drive new and interesting applications .
However , they can also introduce software instability and security issues .
The fault of many computer crashes is problematic third party software .
This issue is something Apple will have to balance carefully .
Since Apple currently controls the entire market for iPod software , it has valid reasons to prefer keeping things bound to iTunes .
This solves a handful of issues :
• prevents malicious software ( there are no PlayStation viruses ) • prevents adware or low quality shovelware from diluting the brand • prevents sloppy development from introducing security and stability problems • creates a sustainable market for iPod games development by limiting piracy
How much control Apple continues to exercise over the platform becomes far more interesting as the iPod marches toward being more than just a music player .
iTV and Software
The first step into new iPod territory has already been announced : the tentatively named iTV .
While the iPod works great as a simple music player , the iTV begs to enter five content categories defined earlier in the series How Apple Will Change TV .
These applications can be all driven by Apple , but partnerships with others will dramatically increase the iTV 's appeal .
Opening the system up to Internet videos for various sources , and allowing it to interoperate with accessory devices such as DVRs like the Tivo both seem like obvious wins , and interactive content , from games to references and related tools , offer many new possibilities .
The iPod Phone
Earlier articles described how Apple could bring iPod features into the world of mobile phones .
It would be hard to imagine that Apple would remain silent on the topic at Macworld , but even an announced Apple phone might not be immediately available .
Macworld Scorecard : iPod , Phone , iTV
Likely to be revealed
• iTV • iPod family software initiatives • iPod Phone
Promising ideas that are less likely to get delivered
• New 6G iPod
No chance of happening
• iPod Origami device running Mac OS X CE

It makes sense to associate the word " launch , " previously for boats and rocket ships , with the release of new websites .
The word evokes the landing pad , crowds of onlookers , and the fact that the craft , from the moment the countdown ends , could suddenly explode , raining loose tiles and human remains over southern Florida .
( Trivia : Cocoa Beach , Florida , insiders call an exploding shuttle a " NASA rainbow " and its residue " ' nautchunks . "
[ Not really . ] )
I just launched a new site for work .
It took about eighteen months to get it into shape to put it into the world .
I had help along the way -- especially at the end , when I was able to hire a friend to help me with database work and my fiance to help me wrangle scans -- and I re-used a lot of work other people had done .
But basically the thing that made the project happen was me beavering away at a stack of books 100 feet tall , trying to turn them into files on a hard disk .
I have plenty to learn , I learned , but I 'm a passable beaverer .
Verbwise , I scanned , revised , converted , ocred , contracted , phoned , disputed , layered , sorted , aligned , tested , coded , indented , debugged , edited , blurred , sharpened , managed , advised , wept , styled , worried , refactored , and uploaded .
Huge events : moving in with Mo , the death of a friend , professional failures , people drifting off to new states or countries -- all happened within the boundaries of the task , with its ever - changing requirements and shimmering deadline , and I was bound to those old magazine pages like a 19th - century whaler was bound to the sea ( sans hardtack ) .
Finally on April 1 it was over .
I decided along the way that this project was a final hurrah of my geek self .
The landmarks of the last year - and - a - half are impersonal , like resume lines : " arranged purchase of Fujitsu 5750 c scanner ; figured out page alignment strategy ; built RDF - based CMS with smart caching . "
In the future ( actually , the now ) I 'll go home nights , make schedules , and keep receipts .
By September I 'll be married , seeing movies , and remembering birthdays .
But back to April 1 : To launch you flip a switch .
One server goes down ; another comes up , and the new thing is alive .
( This time was n't like the time in 1996 , when I was 22 and erased 33,000 user accounts .
I have grown . )
Brace yourself for the initial angry wave of criticism : how dare you , I hate it , it 's ugly , you 're stupid .
The Internet runs on knee - jerk reactions .
People will test your work against their pet theories :
It is not free , and thus has no value ; it lacks community features ; I can't believe you do n't use dotcaps , lampsheets , or pixel scrims ; it is not written in Rusp or Erskell ; my cat is displeased .
The ultimate question lurks beneath these curses : why was n't I consulted ?
You take the criticism into consideration no matter how much vitriol wraps it , file away bug reports where appropriate , reply politely if it 's worth it , and shrug .
Then wait a few days .
Now comes the more significant feedback -- possibly praise , and , if you are lucky , not opinions but problems -- things that you can think about and fix .
Some people are trusting and friendly ; others swear and append " I AM VERY UNHAPPY " to their emails in misdirected righteousness .
Again , you must shrug .
People are used to complaining to faceless organizations that do n't respect them , and often assume an offensive posture , expecting that a display of anger will gain your attention .
They do n't understand that you are the team in I .
The only option is politeness -- remember always that you are dealing with other primates .
You fix the first bugs , and then a few more bugs .
There is still a ton of work to do , onward and ever , a billion scratches that must be buffed , but it does n't need to be done at once .
It 's time for your victory lap .
Instead , the fever to finish is sucked out of your gut and replaced with heavy stones .
You can barely lift your legs .
Expect a terrible depression .
I have now between five and ten newly empty hours a day , and the things I pushed away - - seeing friends , writing fiction , eating off of plates - - do n't return naturally .
The project is gone , taking with it the nearly monastic order it gave to life .
In its place there is : one , the need for praise ( even if they march you down the hall on their shoulders it will never fill up the well ) , two , the sense of failure ( all those problems left unsolved , all the rough edges and clutter that you could n't distill to simplicity ) , and three , the sudden awareness of insignificance ( all you have done is to turn on another blinking screen among the blinking billions in the media night sky ) .
If you work for a startup you can fool yourself into believing that the reward will be eternal wealth , but I work for a nonprofit , and the reward is : I did a thing , and I doubt I 'll ever do anything like it again .
One , two , three : I will never get enough praise ; of course I failed ; and what I did was not particularly important .
The best thing to hope for is that in time and with much more effort the work will become transparent to its users , that it will be taken for granted .
That 's life with websites .
Russian software firm Intelore has developed a password recovery program for OpenOffice.org that can recover encrypted documents even when the password used for the original encryption has been lost .
In addition to recovering passwords , the program can be used to remove various types of document protection , such as document ReadOnly protection , revision marking protection , protection of sections in OpenOffice Writer , protection of cells in OpenOffice Writer tables , automatic protection of indexes and tables , and OpenOffice Calc document protection .
A noncommercial license costs $ 79 , while the full version will set you back $ 129 .
A free but limited evaluation version is available to try the program out .
The program works by a combination of brute - force password guessing and dictionary attacks .
If the user can remember any details about the password , such as the fact that it contains a natural word , or starts with a capital letter , they can select these options before starting the cracking process to reduce the amount of time it takes to find the password .
The exact amount of time depends on the length and complexity of the password and the speed of the computer doing the cracking , but Intelore assures that it only takes a " reasonable amount of time " to do so .
Typical cracking times are between one and ten hours , but can be much less if hints are provided by the user .
The program runs on Windows 95/98 / ME , Windows NT 4 , Windows 2000 , Windows XP , and Windows Vista .
These sorts of password cracking programs are hardly new — in fact , they have been around nearly as long as password protection itself .
Utilities for removing password - protection from popular programs such as Adobe Acrobat Reader have been popular with businesses who wish to recover their own files where the original password has been forgotten , or even do a little unauthorized cutting and pasting from someone else 's documents .
The fact that a commercial password cracking utility has been released for OpenOffice.org , however , is an indication that the open - source software suite is making significant gains in popularity , particularly in the business sector .
Intelore already provides similar utilities for programs such as Microsoft Office , Outlook , Simply Accounting , and the WinRAR archiver .
Not all password recovery programs require the use of a brute - force method : lost passwords for some accounting packages and Outlook Express are recovered " instantly " by Intelore 's recovery software , as is the case with some PDF recovery tools .
Some software either does not use strong encryption , or stores passwords in an easily - recoverable format in the file itself .
In the case of OpenOffice.org , nothing about the program itself has been compromised , as the brute - force solution remains the only method available to recover encrypted documents .
Still , even strong encryption can be broken given enough computing power and time , and users who wish to keep their documents protected should look into third - party solutions such as PGP that can use much longer encryption keys , rather than relying on built - in solutions .
The love of phrases may help boost the use of some nouns in the list
Oxford University
Press researchers looked on the internet at newspapers , journals , fictions and weblogs to take a snapshot of our everyday language .
" Person " was ranked at number two , while " man " reached number seven and " woman " was behind at number 14 .
The new " common words " section put " work " in 15th place , but " play " and " rest " were not in the top 100 nouns .
The section is included in the revised 11th edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary , which is viewed as a guide to our evolving language .
TOP 10 NOUNS 1 Time 2 Person 3 Year 4 Way 5 Day 6 Thing 7 Man 8 World 9 Life 10 Hand
The subject of time is also a common theme , with " year " being the third most common noun , " day " in fifth place and " week " at 17 .
The OUP researchers also found that " government " made a strong showing in the list at number 20 , but we appear to mention " war " , at number 49 , more than " peace " - which was not in the top 100 nouns .
The 100 most common words were expected ones such as " the " , " to " and " of " .
But researchers found looking at the most common nouns provided an interesting insight .
OUP project manager Angus Stevenson said much of the frequency of the use of words such as " time " and " man " could be put down to the English love of phrases , such as " time waits for no man . "
" The thing that struck me when I put together this list was that 90 % of the top 100 words were one syllable , and that a large proportion were actually from Old English , meaning the basic words we use all the time in basic sentences are from before the Norman Conquest , " he said .
" We always put the focus on new words , changing language and words from other countries , but in reality the basic language we use has been the same for hundreds and hundreds of years . "
Television is in transition .
Viewership is down , and in recent months , the major networks have been cautiously stepping away from their traditional broadcast model in an attempt to broaden their audiences .
The latest effort comes from ABC , which is offering full episodes of some programs online for free .
We reported on this development last month when ABC first announced its plans .
Currently limited to episodes of Commander in Chief , Alias , Desperate Housewives , and Lost , ABC 's new service uses Flash 8 for the video , meaning that anyone with a Flash - enabled browser can watch the programming on any platform .
Each show has a sponsor and contains four 30 - second commercials that can not be skipped .
The programs are divided up into sections that are bracketed by the commercials , and viewers can scrub back and forth through any part of the program up to the next commercial break .
According to the FAQ , ABC is only planning on making the episodes available until the end of June .
At that time , ABC Full Episode Streaming will go on hiatus at least until the new fall season .
The shows are available only to US residents , but enterprising surfers should be able to find a way around that .
For now , it appears that only the four shows listed above will be made available during the trial .
The two parties that are affected the most by ABC 's new offering are the network 's local affiliates and Apple .
Affiliates , which have been getting the short end of the stick on some of the networks ' recent moves , may be short - changed on viewership if Desperate Housewives fans find something else to do on Sunday nights knowing that they 'll be able to watch the episode later .
If ABC and its affiliates can create something along the lines of what NBC has done , it may ameliorate those concerns somewhat .
Similarly , Apple may see a loss in sales as fans of Lost decide not to drop a couple of bucks on a show they can watch for free online .
Ultimately , it 's the viewers that will decide whether ABC 's experiment will be a success and ultimately expanded to cover more of ABC 's lineup .
Having shows available on demand , on any platform , and for free in exchange for a few commercials and a sponsorship seems like a reasonable tradeoff to me .
Whether ABC 's partners agree is another matter entirely .
Today 's Code Snippet comes from Rob O. Rob was working in a company ( as a contractor ) on different projects for almost a year before he was asked to sit in on a meeting with two vendors and two business analysts .
Rob failed to notice during the discussion one of the third parties furiously writing notes every time they were asked about XML .
They had not gotten very far with the technical details of the project , but the business analysts knew what they wanted .
Buzz - word compliance .
The buzz - word : XML .
When Rob was not being ignored like a third - grade class - president ( I have no idea what that means ) he was being asked if his system would be able to handle sending and receiving the various files and messages as XML which , of course , it could .
What Rob failed to notice during the discussion was how one of the third parties was furiously writing notes every time they were asked about XML .
" Yes , " they would reply with an enthusiastic nod , " Our system will handle XML . "
Many months passed , and then one bright Autumn day , Rob was given the specification and began working .
After discovering the technical documentation was severely lacking , he requested an example file .
Here is that file .

Where ’s the old site ?
We had some good times did n’t we ?
Unfortunately , all good things must eventually end .
We decided to close down the old site as it was no longer viable in its current form .
Over time , advertising revenue from banner ads ( the old method used to raise funds by the site ) declined dramatically to the point where each click was no longer generating significant revenue .
So sadly ( and after much deliberation ) we felt it was best to redirect users to directly donate to one of our trusted charity partners , WaterAid .
How did Ripple start ?
Ripple was started by a small group of friends with a passion to harness the power of the internet to drive change and raise funds for community aid .
Ripple was a purely non-profit initiative that we all worked on in our spare time aside from our full - time jobs .
Thank you .
Over the journey , we were successful in raising a significant amount of funds for our charity partners .
Over 1.2 million users visited the site from all over the world .
We were continually amazed and gratified by the commitment of the passionate Ripple community .
To everyone who helped , assisted , or contributed with Ripple over the journey : you ’re amazing and thank you .
Thanks ,
The ripple Team
Mr. Pinochet was brutal : More than 3,000 people were killed by his government and tens of thousands tortured , mostly in his first three years .
Thousands of others spent years in exile .
i.e .
Like it or not , Mr. Pinochet had something to do with this success .
To the dismay of every economic minister in Latin America , he introduced the free - market policies that produced the Chilean economic miracle -- and that not even Allende 's socialist successors have dared reverse .
Both did tolerate limited apposition , including opposition newspapers and political parties , but both were also confronted by radical , violent opponents bent on social and political revolution .
Both rulers , therefore , sometimes invoked martial law to arrest , imprison , exile , and occasionally , it was alleged , torture their opponents .
Both relied for public order on police forces whose personnel were said to be too harsh , too arbitrary , and too powerful .
I think this is the context in which you have to understand American conservatism 's generally blasé attitude toward the Bush administration 's more modest ventures into the fields of arbitrary detention , corruption , and torture .
Years of apologizing for the deployment of such tactics by America 's proxies abroad naturally desensitizes the political culture to the re-importation of these methods to the center .
Traditional autocrats leave in place existing allocations of wealth , power , status , and other resources which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few and maintain masses in poverty .
But they worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos .
They do not disturb the habitual rhythms of work and leisure , habitual places of residence , habitual patterns of family and personal relations .
Because the miseries of traditional life are familiar , they are bearable to ordinary people who , growing up in the society , learn to cope , as children born to untouchables in India acquire the skills and attitudes necessary for survival in the miserable roles they are destined to fill .
Such societies create no refugees .
e.g .
Two caveats that ought to be self - evident but will not be to some : ( 1 ) Nothing here is intended to equate ( or not equate ) the quantity or extent of the human rights abuses of the Pinochet regime and the Bush administration ; the point is that the underlying , justifying mindset is similar ; and ( 2 ) Kirkpatrick 's argument is well - argued and makes several other points besides the one highlighted here , including a very persuasive case
against the foolish and inevitably futile attempt to " democratize " other countries that have no history of democracy .
The Editorial Page of The Washington Post today lavishly praised right - wing Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
The Editorial begins with the cursory ( really almost bored and resentful ) acknowledgement that " [ Pinochet ] was the epitome of an evil dictator . "
Why would the dreaded , unnamed " some " shriek that Pinochet was an " evil dictator " ?
No good reason ; only this :
The Post even belittles the contempt expressed for Pinochet by claiming that it is due less to his murder and torture of political opponents -- that can't possibly be the real reason -- and is driven instead by the fact that " he helped to overthrow , with U.S. support , an elected president , whose responsibility for creating the conditions for the 1973 coup is usually overlooked .
" So , with the Rush Limbaugh / National Review straw man in place ( , Pinochet is only hated in " some " circles because he was pro-U.S. and overthrew a darling of the socialist - anti- American - internationalist - left ) , the Post builds its case that Pinochet is , on balance , an admirable figure despite his bad points ( murder , terrorism , torture ) : " It 's hard not to notice , however , that the evil dictator leaves behind the most successful country in Latin America .
" To the Post , Pinochet 's " excesses " are mitigated , perhaps even outweighed , by his noble embrace of capitalism ( via which he enriched himself with hundreds of millions of dollars ) :
The Post Editorial , appropriately enough , concludes with a reverent embrace of Jeane Kirkpatrick 's signature belief " that right - wing dictators such as Mr. Pinochet were ultimately less malign than communist rulers , in part because their regimes were more likely to pave the way for liberal democracies . "
Concludes The Post : " [ Kirkpatrick ] , too , was vilified by the left .
Yet by now it should be obvious :
She was right .
" It is hard to overstate just how radical and extraordinary it is -- though also unsurprising and revealing -- for the Post , particularly in our current political climate , to expressly embrace Augusto Pinochet and to endorse Kirkpatrick 's seminal pro-dictatorship article , titled " Dictatorship and Double Standards , " which was published in Commentary in November , 1979 ( the headline of the Post 's Editorial tracks Kirkpatrick 's title ) .
Kirkpatrick 's article is now proudly displayed on the website of the American Enterprise Institute , where it belongs .
The crux of Kirkpatrick 's argument was a defense of American support for right - wing dictatorships ( the euphemism she used was " traditional autocrats " ) , including those which employ " martial law " to imprison and even torture their political opponents . *
Critically , Kirkpatrick defended such dictatorships not only on the ground that supporting them promotes U.S. interests , but also on the ground that such dictatorships are more benign than left - wing dictatorships ( " revolutionary autocrats " ) and , beyond that , are even justified in their human rights abuses given the nature of the opposition they face .
In defending the regimes of the Iranian Shah and the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza -- again , defending not only U.S. support for them , but defending the dictatorships themselves -- this is what Kirkpatrick wrote :
The word " therefore " in that passage is amazing .
It signifies Kirkpatrick 's belief that these dictators ' reliance upon martial law , " harsh " and " arbitrary " personal police forces , and even torture were understandable , if not outright justifiable .
After all , the opposition the dictators faced was " violent " and was seeking " social and political revolution . "
Under the circumstances , ca n't we all appreciate the need for some hard - nosed , " extra- legal " tactics where rulers get their hands dirty in order to preserve order ?
Western precepts of due process and revulsion towards torture are nice , esoteric luxuries and all , but when faced with revolutionary savages bent on radical change , the implication of Kirkpatrick 's argument is that one simply can't afford to abide by those nicities ( hence the " therefore " ) .
A little -- or even a lot of -- torture and arbitrary imprisonment in order to preserve security and crush the evil ones might be just what is needed .
That is also a pure and complete summary of the current mindset of the Bush administration and its followers and enablers ( including The Washington Post Editorial page ) with regard to the administration 's lawbreaking and its worst excesses .
Objections to the Bush administration 's human rights abuses , total disregard for basic precepts of due process , and its reliance on " coercive interrogation " methods are routinely dismissed away by pointing to -- just as Kirkpatrick did -- the extreme and savage character of the Enemy , which renders such measures not only justifiable but even necessary .
As long as the government continues to defend the free market and only uses such methods against those who really deserve it , that 's something we can all tolerate , even appreciate .
One can draw a short and straight line from Kirkpatrick 's defense of right - wing dictatorships to the Bush administration 's ongoing abuses . *
As Matt Yglesias wrote yesterday in response to various right - wing commentators exhibiting a bizarre reluctance to criticize Pinochet : The Washington Post 's editorial enabling of most ( though admittedly not all ) of the Bush administration 's excesses over the past five years is clearly grounded in the Kirkpatrickian view that sometimes such measures are necessary to preserve order and security , and can never been seen as " pure evil " as long as they are imposed by a government committed to the free market .
What is so striking is that , in the aftermath of 9/11 , that justifying mindset , previously used to defend third - world dictatorships , was so seamlessly imported into the domestic policies of the United States .
This is how Kirkpatrick defined the " traditional autocracies " which she defended :
Objectively speaking , Kirkpatrick 's description of the virtues of " traditional autocracy " sound quite similar to the vision which Bush followers and certain elite enablers ( Fred Hiatt and similar Beltway pundits ) have of the Ideal America today .
Despite the radical transformation of our national character over the last five years , The Washington Post continues to be able to earn money and enjoy the rewards of the free market .
We continue to " worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos . "
And Bush officials " leave in place existing allocations of wealth , power , status , and other resources which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few .
" Just as Kirkpatrick argued in 1979 -- and as the Post implicitly endorsed today -- we can all live with some torture and arbitrary arrests and detentions .
And we must always keep in mind that things could always be worse -- at least the Bush administration ( like Pinochet ) is keeping taxes low and corporate profits high .
So our view of its human rights abuses ( like our view of Pinochet 's ) should be tempered by our appreciation for its rejection of socialism .
Thus , argues the Post ( following along with the illustrious Jonah Goldberg , among others ) , let 's set torture and lawbreaking and indefinite detention to the side .
At least George Bush ( and Pincochet ) are n't Fidel Castro .
That this has become the Post 's measuring stick for our own government explains much about the last five years in this country . :
The homage paid by Fred Hiatt to Augusto Pinochet would likely baffle Ariel Dorfman , whose New York Times Op - Ed today ( h/t Kovie ) examines the lingering and tragic effects on Chile of Pinochet 's despotism .
Hiatt 's admiration for Pinochet would also likely be baffling to what Dorfman describes as the " thousands upon thousands of Chileans who spontaneously poured into the streets here to celebrate the news of his extinction . " :
Even Paul Miregnoff and David Frum -- let 's say that again : even Paul Mirengoff and David Frum -- recognize what a vicious and vile tyrant Augusto Pinochet was .
To Fred Hiatt : if you find yourself cheering on a right - wing dictator who is too despotic even for Powerline ( Pionchet responsible for " a bloody campaign of repression " ) and David Frum ( Pinochet unleashed " a spasm of cruelty and violence unprecedented in the country 's history " ) , that ought to be a fairly convincing signal that you 've fallen into some pretty morally depraved territory .
On a separate note : Ezra Klein makes a good point here , and I hope people will listen to his suggestion about what should be done about it .

Icons by Peter GrundyWhen the next world - crushing disaster strikes — tsunami , quake , dirty bomb , whatever — one thing is certain :
You 're on your own .
As hurricanes Katrina and Rita showed , help may not arrive for 72 hours .
Do n't fret .
Wired has your back with these shopping lists for your DIY emergency kit .
Because when everything goes to hell , you 'll want gear that gives you an evolutionary advantage over your less - prepared neighbors .
Clip and save ; lock and load .
The House Kit
Store all this gear in a sealed plastic trash can or containers .
It wo n't cost as much as you think :
You probably own most of this stuff already .
__A. First aid __You could buy the $ 25 kit from Red Cross .
Or you could build your own : bandages , alcohol , cotton balls , antidiarrheals , anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen , and prescription meds .
__B. Clothes __A full change , including warm outer layers ( wool or synthetic ) and sturdy shoes , for each person under your roof .
__C. Plastic sheeting __Fiber - reinforced , laminated polyethylene film , 0.006 inches ** thick .
You can buy 1,200 square feet of Dura Skrim DS2 for about $ 100 .
Or get a tarp — for covering broken windows , roofs .
__D. Zip ties __Handy when you have to make splints , compression bandages , or tourniquets .
__E . Water __A gallon per person , per day .
For a family of four , that 's 12 gallons .
If you have the space for that , great .
If not , keep as much as you can manage .
Have unscented bleach on hand , too — 16 drops in a gallon and you 've got potable H 2 0 .
Tea bags make it taste OK .
__F. Food __Raid the pantry : dehydrated soups , canned tuna and veggies , nuts and candy .
Peanut butter is high - calorie and has a long shelf life .
You can also buy freeze - dried camping meals .
__G. Flashlight __We like the Inova X5 — it 's water - resistant , aircraft - grade anodized aluminum and uses LEDs .
But a cheap drugstore version and some batteries will do just fine .

__I . Tools __A crowbar to pry debris that might stand between you and a loved one .
An adjustable wrench .
Screwdrivers .

Get the kind marked waterproof and windproof and store 'em in a ziplock bag .
In another bag , hoard some dryer lint for kindling .
The Go Pack
Keep these items in a backpack that 's readily accessible — you know , in case you have to bail at a moment 's notice .
One bag per person .
__K. Radio __A cheap transistor set with batteries is fine .
Or you could get something that 'll pick up TV and NOAA bands and that has a hand crank , like the Eton Grundig FR300 — it comes with a cell phone charging jack and built - in flashlight .
If you want to splurge , see page 95 .
__L. Cash __$ 500 in small bills .
ATMs wo n't work when the power is out , and neither will credit card readers .
__M. Documents __A copy of your home insurance policy , plus contact numbers , medical insurance card , passport , driver 's license , bank records , and photos of family members .
( A local map and spare keys may come in handy , too . )
__N. Mylar space blanket __It 's a super - compact means of both keeping warm and reflecting heatstroke - causing rays of sun .
__O. Clothes __Put spares in a waterproof bag .
Remember a hat .
Toss in a few basic toiletries , too , like a toothbrush and toilet paper .
__P. Food __Make room for sports nutrition or candy bars .

Include a bottle of water .
__Q. Essential medicines __Whatever you 've been prescribed , plus sunblock and ibuprofen or acetaminophen .
__R . Duct tape __Well , duh .
__S. Signal devices __Roadside flares will do .
Or you could get Greatland Laser 's Rescue Laser Flare — two AA batteries and you have 72 hours of 20 - mile - visible brightness .
Also try the Fox 40 whistle ( 115 dB ! ) .
__T. Multitool __Whether you come down on the Swiss Army side or the Leatherman side of the greatest debate of our time , just have one with you .
Make sure it has a can opener , a good knife blade , and both Phillips and flat - head screwdrivers .

Carlos Mencia is one contradicting sonuvagun .
Pardon my French .
I used to think that Dane Cook was the worst entertainer of the decade but after watching this , I ’m starting to have second thoughts .
Mencia was always second worst in my book and after seeing this video it ’s merely adding fuel to the fire .
Normally , when I create a blog post I ’ll submit a video of the performer ’s 20 + minute stand - up performance , but this particular post is about an on -stage feud between Carlos Mencia and Joe Rogan .
What ’s most surprising to me is how the crowd seems to side with Rogan even though they ’re at a Carlos Mencia performance .
The video provides numerous examples of jokes that Mencia has stolen from other comics throughout his comedic career ( and I use that term loosely ) , that his real name is possibly Ned , that he may not even be Mexican , and several other comedians ’ personal opinions on Mencia .
Another interesting point I found is that Mencia had the YouTube video of this removed from the website ( here ) for copyright infringement .
So , instead you can watch the video on Break.com here .
It ’s kind of hard to understand what Joe Rogan is saying since he does n’t have a microphone in the beginning but eventually he gets a really low - volume one .
You can also read more from Joe Rogan ’s website and how he is now banned from the comedy club .
" An article written by one of the agency 's historians for its classified publication , Cryptologic Quarterly , declaring that his review of the complete intelligence shows beyond doubt ' no attack happened that night . '
Claims that North Vietnamese boats attacked two warships that Aug. 4 - just two days after an initial assault on one of those ships - rallied Congress behind Johnson 's buildup of the war .
The Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed three days later empowered him to take ' all necessary steps ' in the region and opened the way for large - scale commitment of U.S. forces ...
A report from the National Security Agency states that the attack on U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin used as the rationale for escalation of the war in Vietnam never happened .
The article , by NSA historian Robert J. Hanyok , reviews signals intelligence , or SIGINT , from that time and concludes top administration officials were only given material supporting the claim of an Aug.
4 attack - not the wealth of contradictory intelligence ...
' In truth , Hanoi 's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on 2 August , ' Hanyok wrote .
He said ' the handful of SIGINT reports which suggested that an attack had occurred contained severe analytical errors , unexplained translation changes , and the conjunction of two unrelated messages into one translation .
This latter product would become the Johnson administration 's main proof of the Aug. 4 attack . ' "

So much for an impartial press .
This is actually quite serious .
If the White House Correspondents Association is so afraid of doing anything that criticizes the president , even in jest , then how does this affect their reporting ?
How can these people write fair , accurate and impartial stories about the increasing woes of this administration if they are so fearful of any speech that may upset this administration ?
From Attytood :
Little said organizers of the event made it clear they do n't want a repeat of last year 's controversial appearance by Stephen Colbert , whose searing satire of President Bush and the White House press corps fell flat and apparently touched too many nerves .
" They got a lot of letters , " Little said Tuesday .
" I wo n't even mention the word ' Iraq . ' "
Little , who has n't been to the White House since he was a favorite of the Reagan administration , said he 'll stick with his usual schtick -- the impersonations of the past six presidents .
" They do n't want anyone knocking the president .
He 's really over the coals right now , and he 's worried about his legacy , " added Little , a longtime Las Vegas resident .
Poor embattled president .
Gosh , someone might tell a joke about him .
I mean , sure , he tortures people for a living , throw out habeas corpus , illegally spies on our phone conversations and the US mail , and oh yeah , killed 35,000 civilians in Iraq this past year alone - but having a joke told about him ... now that crosses the line .
The White House Correspondents Association is pitiful .
You call yourself journalists .
And you wonder why we criticize you ?
You people are pathetic .
Journalism is n't about getting people to like you .
It 's about reporting the news , the facts , the truth , and hopefully making the world a better place while so doing .

Saturday February 10 , 2007
The Guardian
There are some things which are so self - evidently right and good that it ’s hard to imagine how anyone could disagree with you .
The “ open access ” academic journal movement is one of those things .
It ’s a no-brainer .
Academic literature should be freely available : developing countries need access ; part time tinkering thinkers like you deserve full access ; journalists and the public can benefit ; and most importantly of all , you ’ve already paid for much of this stuff with your taxes , they are important new ideas from humanity , and morally , you are entitled to them .
But with old school academic journals , unless you have an institutional subscription , you have to pay to read them .
Here ’s a not - so - fun example : an article called “ Impediments to promoting access to global knowledge in sub-Saharan Africa ” , about how difficult it is to get access to medical literature in developing countries , and how lack of access to knowledge represents a barrier to economic development and a further advantage for the rich West .
Get your credit card ready , this single study costs $ 25 plus tax to read .
Two online , open access publishing organizations have led the fight against the absurdity : one is PLOS , from a Californian campaigning perspective , and the other is Biomed Central , run as a money making empire ( relax , there is nothing wrong with making money from publishing ) .
They both give readers access for free , but they ’ve not had an easy time of it .
Firstly , they ca n’t get journalists to directly link to their studies .
I suspect newspapers like to fantasise that they are mediators between specialist tricky knowledge and the wider public , but I would n’t be so flattering .
In fact , if you have access to the original journals , you can see just how rubbish things can get .
Last year the Times had a piece on paroxetine and suicide risk .
The opening line was : “ ONE of Britain ’s most widely prescribed antidepressants has been linked to a seven - fold increase in suicide attempts . ”
Complete and utter nonsense .
Totally factually incorrect .
The study was published in an open access journal , to which the paper did not link , online or in print , but you can go and read the journal article for yourself , and see if you can spot their error ( clue : the placebo group was smaller than the treatment group ) .
I could n’t write this column without my institutional login .
Between medical jobs with academic affiliations I ’ve had to hustle logins from friends .
There are times when I ’ve had to use the London Underground as a way of transporting information into my brain instead of the internet .
Even in the 20th century this would have been ridiculous .
And a lot of this stuff is really interesting .
You totally missed out if you did n’t read the recent “ medicalisation and disease mongering ” special issue of PLOS Medicine .
Richard Smith ’s article on drug companies and medical journals is cracking .
Pay for his book , if you like books , but this is all free .
In fact , I would say that plenty of academic journal “ commentary ” articles are a lot more interesting than intellectual glossies like Prospect that sit in your loo .
But meanwhile , the old school pay - for - access journals are so worried about OA that they ’ve hired Eric Dezenhall , the famous American “ Pitbull of PR ” , and author of “ Nail ’em : Confronting High - Profile Attacks on Celebrities and Businesses “ , to aggressively promote their interests , and undermine OA .
And these closed journals are hardly the kind of people whose pockets you ’d want to line .
Reed -Elsevier , for example , is one of the largest academic journal publishers in the world – they even own the Lancet â€ “ and they are the same company that runs the DSEI international arms fair in London , selling vile weapons to murderous regimes for cash profit extracted from very real suffering and pain , in countries you will never visit on holiday .
These people do not deserve our charity , and I will be very pleased to see you outside DSEI later this year , 300th copper from the left : because when you ’re so wrong you need police , security , wire fences , and the pitbull of PR to defend you , then you know you ’re in trouble .
[ I ’d have liked to have written more about this , looking at self archiving vs OA journals etc , as two emailers have pointed out ]
You can hear me talk ( somewhat incoherently ) about this at a colloquium on open access at the royal college of physicians , here :
blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/
The Richard Smith talk at the same event is particularly entertaining .
Itâ€™s happened with predictable regularity , every spring since International Bird Rescue Research Center ( IBRRC ) opened its center in San Pedro in 2001 .
The staff at the center , which specializes in seabirds , and especially California brown pelicans , calls it DA ; short for Domoic Acid .
This spring is different .
Itâ€™s much worse , affecting more species of birds , pinepeds and possibly even whales .
Beaches are littered with dead birds , seals , dolphins , otters , and in Santa Barbara a 29 foot sperm whale washed ashore .
The reasons for the deaths are not entirely certain , however , many of the animals tested were positive for domoic acid poisoning .
More : Domoic Acid
Jay Holcomb , IBRRCâ€™s director has many questions , but not enough answers .
â€ œI have been doing this work for 35 years and I have never seen anything like this as far as the number of species affected , other than an oil spill , â€  Holcomb said .
â€ œWe have very serious concerns about what is happening to seabirds , and how it may affect populations , especially California brown pelicans , who are heading into breeding season .
The loss of breeding adults at this time may impact the next generation as well , â€  Holcomb said .
( California brown pelicans are still on the Endangered Species List , but have been petitioned for de-listing ) .
Pelicans with domoic acid poisoning , which affects the brain , can have seizures while flying , causing them to literally fall from the sky .
Some have crashed into car windshields or ended up in places they shouldnâ€™t be , like airport runways and freeways .
Holcomb believes many seabirds having seizures out at sea drown , making it virtually impossible to count the bodies .
Although domoic acid is a naturally occurring toxin produced by microscopic algae , something is making recent blooms of the algae especially virulent .
IBRRC is working closely with the Caron Laboratory at USC , providing body fluids from suspect birds for analysis .
Professor Dave Caron and Assistant Research Professor Astrid Schnetzer test the waters off Southern California and alert the center when domoic acid is present .
The staff then braces and prepares the ICU .
The only way to save the birds is to flush the toxins out of their systems , a labor intensive process .
This spring dead birds began littering beaches in March .
IBRRC rescue personnel walking the beaches reported â€œdead birds everywhere .â€
Species included grebes , gulls , cormorants , American avocets and loons .
Not all test positive for DA .
But other neurotoxins such as saxitoxin which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans , are also being examined by Dave Caron and Astrid Schnetzer .
They are studying the birds with the help of IBRRC staff who provide fresh blood and body fluids of all sick birds .
Long - time volunteer , Susan Kaveggia , orchestrates the sampling and has been instrumental in forging the relationship with USC .
The Marine Mammal Care Center , which is next door to IBRRC in Fort MacArthur , has been overwhelmed with sick seals and sea lions who eat the same fish as pelicans ; anchovies and sardines .
The fish eat the affected algae , which donâ€™t kill them , but the animals that eat the fish get concentrated amounts , depending on how many affected fish they eat .
Whether they live or die depends how much of the poison they ingest .
Many of these sick animals have been tested by Caron and Schnetzer .
More than half of those tested have been positive for DA over the past few days .
Humans have died from eating contaminated mussels .
Many times people donâ€™t know what made them sick so they donâ€™t report it to health authorities .
In humans , domoic acid poisoning can cause vomiting , nausea , diarrhea , abdominal cramps , headache , dizziness , confusion , disorientation , loss of short - term memory , motor weakness , seizures , cardiac arrhythmias , coma and possibly death .
Short term memory loss is permanent , thus the name Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning .
Birds and pinepeds exhibit similar symptoms .
Because the toxin affects the brain , the long term effects of DA poisoning arenâ€™t known , something that concerns Holcomb .
â€ œIn my opinion , domoic acid is the new DDT , â€ Holcomb said .
â€
œIf the effects of DA poisoning are cumulative in the brain , and we donâ€™t know that yet , it could have serious consequences on the population of California Brown Pelicans .
As of this point , we just donâ€™t know.â€ 
Global warming is thought to make algal blooms much worse by providing much better living conditions for algae .
Could this massive bloom be one of many that has recently been attributed to a warming climate ?
This is not the first time massive algal blooms have sprung up .
Lake Washington near Seattle has had problems with massive blooms .
People can be affected , too .
Climate change may be contributing to algal blooms , including a toxic variety that can trigger health warnings and beach closures .
Between late spring and fall , the average temperature in the lake ’s 30 - foot - deep top layer has climbed by more than 2 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit compared with readings taken four decades ago .
The lake ’s overall average temperature has increased by 1 degree .
“ It ’s only 1 degree , but it has huge effects , ” said UW researcher Monika Winder , who has published research on the warming trend .
Evidence of the new imbalance is mounting : * At the bottom of the food chain , some zooplankton — barely visible organisms that devour algae and are , in turn , devoured by juvenile salmon — are declining in numbers .
*
Rising temperatures are keeping the lake divided into warm and cool layers nearly a month longer than before , forcing some species of fish to seek refuge in lower depths where predators lurk .
* Salmon are swimming an ever - more tropical gantlet from the Ballard Locks to the lake .
New research shows that many of the sockeye traversing the locks later in the summer are n’t surviving to spawn in the Cedar River .
Last year , 200,000 sockeye — half the return — vanished before reaching the spawning grounds .
“ This is going to alarm people , ” said Dave Seiler , a salmon scientist with the state Department of Fish and Wildlife , “ but I think the story ought to come out . ” ( via )
Similarly Canada saw an absolutely HUGE bloom in June of last year .
So huge in fact that you could see it from space .

Hidden from the casual Mac user is a spiffy command line utility that allows you to view , configure , and troubleshoot your Mac ’s wireless connection , entirely from the Terminal of MacOS and Mac OS X .
This command has a help file but is otherwise but not much documentation , and judging by the obscure location of the command , Apple probably did n’t think it would be too useful for the average Mac user .
But the hidden command line airport tool is very useful indeed , particularly for more advanced Mac users who want to have full control over their wi-fi hardware directly from the command line in Mac OS X .
With that in mind , here is how to access the amazingly useful yet little - known airport tool , and how you can use it for some networking tasks too .
How to Access & Use airport Command Line Tool on Mac OS
In case you were wondering , yes the command line airport tool exists in nearly all versions of Mac OS X , even modern versions that stopped calling wireless networking ‘ airport ’ and refer to it as Wi-Fi .
OK let ’s begin .
First , Get Easier Access to airport Wi -Fi Tool
The first thing you ’ll want to do is create a symbolic link to the airport command , because it is situated in a very inconvenient location with a deep path , this helps for quick usage .
Creating a symbolic link to airport is very easy , in the Terminal type the following :
For MacOS Mojave , Catalina , and newer MacOS releases
sudo ln -s / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks / Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport
For Mac OS X High Sierra , Sierra , El Capitan , Mavericks , and earlier
sudo ln -s / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks / Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport
The above may be a bit hard to read on some browsers , so alternatively you can use the following ( it does the same thing , just split into two commands ) :
For Mac OS Catalina , Mojave , and newer macOS versions
$ cd /usr / local / bin/
$ sudo ln -s / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks / Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport
For Mac OS X High Sierra , Sierra , El Capitan , Mavericks , and earlier
$ cd /usr / sbin
$ sudo ln -s / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks / Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport
Note the only difference between modern macOS versions and prior versions is where you will be placing the symbolic link , which is in /usr / local / bin / versus in /usr / sbin /
Whichever method you go with , the sudo command will prompt you for a root password , enter it and hit return .
Yes , that giant cryptic path through the depths of Mac OS X is where Apple hid the wonderful airport utility , but by running the above command you have just linked that long path to the much shorter ‘ airport ’ , which is great .
Using the airport Wireless Tool in Mac OS X Command Line
Now that you have quick and easy access to airport with the above symbolic link , you can start using the airport tool .
For starters , you ’ll probably find the - I flag and -s flags to be most useful and informative .
For example , with airport -s you will effectively have a wi- fi router stumbler and get a list of available wireless networks complete with their SSID , BSSID hardware address , security encryption type , and channel .
airport -s
You can also use airport - I at the Terminal prompt , which will return information specific to the current wi-fi connection , looking something like the following :
$ airport - I
commQuality : 75
rawQuality : 59
avgSignalLevel : - 40
avgNoiseLevel : - 97
linkStatus : ESS
portType : Client
lastTxRate : 11
maxRate : 11
lastAssocStatus : 1
BSSID : 00:06:5b:2a:37:10
SSID : OSXNetwork
Security : none
$
Displayed is detailed information on wireless signal quality , noise , security , and other WiFi network attributes .
The airport command is more powerful than just being able to list information on the current wireless network though , you can actually manually adjust any wi-fi settings , network card settings , troubleshoot networks , change security types used on a connection , capture packets into a pcap file , join and leae networks , disassociate from a wifi network , prioritize routers and networks , see signal strength and interference , adjust wi-fi hardware drivers , and perform a huge variety of network troubleshooting functions too .
This is easily one of the most powerful ways to interact with a wireless card on a Mac .
While there is no manual page for the airport command , attaching the -h or –help flag to the command to will issue a brief list of flags and explanations of their function .
You can also just run ‘ airport ’ at the Mac OS X command line to get the full help file , shown below :

As you can see , there is an abundance of options to interact with wireless networks by using the airport utility in Mac OS X. Advanced Mac users should really get a kick out of this one , as it ’s extremely powerful , and wildly useful .
You can also do some pretty interesting things with airport , for example this will list available wi-fi routers by name only that are nearby , sorted by signal strength ( thanks to @jacobiun for this ) but omitting BSSID and other data :
airport -s | tail -n +1 | sed 's / [ a- z0 - 9 ] [ a - z0-9 ]:/,&:/g' | sed 's / -/ , -/g ' | cut -d ' , ' - f1,3 | sed 's /^[ [ : blank : ] ]*//;s/[[ : blank : ] ] *$//' | grep -v " SSID " | sed 's / /,/g' | cut -d ' , ' - f1,2 | sort -t ' , ' -k 2
The next time you ’re working on any wi-fi related task or wireless networking in general , remember the awesome airport tool .

Fixed precision numbers can be handy to have sometimes .
Haskell only provides integral , rational , and floating point in the Prelude , but I want more !
I want to define a type of fixed precision numbers , i.e. , numbers that have a certain number of decimals .
Rational numbers are handy to represent these numbers so here we go .
This uses an GHC extension that allows you to derive anything from the representation type so we do n't have to define all those tedious instances .
But wait , where is the fixed precision ?
What I just defined is just the Rational numbers with a different name .
I really want a type which is parametrized over what precision it has .
OK , so here we go again : Hereis meant to be a type that specifies the precision .
Let 's capture those types that we allow as the precision as a type class :
The idea here is that the actual argument to thefunction is not used , it 's just a proxy and the type carries all the information .
Here 's an example : Thereturns 1 for thetype .
So the intended meaning is that the typeare numbers within an epsilon of the right answer , and epsilon is 1 .
Similarly
The typehas an epsilon of 1e - 50 , i.e. , 50 decimals .
Btw , notice that what looks like a floating point literal is actually a rational number ; one of the very clever decisions in the original Haskell design .
We can also define type constructors like
The typehas an epsilon of 1e - 50/10 = 1e - 51 .
Note how the functionis just a dummy to get the .
If we had used the scoped type variable extension we could have avoided this function .
OK , so we can compute with these fixed precision numbers , but where does the epsilon enter ?
Nowhere , so far .
All arithmetic is performed exactly by the rationals , but our first use of the epsilon is in the show function .
To print a fixed point number we first print the integer part .
Themethod handily returns the integer part and some left over fraction that is < 1 .
We then print decimal after decimal by multiplying the fraction by 10 , converting the integer part to a digit , and then recursing .
While generating these decimals we also multiply the epsilon by 10 each time and stop printing when epsilon is >= 1 , because then we do n't need any more decimals .
All right , lets put it to the test :
As we want , we can't mix different fixed point numbers with different precisions .
Sometimes we do want to convert , so let 's provide such a function
It looks like this function does nothing , and it 's true .
It just converts the type , and since the epsilon type is not involved in the number itself it 's trivial .
Well , basic arithmetic is n't that much fun .
What about the transcendental functions ?
Luckily Jan Skibinski has already implemented all of them .
They compute the various function to with an epsilon using continued fractions .
The instance declaration looks something like :
And all the clever code I stole from Jan is in the module F , see link below .
Now it 's getting more fun .
Naturally , we need to package up all these definitions in a module that will keep the Fixed type abstract , and you can also keep the Epsilon class and the various Epsilon types abstract if you provide enough building blocks .

The study confirms the extent to which the US military is being strained by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The survey into the mental health of the soldiers and marines was requested by US commanders in Iraq and carried out by the office of the surgeon - general in August and October , with 1,300 soldiers and 450 marines interviewed .
The report says : " Approximately 10 % of soldiers and marines report mistreating non-combatants ( damaged / destroyed Iraqi property when not necessary or hit / kicked a non-combatant when not necessary ) .
" Soldiers that have high levels of anger , experienced high levels of combat , or screened positive for a mental health problem were nearly twice as likely to mistreat non-combatants as those who had low levels of anger or combat or screened negative for a mental health problem . "
The report also found that fewer than half of all soldiers and marines would report a team member for unethical behaviour , and more than one - third believed torture should be allowed to save the life of a fellow soldier or marine .
There are about 150,000 US troops in Iraq .
Many have been complaining in emails and blogs about President George Bush 's decision this year to extend deployment from one year to 15 months as part of an attempt to pacify Baghdad and Anbar province .
The Pentagon this week imposed restrictions on internet postings from war zones , and claimed it was because of the risk of providing sensitive information to insurgents .
Blogs and emails from troops in the field can often be extraordinarily vivid and indiscreet .
One report last weekend from a soldier in Iraq advised a trooper in the US who was about to deploy in Iraq on ways to watch for and detect explosive devices planted by insurgents .
Reacting to the ban , soldiers said that the real reason for the curb was their negative comments about the war , including scepticism about Mr Bush 's claims about progress .
Soldiers in the field and former soldiers , in blogs posted on sites such as Black Five , an unofficial site run by former paratrooper Matthew Burden , said the regulations would be inoperable , with most troops obeying the rules but dissidents finding ways round the ban .
Mr Burden , editor of The Blog of War , a book pulling together accounts from the field , criticised the decision : " No more military bloggers writing about their experiences in the combat zone .
This is the best PR the military has - its most honest voice out of the war zone .
" And it 's being silenced . "
“ A website founded by US religious activists aims to counter what they claim is ‘ liberal bias ’ on Wikipedia , the open encyclopedia which has become one of the most popular sites on the web .
The founders of Conservapedia.com say their site offers a ‘ much - needed alternative ’ to Wikipedia , which they say is ‘ increasingly anti-Christian and anti-American . ’ ”

( also ) is the headquarters of the elitist East Coast liberal empire [ 1 ] and the world ’s largest sustained experiment in secular humanism .
The city ’s population is often reported by the mainstream media to be as high as 8 million — but a rigorous count of actual Americans , using the methods of Adjusted Freedom Demography pioneered by Smorgensen in the Patriot Census of 2005 ( i.e. , excluding immigrants , Jews , ivory - tower communists , and nonrepresentational artists , and counting only three - fifths of descendants of African slaves , as originally intended by the Framers ) , reveals that New York City ’s population of legitimate Americans is actually only 312 .
( Smorgensen found Cheyenne , Wyo. , to be the most populous city in America , with almost ten times as many pure Americans as New York . ) [ 2 ]
Although modern New Yorkers specialize mainly in sodomy , drug - taking , and stealing each other ’s property ( the lower classes via mugging , the upper classes by taxing one another ) , the early history of the city is actually rather heroic and inspiring .
Manhattan was liberated from heathens by seventeenth - century Dutch capitalists , who are said to have bought the island for $ 24 .
( The mainstream media often espouses the inequity of this deal , but modern laissez - faire economists believe that the Dutch may actually have been overcharged , particularly when you consider the tremendous hidden costs of clearing out all of the Indians after the sale . [ 3 ] )
One thousand six hundred and sixty - four years after the martyrdom of Jesus Christ on the cross upon the hill of Calvary , at the hands of the Roman Empire ( specifically Pontius Pilate ) after having been betrayed by his disciple Judas and forced to carry his own instrument of death upon his back , an event which is the single true foundation of the one true religion of Christianity , the British conquered New York .
This set the stage for the city ’s glory days — first as a major battleground in the American Revolutionary War , then as the young nation ’s capital .
The city peaked when , in 1789 , the infallible patriot and faith warrior George Washington was inaugurated president near the free - market cathedral of Wall Street . [ 4 ]
Once Washington and his new Governing Army of Divinely Appointed Liberators left for Washington , D.C. , in 1790 A.D. , however , New York fell prey to the vices that plague it even today : an ever - growing tide of un-American infiltrators , a socialist municipal government , the hysterical adoption of primitive and amoral cultural rituals ( jazz , rap , Abstract Expressionism ) , the liberal media , environmentalism , state - mandated sodomy , and musical theater .
In 1857 A.D. , Central Park was built in an effort to encourage public homosexuality .
In 1952 A.D. , in an attempt to cripple the U.S. military , the United Nations settled on Manhattan ’s East Side , increasing the already cacophonous din of guttural non-American speech sounds on the streets of the new Babel .
Most experts agree that the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were God ’s punishment for over two centuries of New Yorkers ’ decadent sinning — though there is some minor debate about which sins , specifically , led to this smiting .
( Believers in usury point to the financial nature of the World Trade Center ’s businesses , proponents of sodomy stress that the towers resembled two erect male sex organs , etc. ) .
Unbiased historical research shows that the hand of God issued many calamitous pre-9/11 warnings , each of which was recklessly ignored : the Great Flood in the book of Genesis , the Great Fire of 1835 A.D. , the Triangle Shirtwaist fire of 1911 A.D. , the 1977 A.D. blackout , the Son of Sam killings , and the career of Patrick Ewing .
Recently , New York City ’s fortunes have seemed to improve .
In 2004 , for instance , despite the interference of several hundred drug - addled protestors , the city hosted the Republican National Convention that helped vault George W. Bush to his triumphant second term .

Why have large outbreaks of Ebola virus killed tens of thousands of gorillas and chimpanzees over the last decade ?
Observations published in the May issue of The American Naturalist provide new clues , suggesting that outbreaks may be amplified by Ebola transmission between ape social groups .
The study provides hope that newly developed vaccines could control the devastating impact of Ebola on wild apes .
Direct encounters between gorilla or chimpanzee social groups are rare .
Therefore , when reports of large ape die - offs first surfaced in the late 1990s , outbreak amplification was assumed to be through " massive spillover " from some unknown reservoir host .
The new study , conducted by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , Cambridge University , and Stony Brook University at three sites in northern Republic of Congo , suggests that Ebola transmission between ape groups might occur through routes other than direct social encounter .
For instance , as many as four different gorilla groups fed in the same fruit tree on a single day .
Thus , infective body fluids deposited by one group might easily be encountered by a subsequent group .
Chimpanzees and gorillas also fed simultaneously in the same fruit tree at least once every seven days .
The study also provided the first evidence that gorillas from one social group closely inspect the carcasses of gorillas from other groups .
Contact with corpses at funerals is a major mechanism of Ebola transmission in humans .
Together with other recent observations on patterns of gorilla mortality , these results make a strong case that transmission between ape social groups plays a central role in Ebola outbreak amplification .
The study has important implications for controlling the impact of Ebola , which has killed roughly one quarter of the world gorilla population .
" It means that vaccinating one gorilla does not protect only that gorilla , it also protects gorillas further down the transmission chain , " said Peter Walsh of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , the lead author on the study .
" Thus , protecting remaining ape populations may not require vaccinating a high proportion of individuals , as many people naively assume . "
Walsh and collaborators are currently searching for funding to implement a vaccination program using one of the several vaccines that have now successfully protected laboratory monkeys from Ebola .

Founded in 1867 , The American Naturalist is one of the world 's most renowned , peer - reviewed publications in ecology , evolution , and population and integrative biology research .
AN emphasizes sophisticated methodologies and innovative theoretical syntheses -- all in an effort to advance the knowledge of organic evolution and other broad biological principles .
A huge asteroid hurtles in from outer space to devastate the Earth , an unstoppable force of nature from which there is no escape .
Just such a catastrophe is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs , and , according to most experts , it is only a matter of time before a similar fate befalls the human race .
But perhaps not all hope is lost .
Hundreds of scientists , from nuclear weapons engineers to planetary experts , are gathering in Washington this week to try to develop a master plan to protect the Earth from such an asteroid .
The Planetary Defence Conference , organised by the US Aerospace Corporation , will bring together scores of ideas on how to develop technology to track and deflect objects heading towards the Earth .
The gathering will also consider the sticky problem of public relations - is it best to warn people if the worst comes to the worst ?
" The collision of a moderately large asteroid or comet , also referred to as a near - Earth object ( NEO ) , with Earth would have catastrophic consequences , " writes Brent William Barbee of Emergent Space Technologies Inc in a discussion paper to be presented at the meeting .
" Such events have occurred in the past and will occur again in the future .
However , for the first time in known history , humanity may have the technology required to counter this threat . "
Many smaller objects around the Earth 's orbit break up when they reach the atmosphere , with no impact beyond a short fireworks display .
An NEO wider than 1 km , however , collides with Earth every few hundred thousand years and an NEO larger than 6 km , which could cause mass extinction , will collide with Earth every 100 m years .
Experts agree that we are overdue for a big one .
All eyes for the moment are on Apophis , a 390 - metre wide asteroid discovered in 2004 , which has an outside chance of hitting the Earth in 2036 .
If it struck , Apophis would release more than 100,000 times the energy released in the nuclear blast over Hiroshima .
Thousands of square kilometres would be directly affected by the blast but the whole planet would see the effects of the dust released into the atmosphere .
There could be dark skies for a year or more and crops worldwide would be destroyed .
Dr Barbee will present a nuclear solution to the problem of NEOs .
Detonated at the correct position , a nuclear weapon could blast away a thin shell of material from the asteroid .
" This virtually instantaneous blow - off of superheated mass imparts an impulsive thrust to the NEO in the opposite direction of the detonation coordinates , causing the NEO 's subsequent trajectory to be altered slightly , which causes the NEO to miss Earth rather than collide . "
The advantage of this idea is that it is possible with current technology - though no one has actually tried it yet .
Piet Hut , of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , has a less dangerous idea - a robotic tugboat that could attach itself to an asteroid and push it out of the Earth 's path .
" Based on early warning , provided by ground tracking and orbit prediction , it would be deployed 10 years or more before potential impact .
The performance of the tugboat , he says , would depend on the development of a high - performance electric propulsion system called an ion engine .
Instead of burning chemicals for fuel , these engines propel a spacecraft forwards by ejecting charged particles the other way .
The thrust is minuscule - the equivalent to the pressure of a piece of paper on your hand - but the engine is extremely efficient and lasts far longer than conventional rocket engines .
Prof
Hut calculates that such an engine could be used to deflect NEOs up to 800 metres across .
Ion engines would also be crucial for another type of probe , the " gravity tractor " .
Instead of landing on an asteroid , though , the gravity tractor would hover near it , using the slight gravitational attraction between the probe and the NEO to change its path .
Aside from unveiling new technology plans , the meeting will also play host to psychologists weighing in with ideas on how to break the news of a potential catastrophic collision .
Al Harrison , a social psychologist at the University of California , Davis , says an NEO collision would present unique problems for the authorities : there would be " significant warning time ( not an unmitigated blessing ) , potential for extensive damage ( near extinction level event ) and a post - impact environment that could prevent full recovery " .
The critical question psychologists will address is whether details of an impending impact should be kept secret , to avoid widespread panic .
In December 2004 , for example , scientists calculated that if Apophis were to hit it would land somewhere along a line that crossed central Europe , parts of the Middle East , the most populated district on Earth ( the Ganges River valley ) , and on out across the Philippines .
At the time , the information was kept secret and many NEO scientists agreed it was the right thing to do .
But Clark Chapman , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , says secrecy goes against the advice of many experts in risk management .
" There are myths about the downsides of putting all information out , used as rationalisations by astronomers and space agency officials for withholding information , but which are counter to the policies of expert social scientists . "
He says the perception that members of the public would immediately panic about an impending impact has no support from studies of social psychology .
" If risk communication is done poorly , people may become unduly alarmed , they may lose faith in the veracity of official statements , they may misunderstand what 's being communicated , they may ignore important warnings . "
Footnotes
Near - Earth objects
These are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of planets into orbits that allow them to come near the Earth .
Most are made of ice and embedded with dust , or are bits of rock from the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars
Outside chance
Apophis had been tracked on and off since its discovery in June 2004 .
In December that year it started causing serious concern .
Astronomers , projecting the future orbit of the asteroid , calculated that the odds of it hitting the Earth in 2029 were alarming .
When it passes the Earth again on April 13 2029 , the asteroid will be deflected by the Earth and alter its orbit .
If that change makes Apophis pass through a particular point in space , the so - called keyhole , it will collide with the Earth on its next passage , in 2036 .
The chance of Apophis passing through the keyhole , a 600 - metre patch of space , is 1 in 5,500 based on current information
Dark skies
Scientists have estimated the effects of a massive asteroid collision by examining simulations of what would happen during a big nuclear war
Slight gravitational attraction
Everything in the universe that has mass attracts anything else with mass via the force of gravity .
If a gravity tractor is placed near an asteroid , the rock will move fractionally in the direction of the probe .
Over millions of kilometres even a slight deflection could move the asteroid out of the Earth 's way .
Tom Cruise has ordered topless scenes of his fiancee Katie Holmes to be cut from her latest film .
The ' Mission : Impossible III ' actor insists the actress ' sexy stripping scenes in ' Thank You For Not Smoking ' go against his strict Scientology beliefs , which instruct followers to act with decency and integrity .
A source said : " Tom was n't too pleased when he found out about Katie .
" She flashed quite a lot of flesh and he did n't think it was appropriate because of their Scientology beliefs .
" Katie was happy to go along with it .
" The brunette 's raunchy sex scene with Aaron Eckhart was included in the first screening on the film at the Toronto Film Festival in Canada last year , however , it had been mysteriously deleted when the film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this year .
At the festival , director Jason Reitman quipped that the scene was n't included because of a " technical glitch " , before adding , " If you want to see a sex scene with Katie Holmes , rent ' The Gift ' . "
Katie , who gave birth to the couple 's first baby , Suri , two weeks ago , appeared topless in the 2000 movie .
Claim : List summarizes what proportions of common traits would be like if we could shrink the earth ’s population to a village of precisely 100 people .
MIXTURE
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2001 ]
If we could shrink the earth ’s population to a village of precisely 100 people , with all the existing human ratios remaining the same , it would look something like the following .
If we could shrink the earth ’s population to a village of preciselywith all the existing human ratios remaining the same , it would look something like the following .
There would be :
57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere , both north and south
8 Africans
52 would be female
48 would be male
70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-Christian
30 would be Christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6 people would possess 59 % of the entire world ’s wealth and all 6 would be from the United States .
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1 would be near death ; 1 would be near birth
1 ( yes , only 1 ) would have a college education
1 would own a computer
Origins :
This item summarizing what proportions of common traits would be like if we could shrink the earth ’s population to a village of precisely 100 people has been circulated on the Internet for many years , and many readers seem to find the contrasts it highlights between the “ haves ” and “ have - nots ” of the world compelling .
However , much of the information it presented was questionable , out of date , or poorly - defined even when it was new , and the passage of time has only made it less accurate .
Since we first wrote about this item back in 2000 , all the information presented below is relative to conditions as they existed in that year :
57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere , both north and south
8 Africans
According to the United Nations World Population Prospects document , the world population in the year 2000 was about 6.7 billion , with this geographic distribution :
Africa : 794,000,000
Asia : 3,672,000,000
Latin America and Caribbean : 519,000,000
Europe : 727,000,000
North America : 314,000,000
Oceania : 51,000,000
If we calculate the corresponding percentages ( and lump North America , Latin America , the Caribbean , and Oceania into the “ western hemisphere ” category ) , we get the following ratios for our population of 100 :
Asians : 60
Europeans : 12
Western Hemisphereans : 15 ( 9 Latin Americans / Caribbeans , 5 North Americans , 1 Oceanian )
Africans : 13
52 would be female
48 would be male
According to that same United Nations document , the world population in the year 2000 consisted of 3,051,099,000 men and 3,005,616,000 women , which ( with a little rounding ) breaks down to 50 men and 50 women in a population of 100 .
70 would be non-white
30 would be white
Here we run into definitional problems trying to lump entire continents ’ worth of people into one class based on some nebulous concept of color .
What makes a person “ white ” or “ black ” ?
If we say that Africans are considered “ black , ” does that categorization apply equally to Nigerians , Egyptians , and South Africans ?
( Is the Middle East part of Africa or Asia ? )
Should the classification of Asians as “ white ” or “ non-white ” be based solely upon skin tone , or upon geographical and cultural factors as well ?
The numbers given here seem to be based upon the classification of Europeans and Western Hemisphereans as “ white ” and Africans and Asians as “ non-white ” ( and the assumption that those continents are homogeneous in racial composition ) .
With those qualifications , a population of 100 ( based on year 2000 numbers ) would include 27 whites and 73 non-whites .
70 would be non-Christian
30 would be Christian
According to the chart at Adherents.com , which provides estimates of “ the number of people who have at least a minimal level of self - identification as adherents ” of a particular religion , the world ’s population in early 2001 was 33 % Christian .
So , our reduced population of 100 would be composed of 33 Christians and 67 non-Christians .
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
This one is almost impossible to estimate with any reasonable degree of accuracy .
The classification of people as being either “ heterosexual ” or “ homosexual ” is too dependent upon subjective criteria , and the answers of respondents to surveys about their sexual habits are too easily influenced by other social factors .
The common figure of “ 10 % of the population is homosexual ” is often bandied about , but that number is derived from a misapplication of a Kinsey study which was not based upon a representative sample of the population .
One can find estimates that place of the percentage of the population considered to be homosexual anywhere between 1 - 2 % and 25% - 35 % , but a reasonable survey of the more controlled studies would put the figure in about the 2 - 3 % range ( for males , at least ) .
6 people would possess 59 % of the entire world ’s wealth , and all 6 would be from the United States .
This claim demonstrates the precariousness of trying to summarize a very large , diverse population in a few simple statistics .
For starters , our miniature world of 100 people only includes 5 people from all of North America , so any statement involving 6 people from the United States just does n’t compute .
“ Wealth ” is a concept difficult to measure with any precision ,
but we can use Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) as a reasonable approximation .
If we take some figures from the CIA ’s World Factbook 2000 , we find that the estimated GDP of the United States in 1999 was $ 9.255 trillion , out of a world total of $ 40.7 trillion .
In other words , in 1999 the United States possessed about 23 % of the world ’s wealth .
If we assume that all 5 North Americans in our miniature world are from the United States , and that they have inherited an amount of wealth proportional to that held by the United States in the “ real ” world , together they ’d still have only 23 % of the world ’s wealth , not 59 % .
Even if you could find some combination of 6 people in our putative population of 100 who held 59 % of the total wealth , they would n’t all be from the United States .
80 would live in substandard housing
This statement ca n’t be assessed without knowing the definition of “ substandard ” being employed here .
“ Substandard ” by whose standards ?
And if a full 80 % of the world ’s population truly lives in “ substandard ” housing , does n’t that indicate whatever standard is being used must be too high ?
Estimates for this figure are all over the map as well ( some United Nations housing statistics are informative but do n’t really answer the question ) , but a 1999 article in International Wildlife puts the estimate at 33 % , not the 80 % figure offered here .
70 would be unable to read
A 1998 UNICEF study put the world illiteracy rate at 16 % , well short of the 70 % claimed here .
50 would suffer from malnutrition
The World Health Organization puts the malnutrition figure at about 33 % .
1 would be near death
1 would be near birth
This statement is simply too vague to evaluate .
At any given time , one person in a hundred is near death ?
Just how “ near ” ?
Is age a factor in this statistic ?
1 ( yes , only 1 ) would have a college education
Again , we have to know whether our miniature world ’s inhabitants represent current population trends in age as well as other factors .
According to the United Nations World Population Prospects document , the median age of the world ’s population was 26.5 in 2000 , with that figure being lower in less developed ( and more populous ) areas of the world .
( The median age of Africans , for example , was only 18.4 in 2000 . )
So , this statistic could be true simply because much of our miniature population would be too young to have finished college yet ( assuming that “ having a college education ” means “ graduated with the equivalent of a bachelor ’s degree ” ) .
However , if we assume everyone in our miniature world is of sufficient age and apply the current graduation rates of the USA ( 33 % ) to its share of the population ( 5 ) , we ’d have almost two college graduates from America alone .
And other parts of the world ( e.g. , New Zealand , Netherlands , Britain , and Norway ) have graduation rates equal to or higher than the USA’s .
1 would own a computer
Computer ownership rates in the USA now indicate that over 50 % of American households have computers , so if we assume that “ households ” can be equated with “ people ” in our miniature world , our 5 Americans alone would have at least two computers between them .
processing is a package for the Python language which supports the spawning of processes using the API of the standard library ’s threading module .
It runs on both Unix and Windows .
Features :
Examples
The processing .
Process class follows the API of threading .
Thread .
For example
from processing import Process , Queue def f( q ) : q.put ( ' hello world ' ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : q = Queue( ) p = Process ( target=f , args=[q ] ) p.start ( ) print q.get ( ) p.join ( )
Synchronization primitives like locks , semaphores and conditions are available , for example
>>> from processing import Condition >>> c = Condition ( ) >>> print c < Condition (< RLock ( None , 0 ) > ) , 0 > >>> c.acquire ( )
True >>> print c < Condition (< RLock ( MainProcess , 1 ) > ) , 0 >
One can also use a manager to create shared objects either in shared memory or in a server process , for example
>>> from processing import Manager >>> manager = Manager ( ) >>> l = manager.list ( range ( 10 ) ) >>> l.reverse( ) >>> print l [ 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 ] >>> print repr(l ) < Proxy [ list ] object at 0x00E1B3B0 >
Tasks can be offloaded to a pool of worker processes in various ways , for example
>>> from processing import Pool >>> def f( x ) : return x*x ... >>> p = Pool ( 4 ) >>> result = p.mapAsync(f , range ( 10 ) ) >>> print result.get ( timeout=1 ) [ 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 , 49 , 64 , 81 ]
Sir Richard Branson is a genius at scoring public relations coups .
His open letter to Geoff Dixon creates a spectacular ' win - win ' for Branson ( and perhaps a lose - lose for Dixon ! ) .
Whatever now happens , the certain result is that Branson will earn substantial more publicity for himself and his airline , in the ' underdog ' role that he portrays so well .

Flamboyant Sir Richard Branson founded Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984 .
In 2000 , he started a new airline in Australia - Virgin Blue .
At the time of Virgin Blue 's conception , there was a fair measure of skepticism within Australia as to whether it would be possible for what would have become a third Australian airline to survive .
Several earlier attempts by other would be competitors to the two established airlines ( Qantas and Ansett ) had all ended in ignominious failure .
Of course , Qantas did all it could to discourage and disparage its new competitor .
Nonetheless , Virgin Blue proceeded , and then , more or less fortuitously perhaps , Ansett ( owned by Air New Zealand ) went bankrupt , and Virgin Blue suddenly found a market that was reasonably full of air service change to a market where 40 % of all flights had suddenly ceased .
Partly because of that , and partly because it is a good airline anyway , Virgin Blue now appears to be flourishing .
Flash forward to 2003 .
Virgin Atlantic have often stated their desire to be able to operate flights to Australia , and their interest has again surfaced to the point where they 're aggressively planning to start such flights ( if they can get permission from the Australian government ! ) .
Qantas has again been understandably disparaging about this - for sure , Qantas would very much prefer not to see another major competitor on its ' Kangaroo Route ' ( ie London - Sydney ) .
And so , with this as background , please enjoy the following open letter from Sir Richard to Geoff Dixon , CEO of Qantas .
Update :
The first Virgin flight to Australia was in December , 2004 .
Geoff Dixon would have lost the bet .

Sir Richard Branson 24 July 2003 OPEN LETTER TO GEOFF DIXON FROM RICHARD BRANSON Dear Geoff , I was amused to read Qantas ’s completely dismissive comments about Virgin Atlantic ’s chances of getting permission to fly to Australia .
It would be prudent for you to remind yourself of your and James Strong ’s equally dismissive comments about Virgin Blue ’s chances of entering the Australian market only three years ago .
Here goes !
This is the gist of what you said : “ Virgin Blue is a lot of media hype . ”
“ This market is not big enough to sustain Virgin Blue . ”
“ Virgin Blue does n’t have deep enough pockets to cope . ”
“ Qantas will employ any option to see off this interloper . ”
“ They ’ll be unlikely to survive a year . ”
“ Claims by Richard Branson that domestic fares are high are a misnomer ! ” ( my exclamation mark )
Here is what James Strong , your former C.E.O , said about Virgin Blue and myself : “ If you listen to most of the pretenders there is a distinct air that they are making it up as they go along .
In terms of real plans and real commitment you could fire a shot gun up the main street and not hit anybody . ”
Yet three years later you are telling your staff that this same airline , “ that was making it up as it went along ” and that now has 30 % of the market could , “ Drive Qantas out of business ! ”
We also find it flattering , if a little silly , that three years on you now have spies hiding behind pot plants in the Virgin terminal trying to work out why we are so successful .
Even if some of your comments do n’t suggest it , your actions indicate you are taking us seriously .
But let ’s not take ourselves too seriously .
I would like to propose a friendly challenge !
If Virgin Atlantic fails to fly to Australia ( within 18 months , say ) I ’d be prepared to suffer the indignity of donning one of your stewardesses brand new designer outfits and will work your flight from London to Australia serving your customers throughout .
However , if Virgin Atlantic does fly to Australia you would do so instead .
On our inaugural flight from London to Australia you would wear one of our beautiful red Virgin Stewardesses uniforms and serve our inaugural guests all the way to Australia .
Oh and in case you were wondering , we ’re not hung up on flying through Hong Kong .
You might end up doing your days work experience through Singapore , Thailand or Malaysia instead .
This is the challenge .
If you believe in what Qantas said to the press there ca n’t be any risk for you .
We expect your response within one week .
Our inaugural flights are great fun and I look forward to welcoming you on board personally .
Oh and by the way my preferred drink is ………..!
Kind regards , Richard .
p.s. I enclose a picture to give you an idea of what you might look like .
Dixon was n't impressed with Branson 's offer .
" We are running an airline not a circus , " Dixon said through a Qantas spokeswoman .
Long story short :
If you downloaded WordPress 2.1.1 within the past 3 - 4 days , your files may include a security exploit that was added by a cracker , and you should upgrade all of your files to 2.1.2 immediately .
Longer explanation :
This morning we received a note to our security mailing address about unusual and highly exploitable code in WordPress .
The issue was investigated , and it appeared that the 2.1.1 download had been modified from its original code .
We took the website down immediately to investigate what happened .
It was determined that a cracker had gained user - level access to one of the servers that powers wordpress.org , and had used that access to modify the download file .
We have locked down that server for further forensics , but at this time it appears that the 2.1.1 download was the only thing touched by the attack .
They modified two files in WP to include code that would allow for remote PHP execution .
This is the kind of thing you pray never happens , but it did and now we ’re dealing with it as best we can .
Although not all downloads of 2.1.1 were affected , we ’re declaring the entire version dangerous and have released a new version 2.1.2 that includes minor updates and entirely verified files .
We are also taking lots of measures to ensure something like this can’t happen again , not the least of which is minutely external verification of the download package so we ’ll know immediately if something goes wrong for any reason .
Finally , we reset passwords for a number of users with SVN and other access , so you may need to reset your password on the forums before you can login again .
What You Can Do to Help
If your blog is running 2.1.1 , please upgrade immediately and do a full overwrite of your old files , especially those in wp-includes .
Check out your friends blogs and if any of them are running 2.1.1 drop them a note and , if you can , pitch in and help them with the upgrade .
If you are a web host or network administrator , block access to “ theme.php ” and “ feed. php ” , and any query string with “ ix = ” or “ iz= ” in it .
If you ’re a customer at a web host , you may want to send them a note to let them know about this release and the above information .
Thanks to Ryan , Barry , Donncha , Mark , Michael , and Dougal for working through the night to figure out and address this problem , and thanks to Ivan Fratric for reporting it in the first place .
Questions and Answers
Because of the highly unusual nature of this event and release , we ’ve set up an email address 21securityfaq@wordpress.org that you can email questions to , and we ’ll be updating this entry with more information throughout the day .
Is version 2.0 affected ?
No downloads were altered except 2.1.1 , so if you ’ve downloaded any version of 2.0 you should be fine .
What if we update from SVN ?
Nothing in the Subversion repository was touched , so if you upgrade and maintain your blog via SVN there is no chance you downloaded the corrupted release file .

あー、やっぱりな -- 連休で調子がくるって、まだ何かおかしいよ。
で、少し頭のトレーニングになる話でもしましょうか。
pが論理式で 、Aが文とか文の並びだとして、 if ( p ) { A; } else { A ; } って書く人はあまりいませんよね、これは単に A ; と書いて も “ 同 じ ” だから。 次 の3 つの表現も事実上 “ 同じ ” なのはわかるでしょう 。
// その1 if ( p ) { ; } else { if ( q ) { A ; } } // そ の 2 if ( ! p ) { if ( q ) { A ; } } // その3 if ( ! p && q ) { A;}
次 の 「その2」はなんだか無意味みたいですが、「その1 」 と“ 同じ ” です 。
// その1 while ( p ) { A ; } // そ の2 if ( p ) { A ; while ( p ) { A;} }
さて、一般に2つのプログラムコードが “ 同じ ” であることを判定するのは難しいことです。が、算術的計算でプログラムの同値性を示せることもあります。その計算法（の一例）を紹介しましょう。
※印刷の時はサイドバー消えます。
内容：
記号と言葉のお約束
論理式の表現と計算には、標準的な論理記号を使いましょう。以前、「プログラマのための述語論理」でも登場したやつです。
記号 意味 プログラミング言語での記号 ∧ かつ（連言） && ∨ または（選言） || ¬ ではない（否定） !
論理計算については今特に説明しませんが、二重否定の除去「¬¬p = p」とか、ド・モルガンの法則 「 ¬( p∧q ) = ( ¬p ) ∨( ¬q ) 」とかは使います 。
論理式とプログラムの実行文を区別したいので、次の約束をします。
A , Bなどの大文字 -- 文や文の並びなどを表す
p , qなどの小文字 -- 条件、論理式を表す
以下、 「文」と言ったら、単純な文だけではなく、文の並び（複文）や複数の文を組み合わせた複雑な表現も意味します。
ちょっと変わった制御構造
プログラムの制御構造には、順次実行、非決定性の選択、条件（ガード）付き実行の3種を基本に採用します。順次実行はお馴染みのものですが、非決定性の選択、条件付き実行は、普通の言語ではあまりお目にかかりません。
順次実行、非決定性の選択、条件付き実行を、それぞれ次のような記号で書くことにします。括弧内はキーワードを使った補助的な代替記法です。
A ;B
A | B （choose A or B end ）
p・A （when ( p ) do A end ）
非決定性の選 択 A | B は 、AかBのどちらかが実行されます。が、どっちが実行されるかは前もってわかりません。その場その場でサイコロをふって決めると思ってください。
条件付き実行 p・A は if ( p ) then A end と似てます。が、同じではありません。条件（ガードとも呼ばれます）pが成立しないときは、そこで、プログラムは無限に待ち続けます。もし、何らかの外的要因でpが真になれば、プログラムが続行されることもあります。
非決定性の選択はバクチ打ちで、条件付き実行はイクジなし（ガードを強行突破はできない）ってわけです。こんなトンデモナイ制御構造でまともにプログラムが記述できるとは信じがたいのですが、バクチ打ちとイクジなしでもうまく使えば通常の制御構造を実現できます。
if - then - elseの実 現
まず、非決定性の選択と条件付き実行により if ( p ) then A else B を実現しましょう。答えを先に言ってしまうと、 p・A | ( ¬p ) ・B です。これは次のようにも書けます 。
choose when ( p ) do A end or when ( ! p ) do B end end
割と簡単できれいな形です。が、どうも変な気もします。今、pがtrueだとして考えてみましょう。choose（選択）はサイコロをふるので、二番目の選択肢が選ばれるかもしれません。すると、条件 ( ! p ) は falseとなり 、 “ 待ち ” に入ってプログラムはつっかえてしまうはずです。そうなると、明らかにif文とは違う振る舞いになります。
いやっ、実は非決定性の選択の解釈は、「プログラムは通れる実行経路を通ろうとするが、どこを通るかはわからない」ということです。選択肢の片一方が通れない（実行を続行できない）なら、そこで“ 待ち ” に入るのではなくて、もう一方を選んで進みます。
簡単な計算 例
記 号 「 ; 」 「 | 」 「・」は、文と論理式に対する二項演算記号と思えます。「 ; 」と「・」は積（掛け算）のように、 「 |」は和（足し算）のように振る舞います。そして、普通に期待される計算法則はだいたい成立します（って、ひどくイイカゲンな言い方ではあるが）。計算法則を並べる前に、具体例を出してしまいましょう。 if ( p ) then A else A の計算です 。
// if ( p ) then A else A p・A | ( ¬p ) ・ A // ・と|に関して分配法則 = ( p∨¬p ) ・A // p∨¬p はtrue = true ・A // trueをガードにしても影響はない = A // よって、if ( p ) then A else A は A と同 じ
「 ・」は省略して、 「 | 」 と「∨」をどちらも 「 +」 と書いて、「 ¬p 」を「 p ' 」 、「 true 」 を「1」と書くと、簡潔だし親しみも持てるでしょう。
pA + p'A // 分配法則 = ( p + p ' ) A // p + p ' = 1 = 1A // 1A = A = A
文 Aに、論理定数1（ture）をガードとして前置しても何の変化もないので、1・A = A です。よって、どんな文もガード付き文だと考えてもかまいません。
さて、n個の 文 A 1 , A 2 , ... , A n とn個の論理式 p 1 , p 2 , ... , p n から、p 1 ・A 2 | p 2 ・ A 2 | ... | p n A n （簡潔な表現なら p 1 A 1 + p 2 A 2 + ... + p n A n ）を作れますが、これは、非決定性の多方向分岐です。プログラム実行のある時点で、各p i は1（true）か0（false）の値をとります。nで割り算すると、事象A i が確率(p i /n)で生起するときの和事象と似た形式です。確率計算と同じではないのですが、かなり似てます。A + A = A、pp = p など（ベキ等性という）に気を付ければ線形代数*1の計算とも似てます。
そんなわけで、プログラムを計算の対象にできるらしいことがわかったわけですが、今日は疲れたのでココマデ。続きは次回。
Early History
Map of Locations
The Residence Act of July 16 , 1790 , as amended March 3 , 1791 , authorized President George Washington to select a 100 - square - mile site for the national capital on the Potomac River between Alexandria , Virginia , and Williamsport , Maryland .
President Washington selected the southernmost location within these limits so that the capital would include all of present - day Old Town Alexandria , then one of the busiest ports in the country .
Acting on instructions from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , Major Andrew Ellicott began his initial observations for a rough survey of the ten - mile square on Friday , February 11 , 1791 .
Ellicott , a prominent professional surveyor , hired Benjamin Banneker , an astronomer and surveyor from Maryland , to make the astronomical observations and calculations necessary to establish the south corner of the square at Jones Point in Alexandria .
According to legend , " Banneker fixed the position of the first stone by lying on his back to find the exact starting point for the survey ... and plotting six stars as they crossed his spot at a particular time of night . "
From there , Ellicott 's team embarked on a forty - mile journey , surveying ten - mile lines first along the southwest line , then along
The northwest line , next along the northeast line , and finally along the southeast line .
The team completed this rough survey in April 1791 .
On April 15 , 1791 , the Alexandria Masonic Lodge placed a small stone at the south corner at Jones Point in ceremonies attended by Ellicott , federal district commissioners Daniel Carroll and David Stuart , and other dignitaries .
George Washington did not attend the ceremony , although he did visit the site the prior month .
Newpapers around the country announced the story of the beginning of the new federal city .
( In 1794 , the ceremonial stone at Jones Point was replaced by a large stone , still in place today , with the inscription " The beginning of the Territory of Columbia " on one side . )
Ellicott 's team , minus Banneker , who left after the placement of the south stone , then began the formal survey by clearing twenty feet of land on both sides of each boundary line and placing other stones , made of Aquia Creek sandstone , at one - mile intervals .
On each stone , the side facing the District of Columbia displayed the inscription " Jurisdiction of the United States " and a mile number .
The opposite side said either " Virginia " or " Maryland , " as appropriate .
The third and fourth sides displayed the year in which the stone was placed ( 1791 for the 14 Virginia stones and 1792 for the 26 Maryland stones ) and the magnetic compass variance at that place .
Stones along the northwest Maryland boundary also displayed the number of miles they fell from NW4 , the first stone placed in Maryland .
Stones placed at intervals other than a full mile listed their distances partially in miles and partially in poles .
The boundary stones are the oldest federal monuments .
Although several stones have been moved or severely damaged , thirty - six stones from the 1790s are in or near their original locations , including all fourteen in the land that was returned to Virginia in the 1846 - 1847 retrocession .
Three other locations have substitute stones ( SW2 SE4 , and SE8 ) , and one location ( NE1 ) is marked only by a plaque .
This site describes the locations of the stones as of 2016 , updating the information provided by the Daughters of the American Revolution ( 1976 ) and the National Register of Historic Places ( 1996 ) .
Click the map markers below for photos and information about each stone .
The D.C. Geographic Information System 's 2011 survey provided precise GPS data for all but two stones that were respositioned after the survey and therefore have only approximate coordinates .
Locations marked with " X " lack stones from the 1790s .

Ever since passing what its Legislature promoted as the nation ’s toughest laws against illegal immigration last summer , Colorado has struggled with a labor shortage as migrants fled the state .
This week , officials announced a novel solution : Use convicts as farmworkers .
The Department of Corrections hopes to launch a pilot program this month -- thought to be the first of its kind -- that would contract with more than a dozen farms to provide inmates who will pick melons , onions and peppers .
Crops were left to spoil in the fields after the passage of legislation that required state identification to get government services and allowed police to check suspects ’ immigration status .
“ The reason this [ program ] started is to make sure the agricultural industry would n’t go out of business , ” state Rep. Dorothy Butcher said .
Her district includes Pueblo , near the farmland where the inmates will work .

Prisoners who are a low security risk may choose to work in the fields , earning 60 cents a day .
They also are eligible for small bonuses .
The inmates will be watched by prison guards , who will be paid by the farms .
The cost is subject to negotiation , but farmers say they expect to pay more for the inmate labor and its associated costs than for their traditional workers .
Advocates on both sides of the immigration debate said they were stunned by the proposal .
“ If they ca n’t get slaves from Mexico , they want them from the jails , ” said Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , which favors restrictions on immigration .

Ricardo Martinez of the Denver immigrant rights group Padres Unidos asked : “ Are we going to pull in inmates to work in the service industry too ?
You wo n’t have enough inmates -- unless you start importing them from Texas . ”
Farmers said they were n’t happy with the solution , but their livelihoods are on the verge of collapse .
“ This prison labor is not a cure for the immigration problem ; it ’s just a Band - Aid , ” farmer Joe Pisciotta said .
He said he needed to be sure he would have enough workers for the harvest this fall before he planted watermelons , onions and pumpkins on his 700 - acre farm in Avondale .
But he ’s not thrilled with the idea of criminals working his fields .

“ I ’ve got young kids , ” he said .
“ It ’s something I ’ve got to think about . ”
Pisciotta said he hoped the program highlighted what he viewed as the absurdity of Colorado ’s position -- dependent on immigrant labor but trying to chase migrants away .
He said the people leaving were not just those who entered the country illegally .
“ Some of them have said , ‘ We think our paperwork is in order , but how about if it ’s not and we get caught on a glitch , ’ ” he said .
Ever since the Democratic - controlled Legislature took a tough turn on immigration , the new requirements have worried those in the country legally and illegally .

Immigrant advocates allege that some sheriffs have authorized deputies to pull over Latino drivers on supposed speeding violations and ask them whether they are in the country legally .
And more stringent requirements put into effect last year made it harder to get a driver ’s license .
Numerous U.S. citizens , including the daughter of a state legislator , were refused licenses because they lacked proper proof of citizenship .
A judge has since ruled that the requirements must be revised .
Social service agencies say they have discovered few illegal immigrants on public assistance since the laws were passed .
Immigrant and business groups agree that the heated rhetoric has led to an exodus of Latinos -- though no one is sure how many .
Businesses including carwashes and construction firms have complained of a worker shortage .

“ It ’s like , ‘ Do n’t go visit that house , there ’s a guy with a shotgun at the door , ’ ” said state Rep. Rafael Gallegos , who represents a heavily Latino agricultural district in south - central Colorado .
He voted against most of the legislation .
Farmers on Monday met with state officials at the Capitol here to discuss using inmate labor .
The Department of Corrections expects to begin sending about 100 prisoners to work on farms near Pueblo this month .
Some of the state ’s 22,000 prisoners have agricultural experience .
Convicts can participate in programs on prison grounds to break wild horses and grow crops .
About 700 inmates work in other jobs outside prison , such as on fire crews .
Ari Zavaras , the executive director of the Department of Corrections , said he knew of no other prison system in the nation using convicts to fill agricultural labor shortages .

In California , where growers also have complained about a lack of workers , inmates have not labored in private fields since the 1940s .
Prisoners then were used as farmhands while laborers were fighting in World War II , said Terry Thornton , a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections .
“ The idea [ of using prisoners on farms ] has been floated before , but these are not unskilled jobs .
They ’re jobs that require a lot of training and supervision , ” said David Kranz , a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation .
“ It does n’t seem like a very practical alternative . ”
Krikorian , of the Center for Immigration Studies , said the Colorado prison experiment was “ a sign that there are solutions other than importing foreign labor . ”
He said “ ultimately they ’re going to have to improve the wages and working conditions ” to attract legal workers , as well as to mechanize parts of their farming operations .

Colorado ’s experience shows that hard - line measures have an effect on illegal immigrants , Krikorian added , noting that arrests had dropped along the U.S. - Mexico border since security was increased last year .
“ We ’re seeing enforcement work , not just in Colorado , ” he said , “ but all over the country . ”

Fear of Terrorism Overblown ?
Politicians and security analysts constantly remind us that a terrorist attack is just a matter of time .
Clark Kent Ervin , former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security and author of " Open Target : Where America is Vulnerable to Attack , " says we must have tougher security at stadiums , shopping malls , and even schools .
" We can have deterrence measures like police patrols ... greater use of bomb - detecting dogs , and bomb sensors , other such technologies ... random bag searches , " he told me .
" If terrorists see that such measures are in place , they 're less likely to strike . "
This seemed illogical to me , and so I was delighted to discover the book " Overblown : How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats , and Why We Believe Them . "
Its author , Ohio State political science professor John Mueller , points out the folly of arming shopping - mall guards : " A terrorist would say , well , if that mall has guards around it , I 'll go to the one that does n't .
...
If you protect one thing and you simply displace the terrorist to a different threat ... it's an exercise in futility . "
Mueller also says the threat to the average American is overblown .
" Your chances of being killed , at present rates , by an international terrorist outside of a war zone is something like 1 in 80,000 , " he says .
" It 's about the same as being killed by an asteroid . "
But on Sept. 11 , almost 3,000 people died !
Mueller replies that 9/11 was not a typical terrorist attack .
Terrorists were able to capture four planes , and two huge buildings collapsed .
" It 's a spectacular exception to what terrorists have been able to do , " he said .
Sure enough , since 9/11 , the biggest terrorist successes have been the bombings of commuter trains in Madrid and a nightclub in Bali .
The death toll from each attack was about 200 people .
" Outside of war zones , the amount of destruction is maybe 200 people a year , " says Mueller .
" That 's 200 people too many , but that 's hardly an existential threat .
In the United States , between 300 and 400 people die every year just from drowning in bathtubs . "
He says there 's a terrorism industry -- I call it the " Fear Industrial Complex " -- made up of the media , the bureaucracy , business , and politicians .
" Politicians notice that when they hype the terrorist threat , people respond favorably , " Mueller says .
Then the bureaucracy hypes terrorism to justify its pork .
" Terror porn " is what economist Veronique de Rugy calls it .
Why " porn " ?
" Because porn sells , [ and ] terrorism sells even better , " she says .
" It 's great for politicians .
They can campaign on the fact that they are protecting us .
They also can campaign on the fact that they 're bringing more money to their states . "
Lots of small towns do get absurd grants for homeland security .
Lake County , Tenn. , a rural county with only 8,000 people , got nearly $ 200,000 in homeland - security money .
" I do n't know that terrorists will come , but I do n't know they wo n't come , " Lake County Mayor Macie Roberson told us , smiling .
At least he did n't do what Columbus , Ohio did : spend it on bulletproof vests for police dogs .
Ervin concedes that some security money is wasted , but still says we need to spend more .
" It 's very important to reassure the American people that our government is doing everything it can to protect them , " he told me .
" If we do that , we will have succeeded in denying terrorists a major victory . "
No .
The opposite is true .
It 's overreacting that would give them a victory .
Of course , terrorism is a real threat .
But fear kills people , too .
A University of Michigan study found that an additional 1,000 Americans died in car accidents in the three months after Sept. 11 , because they were afraid to fly .
We need to keep risk in perspective .
" We have had dark moments in our history , far darker moments than those we face today , " says The Rand Corporation 's Brian Michael Jenkins .
After studying terrorism for 40 years , he likes to remind people , " We 've come through wars , plagues , pandemics ...
The response to terrorism cannot be diving under the kitchen table and living in a state of fear .
That 's exactly what the terrorists are attempting to create . "
United States attorneys , though subject to confirmation by the Senate , serve at the pleasure of the president .
As a constitutional matter , the president is at perfect liberty to fire all or some of them whenever it suits him .
He can fire them for mismanagement , for failing to pursue administration priorities with sufficient vigor , or even because he would prefer to replace an incumbent with a political crony .
Indeed , a president could , without exceeding his constitutional authority and ( probably ) without violating any statute , fire a United States attorney for pursuing officeholders of the president ’s party too aggressively or for failing to prosecute officeholders of the other party aggressively enough .

That the president has the constitutional power to do these things does not mean he has the right to do them without explanation .
Congress has the right to demand explanations for the president ’s managerial choices , both to exercise its own oversight function and to inform the voters its members represent .
The right of Congress to demand explanations imposes on the president , and on inferior executive officers who speak for him , the obligation to be truthful .
An attorney general called before Congress to discuss the workings of the Justice Department can claim the protection of “ executive privilege ” and , if challenged , can defend the ( doubtful ) legitimacy of such a claim in the courts .
But having elected to testify , he has no right to lie , either by affirmatively misrepresenting facts or by falsely claiming not to remember events .
Lying to Congress is a felony — actually three felonies : perjury , false statements and obstruction of justice .
A false claim not to remember is just as much a lie as a conscious misrepresentation of a fact one remembers well .
Instances of phony forgetfulness seem to abound throughout Mr. Gonzales ’s testimony , but his claim to have no memory of the November Justice department meeting at which he authorized the attorney firings left even Republican stalwarts like Jeff Sessions of Alabama gaping in incredulity .
The truth is almost surely that Mr. Gonzales ’s forgetfulness is feigned — a calculated ploy to block legitimate Congressional inquiry into questionable decisions made by the Department of Justice , White House officials and , quite possibly , the president himself .
Even if perjury were not a felony , lying to Congress has always been understood to be an impeachable offense .
As James Iredell , later a Supreme Court justice , said in 1788 during the debate over the impeachment clause , “ The president must certainly be punishable for giving false information to the Senate . ”
The same is true of the president ’s appointees .

Can you really make functional speakers and / or a computer case out of cardboard ?
Apparently so .
You ’ll find that and more in this weird list .
Cardboard Speakers
MUJI , best known in Japan for their innovative yet simple products , has come out with speakers made of cardboard and electronic components
They ship unfolded in a clear plastic pouch , fold them up , and they are ready to use .
Now that ’s what I call portability .

Cardboard PC Case
Lupo Japan introduces a PC case that ’s made entirely out of cardboard .
The downside to this is if your computer overheats the case will most likely catch on fire and burn all the internal parts to a crisp .
There are cutouts on the front of the case for the CD / DVD and floppy disk drives .
On the backside , there are several cutouts for the fans , ports , and even a power supply .
Unfortunately , it does n’t come assembled , but rather in perforated cardboard pieces .

These weird laptop cases are made from genuine , cardboard “ Italian - style ” pizza boxes and lined with 10 mm of foam to offer the least amount of protection possible — for your 14 ″ or 15 ″ laptop .
For water protection , you ’ll need to purchase an additional carrying bag .
In a nutshell , you ’ll end up buying two cases that offer the least amount of protection for the money .

Home Good Ideas , Through the Looking Glass Niklaus Wirth .
Good Ideas , Through the Looking Glass , IEEE Computer , Jan. 2006 , pp. 56 -68 .
An entire potpourri of ideas is listed from the past decades of Computer Science and Computer Technology .
Widely acclaimed at their time , many have lost in splendor and brilliance under todayâ€™s critical scrutiny .
We try to find reasons .
Some of the ideas are almost forgotten .
But we believe that they are worth recalling , not the least because one must try to learn from the past , be it for the sake of progress , intellectual stimulation , or fun .
A personal look at some ideas , mostly from the field of programming languages .
Some of Wirth 's objections are amusing , some infuriating - and some I agree with ...
LtU readers will obviously go directly to sections 4 ( Programming Language Features ) and 6 ( Programming Paradigms ) .
Here are a few choice quotes :
It has become fashionable to regard notation as a secondary issue depending purely on personal taste .
This may partly be true ; yet the choice of notation should not be considered an arbitrary matter .
It has consequences , and it reveals the character of a language .
[ Wirth goes on to discuss = vs. == in C... ]
Enough has been said and written about this non-feature [ goto ] to convince almost everyone that it is a primary example of a bad idea .
The designer of Pascal retained the goto statement ( as well as the if statement without closing end symbol ) .
Apparently he lacked the courage to break with convention and made wrong concessions to traditionalists .
But that was in 1968 .
By now , almost everybody has understood the problem , but apparently not the designers of the latest commercial programming languages , such as C# .
The concept that languages serve to communicate between humans had been completely blended out , as apparently everyone could now define his own language on the fly .
The high hopes , however , were soon damped by the difficulties encountered when trying to specify , what these private constructions should mean .
As a consequence , the intreaguing idea of extensible languages faded away rather quickly .

69 % of those polled said medical care provision was still poor
Less than 40 % of those polled said things were good in their lives , compared to 71 % two years ago .
However , a majority of those questioned said that , despite daily violence , they did not believe Iraq was in a state of civil war .
More than 2,000 people took part in the BBC / ABC News poll .
There are also regional differences , with pessimism most keenly felt across central Iraq , including Baghdad , where Sunni Arabs are most numerous .
But despite their differences , 58 % overall said they wanted Iraq to remain a unified country .
Almost all said they did not want Iraqi to be broken up along sectarian lines .
The poll produced conflicting views on the role of the US and its allies .
Only 18 % said they had confidence in US and coalition troops , and 51 % said they thought attacks on coalition forces were justified .
However , only 35 % said foreign troops should leave Iraq now .
A further 63 % said they should go only after security has improved .
' Deteriorating lives '
The poll was commissioned by the BBC , ABC News , ARD German TV and USA Today .
It was conducted by D3 Systems .
The findings contrast sharply with those of a similar poll in 2005 , a year when elections were taking place .
Asked now whether they thought reconstruction efforts in Iraq had been effective , some 67 % said they felt they had not .
And just 38 % said the situation in the country was better than before the 2003 war , while 50 % said it was worse .
Many said the quality of their lives was deteriorating , with a particularly high proportion ( 88 % ) saying electricity and fuel supplies were poor .
Security remains a serious concern , with only 26 % saying they felt safe in their own neighbourhoods .
More than half of those polled said that they have not gone to markets or crowded areas and often stayed at home in order to avoid trouble .
Many said they often stopped their children from going to school .
Ethnic divide
Ethnic differences were particularly evident in attitudes towards the execution of Saddam Hussein , who was a Sunni leader in a predominantly Shia state .
WAS US RIGHT TO INVADE IRAQ ?
Absolutely right :
2007 : 22 %
2005 : 19 %
2004 : 20 % Somewhat right :
2007 : 25 %
2005 : 28 %
2004 : 29 % Somewhat wrong :
2007 : 19 %
2005 : 17 %
2004 : 13 % Absolutely wrong :
2007 : 34 %
2005 : 33 %
2004 : 26 % Refused / do n't know :
2007 : 0 %
2005 : 4 %
2004 : 13 %
Of Sunni Arabs questioned , more than 95 % said they regarded the manner of his death as inappropriate and unlikely to help the cause of reconciliation .
Shias predominantly took the opposite view - 82 % said the manner of death was appropriate .
But considerably fewer - 62 % - thought his execution would lead to reconciliation .
A large number of Sunnis , 48 % , said they thought Iraq should have a strong leader in five years ' time , compared to 46 % who said they wanted a democracy .
Only 11 % of Shias sought a strong leader , with 52 % calling for democracy and 37 % for an Islamic state .
But Circuit City ’s store managers found it hard to stick to the policy .
When they were divvying up the yearly pool of raise money , they would often increase the pay of all workers who had done a good job , even those at the range ’s ceiling , said Bill Cimino , Circuit City ’s chief spokesman .
It just seemed like the decent thing to do .
“ It ’s hard to say no , ” Mr. Cimino told me .
“ It ’s only 3 or 4 percent . ”
Eventually , though , the company ’s executives decided they could n’t afford decency for decency ’s sake .
In recent months , there has been a price war over flat - panel televisions that ’s an excellent case study of the benefits and drawbacks of globalization .
The price cuts have made the televisions , which are manufactured in Asia and Mexico , affordable to many more families , but have also squeezed Circuit City ’s margins .
At the same time , the company has to reckon with cut - throat competition from Wal - Mart and Best Buy .
Wal - Mart , in fact , has also been taking steps that seem aimed at pushing out more experienced workers , like setting wage caps for certain jobs and requiring people to work nights and weekends .
In 2005 , a top executive wrote Wal - Mart ’s board a memo , which McKinsey & Company helped put together , noting that “ the cost of an associate with 7 years of tenure is almost 55 percent more than the cost of an associate with 1 year of tenure , yet there is no difference in his or her productivity . ”
There is a real question about whether these chains will hurt themselves in the long run by damaging employee morale , customer service and , ultimately , productivity .
( Circuit City is forcing fired workers to wait 10 weeks to reapply for their jobs , I assume because the company executives were afraid that workers whose pay had been cut would n’t make effective sales associates . )
But there ’s no question that corporate America is moving in the same direction as Circuit City .
Companies are wringing out what they see as inefficiencies , like traditional pensions and health insurance coverage , and tying workers ’ pay more closely to their performance .
It ’s probably not possible to halt these changes .
It may not even be desirable .
The flexibility of the American labor force seems to be one reason that recessions have become less frequent and unemployment is less of a problem here than in Europe , notes Jason Furman , a leading Democratic economist .
In this country , fast - growing companies can hire new workers without worrying that they are making a 30 - year commitment .
But it would also be foolish to pretend nothing is changing .
The corporate safety net of the 20th century is going away , and a fundamentally different private sector will require a fundamentally different public sector .
DIGG THIS
The neocon pundit Frank Gaffney had his war lust tempered a bit last week when he invoked a fake quote by Lincoln in a Washington Times column in which he viciously attacked congressional opponents of an escalation of the war in the Middle East to Iran and beyond .
He called them all traitors by quoting Dishonest Abe as supposedly saying , " Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested , exiled , or hanged . "
The source of the quote was a December 23 , 2003 Insight magazine column by Michael Waller , who now admits that the quote is not genuine .
How disappointed our Strangelovian neocons ( a.k.a. , the Republican Party ) must be .
Poor Rep.
Don Young of Alaska was forced to apologize for calling his congressional colleagues traitors under the supposed cover of " Father Abraham , " as the Jaffa cult calls him .
In a supreme act of humility , Congressman Young confessed to the Washington Post on February 16 that he " was not advocating the hanging of Democrats . "
( Not yet , anyway . )
But there is hope for our twenty - first century Dr. Strangeloves .
Even if Lincoln never said the above statement , there is no denying that he did , in fact , arrest and exile Democratic Congressman Clement Vallandigham in 1863 .
And , he and his administration went on record on numerous occasions to say that all those who opposed them were guilty of treason .
That ’s why as many as 30,000 Northern citizens ( or more ) were imprisoned without due process during the Lincoln regime .
The ultimate penalty for treason at the time was death by hanging .
In fact , Lincoln believed that anyone who simply remained silent , and did not actively support his regime , was behaving in a treasonous manner .
In his own words : “ The man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his Government is discussed cannot be misunderstood .
If not hindered , he is sure to help the enemy ; much more if he talks ambiguously — talks for his country with ‘ buts ’ and ‘ ifs ’ and ‘ ands . ' ”
( Roy Basler , The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln , vol. 6 , p. 264 ) .
Waller says that his editor at Insight mistakenly put quotations around the quote , when in fact they were his words , not Dishonest Abe’s .
If so , then one would have a very difficult time arguing with Waller ’s interpretation of Lincoln ’s behavior .
When the British captured Washington , D.C. and set the White House on fire during the War of 1812 President James Madison , " father of the Constitution , " never dreamed of mass arresting and imprisoning all dissenters , shutting down the opposition press , and deporting congressional opponents of his war policy , as Lincoln did .
When Jefferson ’s election as president spawned a secession movement among the New England Federalists , he announced in his first inaugural address that if there were any who wanted to break apart the union they should be left unmolested as a testament to the strength of Americans ’ belief in a free society .
It was Lincoln who , immediately upon taking office , declared himself dictator , ignored the Constitution , abolished civil liberty in the Northern states , and waged total war on fellow citizens , killing 300,000 of them because they no longer consented to being governed by Washington , D.C. and politicians like himself .
He did all of this on behalf of an abstraction he labeled " the mystic chords of union . "
This was not unlike how future tyrants would kill hundreds of thousands , or millions , of their own people for the sake of " creating socialist man , " " the master race , " and other collectivist abstractions .
The Waller article in Insight is mostly about the Vallandigham affair , which I write about in my latest book , Lincoln Unmasked .
Congressman Vallandigham of Dayton , Ohio , was a huge thorn in the Republican Party ’s side from the very first day of the Lincoln administration .
In Lincoln ’s Critics : The Copperheads of the North , Frank L. Klement writes that Vallandigham " was one of the most ardent supporters of compromise measures designed to prevent a military conflict between North and South " before the war .
Once the war started , he became known as " the apostle of peace " and worked diligently for an end to the bloodshed and a reuniting of the two sections .
He was a free trader , opposed Lincolnian central banking and corporate welfare schemes , was a vociferous opponent to Lincoln ’s military conscription law , and was a Jeffersonian decentralist philosophically .
He once stated that he was " inexorably hostile to Puritan domination in religion or morals or literature or politics . "
This of course is what happened to America in the post - 1865 era with the New Englandization of the entire nation at the hands of the political descendants of the Puritans , the " Yankees . "
Clement Vallandigham posed a serious danger to the Lincoln regime , for as Klement wrote , " he was an excellent speaker . "
On January 14 , 1863 , he gave a stirring , pro-peace speech on the floor of the House of Representatives in which he charged that if the war continued , " civil rights would be washed away [ in the North ] .
The arbitrary arrests . . . , the purging of the polls in the border states , the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , and the mobbing of Democratic newspapers were all steps toward an eventual despotism " ( Klement , p. 119 ) .
The Republican Party in Ohio gerrymandered Vallandigham out of his congressional seat , after which he ran for governor of Ohio .
He continued to repeat his criticisms of the Lincoln regime , for which he was arrested and imprisoned , without due process , after sixty - seven armed federal soldiers broke into his Dayton , Ohio home in April of 1863 .
Lincoln wanted to portray him as a traitor , so he instructed that he be handed over to " his people , " the Confederate Army .
The Confederates had no idea who Vallandigham was ; he was not " one of them " but a former Congressman from the state of Grant and Sherman .
He went into exile in Canada .
Lincoln never showed any respect for constitutional liberty and was a rude , crude , political shyster of the worst kind .
( It is telling that one of his campaign managers in 1860 was the notoriously corrupt New York City politician Thurlow Weed ) .
As such , he cleverly brushed aside all the protests over the treatment of Vallandigham ( " There was a groundswell for Vallandigham among the masses , " writes Klement ) with a silly slogan .
" Must I shoot " a poor boy who deserts from the Army , he asked , while not touching a hair on the head of " the wily agitator " who causes him to desert ?
( Repeated just last week by Rush Limbaugh ) .
This masks and ignores the serious constitutional issue of the abolition of the separation of powers whereby one branch of government can literally imprison and deport members of another branch .
But such technicalities were never Lincoln ’s strong point ; intentionally confusing political rhetoric was .
Is n’t there something sick about the fact that it is Lincoln the heavy - handed tyrant ( and mass murderer of his own people ) that appeals so much to the Frank Gaffneys , Rush Limbaughs , and Newt Gingriches of the world ?
Whenever almost any politician or pundit proposes the abolition of more of our personal liberties , or embarking on another unnecessary war that will kill thousands without protecting America ( but make more enemies around the world while enriching politically - connected defense contractors ) , he invariably invokes The Legend of Father Abraham as his " justification . "
When Newt Gingrich called for the invasion and occupation of Iran , Syria , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , and North Korea in a September 7 , 2006 Wall Street Journal Online article , he naturally began the article with a quote from Lincoln about how we " must think anew . "
When Townhall.com , the web site founded by the Heritage Foundation , advocated sedition trials for opponents of the Bush administration ’s foreign policies , they invoked the Lincoln legend in a series of articles in 2005 and 2006 ( See Horace Cooper , " Not a Suicide Pact , " and Ben Shapiro , " Should We Prosecute Sedition ?

When neocon pundit Michelle Malkin proposed rounding up all American Muslims and putting them in concentration camps , as was done to Japanese Americans during World War II , she praised Lincoln for having suspended habeas corpus and imprisoned thousands " without access to judges " ( See her book , In Defense of Internment ) .
And when American Enterprise Institute ’s resident neocon political scientist Walter Berns wrote a book ( " Making Patriots " ) complaining that America ’s youth are too self - centered and not willing enough to participate in the neocon agenda of never - ending war around the globe , he offered the " solution " of more Lincolnite propaganda .
We must indoctrinate America ’s youth with the political rhetoric of Lincoln , our " statesman , poet , and . . . the martyred Christ of democracy ’s passion play , " says Berns .
Do n’t educate them about Lincoln ’s behavior , he says ( for obvious reasons ) , but " in the power and beauty of his words . "
Left - wing statists play this game as much as these right - wing statists do .
In a February 1991 article in The Nation magazine the renowned Columbia University " Civil War " historian Eric Foner opposed the break - up of the Soviet Union .
The title of the article was " Lincoln ’s Lesson . "
He harshly criticized Gorbachev for his weakness in allowing the Soviet republics to peacefully secede , something that Lincoln would never do .
The American union was " a permanent government , " a one - way Venus flytrap , as Murray Rothbard once sarcastically described it .
Foner , who once described the Communist Party U.S.A. as " a cultural front that helped to redraw the boundaries of American freedom , " hoped that " Gorbachev would surely agree " that this was also true of the Soviet Union .
If you want to live under a government defined by militarism , mercantilism , dictator worship , and imperialism , then continue following the political sons and daughters of " Father Abraham " as they continue to invoke their " martyred Christ " as rhetorical cover for an agenda that sounds remarkably identical to early twentieth - century European fascism .
Americans once fought a war against such an ideology , if you can recall .

Nine - eleven conspiracy theories have been circulating for years , producing millions of Web links , scores of books , and a nationwide collection of doubters known as the “ 9/11 Truth ” movement .
In 2005 the State Department responded by posting some “ clues ” to “ identifying misinformation ” on their Web site .
“ Does the story claim that vast , powerful , evil forces are secretly manipulating events ? ” it asks .
“ If so , this fits the profile of a conspiracy theory .
Conspiracy theories are rarely true , even though they have great appeal and are often widely believed .
In reality , events usually have much less exciting explanations . ”
One of the first American officials to publicly acknowledge conspiracy theories in connection with 9/11 was President George Bush , who on November 10 , 2001 , in a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations , said , “ Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September 11 . ”
Yet according to a May 2006 Zogby poll , 42 percent of Americans now believe that the U.S. government and the 9/11 commission “ concealed or refused to investigate critical evidence that contradicts their official explanation of the September 11th attacks , ” and that “ there has been a cover - up . ”
For those who ca n’t find information about the alleged cover - up on the nightly news , there is Loose Change , a documentary about 9/11 conspiracy theories which just might be the first Internet blockbuster .
Since it appeared on the Web in April 2005 , the 80 - minute film has been climbing up and down Google Video ’s “ Top 100 , ” rising to No. 1 this May , with at least 10 million viewings .
“ We beat the woman getting punched in the face , ” says its director , 22 - year - old Dylan Avery , from Oneonta , New York ( population 13,000 ) , referring to an oft watched video .
“ We beat the guy who beats his computer with his keyboard , ” says his producer , 23 - year - old Korey Rowe , also from Oneonta and an army specialist who served in Afghanistan and Iraq .
“ We beat the [ Stephen ] Colbert speech , ” says Jason Bermas , 26 , their researcher .
“ The viral videos , we dominate them . ”
Told in MTV - style jump cuts , illustrated by high - end graphics , and scored with hip music written by a few of their friends , Loose Change is an investigation into the official story of 9/11 as told by The 9/11 Commission Report , asking a number of highly controversial questions :
What , for example , were the explosions some witnesses heard after the towers were hit by planes ?
Why was the site of the collapse not treated as a crime scene , and why was the debris shipped off as waste to several foreign countries ?
After deciding to get pimping it took us about five seconds to plump for a Cadburys Creme Egg .
We decided not to let the fact that it had been pimped before put us off because we thought we could make the Creme de la Creme Egg !
The ingredients :
1.5 kg of Cadburys Milk Chocolate
3lbs of granulated sugar
2 x 140 g bottles of liquid glucose
vanilla extract
red food colouring
yellow food colouring
Our first challenge was obtaining out of season Creme Eggs for comparison and mid-pimp snacking but that was solved thanks to the internet .
Three days later we were the proud owners of 48 of them !
After procuring an Easter Egg mould ( £ 4.32 from eBay ) we were ready to go .
Making the shell :
Melt about 150 g chocolate in a glass bowl over a pan of boiling water .
Spread the melted chocolate into the egg mould with a pastry brush .
Place in fridge until set .
Repeat 10 - 12 times to build up a shell about 1 /2 " thick .
Trim the edges with a sharp knife then pop the shells out of the moulds .
Engrave shells with the classic Creme Egg star and rings pattern and return to moulds for protection .
Hitachi's new neuroimaging technique allows its operator to switch a train set on and off by thought alone , and the Japanese company aims to commercialize it within five years .
Mind - machine interfacing is n't unheard of : just weeks ago , a young patient was given a chance to play Space Invaders through the power of thought .
And this all comes hot on the heels of a revolution in microsurgery , allowing artificial limbs to be wired to the brain by reusing existing nerves .
The difference this time is that Hitachi 's system does n't invasively co-opt the nervous sytem , instead using a topographic modelling system to measure blood flow in the brain , translating the images into signals that are sent to the controller .
So far , this new technique only allows for simple switching decisions , but Hitachi aims to commercialize it within five years for use by paralyzed patients and those undergoing " cognitive rehabilitation . "

I am always disappointed by public meetings .
We hold public meetings for people to give us comment , and we never get the kind of comment I hope for .
I keep hoping some guy will stop in and say “ Why , that problem looks like one we solved for a tricky transportation issue !
You might not think so , but I think the underlying structure is the same .
Have you thought about this algorithm , which worked for us ? ”
And then I would say , “ That just might work !
Maybe you could show me how you derived it over dinner tonight . ”
And he would say “ Only if I can take you out for dessert after , so we can talk about other potential applications .
But it will have to be in Midtown , because I rode my bike here . ”
And then I would start blushing and fanning myself , because I would be thinking impure thoughts .
That is from Megan Non-McArdle .
Her politics are not mine , but if you scroll down her blog for the last few days , you ’ll find some of the best posts on regulation in all of Blog Land ; here is her post on how regulation can go wrong .
From my angle :
1. Government regulations have a very large aggregate net benefit relative to their costs ; rules for clean gas , taken alone , might be more valuable than all the other regulatory costs we bear .
If you do n’t believe me , try visiting Mexico City in November .
I ’ve also been to Delhi .
2 . Many government regulations are simply unnecessary .
3 . No one has come up with a good algorithm for weeding out the bad regulations from the good ones .
Nonetheless cost - benefit analysis , for all its philosophic flaws , can serve this function .
You do n’t have to take CBA very seriously for this to be true .
It will reject towing in icebergs from the Arctic to supply water in New Zealand , and for the right reasons .
A deeper question is whether throwing darts at the Federal Register , as a means of eliminating new excess regulation , will bring a positive expected return .
4 . In many areas the difference between " government regulation " and " government protecting property rights " is not well - defined .
Reread # 3 .
5 . The costs of regulation sometimes involve intransitivities .
Many small regulations , examined individually , might be said to bring zero net harm , but taken collectively they tax innovation .
It is simply very hard to run a business and deal with extensive regulation ; attention and effort are scarce .
More people on the left should take seriously the political conversion of George McGovern to a pro-business stance , after he tried running a business himself .
6 . In Megan ’s area — water policy — property rights are especially likely to be poorly defined and the scope for regulation ( or is that " enforcement of property rights " ? ) is especially likely to be strong .
First steps to develop artificial retina with nanotechnology
( Nanowerk News )
The world 's first direct electrical link between nerve cells and photovoltaic nanoparticle films has been achieved by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston ( UTMB ) and the University of Michigan .
The development opens the door to applying the unique properties of nanoparticles to a wide variety of light - stimulated nerve - signaling devices  including the possible development of a nanoparticle - based artificial retina .
Nanoparticles are artificially created bits of matter not much bigger than individual atoms .
Their behavior is controlled by the same forces that shape molecules ; they also exhibit the bizarre effects associated with quantum mechanics .
Scientists can exploit these characteristics to custom - build new materials " from the bottom up " with characteristics such as compatibility with living cells and the ability to turn light into tiny electrical currents that can produce responses in nerves .
That 's what the UTMB and Michigan researchers did , using a process devised by Michigan chemical engineering professor Nicholas Kotov , one of the authors of a paper on the research appearing in the current issue of Nano Letters .
The process starts with a glass plate and then builds a layer - by - layer sandwich of two kinds of ultra - thin films , one made of mercury - tellurium nanoparticles and another of a positively charged polymer called PDDA .
The scientists then added a layer of ordinary clay and a cell - friendly coating of amino acid , and placed cultured neurons on the very top .
When light shines on them , the mercury - tellurium nanoparticle film layers produce electrons , which then move up into the PDDA film layers and produce an upward - moving electrical current .
" As you build up the layers of this , you get better capabilities to absorb photons and generate voltage , " said UTMB research scientist Todd Pappas , lead author on the Nano Letters paper .
" When the current reaches the neuron membrane , it depolarizes the cell to the point where it fires , and you get a signal in the nerve . "
Although light signals have previously been transmitted to nerve cells using silicon ( whose ability to turn light into electricity is employed in solar cells and in the imaging sensors of video cameras ) , nanoengineered materials promise far greater efficiency and versatility .
" It should be possible for us to tune the electrical characteristics of these nanoparticle films to get properties like color sensitivity and differential stimulation , the sort of things you want if you 're trying to make an artificial retina , which is one of the ultimate goals of this project , " Pappas said .
" You can't do that with silicon .
Plus , silicon is a bulk material  silicon devices are much less size - compatible with cells . "
The researchers caution that despite the great potential of a light - sensitive nanoparticle - neuron interface , creating an actual implantable artificial retina is a long - range project .
But they 're equally hopeful about a variety of other , less complex applications made possible by a tiny , versatile light - activated interface with nerve cells  such things as new ways to connect with artificial limbs and other prostheses , and revolutionary new tools for imaging , diagnosis and therapy .
FUNDRAISING , REPUBLICAN STYLE ….
A reader in Washington recently bought a house from a very conservative elderly man , and apparently the efficient folks at the National Republican Senatorial Committee have now started sending him their fundraising appeals .
He sent me a copy of their latest mailing , and I thought I ’d share it with you .
Basically , it ’s a fake survey , with the lucky recipient informed that he ’s been singled out to represent “ all Republicans living in your voting district . ”
Here ’s the pitch :
So far , it ’s a fairly standard hard sell direct mail piece , complete with appeals to keep “ Union Bosses and other liberal special interests ” from destroying our great nation ?
at which point the recipient is repeatedly hit up to return the survey “ along with your generous donation . ”
But the best part is at the bottom :
So that ’s it .
That ’s their pitch to elderly Republican voters .
You MUST return this survey , and by the way , you also need to send us $ 11 to “ cover the cost of tabulating and redistributing ” the results .
You can see the full mailing here .
I wonder who came up with this scam ?
How many elderly Republicans end up sending the NRSC $ 11 because they ’re convinced they ’ve been specially chosen to represent their district and figure eleven bucks must be a legitimate fee of some kind ?
Hundreds ?
Thousands ?
Does everyone feeble - minded enough to include the $ 11 payment go into a special chump file for future use ?
Do Democrats do stuff like this too ?
Am I naive to find this kind of thing revolting ?

This is an interesting idea , make a normal looking suburban home , and make it a Zero Carbon Home .
Zero carbon homes are structures that attempt to reduce to 0 the amount of co2 it takes to run the home .
The Zero Carbon House is a low energy demonstration project to show how renewable energy can create a unique living experience on a remote island in a severe climate .
A holistic approach has been taken to eliminating household carbon emissions that would normally result from heating and powering the home , running the family car and growing and transporting food .
Based on a normal timber frame , built from local and sustainably grown lumber , this home looks like any other you might see in the burbs .
However there is a difference .
For one this home is energy efficient .
Built tight and with efficiency in mind it will use less energy than your normal house .
It is also renewable powered by two wind turbines , with a backup up Redox fuel cell for evening out the non-windy days .
All extra energy created will be stored for later use instead of feeding back into the grid .
A choice I am not sure I would have made .
The house is heated with a air - to - water heat exchanger that runs the radiant floor heating system .
The home also uses passive solar heating principles to minimize energy used for heating .
The extra heat will also be used to grow food in a hydroponic greenhouse out back .
This means that they can “ eat local ” all year round .
This might be my favorite part of this home .
I think most suburban homes , with their sprawling back yards have more than enough space to set up a solar thermal powered green house to grow food year round .
Zero carbon heat from the heat pump will augment passive solar collection in a doubly - insulated greenhouse to provide suitable growing conditions for a range of fruit and vegetables grown in a hydroponics system .
The availability of fresh affordable food is a major concern on Unst and other remote islands in Scotland .
The erection of the first greenhouse will demonstrate production of locally grown food to reduce food miles and to give the community fresh affordable produce to improve the dietary habits of the community in line with the Scottish Executive ’s objectives .
The project will be self financing after 3 years , by starting a horticulture business , and using the home as a training and educational facility .
They also sprung for the bonus package and set up a satellite link so that energy monitoring can be done live over the Internet .
I might have skipped this step , but if they plan on making this a demonstration project for other to emulate it will be helpful for people to see just how well this home is working .

No 2 . Chicago : Alinea $ 192 British pound : 110 Eur : 160 Alinea 's opening last spring generated major buzz , thanks to Executive Chef Grant Achatz , former sous - chef to Thomas Keller at French Laundry in Napa , California .
Achatz left French Laundry for Trio , the Illinois restaurant where he continued making his name with an entrée called Black Truffle Explosion , which actually featured bursts of truffle broth while diners chewed .
At Alinea , guests choose from a menu of as many as 24 mini-courses , which can take as long as five hours to finish .
Since opening , Alinea has not disappointed Achatz fans , and reservations must be made several months in advance .
No 3 . Seattle : The Herbfarm $ 152 British pound : 87 Eur : 127 Live guitar music , herbs and vegetables grown on the grounds and a large selection of Pacific Northwest wines are just a few of the reasons why The Herbfarm is a unique dining experience .
Paying over $ 150 per person outside of New York or Los Angeles is a bit uncommon , but at The Herbfarm -- where a nine - course meal ( at $ 159 to $ 189 , including wine but excluding tip and tax ) can take over four hours to consume -- we promise you it 's worth it .
No 4 . San Francisco : French Laundry $ 135 British pound : 77 Eur : 113 The restaurant takes reservations two months to the calendar date in advance , so get booking now -- it 's universally acknowledged as one of the must - dine destinations in California , and even in the entire U.S. Thomas Keller , the renowned chef behind the restaurant , made waves lately with the opening of Per Se in the Time Warner Center in New York , but French Laundry remains his landmark property , and one well worth checking out .
The prix fixe menu consists of between five and nine whimsically named dishes , such as Oysters and Pearls , which is pearl tapioca custard served with caviar and oyster .
Tasting menus are priced at $ 175 per person .
No 5 . Washington , D.C : Inn at Little Washington $ 129 British pound : 74 Eur : 108 This country inn and restaurant opened in 1978 in a converted garage in Rappahannock County .
The self - taught chef and owner , Patrick O'Connell , has since catapulted his inn and restaurant -- now a Relais & Chateaux property -- to national attention with innovative , hearty appetizers and entrées like lobster napoleon or a " salmon five ways " starter .
The homemade bread basket brought to the table , which includes chewy poppy seed rolls and rye bread with currants and nuts , is refilled every few minutes .
Prix fixe menus start at $ 138 per person during the week .
No 6 . Philadelphia : Le Bec - Fin$ 120 British pound : 69 Eur : 100Le Bec - Fin celebrates its 35th anniversary this year .
To commemorate the event , the restaurant launched a new , three - course prix fixe dinner as an alternate to the much heaver , seven - course prix fixe ( $ 138 per person ) that had traditionally been the only option .
To toast your date , order La Bicyclette , a champagne cocktail with raspberry spirits and Chambord raspberry liquor introduced in honor of this year 's anniversary .
When it opened in 1970 , Chef Georges Perrier could n't have known the formal restaurant would become a hallmark of a town famous for its cheese steaks .
Luckily for us , it did .
No 7 . Los Angeles : Bastide $ 101 British pound : 58 Eur : 84 Classic
French cuisine would n't set Bastide apart in and of itself .
But the impeccable quality of the ingredients helps explain why this restaurant has made our list for the second year in a row -- and helps justify the price tag .
Indeed , the restaurant 's owner , Joe Pytka , once paid $ 35,000 for a one - kilogram white truffle , which he incorporated into the menu .
Entrées start at $ 50 .
No 8 . Las Vegas : Picasso$ 91 British pound : 52 Eur : 76 Although
The Bellagio is n't short of dining options , the Picasso is a venerable favorite for hotel guests or anyone who comes through Las Vegas .
Original works of art by Pablo Picasso , including oil paintings and ceramic sculptures , decorate the dramatic space .
But do n't come for the art : Come for the French - Mediterranean menu , the real reason for the restaurant 's popularity .
And plan to come early to fortify yourself before a night of gambling , as the kitchen closes at 9:30 P.M .
The four - course menu is $ 90 and the five - course meal is $ 100 .
No 9 . Atlanta : Seeger 's $ 86 British pound : 49 Eur : 72 Currently closed to undergo renovations on everything from the dining room to the menu , Seeger 's will reopen on Oct. 14 .
The eclectic menu , which changes daily according to the whims of Head Chef Guenter Seeger , will feature four - course ( $ 105 without wine ) and eight - course ( $ 125 without wine ) tasting menus , instead of the five - and eight - course menus previously on offer .
The dining room , which once accommodated 65 , will be whittled down to only 32 , and the wine list will be thoroughly expanded .
If this sounds up your alley , Seeger 's is currently accepting reservations for the week of their reopening .
No 10 .
Orlando , Fla. : Victoria & Albert 's$ 85 British pound : 49 Eur : 71 Frette linens and Christofle silver may not sound very Disney , but it's all part of the dining experience at Victoria & Albert 's , the restaurant located in the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa , a part of Walt Disney World , in Orlando , Fla .
Not only that , but the seven - course seasonal menu ( $ 95 without wine ; $ 145 with wine ) , which is customized daily and may include such delicacies as Hudson Valley foie gras , Fuji apples or dayboat diver scallops , is very adult - friendly -- as is the 4,200 - bottle wine cellar .
By now all reasonable people in the world know that the Bush administration ( with almost no opposition from Democrats ) used 9/11 as a pretense to invade and occupy an oil - rich Middle Eastern country that posed no threat to America .
Even President Bush has admitted in a press conference that there were never any WMDs in Iraq .
But the war has been very profitable for some , as war always is , as it has drained American taxpayers of hundreds of billions of dollars .
It has also ballooned the warfare state , the military - industrial complex , and the conservative anti-civil liberties lobby .
( On the day of this writing the talking heads on the FOX War Channel were all but dancing in the streets of Manhattan in celebration of a bill passed by the U.S. Senate the previous evening that would allow for the suspension of habeas corpus .
Can mass burn - the - Constitution rallies , perhaps organized by Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , be far behind ? )
But the state ’s use of this illegitimate war to aggrandize itself goes much , much farther than this .
Those Americans who are still concerned about the state ’s ability to plunder us into poverty and strip us of personal liberties are extremely fortunate that Professor James Bennett of George Mason University has stepped up to explain exactly how this is happening with his new book , Homeland Security Scams ( Transaction Publishers , 2006 ) .
Read this book and the crassness , dishonesty , and plain chutzpah of the state in using the " war on terror " as an excuse to pick your pocket will boggle your mind .
The average reader will also be shocked at the remarkable blueprint for fascism that has been mapped out for us by our rulers in the post - 9/11 world .
Indeed , the very name " Homeland Security " has an obvious echo of " fatherland , " as Professor Bennett ominously points out .
" Americans have never used the world u2018homeland ’ to describe their country " anywhere and at any time .
The very word is un-American and reeks of fascism .
The major theme of Homeland Security Scams is stated on page 1 :
" [ H ] omeland security is developing into the largest boondoggle in the history of the U.S. government .
Fed by the . . . war on terror , homeland security is being used as an excuse . . . for a vast expansion of government power and spending . "
And the spending usually has nothing at all to do with " defense " or " security . "
" Homeland security is not making us safer : just poorer , less free , and more dependent on the federal government , " Professor Bennett charges .
In the following 217 pages he provides chapter and verse to prove his point .
The " scam " is that the word " homeland security " is routinely invoked to " justify " thousands of pork barrel spending programs that have nothing to do with safety or security .
They are simply pork .
So much money is being drained from the taxpayers ’ pockets under this ruse that governments cannot spend it fast enough .
" North Carolina spent only 30 percent . . . of the federal homeland security monies it had received in 2004 . "
" Under President Bush , the Republicans have become the party of Big Government . "

Professor Bennett has always been a libertarian - minded conservative , and is disgusted by the descent of formerly like - minded institutions , such as the Heritage Foundation , into the fascistic abyss of Big Government neo-conservatism .
He writes that the Heritage Foundation was " largely co-opted by the Reagan administration " in the 1980s and has been " ever since ensconced firmly in the GOP ’s right pocket . "
It has " abandoned any . . . interest in restricting leviathan . . . " ( p. 200 ) .
The Heritage Foundation ’s position papers in " the age of Bush II " sound the old , leftist themes of " Spend , spend , spend .
Regulate , regulate , regulate . "
( This would also seem to have dire implications for the Mont Pelerin Society , of which Heritage Foundation president Ed Fulner is the longtime treasurer and board member . )
The primary beneficiaries of all this are " politicians , lobbyists , and a flourishing homeland security industry . "
This would also include , in my opinion , all of the neocon " think tanks , " magazines , and " scholars " who are paid to provide the intellectual cover for the scam .
The " one constant " that keeps the racket going is fear .
As long as our rulers can continue to frighten the public with promises of " terror " their motives and actions will not be questioned by the vast majority of the public .
The Department of Fatherland ( Oops , I mean " Homeland " ) Security ( DHS ) was not simply a response to 9/11 .
Our rulers had planned for an Orwellian bureaucracy of that sort years in advance , with the twelve - member Rudman - Hart Commission , originated under Bill Clinton ’s administration .
9/11 provided the perfect excuse .
Professor Bennett reveals exactly how the plot was hatched .
Meanwhile , the already gargantuan " internal security " apparatus of the U.S. government ( another phrase that was popular in totalitarian societies ) was a complete and total failure on 9/11 because , says Professor Bennett , it had been preoccupied for years with the non-threat of " the bogeymen of the 1990s : militias and other right - wing populist groups . "
The so - called militias " made a useful hate object for upper - middle - class liberals who wished to feel threatened , " and the FBI , CIA , BATF , and other federal agencies gladly complied .
After all , some of these " militiamen " were alleged tax evaders .
Professor Bennett gives a detailed explanation of how the Republican Party ’s Deep Thinkers decided that simply renaming several dozen bureaucracies would somehow make America " safe . "
That , in essence , is how the Department of Homeland Security was created  by connecting " bits and pieces and chunks " of various federal bureaucracies in an effort " that would make Dr. Frankenstein proud . "
And it was a goldmine for every one of these useless , jack - booted bureaucracies , from the INS to FEMA , the " Federal Protective Service " and the " Domestic Energy Support Teams . "
The claim that they are now " fighting terrorism " is all they needed to get Congress to increase their budgets seemingly exponentially .
Lincoln Unmasked : What ...
Thomas J. Dilorenzo Best Price : $ 5.95 Buy New $ 9.85 ( as of 07:10 EST - Details )
The language of the DHS really is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany .
Its web site claims that its mission is " securing the homeland , " a " locution so foreign to Americans as to bring a shudder to the spine . "
Another slogan is " Preserving our freedoms , protecting America . . . we secure our homeland . "
One can just imagine that there must be a continual showing of the movie " Triumph of the Will " playing 24 hours a day at DHS headquarters .
Among the more insidious effects of the state ’s response to 9/11 , writes Professor Bennett , is a massive miseducation of the American public about the true nature of bureaucrats and bureaucracy .
" Gone forever [ is ] the invidious caricature of the pencil - pushing , clock - watching goldbricker : the federal employee of the twenty - first century [ is ] a cocky , can - do Tom Cruise , a perky and feisty Sandra Bullock . "
Since 9/11 " every police officer and fire fighter is a saint ; soldiers are selfless heroes u2018 fighting for our freedom ’ ; CIA agents are sexy glamorous , and deeply ethical ; even George W. Bush is a steely - eyed missile man , in the old Mercury Seven astronaut term of praise . "
You know the pork barrel is massive when " Thirteen committees and sixty subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have jurisdiction over . . . the DHS . "
Every member of Congress wants to be on a committee or subcommittee that can distribute pork to his or her constituents and campaign contributors under the phony guise of " homeland security . "
State and local police and fire departments are also being slowly nationalized thanks to DHS pork , for with federal money comes federal controls .
Conservatives used to fear the federalization of law enforcement , Professor Bennett points out , but now they champion it .
Former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge once boasted that his department had " redefined a new federalism " when in fact it " is destroying true federalism " by increasingly taking over local law enforcement .
His " strategy " was " to view federal , state , and local governments as one entity " ( again reminiscent of Nazi Germany , where all governmental powers were centralized and under the direction of a dictator with no constitutional limits on his authority ) .
As for the pork , a few examples will give you the flavor of how out - of - control it has become :
Boeing was given a five - year , $ 1.37 billion contract to equip U.S. airports with " bomb screening devices " that experts say are " laughingly ineffective . "
Northrop Grumman " landed a $ 350 million contract to construct a DHS data network .
" First - responder training facilities are springing up like toadstools after a rainstorm .
The Nevada Test Site . . . which trains 3,000 fire fighters , paramedics , and policemen annually , is slated to quintuple that number as the DHS money rolls in . "
The new Hampshire town of Bennington , population 1 , 272 , spent part of its Homeland Security grant to buy chemical weapons suits  just in case bin Laden chose Bennington as his next maximum impact target .
Local police departments in New Hampshire will get access to " satellite television channels that transmit continuous news , " courtesy of a DHS grant .
Colchester , Vermont , population 18,000 , received a DHS grant to purchase a " search - and - rescue vehicle " that " can bore through concrete and search for victims in collapsed buildings . "
Thanks to the influence of Dick Cheney , " Wyoming receives more money per capita than any other state in homeland security grants . "
And naturally , " a non-state  the District of Columbia  is far and away the biggest recipient of homeland security grants per capita , " receiving more than twice as much as Dick Cheney ’s home state .
Citgo , Conoco - Phillips , and Shell received tens of millions of dollars in DHS grants for " refiner security , " something they are very well equipped to finance themselves .
The former mayor of Washington , D.C. , Sharon Pratt , received a no - bid " bioterrorism consulting contract " for $ 236,000 .
Forty " young people " in Washington , D.C. were paid by a DHS grant to " rap and dance about emergency preparedness . "

As part of its nonstop assault on civil liberties the DHS employs an " entertainment liaison " whose job is to try to " shape the political content of films " made in Hollywood .
Its " Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II " would " for the first time put the government in the business of conducting regular background checks on everyday citizens . "
The Orwellian PATRIOT
Act is expertly dissected by Professor Bennett , and its entrails are revealed to be poisonous to personal liberty in American , patently unpatriotic , and useless in " fighting terrorism . "
This totalitarian legislation eviscerates the Fourth Amendment by permitting " sneak and peak " searches , without a warrant , of email , homes , offices , libraries , and internet records .
Warrant - less searches have routinely been made by armed federal agents ; and even the attorney - client privilege has been trashed by the Bush administration .
The CIA has been given expanded powers to spy on ordinary American citizens and the GOP ’s fascistic " internal security " bureaucracies " reach into banking , business , educational , and financial records " in an unprecedented way .
The FBI has even been empowered " to force librarians to reveal the borrowing habits of patrons . . . "
Moreover , " practically any act of civil disobedience could be construed to violate the law " under the laughingly - named PATRIOT Act .
This is just a small sampling of how Big Government Conservatives are hard at work destroying American liberty while the " liberal opposition " stands idly by like so many political eunuchs .
Apart from revealing the shocking degree to which the state has used the excuse of 9/11 to wage " war " on the American public by picking its pockets and destroying its liberties , Homeland Security Scams also provides definitive proof that the conservative movement no longer has any interest whatsoever in limited government  if it ever did .
" The Heritage Beltway Right has gone over almost completely to the statist side , " Professor Bennett laments in his concluding chapter .
Frankly , I ’m not so sure they were not always on that side .
After all , it was " Mr. Conservative , " William F. Buckley , Jr. , who announced in the 1950s , shortly after the founding of National Review , that what was needed to fight the Cold War was a " totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores " complete with high taxes , a giant military - industrial complex , expansive powers granted to the CIA and FBI , and the subsequent loss of freedoms that all of that would entail .
With the exception of a dozen or so libertarians who influenced parts of the Reagan administration in its first two years ( after which they became irrelevant ) , this statist vision has been the defining characteristic of " conservatism " in America for at least the past half century .

An artist 's impression shows the geysers erupting through ice
Images from a camera orbiting Mars have shown the 100 mph jets of carbon dioxide erupt through ice at the planet 's south pole , Arizona State University says .
The orbiting camera , called the Thermal Emission Imaging System ( Themis ) , is on the Mars Odyssey probe .
The geyser debris leaves dark spots , fan - like markings and spider - shaped features on the ice cap .
The scientists said geysers erupted when sunlight warming the ice turned frozen carbon dioxide underground into high - pressure gas .
" If you were there , you 'd be standing on a slab of carbon dioxide ice , " said the university 's Dr Phil Christensen .
" All around you , roaring jets of CO2 gas are throwing sand and dust a couple of hundred feet into the air . "
Dr Christensen said the process was " unlike anything that occurs on Earth " .
His team discovered the jets through examining more than 200 Themis visible and infrared images .
The findings were published in the latest edition of the journal Nature .
WaPo :
The Army 's highest - ranking officer said Friday that he was unsure whether the U.S. military would capture or kill Osama bin Laden , adding , " I do n't know that it 's all that important , frankly . "
" So we get him , and then what ? " asked Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker , the outgoing Army chief of staff , at a Rotary Club of Fort Worth luncheon .
" There 's a temporary feeling of goodness , but in the long run , we may make him bigger than he is today .
Anyone want to hazard a guess as to why it " emboldens the enemy " in Iraq to say we 're going to require that troops we send there have adequate armor and training , but it 's " bold leadership " to say we just do n't really care all that much about eliminating bin Laden ?
Remind me , which one of these enemies " followed us home " again ?
Now , has he got a point ?
Sure he does .
Al Qaeda is bigger than just Osama bin Laden .
And , as the article notes :
Schoomaker pointed to the capture of Saddam Hussein , the killings of his sons , Uday and Qusay , and the killing of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi as evidence that the capture or death of al - Qaeda 's leader would have little effect on threats to the United States .
You have to admit , there 's an element of truth to that .
Of course , it 's an element of truth that someone we know was ridiculed for making ... three years ago :
Anti-war candidate Howard Dean said Monday " the capture of Saddam has not made America safer , " directly contradicting President Bush and drawing the wrath of two Democratic presidential rivals .
And let 's just be clear about what that says up there .
It says two Democratic presidential rivals joined in bashing Dean on that point .
And they were ?
A forceful proponent of the war , Sen . Joe Lieberman , said Dean is in a " spider hole of denial , " a reference to Saddam 's ignominious hideout and Dean 's assessment of the capture 's impact .
[ Sen. John ]
Kerry said the front - runner 's speech " is still more proof that all the advisers in the world can't give Howard Dean the military and foreign policy experience , leadership skills , or diplomatic temperament necessary to lead this country through dangerous times . "
Only one of the above Democratic rivals has come to see the error of his ways since then .
The other , of course , is no longer Democratic .
Home / Career / How to Get the Promotion You Deserve
How to Get the Promotion You Deserve
We all know a thing or two about unrewarded effort .
The fastest way to get a promotion you ’ve earned or a position you want is to be pro-active about the process .
I ’ve followed the steps below and it ’s netted me four promotions in seven years on the job .
1 ) Determine Expectations
Identify the goals for the position you have and the position you want .
Find out what your boss and your company expect from you in return for your current salary and the salary you desire .
Many companies have a list of expected skill sets and duties for each job .
2 ) Perform a Gap Analysis
Find the gap between what you do today and what needs to be done to get promoted .
Using the expectations for your current and desired role , make a list of the skills and responsibilities required for the next level that that you do n’t currently possess or perform .
3 ) Communicate Your Desires & Intentions
Schedule an hour long meeting with your boss .
Bring along your list of skills and responsibilities that are needed to earn a promotion .
Start off by letting your manager know that your goal is to get to the next level .
Then walk through your list and come up with projects you can work on that will help you achieve a promotion .
4 ) Monitor & Prioritize Your Work
Compare all new work that you ’re assigned or that someone asks for help with against your list of skills and responsibilities .
Focus your efforts on the work that will help you meet your career goals .
This might sound a bit petty or selfish but in the corporate world , you have to be your own advocate because it ’s likely one else will .
As you finish projects and learn new skills keep track of these accomplishments , documenting them as you go .
5 ) Cash In Your Chips
Once you feel you ’ve achieved the items on your list setup another meeting with your boss .
Do n’t jump the gun .
Make sure you really have mastered what is expected of you and met any timeframe requirements that were discussed in your initial meeting .
Bring along a document summarizing how you achieved each goal along with examples .
After delivering your spiel , ask for the promotion .
If the meeting ends with your boss agreeing you ’ve earned a promotion , send them an electronic copy of your summary .
Most managers have to submit some type of recommendation to their boss to secure your advancement , which requires time they often do n’t have .
You ’ve basically written the justification for them so give them a head start and take away any reason they have to delay your promotion .
Progress Takes Time
Notice that some period of time will pass between 3 and step 5 .
This is where you must prove yourself competent or even extraordinary .
This is the hard part , doing the actual work .
The great part is if you follow these steps then you wo n’t feel like all the hard work is for nothing .
You ’re working towards a goal and your effort should pay off .
Growth Opportunities
One thing to consider at the beginning of this process is the amount of room for growth in your current environment .
I started my career in a new product group that has grown from 8 to 50 people .
As the product grew , there were opportunities for career advancement for its members .
If your current group does not offer much opportunity for growth it may be time to look for another job .
If you follow all the steps above but there are no openings to fill then it will be tough for your manager to promote you .
Promote Yourself !

PARIS ( Reuters ) - French secret services produced nine reports between September 2000 and August 2001 looking at the al Qaeda threat to the United States , and knew it planned to hijack an aircraft , Le Monde newspaper reported on Monday .

French secret services produced nine reports between September 2000 and August 2001 looking at the al Qaeda threat to the United States , and knew it planned to hijack an aircraft , the French daily Le Monde said on Monday .

The newspaper said it had obtained 328 pages of classified documents that showed foreign agents had infiltrated Osama bin Laden ’s network and were carefully tracking its moves .
One document prepared in January 2001 was entitled “ Plan to hijack an aircraft by Islamic radicals ” , and said the operation had been discussed in Kabul at the start of 2000 by al Qaeda , Taliban and Chechen militants .
The hijack was meant to happen between March and September 2000 but the planners put it back “ because of differences of opinion , particularly over the date , objective and participants , ” said Le Monde , quoting from the report .
The attacks on U.S. cities that eventually occurred on September 11 , 2001 killed nearly 3,000 people .
In the United States , CIA spokesman George Little said Le Monde ’s article did not add to what was already known about the attacks .
“ Today ’s Le Monde article merely repeats what the U.S. government knew and reported before September 11 -- that al Qaeda was interested in airliner plots , especially hijackings , ” he said .
“ The article does not suggest that U.S. or foreign officials had advance knowledge of the details surrounding the September 11 plot .
Had the details been known , the U.S. government would have acted on them . ”
Le Monde said the French report of January 2001 had been handed over to a CIA operative in Paris but that no mention of it had been made in the official U.S. September 11 Commission , which produced its findings in July 2004 .
The newspaper quoted a former senior official at France ’s DGSE secret service agency as saying that , although France thought a hijack was being planned , the DGSE did not know the plot involved flying aircraft into buildings .
“ You have to remember that a plane hijack ( in January 2001 ) did not have the same significance as it did after September 11 .
At the time , it implied forcing a plane to land at an airport and undertaking negotiations , ” said Pierre - Antoine Lorenzi .
Le Monde said the documents showed the French believed bin Laden was still receiving help from family members and senior officials in Saudi Arabia ahead of September 11 , 2001 , despite attempts to clamp down on the network after al Qaeda ’s attacks on U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998 .
Far from taking Java to new heights , Sun Microsystems ' latest platform specification is a nail in the coffin of enterprise Java .
That 's according to analyst house the Burton Group , whose latest report , JEE5 : the Beginning of the End of Java EE , predicts the death of enterprise Java within the next five years .
According to Burton , Java EE 5.0 has failed to deliver on the promise of reducing enterprise Java 's notorious complexity and Java EE is risking extinction with the rise of more flexible programming platforms such as Ruby on Rails .
Senior analyst Richard Monson - Haefel reportedly said the failure of Sun and others to address complexity means Java EE will go the way of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture ( CORBA ) .
" In five years , Java EE will be the CORBA of the 21st Century , " Monson - Haefel said .
According to Monson - Haefel : " JEE5 fails to save Java EE ... it 's a harbinger of Java EE as the dominant enterprise platform . "
Burton 's report will no doubt make compelling reading for fans of scripting languages , who recently flamed Java father James Gosling for blogging that Ruby and similar languages are " light " and unsuited to the kinds of enterprise scenarios reserved for Java .
Sun billed Java EE as its biggest update to enterprise Java in six years with major improvements to the programming model , service oriented architecture ( SOA ) support and simplified creation of web services .
Sun has preferred to sidestep talk of complexity in Java EE and tout simplicity provided in tools , instead . ®
WEST PALM BEACH , Fla. , Aug. 21 — It took Esteban Velásquez a year to save enough money to buy a gold chain he had always wanted .
But last summer , as Mr. Velásquez , an illegal immigrant from Guatemala , walked to a convenience store with a friend , a man punched him in the face and ran off with the $ 400 piece of jewelry .
Robberies of illegal immigrants have become a serious problem here in recent years , and the victims , mostly from Guatemala , often avoid reporting the crimes , fearing deportation .
“ I was afraid , ” said Mr. Velásquez , 25 , a landscaper who arrived here six years ago .
He reported the crime but later tried to hide from the authorities to avoid appearing in court .
“ But then I thought , whether I ’m documented or not , I still have my rights , ” he said .
With such crimes on the rise — they are common enough to have a chilling street name , “ Guat - bashing ” — the Guatemalan - Maya Center in Lake Worth , Fla. , and the Guatemalan Consulate in Miami , along with local law enforcement agencies , religious groups and banks , are working to help illegal immigrants from Guatemala protect themselves .
Logic & Fallacies
Constructing a Logical Argument ( 1997 )
[ Español / Spanish ]
Introduction
There is a lot of debate on the net .
Unfortunately , much of it is of very low quality .
The aim of this document is to explain the basics of logical reasoning , and hopefully improve the overall quality of debate .
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as " the science of reasoning , proof , thinking , or inference . "
Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning , and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not .
You do n't need to know logic to argue , of course ; but if you know even a little , you 'll find it easier to spot invalid arguments .
There are many kinds of logic , such as fuzzy logic and constructive logic ; they have different rules , and different strengths and weaknesses .
This document discusses simple Boolean logic , because it 's commonplace and relatively easy to understand .
When people talk about something being " logical , " they usually mean the type of logic described here .
What logic is n't
It 's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not .
First , logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe .
Many times in the past , people have concluded that because something is logically impossible ( given the science of the day ) , it must be impossible , period .
It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law ; it is , after all , logically consistent .
Again , we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal .
Second , logic is not a set of rules which govern human behavior .
Humans may have logically conflicting goals .
For example :
John wishes to speak to whoever is in charge .
The person in charge is Steve .
Therefore John wishes to speak to Steve .
Unfortunately , John may have a conflicting goal of avoiding Steve , meaning that the reasoned answer may be inapplicable to real life .
This document only explains how to use logic ; you must decide whether logic is the right tool for the job .
There are other ways to communicate , discuss and debate .
Arguments
An argument is , to quote the Monty Python sketch , " a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition . "
Many types of argument exist ; we will discuss the deductive argument .
Deductive arguments are generally viewed as the most precise and the most persuasive ; they provide conclusive proof of their conclusion , and are either valid or invalid .
Deductive arguments have three stages :
premises inference conclusion
However , before we can consider those stages in detail , we must discuss the building blocks of a deductive argument : propositions .
Propositions
A proposition is a statement which is either true or false .
The proposition is the meaning of the statement , not the precise arrangement of words used to convey that meaning .
For example , " There exists an even prime number greater than two " is a proposition .
( A false one , in this case . )
" An even prime number greater than two exists " is the same proposition , reworded .
Unfortunately , it 's very easy to unintentionally change the meaning of a statement by rephrasing it .
It 's generally safer to consider the wording of a proposition as significant .
It 's possible to use formal linguistics to analyze and rephrase a statement without changing its meaning ; but how to do so is outside the scope of this document .
Premises
A deductive argument always requires a number of core assumptions .
These are called premises , and are the assumptions the argument is built on ; or to look at it another way , the reasons for accepting the argument .
Premises are only premises in the context of a particular argument ; they might be conclusions in other arguments , for example .
You should always state the premises of the argument explicitly ; this is the principle of audiatur et altera pars .
Failing to state your assumptions is often viewed as suspicious , and will likely reduce the acceptance of your argument .
The premises of an argument are often introduced with words such as " Assume , " " Since , " " Obviously , " and " Because . "
It 's a good idea to get your opponent to agree with the premises of your argument before proceeding any further .
The word " obviously " is also often viewed with suspicion .
It occasionally gets used to persuade people to accept false statements , rather than admit that they do n't understand why something is " obvious . "
So do n't be afraid to question statements which people tell you are " obvious " -- when you 've heard the explanation you can always say something like " You 're right , now that I think about it that way , it is obvious . "
Inference
Once the premises have been agreed , the argument proceeds via a step - by - step process called inference .
In inference , you start with one or more propositions which have been accepted ; you then use those propositions to arrive at a new proposition .
If the inference is valid , that proposition should also be accepted .
You can use the new proposition for inference later on .
So initially , you can only infer things from the premises of the argument .
But as the argument proceeds , the number of statements available for inference increases .
There are various kinds of valid inference -- and also some invalid kinds , which we 'll look at later on .
Inference steps are often identified by phrases like " therefore ... " or " ... implies that ... "
Conclusion
Hopefully you will arrive at a proposition which is the conclusion of the argument - the result you are trying to prove .
The conclusion is the result of the final step of inference .
It 's only a conclusion in the context of a particular argument ; it could be a premise or assumption in another argument .
The conclusion is said to be affirmed on the basis of the premises , and the inference from them .
This is a subtle point which deserves further explanation .
Implication in detail
Clearly you can build a valid argument from true premises , and arrive at a true conclusion .
You can also build a valid argument from false premises , and arrive at a false conclusion .
The tricky part is that you can start with false premises , proceed via valid inference , and reach a true conclusion .
For example :
Premise :
All fish live in the ocean
Premise : Sea otters are fish
Conclusion :
Therefore sea otters live in the ocean
There 's one thing you can't do , though : start from true premises , proceed via valid deductive inference , and reach a false conclusion .
We can summarize these results as a " truth table " for implication .
The symbol " = > " denotes implication ; " A " is the premise , " B " the conclusion .
" T " and " F " represent true and false respectively .
Truth Table for Implication Premise Conclusion Inference A B A =>
B false false true false true true true false false true true true
If the premises are false and the inference valid , the conclusion can be true or false .
( Lines 1 and 2 . )
If the premises are true and the conclusion false , the inference must be invalid .
( Line 3 . )
If the premises are true and the inference valid , the conclusion must be true .
( Line 4 . )
So the fact that an argument is valid does n't necessarily mean that its conclusion holds -- it may have started from false premises .
If an argument is valid , and in addition it started from true premises , then it is called a sound argument .
A sound argument must arrive at a true conclusion .
Example argument
Here 's an example of an argument which is valid , and which may or may not be sound :
Premise : Every event has a cause Premise :
The universe has a beginning Premise :
All beginnings involve an event Inference :
This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event Inference :
Therefore the beginning of the universe had a cause Conclusion :
The universe had a cause
The proposition in line 4 is inferred from lines 2 and 3 .
Line 1 is then used , with the proposition derived in line 4 , to infer a new proposition in line 5 .
The result of the inference in line 5 is then restated ( in slightly simplified form ) as the conclusion .
Spotting arguments
Spotting an argument is harder than spotting premises or a conclusion .
Lots of people shower their writing with assertions , without ever producing anything you might reasonably call an argument .
Sometimes arguments do n't follow the pattern described above .
For example , people may state their conclusions first , and then justify them afterwards .
This is valid , but it can be a little confusing .
To make the situation worse , some statements look like arguments but are n't .
For example :
" If the Bible is accurate , Jesus must either have been insane , a liar , or the Son of God . "
That 's not an argument ; it 's a conditional statement .
It does n't state the premises necessary to support its conclusion , and even if you add those assertions it suffers from a number of other flaws which are described in more detail in the Atheist Arguments document .
An argument is also not the same as an explanation .
Suppose that you are trying to argue that Albert Einstein believed in God , and say :
" Einstein made his famous statement ' God does not play dice ' because of his belief in God . "
That may look like a relevant argument , but it 's not ; it 's an explanation of Einstein 's statement .
To see this , remember that a statement of the form " X because Y " can be rephrased as an equivalent statement , of the form " Y therefore X . "
Doing so gives us :
" Einstein believed in God , therefore he made his famous statement ' God does not play dice . ' "
Now it 's clear that the statement , which looked like an argument , is actually assuming the result which it is supposed to be proving , in order to explain the Einstein quote .
Furthermore , Einstein did not believe in a personal God concerned with human affairs -- again , see the Atheist Arguments document .
We 've outlined the structure of a sound deductive argument , from premises to conclusion .
But ultimately , the conclusion of a valid logical argument is only as compelling as the premises you started from .
Logic in itself does n't solve the problem of verifying the basic assertions which support arguments ; for that , we need some other tool .
The dominant means of verifying basic assertions is scientific enquiry .
However , the philosophy of science and the scientific method are huge topics which are quite beyond the scope of this document .
There are a number of common pitfalls to avoid when constructing a deductive argument ; they 're known as fallacies .
In everyday English , we refer to many kinds of mistaken beliefs as fallacies ; but in logic , the term has a more specific meaning : a fallacy is a technical flaw which makes an argument unsound or invalid .
( Note that you can criticize more than just the soundness of an argument .
Arguments are almost always presented with some specific purpose in mind -- and the intent of the argument may also be worthy of criticism . )
Arguments which contain fallacies are described as fallacious .
They often appear valid and convincing ; sometimes only close inspection reveals the logical flaw .
Below is a list of some common fallacies , and also some rhetorical devices often used in debate .
The list is n't intended to be exhaustive ; the hope is that if you learn to recognize some of the more common fallacies , you 'll be able to avoid being fooled by them .
The Nizkor Project has an excellent list of logical fallacies .
Sadly , many of the examples below have been taken directly from the Net , though some have been rephrased for the sake of clarity .
List of fallacies
For more fallacies , more examples , and scholarly references , see " Stephen 's Guide to the Logical Fallacies . "
( Off Site )
Accent is a form of fallacy through shifting meaning .
In this case , the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized .
For example :
" We should not speak ill of our friends "
and
" We should not speak ill of our friends "
Be particularly wary of this fallacy on the net , where it 's easy to misread the emphasis of what 's written .
Ad hoc ( for this purpose only )
As mentioned earlier , there is a difference between argument and explanation .
If we 're interested in establishing A , and B is offered as evidence , the statement " A because B " is an argument .
If we 're trying to establish the truth of B , then " A because B " is not an argument , it 's an explanation .
The Ad Hoc fallacy is to give an after - the - fact explanation which does n't apply to other situations .
Often this ad hoc explanation will be dressed up to look like an argument .
For example , if we assume that God treats all people equally , then the following is an ad hoc explanation :
" I was healed from cancer . "
" Praise the Lord , then .
He is your healer . "
" So , will He heal others who have cancer ? "
" Er ... The ways of God are mysterious . "
This fallacy is an argument of the form " A implies B , B is true , therefore A is true . "
To understand why it is a fallacy , examine the truth table for implication given earlier .
Here 's an example :
" If the universe had been created by a supernatural being , we would see order and organization everywhere .
And we do see order , not randomness -- so it 's clear that the universe had a creator . "
This is the converse of Denial of the Antecedent .
Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing .
For example :
" Premise : Belief in God fills a much - needed gap . "
One of the simplest fallacies is to rely on anecdotal evidence .
For example :
" There 's abundant proof that God exists and is still performing miracles today .
Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer .
Her whole family went to church and prayed for her , and she was cured . "
It 's quite valid to use personal experience to illustrate a point ; but such anecdotes do n't actually prove anything to anyone .
Your friend may say he met Elvis in the supermarket , but those who have n't had the same experience will require more than your friend 's anecdotal evidence to convince them .
Anecdotal evidence can seem very compelling , especially if the audience wants to believe it .
This is part of the explanation for urban legends ; stories which are verifiably false have been known to circulate as anecdotes for years .
This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it 's old , or because " that 's the way it 's always been . "
The opposite of Argumentum ad Novitatem .
" For thousands of years Christians have believed in Jesus Christ .
Christianity must be true , to have persisted so long even in the face of persecution . "
An Appeal to Force happens when someone resorts to force ( or the threat of force ) to try and push others to accept a conclusion .
This fallacy is often used by politicians , and can be summarized as " might makes right . "
The threat does n't have to come directly from the person arguing .
For example :
" Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible .
All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell . "
" In any case , I know your phone number and I know where you live .
Have I mentioned I am licensed to carry concealed weapons ? "
The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness ; that those with more money are more likely to be right .
The opposite of Argumentum ad Lazarum .
Example :
" Microsoft software is undoubtedly superior ; why else would Bill Gates have gotten so rich ? "
Argumentum ad hominem ( Abusive : attacking the person )
Argumentum ad hominem literally means " argument directed at the man " ; there are two varieties .
The first is the abusive form .
If you refuse to accept a statement , and justify your refusal by criticizing the person who made the statement , then you are guilty of abusive argumentum ad hominem .
For example :
" You claim that atheists can be moral - - yet I happen to know that you abandoned your wife and children . "
This is a fallacy because the truth of an assertion does n't depend on the virtues of the person asserting it .
A less blatant argumentum ad hominem is to reject a proposition based on the fact that it was also asserted by some other easily criticized person .
For example :
" Therefore we should close down the church ?
Hitler and Stalin would have agreed with you . "
A second form of argumentum ad hominem is to try and persuade someone to accept a statement you make , by referring to that person 's particular circumstances .
For example :
" Therefore it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food .
I hope you wo n't argue otherwise , given that you 're quite happy to wear leather shoes . "
This is known as circumstantial argumentum ad hominem .
The fallacy can also be used as an excuse to reject a particular conclusion .
For example :
" Of course you 'd argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing .
You 're white . "
This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem , when you allege that someone is rationalizing a conclusion for selfish reasons , is also known as " poisoning the well . "
It 's not always invalid to refer to the circumstances of an individual who is making a claim .
If someone is a known perjurer or liar , that fact will reduce their credibility as a witness .
It wo n't , however , prove that their testimony is false in this case .
It also wo n't alter the soundness of any logical arguments they may make .
Argumentum ad ignorantiam ( Argument from ignorance )
Argumentum ad ignorantiam means " argument from ignorance . "
The fallacy occurs when it 's argued that something must be true , simply because it has n't been proved false .
Or , equivalently , when it is argued that something must be false because it has n't been proved true .
( Note that this is n't the same as assuming something is false until it has been proved true .
In law , for example , you 're generally assumed innocent until proven guilty . )
Here are a couple of examples :
" Of course the Bible is true .
Nobody can prove otherwise . "
" Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist .
Nobody has shown any proof that they are real . "
In scientific investigation , if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred , the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did n't occur .
It does not prove it with certainty , however .
For example :
" A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth .
The earth does n't have a tenth as much water , even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles .
Therefore no such flood occurred . "
It is , of course , possible that some unknown process occurred to remove the water .
Good science would then demand a plausible testable theory to explain how it vanished .
Of course , the history of science is full of logically valid bad predictions .
In 1893 , the Royal Academy of Science were convinced by Sir Robert Ball that communication with the planet Mars was a physical impossibility , because it would require a flag as large as Ireland , which it would be impossible to wave .
[ Fortean Times Number 82 . ]
See also Shifting the Burden of Proof .
The fallacy of assuming that someone poor is sounder or more virtuous than someone who 's wealthier .
This fallacy is the opposite of the Argumentum ad Crumenam .
For example :
" Monks are more likely to possess insight into the meaning of life , as they have given up the distractions of wealth . "
This is the " fallacy fallacy " of arguing that a proposition is false because it has been presented as the conclusion of a fallacious argument .
Remember always that fallacious arguments can arrive at true conclusions .
" Take the fraction 16 / 64 .
Now , canceling a six on top and a six on the bottom , we get that 16/64 = 1/4 . "
" Wait a second !
You ca n't just cancel the six ! "
" Oh , so you 're telling us 16 / 64 is not equal to 1/ 4 , are you ? "
Argumentum ad misericordiam ( Appeal to pity ; Special pleading )
This is the Appeal to Pity , also known as Special Pleading .
The fallacy is committed when someone appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted .
For example :
" I did not murder my mother and father with an axe !
Please do n't find me guilty ; I 'm suffering enough through being an orphan . "
This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true , or is more likely to be accepted as true , the more often it is heard .
So an Argumentum ad Nauseam is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something ; saying the same thing over and over again until you 're sick of hearing it .
On the Net , your argument is often less likely to be heard if you repeat it over and over again , as people will tend to put you in their kill files .
This is the opposite of the Argumentum ad Antiquitatem ; it 's the fallacy of asserting that something is better or more correct simply because it is new , or newer than something else .
" BeOS is a far better choice of operating system than OpenStep , as it has a much newer design . "
This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum .
It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition , the more likely it is that that proposition is correct .
For example :
" The vast majority of people in this country believe that capital punishment has a noticeable deterrent effect .
To suggest that it does n't in the face of so much evidence is ridiculous . "
" All I 'm saying is that thousands of people believe in pyramid power , so there must be something to it . "
Argumentum ad populum ( Appeal to the people or gallery )
This is known as Appealing to the Gallery , or Appealing to the People .
You commit this fallacy if you attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people .
This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language .
For example :
" Pornography must be banned .
It is violence against women . "
" For thousands of years people have believed in Jesus and the Bible .
This belief has had a great impact on their lives .
What more evidence do you need that Jesus was the Son of God ?
Are you trying to tell those people that they are all mistaken fools ? "
Argumentum ad verecundiam ( Appeal to authority )
The Appeal to Authority uses admiration of a famous person to try and win support for an assertion .
For example :
" Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God . "
This line of argument is n't always completely bogus when used in an inductive argument ; for example , it may be relevant to refer to a widely - regarded authority in a particular field , if you 're discussing that subject .
For example , we can distinguish quite clearly between :
" Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation "
and
" Penrose has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer "
Hawking is a physicist , and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed .
Penrose is a mathematician , so it is questionable whether he is well - qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence .
Often , people will argue from assumptions which they do n't bother to state .
The principle of Audiatur et Altera Pars is that all of the premises of an argument should be stated explicitly .
It 's not strictly a fallacy to fail to state all of your assumptions ; however , it 's often viewed with suspicion .
Also referred to as the " black and white " fallacy and " false dichotomy , " bifurcation occurs if someone presents a situation as having only two alternatives , where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist .
For example :
" Either man was created , as the Bible tells us , or he evolved from inanimate chemicals by pure random chance , as scientists tell us .
The latter is incredibly unlikely , so ... "
This fallacy occurs if you assume as a premise the conclusion which you wish to reach .
Often , the proposition is rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument .
For example :
" Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office .
Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job .
Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret , and will be open to blackmail .
Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office . "
Note that the argument is entirely circular ; the premise is the same as the conclusion .
An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services ' official ban on homosexual employees .
Circular arguments are surprisingly common , unfortunately .
If you 've already reached a particular conclusion once , it 's easy to accidentally make it an assertion when explaining your reasoning to someone else .
This is the interrogative form of Begging the Question .
One example is the classic loaded question :
" Have you stopped beating your wife ? "
The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked .
This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination , when they ask questions like :
" Where did you hide the money you stole ? "
Similarly , politicians often ask loaded questions such as :
" How long will this EU interference in our affairs be allowed to continue ? "
or
" Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization ? "
Another form of this fallacy is to ask for an explanation of something which is untrue or not yet established .
The Fallacy of Composition is to conclude that a property shared by a number of individual items , is also shared by a collection of those items ; or that a property of the parts of an object , must also be a property of the whole thing .
Examples :
" The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components , and is therefore very lightweight . "
" A car uses less petrochemicals and causes less pollution than a bus .
Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses . "
A related form of fallacy of composition is the " just " fallacy , or fallacy of mediocrity .
This is the fallacy that assumes that any given member of a set must be limited to the attributes that are held in common with all the other members of the set .
Example :
" Humans are just animals , so we should not concern ourselves with justice ; we should just obey the law of the jungle . "
Here the fallacy is to reason that because we are animals , we can have only properties which animals have ; that nothing can distinguish us as a special case .
This fallacy is the reverse of the Fallacy of Accident .
It occurs when you form a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are n't representative of all possible cases .
For example :
" Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian .
Therefore all Christians are insincere . "
This fallacy is an argument of the form " If A then B , therefore if B then A . "
" If educational standards are lowered , the quality of argument seen on the Net worsens .
So if we see the level of debate on the net get worse over the next few years , we 'll know that our educational standards are still falling . "
This fallacy is similar to the Affirmation of the Consequent , but phrased as a conditional statement .
This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc .
The fallacy is to assert that because two events occur together , they must be causally related .
It 's a fallacy because it ignores other factors that may be the cause (s ) of the events .
" Literacy rates have steadily declined since the advent of television .
Clearly television viewing impedes learning . "
This fallacy is a special case of the more general non causa pro causa .
This fallacy is an argument of the form " A implies B , A is false , therefore B is false . "
The truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy .
Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa .
That has the form " A implies B , A is false , therefore B is false , " where A does not in fact imply B at all .
Here , the problem is n't that the implication is invalid ; rather it's that the falseness of A does n't allow us to deduce anything about B .
" If the God of the Bible appeared to me , personally , that would certainly prove that Christianity was true .
But God has never appeared to me , so the Bible must be a work of fiction . "
This is the converse of the fallacy of Affirmation of the Consequent .
A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation , but the features of that particular situation mean the rule is inapplicable .
It 's the error made when you go from the general to the specific .
For example :
" Christians generally dislike atheists .
You are a Christian , so you must dislike atheists . "
This fallacy is often committed by people who try to decide moral and legal questions by mechanically applying general rules .
The fallacy of division is the opposite of the Fallacy of Composition .
It consists of assuming that a property of some thing must apply to its parts ; or that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item .
" You are studying at a rich college .
Therefore you must be rich . "
" Ants can destroy a tree .
Therefore this ant can destroy a tree . "
Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument .
For example :
" What could be more affordable than free software ?
But to make sure that it remains free , that users can do what they like with it , we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable . "
One way to avoid this fallacy is to choose your terminology carefully before beginning the argument , and avoid words like " free " which have many meanings .
The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over .
The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations , in an argument about a general rule , constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other .
Here 's real example from an online debate about anti-cryptography legislation :
" I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it . "
" Such a position is odious : it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King . "
" Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation ?
How dare you ! "
The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion .
For example , a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtedly true .
If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people , no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true .
Sadly , these kinds of irrelevant arguments are often successful , because they make people to view the supposed conclusion in a more favorable light .
The Appeal to Nature is a common fallacy in political arguments .
One version consists of drawing an analogy between a particular conclusion , and some aspect of the natural world -- and then stating that the conclusion is inevitable , because the natural world is similar :
" The natural world is characterized by competition ; animals struggle against each other for ownership of limited natural resources .
Capitalism , the competitive struggle for ownership of capital , is simply an inevitable part of human nature .
It 's how the natural world works . "
Another form of appeal to nature is to argue that because human beings are products of the natural world , we must mimic behavior seen in the natural world , and that to do otherwise is " unnatural " :
" Of course homosexuality is unnatural .
When 's the last time you saw two animals of the same sex mating ? "
An example of " Appeal to Nature " taken to extremes is The Unabomber Manifesto .
Suppose I assert that no Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge .
You counter this by pointing out that your friend Angus likes sugar with his porridge .
I then say " Ah , yes , but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge .
This is an example of an ad hoc change being used to shore up an assertion , combined with an attempt to shift the meaning of the words used original assertion ; you might call it a combination of fallacies .
The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when something is identified as the cause of an event , but it has not actually been shown to be the cause .
For example :
" I took an aspirin and prayed to God , and my headache disappeared .
So God cured me of the headache . "
This is known as a false cause fallacy .
Two specific forms of non causa pro causa fallacy are the cum hoc ergo propter hoc and post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacies .
A non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are n't logically connected with it .
For example :
" Since Egyptians did so much excavation to construct the pyramids , they were well versed in paleontology . "
( Non sequiturs are an important ingredient in a lot of humor .
They 're still fallacies , though . )
Petitio principii ( Begging the question )
This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached .
Typically the premises of the argument implicitly assume the result which the argument purports to prove , in a disguised form .
For example :
" The Bible is the word of God .
The word of God cannot be doubted , and the Bible states that the Bible is true .
Therefore the Bible must be true .
Begging the question is similar to circulus in demonstrando , where the conclusion is exactly the same as the premise .
This fallacy occurs when someone demands a simple ( or simplistic ) answer to a complex question .
" Are higher taxes an impediment to business or not ?
Yes or no ? "
The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter
Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before that event .
For example :
" The Soviet Union collapsed after instituting state atheism .
Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons . "
This is another type of false cause fallacy .
This fallacy is committed when someone introduces irrelevant material to the issue being discussed , so that everyone 's attention is diverted away from the points made , towards a different conclusion .
" You may claim that the death penalty is an ineffective deterrent against crime -- but what about the victims of crime ?
How do you think surviving family members feel when they see the man who murdered their son kept in prison at their expense ?
Is it right that they should pay for their son's murderer to be fed and housed ? "
Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing .
" I noticed you described him as ' evil . '
Where does this ' evil ' exist within the brain ?
You can't show it to me , so I claim it does n't exist , and no man is ' evil . ' "
The burden of proof is always on the person asserting something .
Shifting the burden of proof , a special case of Argumentum ad Ignorantiam , is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion .
The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise .
For further discussion of this idea , see the " Introduction to Atheism " document .
" OK , so if you do n't think the grey aliens have gained control of the US government , can you prove it ? "
This argument states that should one event occur , so will other harmful events .
There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event .
For example :
" If we legalize marijuana , then more people would start to take crack and heroin , and we'd have to legalize those too .
Before long we'd have a nation full of drug - addicts on welfare .
Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana . "
The straw man fallacy is when you misrepresent someone else 's position so that it can be attacked more easily , knock down that misrepresented position , then conclude that the original position has been demolished .
It 's a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made .
" To be an atheist , you have to believe with absolute certainty that there is no God .
In order to convince yourself with absolute certainty , you must examine all the Universe and all the places where God could possibly be .
Since you obviously have n't , your position is indefensible . "
The above straw man argument appears at about once a week on the net .
If you can't see what 's wrong with it , read the " Introduction to Atheism " document .
This is the famous " you too " fallacy .
It occurs if you argue that an action is acceptable because your opponent has performed it .
For instance :
" You 're just being randomly abusive . "
" So ?
You 've been abusive too . "
This is a personal attack , and is therefore a special case of Argumentum ad Hominem .
These fallacies occur if you attempt to argue that things are in some way similar , but you do n't actually specify in what way they are similar .
Examples :
" Is n't history based upon faith ?
If so , then is n't the Bible also a form of history ? "
" Islam is based on faith , Christianity is based on faith , so is n't Islam a form of Christianity ? "
" Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry , dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry , so are n't dogs a form of cat ? "

Edward Felten ( center ) , director of the Center for Information Technology Policy , has coauthored a paper with graduate students Ariel Feldman ( left ) and Alex Halderman on a demonstration vote - stealing software that highlights security vulnerabilities in electronic voting machines .
Credit : John Jameson , Princeton University
In a paper published on the Web today , a group of Princeton computer scientists said they created demonstration vote - stealing software that can be installed within a minute on a common electronic voting machine .
The software can fraudulently change vote counts without being detected .
" We have created and analyzed the code in the spirit of helping to guide public officials so that they can make wise decisions about how to secure elections , " said Edward Felten , the director of the Center for Information Technology Policy , a new center at Princeton University that addresses crucial issues at the intersection of society and computer technology .
The paper appears on the Web site for the Center for Information Technology Policy ( itpolicy.princeton.edu/voting / ) .
The researchers obtained the machine , a Diebold AccuVote - TS , from a private party in May .
They spent the summer analyzing the machine and developing the vote - stealing demonstration .
" We found that the machine is vulnerable to a number of extremely serious attacks that undermine the accuracy and credibility of the vote counts it produces , " wrote Felten and his co-authors , graduate students Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman .
In a 10 - minute video on their Web site , the researchers demonstrate how the vote - stealing software works .
The video shows the software sabotaging a mock presidential election between George Washington and Benedict Arnold .
Arnold is reported as the winner even though Washington gets more votes .
( The video is edited from a longer continuously shot video ; the long single - shot version will be available for downloading from the center 's site as well . )
The researchers also demonstrate how the machines " are susceptible to computer viruses that can spread themselves automatically and invisibly from machine to machine during normal pre- and post- election activity . "
Felten said that policy - makers should be concerned about malicious software infecting the Diebold AccuVote - TS and machines like it , from Diebold and other companies .
" We studied these machines because they were available to us , " the researchers wrote in their Web posting .
" If we had gotten access to another kind of machine , we probably would have studied it instead . "
Felten said , " There is reason for concern about other machines as well , even though our paper does n't directly evaluate them .
Jurisdictions using these machines should think seriously about finding a backup system in time for the November elections . "
Felten , a professor of computer science and public affairs who is known for his groundbreaking work in computer security , said that some of the problems discussed in the paper cannot be fixed without completely redesigning the machine .
Other problems can be fixed by addressing software or electronic procedures .
" But time is short before the next election , " he said .
According to the researchers ' paper , the Diebold machine they examined and another newer version are scheduled to be used in 357 U.S. counties representing nearly 10 percent of all registered voters .
About half those counties , including all Maryland and Georgia , will use the exact machine examined by Felten 's group .
Felten said that , out of security concerns , the Diebold machine infected with the vote - stealing software has been kept under lock and key in a secret location .
" Unfortunately election fraud has a rich history from ballot stuffing to dead people voting , " he said .
" We want to make sure this does n't fall into the wrong hands .
We also want to make sure that policy - makers stay a step ahead of those who might create similar software with ill intent . "

Python 's Super is nifty , but you can't use it
( Previously : Python 's Super Considered Harmful )
When I first heard about ' super ' in python , I thought it sounded like a great idea , and should be adopted by everyone immediately !
After all , it fixes inheritance diamonds , makes you not have to encode the superclass name into every call , and lets you use the same structure to call superclass methods as methods on another class ( x.foo ( 1 ) vs. SuperClass.foo( self , 1 ) ) However , after poking around with it a bit , I now feel that people should generally avoid it .
It really is the " right thing " , but it just does n't seem to work in Python .
One big problem with ' super ' is that it sounds like it will cause the superclass 's copy of the method to be called .
This is simply not the case , it causes the next method in the MRO to be called .
That misconception causes people to make two common mistakes .
People omit calls to super ( ...) .
__init__ if the only superclass is ' object ' , as , after all , object .
__init__ does n't do anything !
However , this is very incorrect .
Doing so will cause other classes ' __init__ methods to not be called .
People think they know what arguments their method will get , and what arguments they should pass along to super .
This is also incorrect .
It just so happens that the semantics of Python 's super ( ) are essentially identical to Dylan 's ' next - method ' , which works rather well .
So why does n't Python 's implementation work well in practice ?
There are unfortunately three major differences between Python and Dylan that make Python work significantly less well :
The only reasonable way to call the next method in Dylan is to use ' next - method ' .
You could not reasonably call a specific implementation explicitly .
Thus , there is no problem of some people using next - method and others not .
Dylan has generic functions , not classes .
All the functions for a generic are required to have compatible signatures , while functions on classes are not .
As a approximation , a function has a " compatible signature " if it takes the same number of arguments and the same keyword arguments as the generic it is defined on .
( See http://www.gwydiondylan.org/books/dpg/db_179.html#marker-9-529 for the actual rules )
Dylan 's version of __init__ and __new__ only allow keyword arguments , and the generic function accepts all keyword arguments .
This considerably reduces the problem with incompatible method signatures .
Here are some situations where a non-obvious thing happens in python .
Note that the __init__ method is not special -- the same thing happens with any method , I just use __init__ because it is the method that most often needs to be overridden in many classes in the hierarchy .
Argument passing , argh !
Okay , so you have a class hierarchy like in Example 1 - 1 and you want to convert it to use super .
The obvious way to do it , as shown in Example 1 - 2 does not work .
It dies with :
MRO : [ ' E ' , ' C ' , ' A ' , ' D ' , ' B ' , ' object ' ]
E arg= 10 C arg= 10 A Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " example 1 - 2.py " , line 27 , in ? E( 10 ) File " example 1 - 2.py " , line 24 , in __init__ super ( E , self ) .__init__( arg )
File " example 1 - 2.py " , line 14 , in __init__ super ( C , self ) .__init__ ()
File " example 1 - 2.py " , line 4 , in __init__ super ( A , self ) .
__init__ ( ) TypeError : __init__ ( ) takes exactly 2 arguments ( 1 given )
What is it talking about , how can this be ?
Well , it 's pretty simple really -- the next __init__ method after A's in the MRO is D's .
D.__init__ takes an argument , which A.__init__ is not passing !
Uh oh .
So , here you see the confusion about super again — you must remember that super does not call your superclass .
You must be prepared to call any other class 's method in the hierarchy and be prepared to be called from any other class 's method .
Thus , the general rule is : always pass all arguments you received on to the super function , and , if classes can take differing arguments , always accept * args and ** kwargs .
This is shown in Example 1 - 3 .
Just as a side note , I thought I 'd mention that in Dylan , just " next - method " by itself with no argument - list does the same thing as Python 's " super ( MyClass , self ) .currentmethod( alltheargsideclared , * args , ** kwargs ) " .
Much simpler , much harder to mess up .
Mixing super and non-super using methods
Subclasses must use super if their superclasses do
A class ' C ' derives from two classes ( ' A ' and ' B ' ) that use super to call their super 's __init__ .
However , the author of the subclass does not know about super and simply calls A.__init__ followed by B.__init__ .
Example 2 -
1
MRO is : [ ' C ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' object ' ]
Methods called : C A B B
B.__init__ gets called twice !
D'oh !
For correct behavior , if any class uses super , all its subclasses must also .
Superclasses must use super if their subclasses do ( sometimes )
The inverse is also true .
In this example , I demonstrate that inheriting from a class that does not use super causes problems .
In particular , any classes after it in the superclass list do not have their methods called .
Example 2 - 2
MRO : [ ' F1 ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' N ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : F1 A B N MRO : [ ' F2 ' , ' A ' , ' N ' , ' B ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : F2 A N MRO : [ ' F3 ' , ' N ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : F3 N MRO : [ ' F4 ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' N ' , ' M ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : F3 A B N
So , F1 appears to work , but F2 and F3 ( where N is not the last element ) , do not , as A and / or B's __init__ does not get called .
Thus it would appear that you simply need to put the classes that do not use super last .
This is not the case , as F4 shows .
The rule , then , seems simple : Always put those superclasses that do n't use super last , and , if there 's more than one , explicitly call all but the first .
However , this does not actually work as shown by the following example .
Example 3
MRO : [ ' G ' , ' F1 ' , ' A ' , ' N ' , ' F2 ' , ' B ' , ' M ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : G G1 A N
Both F1 and F2 followed the above rule , but , if someone subclasses them , it is impossible for all the non-super - using methods be at the end of the MRO .
Thus , breakage .
Thus , in conclusion , if a class uses super , all its superclasses must also .
... But it 's okay if they 're oldstyle classes
Let 's take example 2 - 2 and 2 - 3 again , but modify them slightly so that N and M are oldstyle classes ( and thus do not derive from object ) .
This turns out to work fine , as long as the oldstyle classes ( that do not use super ) appear after all newstyle classes in the superclass list of each class .
Because they will then always appear after ' object ' in the MRO , super will never call them , and you can call them explicitly without worry .
Example 2 - 2b
MRO : [ ' F1 ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' object ' , ' N ' ] Calls : F1 A B MRO : [ ' F2 ' , ' A ' , ' N ' , ' B ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : F2 A N MRO : [ ' F3 ' , ' N ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' object ' ]
Calls : F3 N MRO : [ ' F4 ' , ' A ' , ' B ' , ' object ' , ' N ' , ' M ' ] Calls : F3 A B
Example 2 - 3b
MRO : [ ' G ' , ' F1 ' , ' A ' , ' F2 ' , ' B ' , ' object ' , ' N ' , ' M ' ] Calls : G G1 A G2 B
Conclusion
Use it consistently , and document that you use it , as it is part of the external interface for your class , like it or not .
, and document that you use it , as it part of the external interface for your class , like it or not .
Never call super with anything but the exact arguments you received , unless you really know what you 're doing .
know what you 're doing .
When you use it on methods whose acceptable arguments can be altered on a subclass via addition of more optional arguments , always accept * args , **kw , and call super like " super ( MyClass , self ) .currentmethod( alltheargsideclared , *args , ** kwargs ) " .
If you do n't do this , forbid addition of optional arguments in subclasses .
" . If you do n't do this , forbid addition of optional arguments in subclasses .
Never use positional arguments in __init__ or __new__ .
Always use keyword args , and always call them as keywords , and always pass all keywords on to super .
From my experience in python code , needing to define the same name method in two branches of an inheritance tree is exceedingly rare , with the exclusion of __init__ .
And , super ( ) is useless for that if you need any kind of interoperability with existing python code .
If someone has some example code where they actually need this functionality , I 'd like to see it .
The super ( ) function is far from easy to use .
If you do n't believe me : search google for something like " super self py " .
The first result is the code for PyCon 2004 " New - Style Class Tutorial " by Thomas Wouters .
Now , go down to the bottom , where it says ( removing irrelevant code ) :
class tristate ( int ) : nstates = 3 # __new__ is the method to override for immutable values .
#
It is a static method .
The first argument is the class that is being # created ( which may be a subclass ) , and there is no actual instance # yet .
def __new__(cls , state=0 ) : #
We want to limit the actual value of the type to [ 0 , nstates > state %= cls.nstates #
To actually create the new instance , we call the parent 's __new__ .
# Since __new__ is a static method , we have to pass the first # argument explicitly .
#
To call the right parent method , we use super ( ) .
What super ( ) # does , is call the method that _would have been called_ if this # method was n't present .
In single - inheritance situations this just # means ' int.__new__ ' in our case , but if a subclass of our class # actually inherits from more than just us , it may end up being # another method altogether .
Using super ( ) in all places assures # consistent method - call order .
# super ( ) can be used in several ways , and the actual return value # is a magic object , a proxy object that does the right thing with # bound and unbound instance methods , and class methods .
#
Since we only have a class , we return super ( tristate , cls ) .__new__(cls , state )
Notice two things : 1 ) it explains in detail how super is supposed to be useful , and 2 ) This __new__ only takes a state argument , thus making it difficult to actually use this class in a multiple inheritance situation .
However , I must admit , this is no fault of Mr. Wouters .
int.__new__ itself fails to take extra arguments , and to use keywords for its args , both of which would be required .
class NamedInt( int ) : def __new__(cls , num=0 , names =None ) : obj=super( NamedInt , cls).__new__(cls , num ) obj.name=names[obj ] return obj def __str__( self ) : return self .name def __repr__( self ) : return self .
name class NamedTristate ( tristate , NamedInt ) : pass NamedTristate ( 2 , " abc " )
TypeError : __new__ ( ) takes at most 2 arguments ( 3 given )
I highly suspect nearly all python code that uses super runs into one of the issues documented here .
The only situation in which super ( ) can actually be helpful is when you have diamond inheritance .
And even then , it is often not as helpful as you might have thought .
Additionally , it is harmful in the situations shown above .

I ’ve spent most of my adult life assuming that technology was in an endless upward spiral that would always provide me with a never ending supply of a ) fast computers , b ) cheap storage , and c ) massive bandwidth .
You can imagine my surprise when I recently discovered that we are apparently on the verge of a global bandwidth shortage .
If true , that would certainly change most of my assumptions about the future of media , computing , and civilization as we know it .
My first inkling that we might have a serious problem came last week when a Google representative , speaking at the Cable Europe Congress , announced :
The Web infrastructure , and even Google ’s ( infrastructure ) does n’t scale .
It ’s not going to offer the quality of service that consumers expect .
One cable executive called it “ the best news of the day ” .
Why is it that good news for cable companies is always bad news for consumers ?
And why is it that Google of all companies is just now getting around to breaking this news to us ?
Seems like they might have mentioned this before they spent a fortune buying YouTube .
I was still pondering how serious this bandwidth shortage might be when I read that a bird flu pandemic could bring the Internet to it ’s knees .
How would a flu pandemic affect the Internet ?
Easy .
Remember years ago when we were told that one day we ’d all be able to telecommute to our jobs ?
Despite the fact that most employees now have broadband and a home computer that prediction never really came to pass .
Well , it turns out that your boss was just waiting for the plague .
Once the bird flu hits we ’ll all be expected to telecommute .
The current thinking is that a massive influx of telecommuters making VPN connections to their offices would have a substantial impact on available bandwidth .
When that happens , it ’s goodbye online video .
Just do n’t forget to clock out at the end of the day .
It was n’t all that long ago that we were talking about a global bandwidth glut .
During the dot com boom companies actually went under by overbuilding infrastructure .
So what ’s changed ?
In a word , everything .
P2P applications like BitTorrent are partially to blame .
The firm CacheLogic has estimated that P2P applications use between 60 and 80 percent of capacity on consumer ISP networks .
Others have suggested that spam comprises 80 % of all Internet traffic .
Between all of the spam and video file sharing that leaves - 40 % to - 60 % of Internet capacity for everything else we do online .
Based on those numbers it ’s amazing you ’re even able to read this article .
Is our dependence on ubiquitous broadband a fatal flaw in our plans for the future , or are these dire warnings overstated ?
Chances are we wo n’t really know for sure until something unexpected happens .
In the meantime , the mere thought of a bandwidth shortage probably has the old - line media types jumping for joy .
It ’s not just the cable operators who would stand to benefit if the Internet collapsed .
The broadcast networks would be free to ignore the Internet and go back to business as usual , newspapers and magazines might start seeing subscriber growth , and phone companies could go back to their switched networks and forget about all of this VoIP stuff .
In other words , it would be the 1980 ’s all over again .
And all of those cool new media services that you were planning on using ?
Turns out they could be a lot less cool and a lot more expensive than you were thinking they might be .
Then again , this could be an elaborate ploy by Google to buy more time to ramp up their IP television service and catch the cable operators off guard when the service is finally ready .
Or not .
That ’s the worst part of this story .
We do n’t really know anything for sure .
How far would you be willing to go to ensure there was enough bandwidth to go around ?
Would you willingly limit your Internet access to a small selection of lower bandwidth applications like email and limited web browsing ?
Would you stop playing online games ?
Stop using P2P networks or watching online videos ?
Would today ’s Internet even be worth using if there were bandwidth limitations ?
Microsoft today lobbed three massive bombs into the server virtualization market .
First off , it will now support - wait for it - Linux , when the OS is running on top of its Virtual Server product .
Secondly , Microsoft has made Virtual Server free .
And , in a move few thought possible , Microsoft has teamed with the developers of the open source Xen product to gang up on server slicing leader VMware .
Given these moves , we 're reminded of the scene from Spaceballs when Lord Helmet orders an underling to thrust his ship from light speed to ludicrous speed .
" Prepare ship , prepare ship for ludicrous speed .
Fasten all seat belts , seal all entrances and exits , close all shops in the mall , cancel the 3 - ring circus , secure all animals in the zoo ... " shouts the underling .
Up until now , you 've been able to run Linux on top of Virtual Server , but Microsoft refused to help out with any problems a customer might have with the combination .
Not anymore .
Microsoft will offer 24 - hour support to customers running enterprise and standard versions of Red Hat and Novell Linux in conjunction with Virtual Server 2005 R2 .
Beyond that , Microsoft plans to distribute " virtual machine add - ins " that make Linux guest operating systems work better with its product .
The add-ins will help out with mouse and display driver functions , SCSI disk emulation and guest and host synchronization .
Microsoft will release even more add-ins with an update to Virtual Server 2005 R2 due out early next year .
" Customers who have questions regarding the interoperability with Linux guest operating systems and the virtual machine add-ins will be able to access the standard Microsoft support process , " Microsoft said .
As with any product in this class , Virtual Server allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single server and to move these " virtual servers " from physical server to physical server .
Now to the pricing front .
Above , we mentioned the upcoming update to Virtual Server .
Microsoft had hoped to bring out this update in 2006 but , like all of its products of late , let it slip to next year .
That 's a particularly damaging delay given that it means Microsoft will fall behind rivals VMware and XenSource with regard to tapping into new virtualization - friendly hardware in server chips from Intel and AMD .
The chips deliver serious performance and management gains by making it easier to set up virtual operating systems .
Microsoft 's second product delivery problem comes in the form of its next - generation server virtualization software .
Microsoft is the only major player not to use a hypervisor that sits directly on the server hardware at this point , preferring instead to run Virtual Server on top of Windows .
That changes in 2008 or 2009 when Microsoft will bundle a hypervisor into " Longhorn " Server via a service pack .
Up to this point , Microsoft sold Virtual Server for $ 100 or $ 200 , depending on the number of processors in a server .
Now , it 's throwing out the price , preparing for the bundling scenario a bit early .
Customers can pick up Virtual Server 2005 R2 as a free download .
Microsoft product marketing man Zane Adam made it rather clear that this move was intended as a blow against VMware .
" In light of this and other market trends , I believe customers will think twice before spending thousands of dollars for other virtualization products that very well could be at no charge in a couple of years , " he said .
To be fair , VMware has a free version of its mid-market product in beta and this software stacks up well against Virtual Server .
Surface plasmon resonance is used for a variety of purposes including detecting protein or DNA and enhancing the sensitivity of spectroscopy .
However , surface plasmon resonance requires a metal .
Gold and silver are among the metals that best support surface plasmons .
Unfortunately , Weili Zhang , a professor at Oklahoma State University , tells PhysOrg.com , “ Silver is n’t always long lasting and gold can be too expensive . ”
The solution ?
Zhang and his colleagues suggest that silicon can be used for surface plasmon resonances .
But first it needs to become something metallic .
Along with colleagues Abul Azad and Jiaguang Han from Oklahoma State and Jngzhou Xu , Jian Chen and X. - C. Zhang from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , New York , Zhang has shown how the use of laser pulses can create a surface plasmon resonance from a photonic crystal effect .
“ This is the first time anyone has reported seeing this transition .
This is a very interesting change , ” he says .
Zhang and his coauthors report their findings in “ Direct Observation of a Transition of a Surface Plasmon Resonance from a Photonic Crystal Effect , ” published in Physical Review Letters .
Surface plasmons can only exist in a metal / dielectric interface .
They are electromagnetic waves that run along the surface of this interface .
“ What we wanted to do , ” explains Zhang , “ is start with a non-conductive material to see if we could excite surface plasmons in the terahertz region . ”
For their attempt , Zhang and his colleagues use silicon because of its properties as a semiconductor .
“ We used ultra - fast laser pulses that resulted in photodoping . ”
Zhang explains that initially the signature of the microstructured silicon is that of a photonic crystal resonance .
But as the laser pulses are introduced , the resonance changes .
“ We see the photonic crystal signature disappear because the permittivity changes , the silicon becomes metallic , and the condition for surface plasmons is satisfied , thus the resonance changes . ”
This work is likely to result in a variety of applications across different fields , Zhang explains .
Terahertz systems , which are used for spectroscopy and imaging , can be modified more efficiently with this new way of generating surface plasmon resonance , which Zhang describes as “ tunable . ”
“ Terahertz systems always need some kind of filters to control operating frequencies and wavelengths , ” Zhang points out .
“ But with regular metals , once the structure is fixed , the operating frequencies are fixed .
With this silicon process , these things can be changed .
Both the frequencies and intensity can be controlled .
This new way is more flexible and efficient . ”
Biomedicine is a field especially where terahertz systems can find good use .
Terahertz radiation can be used to “ look ” deep inside organic materials , and they do it without causing the damage that X - rays do .
Additionally terahertz radiation is being considered for use in screening airport passengers .
Zhang also points out that surface plasmon resonance to direct terahertz systems can also be used to enhance space communication : “ This would be ideal for making tunable switches . ”
Indeed , astronomers are interested in using terahertz technology to study the particles that fall into the category of “ far - infrared . ”
“ Because silicon is cheap , rigid , and tunable , ” concludes Zhang , “ this is an important and exciting finding .
The applications for technology are just beginning . ”

Why Good HVAC Is Vital
The term HVAC may appear to be too removed to even think about relating to , yet actually , it is a piece of our day by day lives .
We are encompassed by it , from homes to workplaces to recreational zones .
Air conditioning is a condensing for Heating , Ventilation and Air-Conditioning .
Justifiably , it is an incredible piece of our solaces of current life .
Air conditioning is so significant in life today ; we would nearly be unequipped for living without these administrations today .
Be that as it may , discovering HVAC benefits in numerous spots is to be sure a test .
Being a touchy and fundamental and mechanical angle to a structure , an advanced home that looks exceptionally pleasant ( and has a reciprocal sticker price ! ) may not be as livable as it appears without appropriately practical HVAC gadgets .
Somewhere in the range of million dollar homes do n’t have essential luxuries like their ventilation very much set !
This is for the most part on the grounds that most lodging contractual workers focus on the beautification to blow up the sticker price and cut expenses on the inner subtleties .
Channeling is slimmer than required ; ventilation entries are deficient ; and regularly futile in their situating .
Numerous houses have a warming framework that is poor to the point that it might really be a fire peril !
Great HAVC administrations are explicitly essential for places with extraordinary atmospheres .
In northern states like New York , extraordinary virus makes ventilation and warming indispensable necessities even in the least difficult of nation homes .
Later fixes or rebuilding is very exorbitant .
An individual purchasing a home from an obscure source , or building their home with assistance from a little league temporary worker may land in a difficult situation .
Air conditioning frameworks are hard to incorporate .
Unpracticed and undeveloped hands may cause essential defects .
The outcome – a significant issue in the ventilation or warming framework !
Finding a presumed contractual worker is n’t just about taking a gander at a permit .
All things considered , assembling you home is a significant venture .
Checking for notoriety and sound references is imperative in the field of development if the house should be wonderful all things considered and precisely stable from inside .
Spots like Monroe County on the shores of Lake Ontario can confront temperatures as low as – 25 C !
The most significant perspective in a home in such places is flawless HVAC .
Monroe County and the remainder of the State of New York are territories served by Leo J Roth Corporation .
A chief development organization of more than 50 years , inhabitants here need n’t stress over well - set HVAC in their homes .
Modal Web Server Example Part 1
In part two I describe some additional changes to the server code .
Part
Three makes no changes to the server code , but discusses some advantages of continuation based frameworks .
Part Four extends the framework , adding a callback system , and fixing an important bug .
The modal - web - server - 0.1.tar.gz file contains the version used in this document .
Overview
There has been quite a bit of discussion lately in various places about continuation based web servers and continuation based web frameworks .
Using the Scheme programming language it can be quite easy to put together a very simple continuation based web server .
This document shows one approach to get a working server using Chicken Scheme that has enough features to allow playing around with some of the possiblities of this kind of web server design .
I 've called the server a ' Modal ' web server .
' Modal Web Server ' or ' Modal Web Framework ' is the term that Avi Bryant , the author of Seaside , has coined to describe continuation based web server designs .
I chose Chicken Scheme to base the example on because it has a working HTTP library that is easy to use .
It is also a very portable Scheme implementation implemented in standard C .
This example is not suitable for production use , although it could be extended for this purpose , and at the end of this document I will explain some of the limitations .
The modal - web - server - 0.1.tar.gz file contains the version described by this document .
What is a Modal Web Server ?
A modal web server can be built upon an existing web server framework fairly easily if the language you are using supports continuations .
That 's why I 'm using Scheme in this example .
The advantage of this type of server design is that the control flow for a web application does not need to be split up into a page request / response model , or state machine .
Instead you can write the control flow in a procedural manner and the framework manages the problem of maintaining state , allowing the use of the back button and forking of browser windows and keeping everything consistent .
Example
The start to this type of server is being able to register a function that displays HTML with a URL .
When that URL is called the function is called and the HTML it generates is displayed to the user .
This is fairly easy to do in a language with first class functions .
Using Chicken Scheme with modal - web- server.scm ( from modal - web - server - 0.1.tar.gz ) loaded you get exactly this .
Start a server with :
( spawn - server 5000 )
This starts an HTTP server running on port 5000 .
To make it easy to generate HTML I use the Scheme SSAX libraries .
This allows generating HTML and XML using a format called SXML .
A ' hello world ' function is as simple as :
( define ( page1 url ) ( sxml - > html - string '( html ( head ( title " Hello World ! " ) ) ( body ( p " Hello World ! " ) ) ) ) )
' page1 ' is a function that when called returns the HTML for a page that displays the text ' Hello World ! ' .
To register this with the server and assign it a URL so it can be accessed from the browser use :
The result of this call is a URL that is associated with the function .
Accessing this URL from the browser will run the function and display the ' Hello World ! ' page .
In this example we do n't use the ' url ' argument passed to ' page1 ' .
This argument is an URL which can be placed inside an anchor on the page which when requested , continues computation of the function that originally called ' show ' .
An example is easier than an explanation .
' show - message ' is a function that displays an HTML page with a message and an ' Ok ' anchor .
The ' Ok ' anchor goes to an URL as described above :
( define ( show - message msg ) ( show ( lambda ( url ) ( sxml - > html - string `( html ( head ( title , msg ) ) ( body ( p , msg ) ( p ( a ( @ ( href , url ) ) " O k " ) ) ) ) ) ) )
We can use this by registering with the server a function that calls it a couple of times :
( register - function ( lambda ( ) ( show - message " Hello " ) ( show - message " World " ) ) )
Accessing the registered function displays the first ' Hello ' page .
Clicking ' Ok ' will then resume the function and display the second ' World ' page .
Clicking ' Ok on that page exits the function .
Between calls to ' show ' or ' show - message ' we can create state , modify it , and it will be saved between page requests .
The common example for modal web applications is the ' Counter ' example .
This example displays a single page with a number on it .
Clicking '++' increases the number .
Clicking '- -' decreases the number .
To do this example in our framework I use a helper function ' function - href ' .
This function generates an anchor that when pressed calls a given function :
;;
Take the result returned from a page function and send the data to ; ; the web browser .
If the page function returns #f then take no ;; action .
( define ( process - page - function - result result ) ( when result ( http:write -response - header ) ( print " Content - type : text / html\r
Content - length : " ( string - length result ) " \r
\r
" result ) ) )
' register - function ' , which we 've been using to assign an URL to functions does a similar job to ' show ' , except it does n't expect the function to generate HTML .
It only exists to run the function :
( define ( register - function function ) ( let ( ( kid ( get-unique - continuation - id ) ) ) ( hash - table - set ! kid-registry kid function ) ( http : add - resource ( string - append " / " ( symbol - > string kid ) ) ( lambda ( r a ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( exit ) ( suicide exit ) ( let ( ( k ( hash - table - ref kid- registry kid ) ) ) ( k ) ( process - page - function - result " " ) ( ( suicide ) # f ) ) ) ) ) ) ( symbol - > string kid ) ) )
Summary
As you can see , in a language which supports continuations natively it is quite easy to tack on a modal web framework to an existing HTTP framework .
I 'll continue using this framework to show examples of what can be done with a modal web framework and different implementation options .
I welcome an questions .
If you wish to email me or continue reading about updates to this framework , see my weblog .
Other , more full featured , frameworks are in existance :
' Seaside ' , written in Smalltalk .
Sisc Scheme ships with an example that runs as a Java Servlet .
PLT Scheme has a continuation based server with its distribution .
Cocoon is a Java framework that uses a modified Javascript interpreter that supports continuations .
Of these , Seaside is probably the most full featured web application framework that uses the continuation model .
Core Technology , the company I work for , has a commercial continuation based framework that supports clustering , load balancing and persistent sessions , amongst other features .
It serves as the ' engine ' for a number of products built on top of it to make building enterprise level web applications easier .
So there is definitely commercial interest in these ideas .

Much research has shown that reduced calorie intake can increase health and longevity .
Professor Stephen Spindler ( University of California ) and his collaborators * have discovered that reducing calorie intake later in life can still induce many of the health and longevity benefits of life - long calorie reduction .
Importantly , this also includes anti-cancer effects .
They are using this knowledge to establish a novel screening technique to find drugs which mimic this longevity effect .
“ Right now , there are no authentic “ anti-ageing drugs ” capable of extending the lifespan of healthy people .
The technique we have developed allows us to screen a relatively large number of drugs in months rather than years .
The hope is that these drugs will be able to extend the lifespan of healthy animals , and possibly , after further testing , healthy humans ” , says Professor Spindler who will present his results at the Society for Experimental Biology ’s Main Meeting in Glasgow on Monday 2nd April .
Previous research has shown that mice can live up to 40 % longer if they simply consume fewer calories , but a highly nutritious diet .
Because people are not very good at dieting , Dr. Spindler and his colleagues would like to identify drugs which can produce the same beneficial health and longevity effects without the low calorie diet .
The problem is to find a way to rapidly identify these drugs .
Professor Spindler and his colleagues are examining the gene expression patterns which are induced by low calorie diets , and looking for drugs which mimic these changes .
They are searching for drugs which will have these beneficial effects and slow ageing , even when they are given late in life .
One drug , normally used to treat diabetic patients , seems to produce many of the beneficial effects of a low calorie diet .
However , it is important to be sure that healthy people will benefit from the drug .
A very low level of toxicity could interfere with the beneficial effects of such a drug , if it is taken for a lifetime .
Physiological changes associated with ageing include cell damage and the emergence of cancer cells .
The most important effects of low calorie diets and longevity therapeutics given late in life may not be to prevent this damage , but instead to stimulate the body to eliminate damaged cells that may become cancerous , and to stimulate repair in damaged cells like neurons and heart cells .
Low calorie diets drive the body to replace and repair damaged cells .
This process usually slows down as we age , but low calorie diets make the body re-synthesise and turn over more cells – a situation associated with youth and good health .
Dr. Spindler and his colleagues used their screening method to search for drugs which cause pre-cancerous and cancerous cells to commit suicide and to replace those cells with new , healthy cells .
It is thought that the body does this because it normally kills some cells like damaged and rogue cancer cells to provide energy when it is starving .
Then it replaces these cells when a meal is eaten .
It seems it is the total number of calories which are consumed , rather than the type of food which is the key to the effects of low calorie diets on the ageing process .
However , it is known that vegetarians and fish eaters live longer than red meat eaters , and that , generally , the more fruit and vegetables in the diet , the better your health and longer your lifespan .

newswire article reporting united states anti-racism | police / legal JAN 24 , 2007 - 5 YEARS AFTER THE FBI RAID ON RAISE THE FIST author : repost from a listserve written by Sherman Austin
edited , and posted by Akwala On January 24 , 2002 I was surrounded by 25 federal agents from the FBI and Secret
Service Los Angeles Joint Terror
Task force while I was at home asleep taking a nap .
The agents were armed with sub - machine guns , shot guns , bullet - proof vests , a
battering ram , and a 25 page search and seizure warrant filled with as much " terror
rhetoric " as they could think of .
While asleep I was unaware that agents were
already positioned around every angle of the house , including right outside my
window with loaded weapons ready for a fire fight .
I was 18 .
Fortunately my sister was home and woke me up to the news that " a bunch of FBI
looking people " in suites and vests were all over block and up and down the
streets .
Every single one of them focused on the house .
It had only been 2 years
since I started the site Raisethefist.com which was receiving thousands of hits
daily from around the world , many of those hits were also coming from the FBI , U.S
Department of Defense , NSA , Secret Service , and foreign government law agencies .
I
was running the site on a computer network and a residential DSL line from my home .
The news was no surprise .
I got up .
Looked at the servers hosting Raisethefist.com .
They were off - line .
I approached the door where 2 special agents asked for my name , then grabbed my
shoulder and pulled me outside .
Agents armed with their loaded sub - machine guns and
shot guns emerged from their hiding spots and entered the house .
Just as they
walked in , " Its this way ! " one of the agents said as he pointed his sub-machine gun
and led others to my room where the servers were .
The 2 special agents who greeted me at the door escorted me back inside and said
they had a search and seizure warrant because of my web site , Raisethefist.com .
I
asked them how this was legal and they said it was now legal under the USA Patriot
Act .
I was n't being accused of authoring anything on raisethefist.com .
I was being
accused of authoring a web site that was created by somebody else .
A white kid .
A
web site that contained a page on how to build home - made explosives .
Again , a web
site I did n't author , implement , or create in any way .
The FBI insisted I did .
They
asked me 7 times if I was the author of the site which contained this explosives
information .
I said " NO " .
I had a link to this web site from Raisethefist.com , as I did to many other sites .
While my room was being ransacked .
The " evidence " which consisted of computers ,
protest signs , and political literature was loaded into boxes and placed into a big
white truck waiting outside .
The FBI tried to ask me questions about raisethefist.com .
The FBI told my mother
they had been watching me for a very long time and my political have n't changed .
I
was asked if I 'd like to see the president killed .
I was told I had crossed over a
line and as long as I got back on the other side of that line everything would be
okay .
In other words if I stayed silent and did what I was told there would be no
more trouble .
After approximately 6 hours the FBI agents left .
We noticed a message on the
answering machine from a call that came in the same day but before the raid .
It was
from an individual I had n't spoken to in 2 years .
He left a message asking if I
wanted to " hang out " .
A few weeks prior he sent me an email about going to an
anti-capitalist demonstration together to " smash the state " .
I later learned the
FBI visited this individual , stood over his shoulder , and dictated the very words
he sent me in the email .
And as for the phone call , this was also a setup .
He was
an informant .
The FBI forgot to black this out in the 1000 + pages of case
discovery .
But that was n't the only thing they forgot to black out .
The white kid who I mentioned earlier .
The one who authored the site on how to
build home - made explosives .
He was visited by the FBI as well .
What did the agents
do ?
Arrest him ?
No .
They confirmed he authored , implemented , and created the web
site on how to build Molotov cocktails , pipe bombs , and other recipes , then they
left .
What happened next ?
The FBI fabricated statements saying I admitted to
authoring , implementing , and creating the web site on how to build explosives .
2 weeks later federal prosecutors call my public defender and say the FBI did n't
find anything illegal on the computers they seized but did n't want to let me off
the hook .
Basically they wanted me to sign a plea admitting guilt to something I
did n't do .
This only happened after spending 2 weeks in a 24 - hour lock - down maximum
security federal prison cell where I was only allowed out for legal visits , and my
closest neighbors on the cell block being those convicted for the U.S.S Cole
bombings and the bombings of the US Embassy in Kenya .
I was called " terror boy " .
Then of course I was released after 2 weeks when prosecutors decided not to indict
me on anything until they had gone through all of the computers .
A 6 month period
of death threats , wire taps , harassment , government threats , being followed and
surveilled by undercover agents , sheriffs and local police continued ..
I still continued to organized and refused to remain silent .
The feds did n't like
that .
" 18 U.S.C. 842 ( p ) ( 2 ) ( A ) : distribution of information relating to explosives ,
destructive devices , and weapons of mass destruction with the intent that such
information be used in furtherance of a federal crime of violence . "
This was the statue written and sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein and passed
under Clinton 's 1997 anti-terror law .
It was never before enforced .
Not until
August 4 , 2003 when I was sentenced to a year in federal prison and 3 years
" supervised release " .
I was threatened with over 20 years in prison under the
terrorism enhancement .
I was never indicted .
What happened to the white kid who actually wrote the explosives information and
put it on - line with the intent that it be used at an upcoming protest against the
International Monetary Fund in New York ?
Nothing .
The FBI walked out of the court room with smiles .
My mom , family and friends were
in tears .
And of course
It was only standard routine for the U.S injustice system .
Another
young black male , railroaded by the system .
Convicted and sentenced for a crime he
did n't commit .
I went in when I was 20 and got released in 2004 when I was 21 .
I lived with my mom
for the first few months when I got out .
2 undercover agents moved into an
apartment complex directly across the street .
They kept the blinds on the windows
closed 24/7 .
We later learned they worked at the Westwood Federal Building .
That 's
the same federal building that the FBI on the case worked out of .
Sometimes they
made the mistake of not taking off their security badges whenever they came and
left the apartment .
It was a bad job of being undercover ...
As was the entire case .
A bad messy job .
Fabricated evidence filled with
contradictions and obvious lies and allegations created by the feds .
Yet the
obviousness of the truth was n't enough .
The blatant fraud , a blatant setup was n't
enough to stop the judge from handing down a year prison sentence .
This case had nothing to do with information related to explosives being made
available to the public on the internet .
If it did then I would n't be on the one
writing this right now with my pencil and paper as the stipulations of my probation
state I still can't touch a computer .
I would say to those who believe this is too far fetched to be true , just go look
at the case discovery and see for yourself .
The obvious lies are supported by the
contradicting articles FBI agents forgot to black out .
The truth is right there .
But recently we 've learned that the entire case was SEALED by the feds .
Not even a lawyer can get access to the case files now .
However , a copy of the entire case discovery was obtained before this happened .
And
that copy has n't been sealed .

General Case Background
On January 24 , 2002 the FBI and the Secret Service armed with a search warrant
raided Austin 's home .
Austin was 18 - years - old and home with his twin sister , agents
questioned him without an attorney for six hours and seized all of his computer
equipment and political literature .
A week later Austin attended the anti World Economic Forum protests in New York City where he was arrested by the FBI for " distribution of information related to explosives or weapons of mass destruction " .
Conviction Austin an 18 - year - old African American male , claimed that he never authored any
information about explosives .
Nick , a 16 - year - old white male from Orange County
admitted to authoring and posting the ' Reclaim Guide " on a free hosting space
located on Sherman 's server .
FBI dsicovery files referred to an area of the Raise
the Fist server ( " www.raisethefist.com/exit ) which was entitled Reclaim Guide
authored by Nick , who was questioned by the Special Agent John I. Pi and never
admitted to authorship of the information .
The FBI never charged Sherman but instead coerced him into signing a plea for distributing Reclaim Guide .
Sherman was cooerced into entering a guilty plea to violation of 18 U.S.C. 842( p )
which makes it a crime to distribute bombmaking information knowing or intending
that the information will be used for a violent crime .
Sherman was never formally
charged with any crime .
The government threatened him with a " terrorism enhancement " to the charge under
the USA PATRIOT Act and , if the case went to trial and he was convicted of such , a
potential 20 year sentence .
On August 4 , 2003 , he was sentenced in U.S. District
Court by Judge Stephen V. Wilson to 12 months in a federal jail , a $ 2000 fine ,
three years probation , and as well as other restrictions .
His time was served in a
federal institution in Tucson , Arizona .
Release
Austin was released one month early in July 2004 with 3 years of probation which
prohibits him from having access to a computer as well as knowingly associating with
individuals who " espouse violence for political change " .
Public opinion
In February 2006 , Austin released a statement on Indymedia claiming that the
National Security Agency had installed illegal wiretaps before and during the
investigation against him .
Austin's mother , Jennifer Martin Ruggiero , is an outspoken advocate for her son .
Many Americans consider Austin a political prisoner .
Since his arrest , Austin has
become a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre on the internet for anarchists , with many sites dedicated
to " freeing " Austin .
Zack de la Rocha , lead vocalist of the band Rage Against the
Machine , came out in support of Austin .
Carnegie Mellon University professor David S. Touretzky , who posted a mirror of the
Reclaim Guide on his web site in reaction to the FBI raid on Austin , has not been
charged or arrested .
Touretzky has distanced himself from Austin 's politics , which
he characterizes as " mindless " , and has dismissed the Reclaim Guide as amateurish .
He points out that books like Home Workshop Explosives , which offer better
information about making explosives , are sold on the popular website Amazon.com .

Education chair to White House : Turn over student loan records
Citing " serious oversight failures " by White House officials , the Democratic head of the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Labor Committee has demanded that the administration turn over a number of records relating to its federal loans programs , Reuters news service reports today .
In addition to asking for general emails relating to the program , Democratic Representative George Miller of California requested emails directly from current Education Secretary Margeret Spellings and former Education Secretary Rodney Paige .
" Congress and state attorneys general are probing allegations of misconduct across the student loan industry .
Investigators accuse some college financial aid officers of taking payments and perks from lenders in exchange for placing the companies on ' preferred lender ' lists shown to students , " Reuters reported on Tuesday .
" We believe that the ' preferred lender ' list system is broken and needs fixing .
It no longer serves the interests of students and their families , " said a spokesperson from Student Lending Works , an Ohio nonprofit lender that has been left off all but 12 of 100 such lists .
" As the inquiry has progressed , lenders including Citigroup Inc. , Sallie Mae , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have agreed to a code of conduct recommended by Cuomo banning school - lender financial ties , ' preferred lender ' list payments and lender gifts to college employees . "
Spellings is scheduled to testify on May 10 before Miller 's House Education and Labor Committee .

A new open - source social networking software gains its power to be used in schools and other organizations .
University of Brighton was the first to introduce Elgg , a social network to help teachers in their interaction with children and use social networks like MySpace , blogs and Del.icio.us feeds for educational purposes .
If earlier , the access to these sites were seen as a an obstacle and were banned , now many teachers see it a helpful tool as this attracts great interest among teenagers .
Every participant taking part in the project will have a blog with profile page , and have an opportunity to share photos , ideas and communicate with friends in online communities .
Some tutors fear that such innovations will be ineffective , while inventors of the Elgg assure that this will not only result in more interested approach but also create a more natural atmosphere for learning .
In fact , Elgg offer students and tutors the personal learning environment were they can exchange documents and talk to each other , participate in discussions and find common ground .
Now Elgg , that can be downloaded for free , embraces more than 50 schools and colleges worldwide and inventors anticipate an increasing success .
besides the academic use , Elgg that now has versions in almost 40 languages , can compete with other social networks in the near future .
Many private companies all around the world , including France Telecom are now in pace with the new software .
Using social networks to supplement education is just the beginnng .
Eventually , our college education will consist of virtual classrooms , and occasional trips to campus .
Homeschooling will be more prevalent and getting an online bachelor degree will become the standard instead of the exception .
Daniel Kirk - Davidoff ( U. Maryland and one - time Lindzen co-author ) provided a more detailed rebuttal of Lindzen ’s argument in the comments to our previous post .
It deserves to be more widely seen , so here it is again .
Here ’s an effort at a point by point rebuttal .
I would say that the central flaw in the op - ed is a logical one : if you ’re trying to stifle dissent , then you want less funding for climate research , not more .
If you ’re trying to stop global warming , then you want more money for carbon sequestration research , and you do n’t care how much is spent on climate research .
On the other hand if you just love climate research as a really interesting intellectual pursuit , that ’s when you ’ve got an interest in shedding doubt on the reigning view that CO2 - induced climate change is a serious policy program , requiring action .
Twenty - five years ago , when global warming was n’t a big public worry , one might expect climate change researchers to hype the problem .
In 2006 , when public opinion mostly accepts that there ’s a problem , scientists who want research money should be emphasizing uncertainty .
In the opening paragraph , Lindzen states that others have claimed that there are connections between recent rare weather events and global warming , and asks where they would possibly get such an idea .
It ’s not clear where his astonishment comes from though .
Heat waves and increased lake effect snows seem like very reasonable expectations for a warmer world .
Of course , attribution of any individual such event to presently observed global temperature change can only be fractional , but it ’s completely reasonable to say that events like the heat wave of 2003 will be more likely when the mean annual temperature of Europe is a few degrees warmer - this assumes only that the scatter of summer time temperature under global warming wo n’t be much smaller than it is now .
In his second paragraph , Lindzen makes the uncontroversial claim that society sometimes funds science to address phenomena that seem to offer a threat of harm .
Using the passive voice , he asserts a feedback cycle between scientific funding and scientific alarm .
This seems really odd : the publlc demand made by scientists who are most alarmed by global warming is precisely not that more money go into reasearch , but rather that money go into research to increase fuel efficiency to develope carbon - emission - free fuel sources .
In fact Lindzen himself in his final paragraph seems to be calling for increased funding to address the question of climate sensitivity !
The third paragraph about drying up of funding for dissenting science has been addressed by others .
I agree that I just do n’t see it .
The particular anecdotes I have heard about political influence on the federal grant making process go in the other direction , where people are told that they should not pubish findings supporting large climate sensitvity , at least until after some election .
The fourth paragraph is another weird one .
He starts by promissing an opportunity to grasp the “ complex underlying scientific issues ” , but never really discusses anything complex - I take this as an effort to flatter the WSJ readers on their grasp of these erudite points , bolstering their confidence when they take on the tree - huggers at the water cooler .
His rhetorical tactic here is to severely shrink the list of agreed - upon truths to those that we ’ve known since 1980 , while neglecting the fact that human responsibility for the 20th century warming of global temperature is quite well - established , and that various causes for alarm ( for example , substantially reduced water availability in places that depend on snow - pack for their dry - season water ) are also very well established .
Then he moves the discussion to “ outlandish ” claims that contradict the “ models ” .
This is the first use of the word “ models ” in the article , and gets no explanation , which is a little odd for a discussion in a newspaper .
He does n’t explain what the outlandish claims are , so we ’re left to wait for the next paragraph .
Here we discover that the outlandish claims involve something about more “ excitation ” of extratropical storms .
I ’m not sure where he ’s getting this - when I go to , for instance , Ross Gelbspan ’s website , the only references to storms I see is to tropical storms , and to more intense rainfall generally .
Both are well supported by empirical studies .
The increase in rainfall intensity ( shift in distribution of rain from more light events to fewer heavy events ) as a consequence of global warming is a robust feature of GCMs .
Okay , that ’s all I ’ve got time for .
It ’d be nice if Lindzen gave his reader some way of checking the claims he makes about persecution - was Tennekes dismissed because he questioned the scientific underpinnings of global warming , or just after ?
In what context did Bert Bolin “ tar ” Aksel Winn - Nielsen ?
I think Alfonso Sutera ’s recent work on baroclinic neutralization is really interesting … is there some missing strand of his research that Lindzen thinks ought to be taken up again ?
It ’s hard to guess .
About the IRIS paper - I really ca n’t see what he ’s complaining about .
The paper was published , depite some rather “ outlandish claims . ”
For instance , in the IRIS paper , Lindzen argues that tropical surface temperature and polar surface temperature should be assumed to vary in exactly the same way as CO2 concentrations increase .
This is based on the idea that baroclinic neutralization maintains a particular critical temperature gradient , an idea that had a brief period of fashionability in 1978 .
In any case , there ’s certainly been a lively debate about the paper , and if it ’s widely viewed as “ discredited ” , then that ’s the judgement of the climate dynamics community .
If we ’re a bunch of dummies , history will judge us harshly , but we can only do our best .
I see a lot of science in our community that ’s being driven by curiosity .
At the recent European Geophysical Union conference , there were posters on banner clouds on the Zugspitze , the role of cubic ice crystals in high cirrus formation , and the role of global cooling in the fall of the Neanderthals .
Some of this research is being driven by claims that it will address climate change .
So maybe this helps to solve the riddle of what Lindzen is really concerned about .
People who are really concerned about climate change do n’t agitate for more funding for our field - they agitate for funding for fuel efficiency research and carbon sequestration .
It ’s the people who like curiosity - driven research in climate dynamics who have the real incentive to argue that there ’s a lot of uncertainty , because uncertainty allows people with strong intellectual curiosity to make the case that there ’s at least some tangential benefit of their work to the climate sensitivity problem .
Steve Job ’s ambitious goal to grab a fifth of the smartphone market , coyly understated as ‘ just 1 % of the entire billion unit mobile phone industry ’ , indicates that Apple is looking at the industry very differently than every other vendor .
While most phones are cheap or nearly free , the iPhone aims at the high end of smartphones .
Previous articles looked at how mobile providers ’ phone subsidies distort pricing , and how smartphones relate to the rest of the mobile industry .
Here ’s a look at how the iPhone relates to other phones on the market .
Where Does the iPhone Fit ?
Despite the iPhone being Apple ’s first volley into into a crowded market , the company is pursuing an ambitious entry strategy .
Rather than copying an existing successful product and a popular price point , the iPhone blazes a new trail in its combination of features and form factor , and does so at a significantly higher price .
When analysts pick at the iPhone 's price , they tend to gloss over the fact that this is really a handheld computer , not a basic smartphone .
When they complain about missing features , they rarely point out the correlation between those features and a higher price .
The iPhone floats in the uncharted territory between Microsoft's " ultra mobile " Windows XP Tablet PCs like the $ 1300 Samsung Q1 , and the tiny but clumsy Windows Mobile phones with chicklet keyboards that slide out of a box that is as thick as an unabridged Russian dictionary .
Charting a New Course
The iPhone is closer to being a micro-laptop using flash RAM than a conventional smartphone .
In fact , it is actually far closer to being a modern version of the 1994 Newton -- which Jobs was purportedly so embittered against -- than anything that Microsoft has ever released .
It bears little resemblance to Windows Mobile .
Imagine the Newton , but smaller , retrofitted with a modern OS , a camera , a phone , an iPod , built in wireless , better battery life , a color screen , faster , with a finger - based touch screen ... and the iPhone emerges .
While Apple 's retail stores might give the iPhone an advantage in up - selling its own customers from their basic phones , it will still need to aggressively outsell existing smartphones to meet Apple 10 million sales target .
What does the iPhone compete against ?
Here 's a quick look at other phones on the market .
The iPhone ’s Competition
There are few popular phones on the market near the iPhone 's $ 500 price .
Basic phones are commonly free , and smartphones typically cost between $ 100 and $ 200 with a service provider subsidy and mail in rebates .
All smartphones require a two year contract -- a minimum commitment of over $ 2000 - - to qualify for the subsidy discount .
Unlocked phone prices represent the actual cost of the phone without any carrier subsidy .
Additional rebates may apply to new customers .
Prices differ slightly by region , and may be even lower online .
Here ’s what I found online at Amazon and Cingular in a recent price check .
The High End : Symbian Sony Ericsson P990
The new Sony Ericsson P990 is listed as $ 700 unlocked , with no service options in the US offered by Amazon .
Like the Palm , it has a stylus driven touch screen .
Its screen is half the resolution of the iPhone .
It has a number button face that flips down to expose a tiny keyboard below it .
On Amazon , users complained about its software being buggy and crashing frequently .
Like the iPhone , it sports premium features like a 2 Megapixel camera and WiFi wireless networking ; unlike Apple ’s iPhone however , the P990 supports the much faster UMTS 3G data service .
The problem with its 3G service is that it only works on European service bands .
The limited 3G data service that is available in the US uses different frequencies .
Similarly , it uses Tri-band GSM , not Quad - band GSM like the iPhone , giving it reduced voice coverage in the US .
Service Complexities for World Phones and UMTS 3G Data Service
GSM uses two bands in Europe ( 900/1800 MHz ) , and three in the US ( 850/1800/1900 MHz ) for voice service ; [ John Kneeland pointed out that the 1800 MHz band is only used in the US by the Department of Defense ] .
Tri-band phones work on both bands in Europe , but only two [ one ! ] in the US .
Quad - band world phones support all four , providing additional service coverage for users in the US .
High speed UMTS 3G data service is even more complicated .
Existing service in Europe and elsewhere combines two bands for data uplink and downlink ( 2100 +1900 MHz ) .
Unfortunately , parts of the 2100 MHz band are already in use in the US for satellite communications , and parts of the 1900 MHz band are already in use in the US for GSM networks .
Cingular has already started rolling out its own , incompatible UMTS service ( 850+1900 MHz ) in certain US cities , and later this year T - Mobile will offer a different UMTS 3G service ( 2100 +1700 MHz ) .
Neither matches Europe ’s ( 2100 +1900 MHz ) , so both require phones specifically designed to support the oddball US formats .
Between the limited service availability of 3G data service in the US , and the problem of different sets of frequencies in use , 3G service does not yet make a lot of sense in the US .
That ’s why few US phones offer 3G service , and why those that would seem to , like the Sony Ericsson P990 , wo n’t actually work in the US .
Higher End : Windows Mobile HTC TyTN
One of the most expensive phones commonly available is the HTC TyTN / Hermes / 8525 .
Cingular offers it for $ 400 after rebate and subsidy ; Amazon for $ 200 with service and rebates or $ 760 unlocked , with a $ 999 list price .
Like the Palm and other Windows Mobile Pocket PCs , it has a stylus driven touch screen .
Its screen is also half the resolution of the iPhone .
It has a PDA style face which slides open to reveal a QWERTY keyboard , although it ’s too big for thumb typing , and too small for touch typing .
Like the iPhone , it sports premium features like a 2 Megapixel camera and WiFi wireless networking .
Like the P990 , it also supports UMTS 3G data service , although it works on both Europe and Cingular ’s networks .
In order to do that , it packs in Multiband UMTS , as well as being Quad - band GSM like the iPhone .
Support for all those networks results in a unit over twice as thick as the iPhone , but also gives it much faster Internet access when WiFi is n’t available .
The premium price and 3G features of the TyTN and similar high end Windows Mobile phones has not done much to expand Microsoft 's share of the market .
That 's why recent offerings by vendors licensing Windows Mobile have targeted the low end of the smartphone market .
Most Windows Mobile Smartphones Aim Low
Most smartphones running Windows Mobile are conservatively featured and are priced to sell for around $ 100 with a carrier subsidy .
Few support WiFi , and most lack a touch screen or enough memory to run many apps and store music or photos , apart from ringtones and camera phone pictures .
They are basic phones with organizer functions , often with features problematically hidden in deeply nestled pulldown menus that erase any premise of being designed for one handed use .
A big sales pitch for Windows Mobile involves mobile versions of Office apps , as if people are likely to edit Excel documents on a tiny screen .
Low - end Windows Smartphones , like the $ 500 Samsung Blackjack and $ 400 Motorola Q are aimed to sell in the range of $ 100 - 200 with a contract subsidy and mail - in rebates .
These phones abandon the PDA or tiny - PC form factor of earlier WinCE devices to imitate the success and styling of the BlackBerry and Treo .
The Palm Treo and RIM BlackBerry
The loyal following of Palm Treo and RIM BlackBerry users allows those vendors to regularly introduce new models at higher price points than other phones , and then sell older models at a discount to budget customers .
New Palm
Treo versions typically debut at a list price of $ 650 , while a new BlackBerry lists around $ 400 .
With subsidy , Cingular sells the latest Treo 750 on its website for $ 400 , while Amazon offers it for as little as $ 99 .
Older versions of the Treo are listed by Cingular at $ 100 , or as little as $ 49 on Amazon .
Cingular lists various BlackBerry models between $ 100 - $ 200 , while Amazon offers them from $ 70 to Free .
Palm offers a higher resolution display and more memory than most other common mobiles , making it a popular choice for users who want PDA features .
BlackBerry phones are popular among professionals addicted to the push messaging they introduced -- where emails arrive immediately without the user having to stop and check -- along with their thumb driven tiny keypad .
Unique features of the BlackBerry and Palm are mixing together as vendors copy each other ’s strong points .
The result is that many mobiles now have the familiar thumb keyboard , a small touch screen , and similar menus and features and applications .
Snooze You Lose ?
The middle class phones from Palm and RIM , along with imitative offerings by Windows Mobile and Symbian licensees , all aim to sell for around $ 100 or less with a contract subsidy and cover a laundry list of basic features :
• basic camera phone • simplified web browser • basic PDA and sync functions • text messaging and picture mail • simple add - on apps like Google Maps • downloadable $ 2 ringtones and games
It is therefore rather bold for Apple to introduce a phone that is priced around $ 500 , particularly given that Apple plans to swallow up nearly 20 % of the smartphone market by the end of next year .
Other high end phones exist primarily to anchor a vendor ’s lineup ;
Sony does n’t expect its P990 to sell to a wide , mass market audience .
Distinguishing Features
Apart from 3G data service , the iPhone offers hardware features that meet or beat the fancier phones common in markets outside the US : better camera , much larger display , far more memory for storage , and WiFi support .
Where it really differs from existing US phones is in its unique OS X driven software features :
• a finger driven multi - touch screen with intuitive gesture shortcuts that make complex actions simple • a multiple page , standard web browser with smart , resolution independent zooming • a real photo and music media library , and real calendar and contact applications • real 3 - pane email with support for HTML mail and push accounts ; support for visual voicemail • tightly integrated , custom Google Maps and other apps ; tight integration between phone features • integration with iTunes for real media sync , not just ringtones and pay per view toy video
Critics suggesting that the iPhone is “ just a fancier version ” of the email and web on existing phones are being just as disingenuous as DOS users who pooh - poohed the Mac in 1984 , or those who could n’t understand why the Palm Pilot and BlackBerry could have devoted fans .
It ’s all about practical usability .
Good Tools Are Worth It
Existing phones are a lot like the gift box toolsets offered in discount stores : all the pieces are technically there , but it ’s difficult to be productive with them when doing a serious job .
The toy hammer ’s head falls off every three swings and the screwdrivers strip themselves .
Using cheap tools turns out to be expensive in the end because of lost opportunity costs .
Why spend $ 4.99 on a pretend hammer when a real hammer can be bought for $ 25 , saving the frustrating expense of messing around with inadequate junk ?
Will sticker shock be a barrier to Apple ’s iPhone ?
That may depend on whether consumers are able to see past the ruse of phone subsidies and realize that the most expensive thing about a phone is not its hardware cost but the service fees .
Spending $ 2000 across two years is more pleasant with a $ 500 functional phone than with a toy piece of junk that may be available for free .
Given that consumers already see the difference between the $ 500 iPod and $ 99 imitations , it looks like the only thing Apple has to worry about is building enough to meet demand .
Next , I ’ll compare the iPhone to new phones still on the horizon , and how quickly other phones might catch up .
Have another phone to suggest in comparison ?
Let me know and I 'll do a follow up review .

It is “ critical ” that the Congressional Black Caucus remain an all - black organization , one of the CBC ’s founders has said in a strategy memo .
“ The CBC welcomes support from others in the House and Senate , especially those with liberal credentials , but it is critical that its membership remain exclusively African American , ” retired Rep. William Lacy Clay Sr. wrote earlier this year to the CBC .
Mr. Clay ’s letter — distributed by his son , Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. , Missouri Democrat — prompted a CBC meeting before the August recess .
“ The members have discussed it , and we supported the tradition that only African - Americans have been full members of the CBC , but as always we will work with anyone as our coalition partners and some have become honorary members , ” said Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , Michigan Democrat , who has been all but confirmed as the caucus ’ chairman for the 110th Congress .
The Clay letter was written in response to concerns that two Jewish congressional candidates , Tennessee state Rep. Steve Cohen and New York City Councilman David Yassky , both Democrats , would apply for CBC membership if elected from majority - black districts .
Neither candidate has announced plans to seek CBC membership , and some caucus members were skeptical of suggestions they would , with one CBC member saying that such talk might be “ political ploys to bolster their image with the black constituency they are seeking to represent . ”
But with Election Day still two months away , the question addressed by the Clay letter remains hypothetical .
“ And that is just the point , ” said one CBC member , who did not wish to be identified .
“ We should not be taking a position on an academic question considering neither of these guys has been elected . ”
In his letter , Mr. Clay said the CBC would work with whites , Asians and Pacific islanders , Hispanics , Democrats , and Republicans to move legislation that furthers its agenda , but only blacks can be official voting members .
Mr. Clay recalled that Rep. Pete Stark , California Democrat , attempted to join the organization in 1975 .
“ Although Stark was sincere , intentions honest and honorable and record on civil rights impeccable , after thoughtfully and thoroughly examining the issue , a formal vote was taken that rejected his application , ” Mr. Clay wrote .
The issue arose this summer because of two unusual situations for Democrats .
In Tennessee ’s 9th District , after Rep. Harold E. Ford Jr. opted to run for Senate , 15 Democrats entered the campaign for the seat , which had previously been held by Mr. Ford ’s father .
Mr. Cohen won the Aug. 3 primary with 31 percent of the vote in the Memphis - area district , where 60 percent of voters are black .
Mr. Cohen will face Republican Mark White and independent candidate Jake Ford , Harold Jr. ’s brother , in November .
A similar situation could occur after next week ’s Democratic primary in New York ’s 11th District , where Rep. Major R. Owens is retiring .
That Brooklyn district is nearly 60 percent black , as are Mr. Yassky ’s three rivals for the nomination .
But in the four - way primary , Mr. Yassky — who has raised $ 1.4 million for the campaign — may emerge as a plurality winner in the solidly Democratic district .
No white politician has held the seat since 1960 when a federal judge ordered the district be reapportioned , and it has historical significance as it was once held by Rep.
Shirley Chisholm , the first black woman elected to Congress and to run for the presidency in 1972 .
Mr. Owens — whose son is a candidate for the seat — has called Mr. Yassky a “ colonizer . ”
Mr. Yassky has not said he intends to apply for CBC membership .
“ He has never said he would ; he would certainly like to work with them , but it is not up to him .
It is [ the CBC ’s ] decision on whether he can join , ” said Yassky spokesman Evan Theis .
The issue of white politicians attempting to join black political groups came up most recently last year in Tennessee when state Rep. Stacey Campfield , a Republican from Knoxville , attempted to join the Tennessee Black Caucus .
After his application was rejected , Mr. Campfield angered black lawmakers by saying the group ’s bylaws were more exclusionary than the Ku Klux Klan .
In the past , the Congressional Black Caucus has been criticized by some black Republicans .
Former Rep. Gary A. Franks , Connecticut Republican , was nearly ousted from the group for opposing the creation of majority - minority districts .
The CBC ’s chairman at the time , Kweisi Mfume — the Maryland Democrat who is currently running for Senate — intervened and made it clear that the group was bipartisan .

Palaeontologists say the skeleton appears to be complete
The five - million - year - old skeleton , 33ft ( 10 m ) in length , was dug up in the northern grape - growing area of Tuscany .
The vineyards of Castello Banfi , where the bones were uncovered , produce the famed Brunello de Montalcino wine , one of Italy 's most prized .
The whale remains were discovered by a fossil hunter who was given special permission to poke around the vines .
Rich soil
The skeleton appears to be complete and , for the last month , palaeontologists from the University of Florence have been carefully digging around the terraces to extract it in one piece .
Millions of years ago , Tuscany was under water and Castello Banfi was the sea bed .
The vineyard owner , Cristina Mariani , is delighted .
" It reminds us " that this rich soil is composed of nutrients and minerals deposited millions of years ago , " she says .
" It 's that special earth that gives complexity to our wines . "
So , if you are lucky enough to ever taste a Brunello , just savour it for that extra moment , and remember that beneath the old vines that produced it - there was an even bigger old whale .

As part of his plan , the president wants Congress to enact legislation that would authorize tougher interrogations of suspected terrorists .

And that is what Congress must not do , said Colin L. Powell , the former secretary of state .
“ The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism , ” Mr. Powell said in a letter to Senator John McCain of Arizona , one of the Republicans who differ with Mr. Bush ’s policies .
Mr. McCain was one of the four Armed Services Committee Republicans who voted against Mr. Bush ’s proposals .
The others were Senators John W. Warner of Virginia , the chairman , Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina and Susan E. Collins of Maine .
The measure that the panel endorsed and sent to the Senate floor would let suspects see evidence against them and would bar statements obtained through torture or coercion .
Mr. Powell ’s repudiation of the White House ’s anti-terrorism approach was both stark and highly unusual for a former cabinet member .

How much actual gold is in a bottle of Goldschlager Cinnamon Liqueur ?
By Rob Cockerham | August 2004
Goldschlager is my favorite novelty booze .
It is a clear cinnamon liqueur , swirling with hundreds of tiny flakes of real gold .
Yes !
Real gold , inside the bottle , mixed up , ready to flow into your stomach , small intestines and other digestion - related organs .
The alcohol may affect your equilibrium , giving you a light - headed feeling .
The dense gold flakes also affect your equilibrium , delivering a stomach - churning gold " rush " .
Although there are indications that the practice dates back to ancient Egypt , a colorful history of gold and liquor comes out of the California Gold Fever of the 1850s .
Successful gold miners would sometimes sprinkle a few flakes of gold into their drinks , living , they imagined , like Incan kings .
It is said that W.K.
Kellogg was so impressed with this paydirt tradition that he modified the ritual , insisting his corn flakes be treated the same way .
After his surgery , he began substituting milk for the cinnamon schnapps .
The gold flakes swoosh around like a billionaire 's snow - globe , attracting thirsty adults and nesting birds .
Much like champagne , Goldschlager has a reputation as a celebration drink .
It is touted by style consultants for its ability to increase one 's inner bling .
Gold sells for about $ 391 per ounce , so it seems pretty crazy so have real gold in a $ 23 bottle of liquor .
Update : $ 1,320 per ounce
The real gold is what makes goldschlager magical , but how much is inside ?
On Tuesday night , we decided to find out .
Brooke , official spokesshaker , got the gold up and moving .
To separate the gold flakes from the liquor , we decided to pour it though a filter .
Target was all out of gold filters , so we used a coffee filter .
Jane poured carefully to avoid overflow .
Brooke had several good ideas for keeping the level low .
The filter held back the gold , but slowly let the shlager through .
Someone had to check to see if the filter was also removing the alcohol .
I selflessly volunteered .
A few minutes later , the entire 750 milliliters of goldschlager was through the filter .
While we waited for the gold flakes to dry , we had some time to dream up new schlagers .
It seemed like almost any small , foreign object would make an interesting aperitif ...
Googlie - eyeschlager
CornschlagerPushpinschalger
Coinschlager .
Also considered were hookschlager , legoschlager , diamondschlager , advilschlager , gummischlager , porkschlager , hairschlager and flyschlager .
We were planning on downing shots of the filtered liquor , but Jane misunderstood and managed just one " Pyrex shot " before feeling very sleepy .
By the same token , almost any food could be improved with gold flakes .
Gold could add a glittering gleam to soup , chili or ice cream .
How about " gold on the bottom " yogurt ?
Movie popcorn could come with not only real butter , but real gold !
Want something to pour on top of your golden brown waffles ?
How about Mrs. Goldsworth maple syrup ?
Having a superduper superbowl party ?
Maybe your gold - encrusted chips would taste better with some Salsa Con Oro !
The gold filter was really taking forever to dry out .
We actually tried weighing it wet and comparing that weight to another wet filter , but that introduced far too much error to the measurement .
We also realized that even if the filter were dry , it would still contain an unknown amount of sugar .
We carefully scraped the gold flakes onto the digital scale .
Unfortunately , the gold weighed less than a tenth of a gram ( 0.1g ) .
It would n't even register on my scale .
This thin smear of gold , clumped together on Jane 's fingertip , was worth less than $ 1.38 .
Needless to say , this is n't going to impress the Maybach crowd .
For the highest level of luxury , I recommend Goldschlager Double Stuf .
Despite the chemical similarity do n't ever mix flakes of lead into cocktails .
Ruapehu is one of the world ’s most active volcanoes .
The deep crater lies between its peaks and fills with a lake between big eruptions
The crater lake of New Zealand ’s Mount Ruapehu is brimming and could burst at any time , releasing at least one million cubic metres of water and sending a mudflow – or lahar – gushing down the volcano .
The last major Mt Ruapehu lahar , in 1953 , was on a similar scale .
It swept away a railway bridge , killing 151 people travelling across it .
Some local newspapers are raising the prospect of another potential disaster – but scientists say they are scare - mongering .
A new automatic monitoring and alarm system , in combination with alterations to bridges and roads , and detailed predictions of the track of a lahar , mean the public should not be at risk , says Harry Keys , a geologist with the New Zealand Department of Conservation ( DoC ) in Tongariro / Taupo , the area that encompasses Mt Ruapehu .
Local claims that a simple engineering fix was rejected because of protests from Maori , who consider the mountain sacred , are also wrong , Keys says .
Bulldozing a trench through the dam to let water escape slowly would have been a short - term solution to only this lahar threat .
“ What we have in place now is the best solution for managing lahars in the long term , ” he says .

Alpine sports
Mt Ruapehu , which is 2797 metres high , is in the North Island , about 40 km southwest of Lake Taupo , and is hugely popular for skiing , kayaking and hiking .
Its 500 - metre wide crater lake has been filling up since spectacular volcanic explosions in 1995 and 1996 , which deposited ash and rocks around the crater .
The lake ’s level jumped by more than a metre after a minor eruption on 4 October 2006 , and is now 2.8 metres below the crest of the tephra barrier .
This natural barrier – made up of rock ash produced during eruptions – is eroding as the water rises .
While a breach is not inevitable , it is probable , and the most likely time for that to happen is February or March , says the DoC .
If the dam bursts , the DoC says it knows where the water will go .
“ It will flow down the channel where the Whangaehu river flows , ” says Keys , following the route of the 1953 lahar .
“ There ’s no doubt about that . ”
Stronger bridge
The river channel route is believed to be the most active lahar path in the world .
It tracks east down the mountain and then south , before emptying into the ocean .
There are no human settlements in the route , but at Tangiwai , 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) downstream and at least a 1.5 hour journey for a lahar , there is a rail - bridge – a much stronger replacement for the bridge that failed in 1953 .
The road bridge at the same location has been raised .
Furthermore , a barrier has been erected alongside another major road , which is at the most likely spot where the lahar could breach the natural channel , says Keys .
A lahar would take 20 - minutes to reach this site .
The alarm system would prevent trains and cars from crossing the bridges .
Prime opportunity
The monitoring and alarm system is the result of an 8 - year review following the 1996 eruption .
Critics argue that a drainage trench would have been much simpler , cheaper and safer , and that the idea was abandoned because of spiritual objections by Maori .
“ Nothing is further from the truth , ” maintains Keys .
Digging a trench would have been dangerous and could have dealt with only this lahar threat , he says .
Lahars are often caused suddenly by eruptions , which are largely unpredictable .
Making better - protected roads and bridges , as well as an alarm system , is a better option , he argues .
If a lahar does happen , it will give scientists a prime opportunity to observe one up close .
International researchers are currently setting up additional sensors , including flood height monitors and cameras .
“ We will get the best scientific data on a lahar , which will have utility [ for hazard management ] around the world , ” says Keys .
Just like any project you work on , there are signs and behaviors within a development team that indicate a need for refactoring as well .
Before a development team can get to the job of developing quality code , the definition of " quality code " has to be addressed , identified , and agreed upon .
I believe this is the most difficult step in evolving a development team 's skill set away from the ' slap it together and fix it later ' mindset .
Why do I think this ?
Because this is exactly what I 'm attempting to do with my current team .
In order to convince an entire team of developers to change the way they code , you have to establish a case for _why_ this big change has to occur .
Point out where the inefficiencies in the current methods ( or lack thereof ) are .
Make everyone realize that there is a better way .
Security is a _huge_ factor because you are asking someone to step out of their comfort zone and learn something new .
In fact , many take offense to this notion of improving the way they do things .
This brings us to our first Team Smell : There are two things to consider here : 1 ) the industry of software development is full of bright , intelligent people , and 2 ) almost every person in the industry thinks they are one of these bright , intelligent beings .
This is a potential team killer because the person that thinks he or she knows everything they need to know to develop good code – all too often does n’t .
I do n’t want to work with someone that thinks they have nothing left to learn .
This is the type of person that eschews Agile practices like TDD because he claims he can create solid , object oriented , sustainable code on his own , without some crazy process to help him along .
This might be the most difficult symptom to battle because of the inherent human nature involved .
The good part about working with someone afflicted with this condition is that they will often jump into management ;-) .
Of course , you know the downside to this - they could become your manager ;-(
If this smell is too widespread on a team that you are trying to change for the better , the best choice is probably to find another team and / or place to work .
The point of all this improvement is to write higher quality software through better methods .
If the vast majority of team members are just too full of themselves to change , then wish them the best as they continue to pump in 70 - hour weeks and seek out a place where your peers will be more like - minded .
This may seem silly and unbelievable to you , but during my current project I constantly hear fellow developers say , “ Yeah , but I finally got this working .
If I change this now , it might break , and I just do n’t have time for that ” .
Translation : “ I have no idea how my code even compiled , much less how I would go about modifying or moving pieces of it around for the sake of refactoring , especially since the deadline is next week . ”
If a developer is afraid to dig into the code he or she spent a lot of time producing , chances are the code 1 ) sucks – in that it resembles a large plate of spaghetti – at best , and 2 ) has little or no chance of becoming testable without many large , risky refactorings .
Defunkifying this smell should be easier to address because it ’s simply based on a lack of understanding .
Where there ’s a lack of understanding , there ’s usually a hidden desire to understand because the uncertainty of the work he or she is doing is somewhat unsettling .
Many developers in this position simply do n’t know how to shed this uncertainty .
This is where preaching the value of test driven design should find an eager audience .
By working in small , testable chunks , a code base evolves bit by bit , thereby reducing the chance of it becoming too large and fragile .
When code is just slammed into place in order to ‘ get it working ’ , what should have been prototype code usually becomes production code b/c the developer is just happy that the junk he or she produced compiles .
All too often this type of developer knows the code should be at the very least cleaned up and modularized , much less refactored to patterns and made testable , but he or she knows the trouble they will be in when they try this – so they just let it lie .
One of the greatest bi-products of designing test - first is that when a feature is completed ( i.e. all uses cases or stories are satisfied ) there is a compliment of unit tests that can be run at any time to verify the code is doing the job it ’s supposed to .
Another great thing about code that is designed test first is the resulting structure is typically _much_ easier to 1 ) understand , 2 ) extend , and 3 ) if necessary , modify .
I ca n’t start any new piece of application functionality now without beginning in a test method .
I feel quite secure coding one test - case at a time , constantly thinking about the responsibilities of a class and how it should operate with its dependencies .
Working in this way I know that the code was created thoughtfully and with care ( as opposed to entire features crammed into 80 - line methods that can do 20 things , depending on another 20 possible conditions ) .
And thusly , when the code goes live , it will run as intended with very few surprises .
In part two , I ’ll identify one or two more Team Smells and how to expunge their foul stench from your working environment .
Relations between London and Moscow threatened to plummet to a post- cold war low yesterday amid renewed Russian demands for action against Boris Berezovsky over the tycoon 's claim that he is plotting to overthrow Vladimir Putin .
The Russian ambassador to the UK warned that bilateral relations would inevitably suffer if prompt action was not taken against the Britain - based multi-millionaire , who told the Guardian that he was fomenting a revolution to topple Mr Putin by force .
Yesterday it also emerged that British authorities have begun a second inquiry into Mr Berezovsky 's comments , with the Home Office 's border and immigration agency investigating whether they could undermine his refugee status .
Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism command is already assessing whether he breached anti-terrorism laws by inciting a coup .
But it was the remarks of the Russian ambassador , Yury Fedotov , that will have alarmed Downing Street at a time when ministers and senior officials are increasingly concerned about Russia 's assertiveness on the international stage .
Speaking at the embassy in west London , Mr Fedotov said he had sent a letter on Wednesday to John Reid , the home secretary , underlining the seriousness with which the issue was viewed in Moscow .
He also enclosed a copy of a warrant for the arrest of Mr Berezovsky signed by Yury Chaika , the Russian prosecutor general .
" A speedy resolution would help to improve , to develop , our relations even further , " he said .
" But absence of a reaction would have some impact on bilateral relations " and create a " new situation " .
The dispute could have a serious impact on bilateral relations , analysts said yesterday .
Moscow is at odds with Britain on many issues , including how best to curb Iran 's suspect nuclear programme and plans to grant Kosovo independence .
Tensions also surround British - backed western efforts to promote democratic institutions in countries of the post -Soviet " near abroad " such as Georgia and Ukraine , US - led plans for European missile defence , and Nato 's eastward expansion .
" The Russians are already causing trouble across the board .
This could just make them behave even worse , " one former official said .
But David Clark , a former Foreign Office adviser , said it would be a mistake to concentrate on possible Kremlin retaliation .
" The government is very worried about the impact of this dispute on bilateral relations - excessively so , " said Mr Clark .
" It would be a mistake to try to mollify the Kremlin instead of being honest and clear about the reasons why no British court is likely to support the extradition of its political opponents .
The reason is that there is , in current circumstances , little possibility of a fair trial . "
At the Home Office , sources confirmed yesterday that immigration officials were investigating whether Mr Berezovsky 's comments had broken UK laws and regulations and altered his refugee status .
Immigration law experts agreed that the Home Office may struggle to strip Mr Berezovsky of asylum status , granted under the 1951 UN refugee convention , unless they establish that he is " guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN " , as laid down by the convention .
Ministers believe they may be able to review his status if they consider his presence here is no longer conducive to the public good .
Although Mr Putin has said he would stand down when his second elected term comes to an end next year , as required by the constitution , Mr Berezovsky told the Guardian he believed the Russian president could be removed only by force .
" We need to use force to change this regime , " he said , in comments which appeared calculated to infuriate the Kremlin .
" It is n't possible to change this regime through democratic means .
There can be no change without force , pressure . "
He claimed to be in contact with like - minded people in the country 's ruling elite , offering financial assistance as well as " my understanding of how it could be done " .
When asked whether he was fomenting a revolution , he said : " You are absolutely correct . "
Mr Berezovsky added that he was confident his refugee status could not be revoked , and that his position was even stronger since the poisoning of his former employee Alexander Litvinenko .
He has consistently denied the charges laid against him in Russia and says they are politically motivated .
The 61 - year - old billionaire was in Israel last night , where he said he travelled on business .
He said he planned to return to the UK today , and had no comment on the diplomatic furore .
Mr Berezovsky made his estimated £ 850 m fortune during Russia 's 1990s rush to privatise , by capturing state assets at knockdown prices .
Two previous attempts to extradite him failed .
He was granted asylum in 2003 after claims by Litvinenko , a former Russian intelligence agent , that the Kremlin had ordered the tycoon 's murder .

Media Helmet is a bike helmet project which seeks to establish mediated information between the bicyclist and the surrounding world without distraction .
As a hands - free interface , the helmet " listens " to the audio , imagery , and motion of the environment .
Any past encounters with potholes , detours and the like are recalled by the helmet and audio reminders are given to the bicyclist as an obstacle nears .
The bicyclist can nod to turn on turn blinkers , and use voice commands to activate a horn .
The helmet can also make phone calls take dictation , play music and provide other desired information & data .
The helmet is designed to intrude slightly with unusual external information ; for example , it will tell you when a car is approaching .

Pixar - the iconic animation company that produced Toy Story , Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo - is marking its 20th anniversary .
But can digital cartoons ever have the same charm as hand - drawn characters ?
Let there be light .
Well , an anglepoise lamp to be precise .
It 's 20 years since Pixar , the mega - billion animation company , launched its first movie - a short film about a lamp with a life of its own , called Luxo Jr .
Along with iconic brands such as Google and the iPod , Pixar 's computer - generated movies have become part of the digital era - with the animation firm becoming one of Hollywood 's biggest players .
Marking its 20th anniversary is an exhibition at the Science Museum in London , which displays the art and the craft behind Toy Story , Bug 's Life , Monsters Inc , The Incredibles and the soon - to - be released , Cars .
This is a world of movies where the images are instantly - recognisable , but there are no stars .
If anyone was going to walk down a red carpet , it would have to be an anonymous army of artists , directors and software designers .
Or maybe it would be the industrial - scale " renderfarms " that provide the processing power for the computer - generated animations .
Digital Disney
Pixar 's big success was n't instant .
For the first decade the company had made its living from advertising , producing animations for products such as Listerine and Kellogg 's All Bran .
Finding Nemo : Pixar has grown from small fry to movie monster
But the big breakthrough came in 1995 with its first full - length movie - Toy Story .
This first ever fully computer - animated feature film was the biggest grossing movie of the year - earning $ 362 m ( £ 208 m ) worldwide .
Appropriately for an animation company , Pixar had impeccable timing .
Toy Story was launched when new computer power was convincing audiences that they should become more techno - friendly .
Just as Disney created the animations for the great age of cinema , Pixar has produced some of the iconic animations of the digital age .
The movies that followed were all runaway successes .
Monsters
Inc reached the $ 100 m box office benchmark quicker than any animated film in history .
But Pixar also discovered a goldmine in another side of the digital market - the arrival of DVDs - a format which showed off its crystal - clear animation to full effect .
Finding Nemo shifted eight million copies on its first day of release .
Artists not anoraks
The exhibition shows how much work is involved - with a single movie requiring the efforts of 230 people and a whole load of supercomputers for four years .
Pixar movies have turned DVDs into a digital goldmine
But not everyone is convinced that the quality of computer - generated animation matches hand - drawn films .
Richard Taylor , former head of animation at the Royal College of Art , says such films might be lucrative , but " something is filtered out " in the process .
" Computer animation has less direct appeal , less charm , it 's less humane - it lacks the roughness that nature gives . "
But Pixar 's creative boss , John Lasseter , says : " Computers do n't create computer animation any more than a pencil creates pencil animation .
What creates computer animation is the artist . "
And the exhibition shows the creative perspiration involved .
Before the computer animation process , artists will draw and paint up to 50,000 storyboards - and the exhibition includes examples of the so - called " colourscripts " which set the visual style and tone of the story .
Discarded toys
These are works of art in their own right - and reveal the attention to detail .
How would fur look in the snow ?
How do you re-create the precise texture of clothing ?
The exhibition has a zoetrope based on Toy Story characters ( Courtesy Science Museum )
There 's a cover of Good Fishkeeping magazine from Finding Nemo , with the cover - strap " Learn to say ' no ' to your fish . "
Would anyone have seen that as a micro-size glimpse in the movie ?
Probably not , but part of the success of Pixar has been its ability to work on different levels , showing something extra that you might glimpse in the corner of the screen .
For children , Monsters Inc is a story about getting scared at night and big blue furry monsters .
But for the adults , there 's another story about dead - end jobs , dodgy bosses and mistrusting strangers .
And Toy Story works for children as an adventure story about toys that come to life - while the grown - ups will be remembering the poignant stuff about the favourite toy that gets discarded and forgotten .
Osnat Shurer , in charge of Pixar 's short films , says the company 's strength has been based on retaining a creative rather than a corporate culture , and that in the long term " it pays off to over - deliver " .
And she says that rather than being driven by technology , the most important factor is the storytelling - and in that respect , Pixar has taken up the baton from Disney .
And it 's not about developing technology to be more " realistic " , she says .
" It 's about believability , not realism - about creating a universal story , with characters you can feel with , whether it's a car , a child or a toy . "
Finding pay day
As an example of this playfulness , the star attraction of the show is a " zoetrope " , which uses figures from Toy Story to show how static figures can be made to appear to move .
The Incredibles : characters evolve in drawings , sculpture and collages
It 's a really impressive exhibit , built for no purpose other than to entertain - and perhaps that 's what you do when you 've got billions in the bank and plenty of spare time .
But Pixar 's accountants must be enjoying the ride , because the company 's business relationships have given it a highly - influential strategic position for the next phase of the digital entertainment era .
Disney and Pixar are being spliced together in a £ 4bn deal .
And adding to this formidable media alliance is the presence of Pixar 's Steve Jobs - also the head of Apple computers , who is now the biggest single shareholder in Disney .
And Pixar short movies are now appearing for downloading on Apple 's iTunes - with every likelihood that full - length movies will eventually be sold through the same route .
Pixar movies straight to the iPod ?
Will that mean Pixar will be in our pockets , or will we be in theirs ?
Pixar : 20 Years of Animation .
Exhibition 1 April to 10 June , the Science Museum , Exhibition Road , London SW7 2DD .
My youngest son who is 18 months loves Toy Story and Toy Story 2 , it 's the only way we can get him to eat , he 's so entranced by the film , he does n't notice us putting food in his mouth .
My eldest son who is 11 now also loved the film when he was a younger .
It 's timeless .
Meg Hardy , Cardiff
I 'm sure that computer generated cartoons have just as much charm because my kids just love them .
I thought they would not be interested in seeing older hand drawn ones but they love them too .
I really notice the detail and very bright colours , I also like the fact elements for adults are always included in these pictures .
I think sometimes it's not appreciated how much is put into these computer animations - just as much as hand drawn , but in a different way .
Jackie , Maidstone
More so - look at the likes of Buzz and Woody , Nemo , Mike and Sully - the ability of the animators to make them appear so real brings them to life much more than before the technology was available .
The " old " characters are 2D by comparison - not that that 's the animotars ' fault - they work with what is available .
Had CGI been around then , rest assured they 'd be using it .
GDW , London
I agree , I think computer generated images are awful .
They look so cold .
Compare a modern computerised film with a classic 1950s Tom & Jerry .... the computer film does n't come anywhere near its forebear .
John Luty , Harrogate
Buzz and Woody are as iconic to today 's generation as Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry were to my parents ' and grandparents ' generations .
Like the former , they will still be giving inspiration to future film makers in 100 years time because they have warmth , depth and fallibilty .
Leigh , Reading
I 'm an animation student working with CG .
You absolutely can get all the feeling of hand - drawn in a computer - generated film , but they are different styles .
It 's like debating whether a painting or sculpture is more artistic .
People think computers do all the work and it 's completely false !
The computer is just a tool , like a pencil or blob of clay ; if the computer did the work , Pixar animators would produce more than two minutes of work a year !
Rikki , UK
Anyone who 's involved in the creative arts will tell you that working digitally is just as organic a process as working with ' traditional ' tools .
The output may look more clinical in some cases , but most of the charm is in the design itself and in the story / characterisation , not in the method of production .
Craig Grannell , Fleet
I 'm a huge fan of animation , but for me its all about hand drawn / painted and stop motion animation .
I thoroughly enjoy Pixar 's films , to me they are the exception for computer animation , as opposed to soulless offerings in the form of Madagascar and Shark Tail .
There is still a mindset in the public that 3D computer animated films mean a high quality piece of work , and I think that is being exploited by companies who rush out two or three films a year regardless of quality .
Jonny Horne , Farnborough
Pixar cartoons would work just as well , I feel , if they were drawn using nothing but stick - drawn characters .
Why ?
They have remembered something that Disney seems to have forgotten lately : get a good script .
I only hope that even though Disney now owns Pixar , they will not interfere with the creativity of the staff .
Stephen Buxton , Coventry
These types of CGI animated movies have rejuvenated a media which was slowly dying during the 1990s .
The new technique , along with a more multi- level style of storytelling , has given new life to the format .
Phil Saunders , Oxford
Exactly , it 's not the quality of the animation it's the story and character development , which is true of all media , not just animation .

BENN ON TERROR ….
Here ’s an interesting upcoming comment from a rising member of Britain ’s Labor Party :
President George W Bush ’s concept of a “ war on terror ” has given strength to terrorists by making them feel part of something bigger , Hilary Benn will say … .
And Mr Benn , a candidate for Labour ’s deputy leadership , will confirm that UK officials will stop using the term .
…. Mr Benn will say : “ In the UK , we do not use the phrase ‘ war on terror ’ because we can’t win by military means alone .
And because this is n’t us against one organised enemy with a clear identity and a coherent set of objectives . ”
…. ” What these groups want is to force their individual and narrow values on others , without dialogue , without debate , through violence .
And by letting them feel part of something bigger , we give them strength . ”
Nikolas Gvosdev , editor of the National Interest , a foreign - policy magazine affiliated with the Nixon Center in Washington , D.C. , has recently been trying to revitalize the stale discourse on U.S. global strategy in the capital of the world ’s only remaining superpower .
Gvosdev , whose magazine has been shaken up by post - Iraq - invasion ideological disputes ( leading to the departure from its editorial board of neoconservative Charles Krauthammer , as well as ex-neocon Francis Fukuyama ) , has been holding gatherings that bring together realist and internationalist critics of President George W. Bush ’s foreign - policy agenda to discuss alternative approaches to the Bush administration ’s neoconservative , hegemonic strategy .
In late September , the National Interest convened a meeting to consider " What a Post - Bush Foreign Policy Might Look Like . "
Gvosdev invited two foreign policy experts , one a Republican and one a Democrat , to predict how an administration of , say , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) or Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) would change U.S. global strategy , and in particular , whether they would reverse current policies .
The conventional wisdom in Washington is that a Republican president like McCain might embrace a " Bush lite " approach ( that ’s the best - case scenario  some say a Republican super - hawk would try to " out - neoconize " Bush ) , and a Democrat like Sen .
Clinton would adopt a more sensible and internationalist diplomacy , à la Bill Clinton .
To the surprise of some of those attending the National Interest event , it was the speaker representing the Democratic perspective , Will Marshall , president and founder of the Progressive Policy Institute , who ended up " out - neoconizing " Bush .
Republican Stefan Halper , former official in the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations and a fellow at the Center of International Studies at Cambridge University , presented a devastating critique of the foreign policy of Bush Jr .
That a Republican conservative was urging a more realistic and less interventionist foreign policy and a Democratic liberal was advocating a hegemonic global strategy aimed at strengthening America ’s military presence abroad as well as promoting " democracy " worldwide should not shock anyone familiar with the history of U.S. politics and foreign policy .
Indeed , as Halper has noted in a book he coauthored with Jonathan Clarke , America Alone : The Neoconservatives and the Global Order ( 04 ) , many of the neoconservatives who joined the Republican Party at the height of the Cold War had been hawkish liberal Democrats critical of their party for " abandoning " the interventionist and militarized policies pursued by Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman , and Lyndon Johnson and for adopting an " isolationist " agenda .
The neoconservatives accused George McGovern and his supporters of " hijacking " the Democratic Party ’s foreign policy and " appeasing " the Soviet bloc .
Yet the neoconservatives were also very critical of the Realpolitik approach pursued by the Nixon - Kissinger team that created the conditions for détente and arms - control agreements with the Soviets and the opening toward China .
And moreover , even under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush  when such figures as Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz , and I .
Lewis Libby served in top foreign and defense policy jobs  neoconservatives opposed policies that they considered contrary to their staunchly pro-Israel ideas .
Such policies included Reagan ’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Lebanon and Bush Sr. ’s pressure on Israel to end its settlement policies and negotiate with the Palestinians .
The foreign policy principles espoused by neoconservatives  unilateralist military intervention aimed at establishing U.S. global hegemony , a messianic Wilsonian agenda of spreading democracy worldwide , and a radical pro-Likud , Zionist stance  run very contrary to the cautious pursuit of U.S. interests traditionally reflected by conservative and realist Republican foreign policy .
Republican and conservative critics of the neoconservatives felt the need to reassess their " union " with the neoconservatives , which had made sense during the ideological and strategic conflicts with the Communists during the Cold War , but whose impact on U.S. foreign policy , the Republican Party , and the conservative movement proved to be disastrous after 9/11 .
Critics like Halper argue that neoconservatives seized the Republican Party ’s diplomatic and national security agenda after 9/11 and persuaded Bush and his advisers to adopt their approach in the Middle East as part of an effort to establish U.S. hegemony and American - style democracy in the region , while also trying to advance Israel ’s interests there .
But if anything , the Iraq misadventure has demonstrated the " limitations of American power , " as Halper put it during his presentation .
" Reality has been a harsh teacher , " and is leading the American elites and public  including Republicans  to recognize that although the United States may have the world ’s strongest , most technologically advanced military , it cannot be effectively used to " export American values " to the Middle East and elsewhere , Halper said .
But at the same time as realists and conservatives in the Republican Party are hoping to challenge the dominance of the neoconservatives over their party ’s foreign policy , many leading Democratic activists and liberal intellectuals seem to be calling on their party to embrace an even more " pure " or radical version of the neoconservative ideology .
Indeed , during his presentation at the National Interest event , Marshall insisted that his party does not and would not advance antiwar sentiment or hopes for military disengagement .
" Our party needs to show it can take on the job of defeating Islamic extremists if we want to win the next election , " said Marshall , editor of the recent book With All our Might : A Progressive Strategy for Defeating Jihad and Defending Liberty .
" We need to fight for liberal principles abroad as vigorously as we fight for them at home , " he said .
He stressed that Democrats " should n’t abandon democracy as a goal . "
Criticizing the Bush administration for declining to expand the military it relies on as a major policy instrument , Marshall proposed that a Democratic administration would grow the American military by 40,000 troops to better meet the demands of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Not everyone liked this idea ; in response to Marshall ’s comments , one participant responded : " If the first item on the Democrats ’ plan for foreign policy is making the military bigger , color me Republican . "
Although Marshall ’s views may have sounded like an echo of the neoconservative agenda , they should not be considered a minority stance of the political and intellectual Democratic elites .
Much attention has been paid to the antiwar bloggers and other Democratic Party rank - and - file activists who helped torpedo Sen.
Joe Lieberman ‘s ( D - Conn . )
Senate nomination as the party candidate .
Yet many of Lieberman ’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate and the House not only backed the resolution giving Bush a green light to invade Iraq , but also continue to oppose any congressional plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq .
Many of the same Democrats have backed Bush ’s inflexible approach toward Iran  in some cases sounding tougher than the Republicans on the issue  as well as the White House ’s firm defense of Israel ’s recent military operations in Lebanon and Palestine .
Moreover , as New York University historian Tony Judt pointed out recently , many hawkish liberal intellectuals and policy analysts who have ties to the Democratic leadership and are affiliated with newspapers and magazines such as the New York Times , Washington Post , New Republic , and the New Yorker and with think tanks like the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , have acquiesced to Bush ’s foreign policy agenda ( see " Bush ’s Useful Idiots : Tony Judt on the Strange Death of Liberal America , " London Review of Books , Sept. 21 , 2006 ) .
Not unlike Marshall , they seem to be promoting the idea that the Democrats need to adopt the ambitious neoconservative creed while trying to " improve " it by making it more marketable and workable .
They seem to suggest that the neoconservative doctrine was fine  it ’s just that the Republicans lacked the talent and the imagination to turn it into a success .
In some respects , the liberal hawks tend to share more of an ideological affinity with the Wilsonian elements in the neoconservative agenda than with some of the more nationalist hawks , like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , who seem more preoccupied with the need to maintain U.S. geostrategic hegemony .
" For what distinguishes the worldview of Bush ’s liberal supporters from that of his neoconservative allies is that they do n’t look on the ‘ War on Terror , ’ or the war in Iraq , or the war in Lebanon and eventually Iran , as mere serial exercises in the re-establishment of American martial dominance , " Judt argues .
" They see them as skirmishes in a new global confrontation : a Good Fight , reassuringly comparable to their grandparents ’ war against fascism and their Cold War liberal parents ’ stance against international communism .
Long nostalgic for the comforting verities of a simpler time , today ’s liberal intellectuals have at last discovered a sense of purpose :
They are at war with ‘ Islamo - fascism . ’ "
Among some of these liberal hawks , Judt mentions Paul Berman , Christopher Hitchens , and Peter Beinart , whose views on Iraq , the Middle East , and U.S. foreign policy in general seem to be very similar to those of neoconservatives William Kristol , Robert Kagan , and Lawrence Kaplan .
While liberal hawks like Tom Friedman have been critical of Bush ’s Iraq policy , much of their disapproval has been directed at the management of the war and the occupation of Iraq , not of the underlying justification of the administration ’s hegemonic Wilsonian project in the Middle East .
Another contingency of liberal hawks occupies positions of influence in Washington think tanks , including the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution , where such scholar - practitioners as former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk and Kenneth Pollack have been cheerleaders for the Iraq War and have approved of Bush ’s policies on Iran and Israel .
In fact , one does not have to be a veteran political observer to predict Indyk , Pollack , and other experts on the Middle East , like former peace negotiator Dennis Ross , would probably play a major role in influencing the policy of a future Democratic administration .
In that case , the Democratic Party activists who rallied against Joe Lieberman should not be surprised if Bush ’s Democratic successor ends up pursuing policies that might be described as neoconservatism with a smiling Democratic face .

The Province says that because Oprah told Sarah Jessica Parker that she does n’t wear perfume , SJP then turns around and makes a ‘ Lovely ’ scented body butter called O So Rich Body Butter to be released in September .
That is going to be followed up a month later with Lovely Liquid Satin – a silicone - laced liquid that is smooth as silk on the skin .
“ I wanted to make Liquid Satin a real sensory experience when you slip it on , ” says Parker .
I guess she should get kudos for doing something different with fragrance .
Just like her ‘ different ’ July 06 Good Housekeeping cover ( pictured right ) .
It is so different from Carrie in SATC its hilarious .

As some feel that LtU is too math bound , there 's only one solution for us underachievers - a Theoretical Computer Science Cheat Sheet .
( Most of it is vaguely familiar , as I 've taken a lot of math courses over the years .
Sadly though I 'd need a much longer set of crib notes to jog my memory .
Personally I think most CS based math is really simple , but it also is quite terse - much like many PLs . )
There is a secret war going on in the personal finance blogosphere .
No one talks about it openly , but it the battles break out everywhere .
No blog post is safe !
No blog post about “ Debt Snowballing , ” anyway .
If you do n’t know the Debt Snowball Theory , it goes like this : in order to pay off all your debts , you rank them all up .
You make the minimum payments on all of them each month , and you throw every extra cent you have at the debt ranked highest , until it ’s paid off .
Then , you “ snowball ” your payments for that debt into the next highest ranked debt , and continue on down the line .
The war is over how these debts should be ranked .
There are two theories , each with valid points , which is why the war will never end .
Theory # 1 : High Interest – Rank your debts by interest rate , highest to lowest , and pay off the highest interest rate debts first .
Pro : Math - wise , this one wins .
You ’ll spend less money over time on interest this way .
Con :
Your highest interest debts may also be your highest balances , meaning it might be a long time before you actually pay off that first debt .
This can discourage some people , making them give up before they even pay off the first debt .
Theory # 2 : Low Balance ( The Dave Ramsey Theory ) – Rank your debts by balance , lowest to highest , and pay off the lowest balance debts first .
Pro :
It wo n’t be long before your first debt is paid off , giving you an awesome sense of accomplishment , and encouraging you to continue on .
Con : Math wise , you lose , because you ’ll probably pay more in interest this way .
Of course you want to know where I stand in this war .
Look , people , I ’m a math girl .
I love numbers and data .
So I ’m in the “ High Interest ” army .
But I certainly recognize the benefits of the “ other side , ” and I ’m not going to knock anyone for going that way .
In fact , if I had a really low balance debt , I ’d probably pay it off first as well , to get it off my mind .
Theory # 3 : The Annoyance Ranking
I promised you an alternate theory , and here it is :
Rank your debts in the order that they annoy you to have to pay , from “ most annoying ” to “ least annoying , ” and pay off the annoying ones first .
The idea is that when the bills come , there are some bills that make you groan and moan more than others .
Let ’s take The Boyfriend for example .
He has two debts : his car loan , and his credit card debt .
The Boyfriend loves his car to pieces , and does n’t really mind making his loan payments every month .
But his credit card ?
He hates it with a fiery passion .
He curses it while shaking his fist up at the sky .
Basically , his credit card debt annoys the crap out of him .
So , accord to my Annoyance Debt Snowball Plan , he should pay that one off first .
Why is this a good plan ?
Because , like the “ Low Balance ” theory , it plays to your human psychology .
The top debts are making you more unhappy than the bottom debts , so pay them off first .
Also , since you ’re more likely to be annoyed by high interest debts than low interest debts , it takes the “ High Interest ” theory into account as well .
This theory is also good for when you have personal debts , especially family debts .
These debts may be low balance and low interest , which would normally rank low in a debt snowball .
But you probably feel a large amount of guilt over these debts , which would make them annoying .
Putting them at the top of the ranking , and paying them first , will help improve your family relations , and perhaps prevent you from being shot in both kneecaps and lit on fire .
Pros :
Be rid of debts that make you unhappy .
Math usually works since high interest debts are more likely to be more annoying .
Con : Math might not work , may end up paying more interest .
Feel free to add more “ pros and cons ” in the comments if you think of any !
A recently discovered class of immune cell may hold the key to new treatments for asthma – and explain why existing therapies sometimes fail .
Asthma occurs when immune cells go into overdrive and release inflammatory chemicals called cytokines .
These cause excess production of mucus , which plugs up the lungs .
The disease is generally associated with immune cells called T - helper 2 ( TH2 ) cells and the cytokines they release , but their response alone is not enough to trigger asthma .
Natural killer T ( NKT ) cells produce some of the same cytokines as TH2s , but release them faster and in greater quantities ( see Diagram ) . …
DIGG THIS
This talk was delivered at the Wisconsin Forum in Milwaukee on May 1 , 2007 .
Ludwig von Mises said that the great accomplishment of economists was to draw attention to the extreme limits on the power of government .
His point was not merely that government should be limited , but that it is limited by the very structure of reality .
It can not make all people rich by its own initiative .
It cannot provide universal housing , literacy , and health .
It can not raise wages across the board .
It can not ban products .
Those who seek to accomplish economic ends such as these are choosing the wrong means .
That is because there is something more powerful than government : namely economic law .
And what is economic law ?
It is a force that operates within the structure of all societies everywhere that governs the production and allocation of material resources and time according to strict bounds of what is possible .
Some things are just not possible .
It just so happens that this includes most of the demands that are made by the public and pressure groups on the government .
This was the great discovery of the modern science of economics .
This was not known by the ancients .
It was not known by the fathers of the early church .
It was the discovery of the medieval schoolmen , and the insight was gradually elaborated upon and systematized over the centuries , culminating in the classical and Austrian traditions of thought .
The power of government to do what we desire is strictly limited .
Those who do not understand this point do not understand economics .
And the economic teaching has a broader implication that concerns the organization of society itself .
Government is not free to make and unmake society as it sees fit .
It is not a tool we can use to fulfill our private dreams .
Society is too complicated , too far reaching , too much a reflection of the free volition of individual actors , for government to be able to accomplish its ends .
Most often , what government attempts to do — whether abolish poverty , end liquor consumption , or make all citizens literate and healthy — ends up backfiring and generating the exact opposite .
With this background , I would like to discuss the broad topic of the war on terror .
Terrorism is not something that any of us likes .
We would all like to see a world without violence and bloodshed .
This hardly distinguishes our generation from any that preceded .
What is unique about our moment is that we live under a regime that has come to believe that the government itself can produce this result for us if we only give the government enough power , money , and managerial discretion to accomplish this goal .
We associate this view with the political right .
This might be something of a misnomer since the right was very much against the wars of the 1990s .
It was the right that made the case against nation building , and it was Bush who earned the support of the American middle class by promising a humble foreign policy .
It was the conviction back then that Clinton ’s wars had been waged at the expense of the life and liberty of Americans here and abroad , and had failed to accomplish their ends .
A similar critique of left - wing wars was offered by the right in the interwar period .
It was clear that World War I had diminished American liberty , regimented the economy , inflated the money , slaughtered many people , and failed to accomplish its goal of bringing about self - determination for all peoples of the world .
The right applied its political logic of the need for freedom at home to issues of foreign policy .
Small government and non-intervention applied to domestic as well as foreign affairs , for reasons both practical and moral .
The left , in contrast , saw war as yet another application of the principle that government can accomplish great things for us , and they saw how war provides the great pretext for expanding the power of the state to do these things .
But these days , the political roles have changed .
The left is the major voice criticizing the war on terror , while the right , much to my dismay , has enlisted in ways I could not have imagined back in the 1990s .
The right has led the call for war abroad , and called for speech controls , domestic spying , and more power to the president to arrest , jail , and even convict people in military courts without the slightest concern for human rights and liberties .
Countless times
I ’ve had to explain to people who otherwise are suspicious of government that it is not a good thing to give the US government the power to overthrow any government in the world or torture people abroad or pass out trillions in reconstruction aid .
When the left makes a case for total government management at home and yet nonintervention abroad , while the right argues for free markets at home and a global war on terror abroad , there is some sort of political schizophrenia alive in the land .
People who have doubted the power of government to do much at home seem to take leave of their senses when it comes to war abroad .
And it is hardly a surprise that they have been proven wrong .
Four years ago , Bill O’Reilly said : “ I will bet you the best dinner in the gas - light district of San Diego that military action will not last more than a week . ”
Tony Snow said : “ The three week swing through Iraq has utterly shattered skeptic ’s complaints . ”
Morton Kondrake said : “ All the naysayers have been humiliated so far …the final word on this is , hooray . ”
Fred Barnes said : “ The war was the hard part … and it gets easier . ”
Well , it has n’t gotten easier .
Bush says that we should stay in Iraq as long as necessary .
A poll that came out today says that only 23 percent of soldiers in Iraq agree with him .
Seventy - two percent say that the US should leave completely within a year .
Nearly a third say that all troops should leave immediately .
When the troops themselves are willing to tell pollsters this sort of thing , a war is completely doomed .
War supporters at home are starting to see the light .
Let me read to you a note I received this morning .
Dear Lew ,
Some years ago , I wrote to you as a supporter of the Bush war on terrorism .
You reminded me , in a response which now escapes me , that the war was in essence a mistake .
I remember being disappointed at the time with your response , what with 9/11 and alI .
I joined the throng of Conservative lemmings who were following our leader over the edge of the cliff in large measure because I had voted for him in the previous election and I was willing to believe his pronouncements regarding the need for war .
I suppose you could say that I trusted him to tell us the truth , as naive as that may sound for a person who is supposed to be a Conservative .
I now must admit to you that I was wrong and you were right .
Without going into too much detail , I have come to see that UN mandates , lack of conclusive proof of WMD ’s and generally poor intelligence about the Iraqi regime as well as the specious arguments of Saddam ’s Al Qaida connections were all more or less used to cover our invasion of that country and at the price of so many fine soldiers and marines .
And what did we get in exchange for our blood and treasure ?
I wonder .
A couple of years ago I found one of my grandfather ’s books , Three Soldiers by John Dos Passos .
Within the cover I found where he had inscribed the phrase “ To Hell with all wars . ”
Papa had served in the Army during the Great War and was an eyewitness to its horrors .
My grandfather taught me much about the world and gave me my conservative viewpoint .
That discovery combined with my observations of the current scene caused me to re-evaluate my acceptance of this conflict .
Not that I have become , as it were , a pacifist ; but I have re-examined the history of our republic and have come to the conclusion that we should fight only in national self - defense and certainly not without a real congressional declaration as spelled out in our Constitution .
It is very difficult to die for a lie , knowing it to be such .
Such notes no longer surprise me .
The feeling is widespread .
The lie noted in this letter concerns the supposition about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction .
But that is not the most egregious lie .
The worst lie is the big one : that government can accomplish wonderful things if we give it enough power , money , and discretion .
No matter how many times we hear it , or in what context , it is always and everywhere a lie .
A leader who says this is the equivalent of the snake in the garden who promises that glorious knowledge comes with just one bite of fruit .
And yet we as a people keep being lured into accepting it .
The debates about the war on terror have typically involved great detail about the validity of intelligence reports , investigations of terror networks , discussion of the reliability of this or that foreign regime , and the like .
But none of this is really necessary if you want to make a sound judgment about whether to support the war in question .
What we really need is more general knowledge about the nature of government and its limits .
If we understand how it will lose the small wars against things such as cigarettes and liquor , we can more clearly understand how it loses the large wars .
The attempt to ban liquor led to a vast increase in liquor distribution and consumption through black - market means .
The campaign to wage a war on poverty resulted in more poverty .
The war on illiteracy has created generations of illiterates .
The wars on cigarettes and drugs have been spectacularly unsuccessful , and for proof you need look no further than prison , an environment that government fully controls and which is predictably swimming in cigarettes and drugs of all sorts .
There are some things that a state just cannot do , no matter how much power it accumulates or employs .
I ’m sorry to tell this to the American left , but the war on warm weather is not going to be any more successful than any other of these wars .
And I ’m sorry to tell this to the American right , but there is no way that the American government can kill every person on the planet who resents US imperialism .
The attempt to do so will generate more , not less , terrorism .
We are now more than half a decade into this war on terror .
The State Department now says , based on its own data , that the results of the war are “ mixed . ”
In government parlance , the admission of mixed results means , in regular language , total failure .
The number of terror - related incidents increased 28.5 percent from 11,153 in 2005 to 14,338 in 2006 .
The number of people killed in terror - related incidents went from 14,618 in 2005 to 20,498 last year .
Most occurred in Iraq but the number in Afghanistan also nearly doubled from 491 to 749 .
The number of children killed in bombings has increased 80 percent to 700 killed kids and 1,100 wounded .
Let us compare to the year 2001 , when the war on terror really got going .
Including the New York and Washington attacks , there were a total of 531 attacks , with a total dead of 3,572 dead and 2,283 wounded .
The number of attacks went down slightly in 2002 , a fact which the government trumpeted as proof that the war was working .
But this link between cause and effect was quickly deleted .
By the next year , the problem began to grow steadily worse , with 208 attacks and 625 people dead and 3,646 wounded .
In 2004 , the number of incidents shot through the roof to 3,259 and it suddenly became far more difficult to obtain the data .
The old reports that had made it crystal clear became totally reformatted and replete with propaganda instead of facts .
The number tripled the next year , but the data on this was nearly impossible to find .
Gone was the rhetoric from 2002 about the great success .
It was replaced with frenzied attacks on ever - increasing numbers of terror groups .
Instead of 10 or 20 , there were hundreds and hundreds of them taking the lives of ever more people .
Incredibly , the State Department decided to not make public the 2005 figures since attacks rose yet again .
Officials had to be hauled before a Congressional committee before they would give any specifics .
Now they ca n’t get away with hiding the numbers but you still have to look very hard to find them .
The bottom line is that since the war on terror began , the incidents that qualify as terrorism have increased by an incredible 26 times .
For every one incident in 2001 , there are now 26 incidents .
For every person killed by terrorism in 2002 , 23 people were killed in 2006 .
Meanwhile , the polls reflect the perception that the world is more , not less , dangerous since the war on terror began .
Indeed , among those polled , 81 % now believe that the world is becoming more dangerous .
Are we going to call this a job well done ?
It depends on what you call a good job .
It fits precisely with what we might expect government to do : its wars always and everywhere make the problem worse , and not better .
Now let us consider spending .
According to Portfolio.com , the combined cost of the Iraq war ( Operation Iraqi Freedom , in Pentagon jargon ) and its companions , Operation Enduring Freedom , in Afghanistan , and the Global War on Terror , could easily top $ 600 billion this year .
But the overall cost is even higher , exceeding perhaps $ 2 trillion .
The annual congressional appropriations for the wars — averaging $ 127 billion — are bigger than the global markets for soap , heroin , or gambling .
And the spending is growing .
Monthly spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan averaged $ 6.8 billion in 2006 .
That figure is now closer to $ 8 billion a month .
Portfolio adds : “ At that rate of burn , General Electric ’s value would be wiped out in three and a half years , Bill Gates ’ personal fortune would evaporate in just seven months , and the troubled Ford Motor Co. would cease to exist in a matter of weeks .
If you think of the wars as a giant impulse buy using an unlimited credit card , then paying it off would require coming up with enough cash to match the G.D.P. of three Irelands or about 11 Kuwaits or the Netherlands — but only if you throw in Sri Lanka . ”
Before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , Colin Powell warned President Bush that if you break it , you buy it .
At last count , we ’ve bought the equivalent of 10 Iraqs with your tax dollars .
But instead of buying 10 , the money has gone to completely destroying one country .
But surely this money is going to more than just war .
What about the effort to rebuild Iraq ’s infrastructure ?
Well , if you know anything about government building projects , you know there is not a record of success .
Pick any Section - 8 housing project anywhere in the country and you will find a long record of mismanagement , misallocation , and waste .
So it is in Iraq .
These reconstruction projects that war supporters have heralded have amounted to little or nothing .
At the Baghdad airport , for example , your tax dollars paid for $ 11.8 million in new electrical generators .
But $ 8.6 million worth of them are no longer functioning .
The problems with generators in Baghdad are legendary : low oil , broken fuel lines , missing batteries , and the like .
The water purification system for the city is no longer working .
At the maternity hospital in Erbil , an incinerator for medical waste was padlocked and officials can’t find the key .
So syringes , bandages , and drug vials are clogging the sewage system and contaminating the water .
Now , how did we get all this information ?
A federal oversight agency went to inspect a sample of eight projects that US officials in Iraq had declared to be a success .
Of these eight successes , seven of them were not actually functioning at all due to plumbing and electrical failure , poor maintenance , looting , and just general neglect .
Keep in mind that these are the projects that the US government declared successes !
The failures must be abysmal beyond belief .
So too with myriad state programs , among which is the Global War on Terror .
There is no standard by which it can be considered a success .
But as we know , data only get you so far .
If you ask the people who the establishment considers to be experts in terrorism , they are united in one belief : we are n’t spending enough money on the effort .
Every agency needs more power and money , they say .
The reason for the failure is a lack of resources .
If we would just fork over more , all will be well .
It is precisely this rationale that led socialism in Russia to last 70 years and drive the entire country into the ground .
Those of us who watched this calamity from a distance were astonished that a failure could last so long .
Ca n’t the government look around and see what a disaster they have created ?
Ca n’t they see that while their people were lining up blocks for a scrap of bread and dying at the age of 60 , ours were shopping in massive department stores and living to 70 and 75 ?
Why is n’t it obvious what a failure socialism has been ?
Well , one thing is clear in the social sciences : nothing is obvious to the experts .
The reason has to do with their perception of cause and effect .
The supporters of socialism always believed that more money and better management would take care of the problem .
Every failure was caused by something outside of the system that a perfection of the management system would correct .
So it is with the war on terror .
All the experts counsel more spending and power .
It never occurs to them that the war itself is the problem .
All problems are blamed on some other factor : sectarianism , outside interference , a demagogic new leader , poor management , or what have you .
The excuses can be manufactured without end .
And then there is the overwhelming factor that the war on terror can only be considered a failure from the point of view of the stated aims .
It is not a failure for those who directly benefit from the increased funding and power .
And it is an indisputable fact that the government has benefited massively from the war on terror .
It is essential that we look at this war in light of history .
At the end of World War II , the government and its elites were quite desperate for a massive global cause to keeping spending high and the government in control .
Communism was picked , and so our former allies in the war became our sworn enemies .
Ten years ago , with communism gone , the American warmongers had little to do , other than intervene in small skirmishes .
Finally they hit on a great idea : demonize Islamic radicalism .
Here is a nation without borders that is terrifying to the American people , just like communism .
Despite all the appearance of sadness and anger after 9 - 11 , the elites also understood that it meant the continuation of the old war apparatus .
And for that , they were not entirely regretful .
At last there was a pretext for war preparedness and war itself that rivaled the old communist threat .
So off we went into this structure .
There has been no shortage of rhetoric .
No expense is spared on arms escalation .
There is no lack of will .
The effort has the support of plenty of smart people .
It is backed by threats of massive bloodshed .
What is missing in the war on terror is the essential means to cause the war to yield beneficial results .
Of all the billions of potential terrorists out there , and the infinite possibilities of how , when , and where they will strike , there is no way the state can possibly stop them , even if it had the incentive to do so .
Behind terrorism is political grievance .
This is not speculation .
This is the word of the terrorists themselves , from Timothy McVeigh to Osama Bin Laden to innumerable suicide bombers .
They are not acting randomly .
They have goals .
The goal is , first , get the US government and its troops out .
And if history teaches us anything it is that no country wants to be ruled by a foreign power , whether that foreign occupation takes the form of colonialism or outright military dictatorship .
People would rather run a country badly than have it run well from the outside .
No one should understand this better than the American people , whose country was born in a revolt against foreign rule .
The second goal of the terrorists is to gain access to the levers of power .
In many cases , the US created these , such as in Afghanistan and Iraq .
We insist that there must be a single governing power .
Then we are surprised when groups appear that are determined to control it .
It would have been much better for everyone in Iraq and Afghanistan to have left them without states at all .
The longer we continue in the failures of our war on terror , the more problems that we generate .
The pool of actual terrorists ( like the poor in the War on Poverty ) is limited and can be known , and they are the ones the state focuses on .
But the pool of potential terrorists ( and potential poor people ) is unlimited , and unleashed by the very means the state employs in its war .
Hence , not only does the state not accomplish its stated goals , it recruits more people into the armies of the enemy , and ends up completely swamped by a problem that grows ever worse until the state throws in the towel .
In the meantime , the target population is able to make a mockery of the state through sheer defiance .
The means of conducting war has all the features and failings of every form of central planning .
There is an overutilization of resources , and , when the results are the very opposite of the promise , they overutilize some more resources .
They do not account for the possibility of error , even though error is more common than anything .
Rather than admit error , the war planners shift the blame .
The war planners do not account for basic traits of human nature , such as the will to resist .
They assume that the world is theirs for the making and never confront the fact that there are forces beyond their control .
The people who planned the war on Iraq dismissed suggestions that perhaps not everyone in Iraq is going to be overjoyed at the prospect of gaining freedom through bombing , destruction , and martial law administered by a US military dictatorship or a puppet regime .
But ca n’t the state just kill more , employ ever more violence , perhaps even terrify the enemy into passivity ?
It can not work .
Even prisons experience rioting .
The theorist who first saw the collapse of the ideology of the nation - state , Israeli historian Martin van Creveld , was asked about this in an interview for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation .
He was refreshingly blunt : “ The Americans in Vietnam tried it .
They killed between two - and - a - half and three million Vietnamese .
I do n’t see that it helped them much . ”
Without admitting defeat , the Americans finally pulled out of Vietnam , which today has a thriving stock market .
To a notable extent , the war on poverty has ended its most aggressive phases and poverty is declining .
What does this experience tell us about the War on Terror ?
The right approach to this program , as to all government programs , is to end it immediately .
But would n’t that mean surrender ?
It would mean that the state surrenders its role but not that everyone else does .
Had the airlines been in charge of their own security , 9 - 11 would not have happened .
Bin Laden would have a hard time gaining recruits .
Muslim fundamentalism would be dealt a serious blow , for no longer would US policy seem specifically designed to feed the madness of its lunatic fringe .
In all the talk of war on Iraq , I ’ve yet to hear anyone recently claim that taking out Saddam or bringing about a regime change made the world a more peaceful , happier place .
No one really believes that .
The 1990 war on Iraq gave rise to al - Qaeda , led to the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building , and emboldened an entire generation of Muslims to devote their lives to fighting America .
The new war in Iraq has done the same .
And where did these fanatics come from in the first place ?
They were subsidized in the 1980s by US policy .
We believed that they were good guys because they were fighting communism .
Some of the same groups that we are now bombing in Afghanistan and Iraq we were wining and dining in the 1980s in the pursuit of the Cold War .
Thus has one bad intervention led to another , precisely in the way that Mises spelled out in his 1929 book Critique of Interventionism .
He explained that interventionism is not a stable policy .
It creates imbalances that cry out for correction , either by abandoning the policy or pursuing it further to the point of collapse .
For this reason , the War on Terror is impossible , not in the sense that it cannot cause immense amounts of bloodshed and destruction and loss of liberty , but in the sense that it cannot finally achieve what it is supposed to achieve , and will only end in creating more of the same conditions that led to its declaration in the first place .
In other words , it is a typical government program , costly and unworkable , like socialism , like the War on Poverty , like every other attempt by the government to shape reality according to its own designs .
Now let us look at the flipside of the impossibility thesis .
If government wars are impossible , what is possible ?
The answer was provided by the old liberal school : freedom .
Society contains within itself the capacity to self - organize .
There is nothing that government can do to produce a better result .
This is true in domestic and foreign policy .
“ The idea of liberalism starts with the freedom of the individual , ” Mises wrote .
“ It rejects all rule of some persons over others ; it knows no master peoples and no subject peoples , just as within the nation itself it distinguishes between no masters and no serfs . "
The war on Iraq has enjoyed some measure of public support based on the desire for revenge .
Even though Saddam had nothing to do with 9 - 11 , people wanted someone to suffer .
What we tend to forget is that this is an old motive for war , and it can lead to calamity .
World War I had ended with many resentments stewing and the old longing for empire had not entirely gone away .
Germany in particular was ripe for bamboozlement by a leader who could tap into the resentment concerning lost territories .
The leader would convince the people that the urge for justice can only be satisfied by re-creating an empire , and only the strongest possible leader could manage to accomplish this against all odds .
Mises wrote with an impassioned desire to stop the course of events .
“ It would be the most terrible misfortune for Germany and for all humanity if the idea of revenge should dominate the German policy of the future , ” he wrote .
“ To become free of the fetters that have been forced upon German development by the peace of Versailles , to free our fellow nationals from servitude and need , that alone should be the goal of the new German policy .
To retaliate for wrong suffered , to take revenge and to punish , does satisfy lower instincts , but in politics the avenger harms himself no less than the enemy .
What would he gain from quenching his thirst for revenge at the cost of his own welfare ? ”
Americans have a deep - rooted attachment to the ideal of liberty , which is a glorious thing .
But it is also why American leaders have always justified foreign wars in the name of liberating the oppressed people of the world .
The mistake is thinking that freedom can be achieved by means of force .
The Cold War originated with the idea that the US should do whatever was necessary to roll back the very Soviet client states that the US worked to establish at the end of World War II .
Then the US pursued a series of wars in far - flung places that cost lives and liberty and did nothing to stop the spread of communism .
The more implausible the imperial war , the more a variety of rationales becomes necessary .
Iraq has been justified on grounds of security , safety , religion , vengeance , and economics , each rationale carefully tailored to appeal to a certain demographic group .
All that is necessary is that the state convinces a slight majority , however temporarily .
What must a person forget in order to believe in the unity of interest between US foreign policy and the American people ?
They must forget that the US was born in revolt against not only the British Empire but also the very idea of empire itself .
They must forget that the only way the US Constitution was adopted was the promise that it would not act imperialistically at home or abroad .
They must forget the warnings of George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and many presidents of the 19th century .
They must forget about the history of failure of our own imperial wars in the 20th century , in which guerilla armies have consistently beat back our regular troops .
To believe in the war on terror is to adopt a posture that forgets everything that is truly American : our history , our belief in human rights , our hatred of despotism , our opposition to international meddling .
The US has no business attempting to run a war that involves the entire world and the whole human race , and certainly we ca n’t be surprised when those we rule call us the evil empire .
Americans are all rebels in our hearts .
Anyone who longs for freedom must be .
Empire is contrary to the American ethos .
The American people have made exceptions in this century .
But there is no threat on the world scene to our families and property greater than that posed by the U.S. government itself .
I ’m often asked what an average person can do to stop the madness and further liberty .
The first and most important step is intellectual .
We all need to begin to say no to the state on an intellectual level .
When you are asked what you would like the government to do for you , we need to be prepared to reply : nothing .
We should not ask it to save our children , nor provide security , nor vanquish all evil , nor give us anything at all .
We should not ask government to win a war on terror , end poverty , make everyone healthy and literate , provide for us when we are old , or anything else .
Nothing the government does takes place without a greater cost than benefit to society .
Knowing this , we can still be good citizens .
We can be good parents , teachers , workers , entrepreneurs , church members , students , and contributors to society in a million different ways .
This is far more important to the future of liberty than anything else we do .
We must regain our confidence in our capacity for self - governance .
I believe this is happening already .
The government ’s wars will continue to fail , and I do not think that we should regret this .
Even if the public sector cannot and will not prepare for a future of liberty , we can .
Let us look for and work toward the triumph of liberty unencumbered by leviathan and its wars .

Moreutils contains a suite of utilities for command - line users .
Written by multiple authors , they are individually quite modest , and perhaps too limited in scope to exist in a package in their own right , but together they form a useful accompaniment to existing command - line tools .
Following are a few examples of the utilities in moreutils , and how they can be used .
Sponge - Soaking file redirects
Many users of the command line have made a mistake such as the following :
$ grep -v someuser /etc / passwd >
/etc/passwd
As the shell runs this command it will immediately truncate the destination file , and then run the grep command on it .
The end result is an empty file - certainly not what was intended !
After learning from their mistake , the user might instead redirect the output to a temporary file , then move the file on top of the original :
$ grep -v someuser /etc / passwd >
/etc/passwd.tmp
$ mv /etc/passwd.tmp
/etc / passwd
Sponge is a simple , but convenient , command that exists to roll this process up into a single step :
$ grep -v someuser / etc / passwd | sponge /etc / passwd
Sponge ’ soaks up ’ its standard input , waiting for it to complete before writing to the specified output file .
In this way the result is what was intended , and without the need to fiddle with temporary files .
Vipe - Interactively editing pipes
Sometimes it is desirable to put yourself in the middle of a pipe processing chain , where it will be quicker to just edit the pipe content , rather than create complex filters with sed and friends .
Maybe the pipe content will be unknown , perhaps a list of files that the user would like to manually filter .
Say that you would like to touch all files in the current directory , but would like to do so selectively , you could do the following :
ls | vipe | xargs -d ‘
’ touch
In this example a list of files is opened up in your editor ( as set by either the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables ) , in which you may edit the list of files to be touched at your leisure .
When you are satisfied , you can save the file and quit your editor , and vipe will regurgitate the content you edited to its standard - out - touching only the files retained in the editor .
Combine - Boolean / Set operations with text files
Performing set operations with lines in two text files can also be useful .
This can be useful in knowing what file names are common to two directories , for example :
Directory foo contains the files : tom and harry Directory bar contains the files : tom and dick
The file lists can be written to two files ready for use with combine with the following bash command :
ls / path / to / foo > foo_list && ls / path / to / bar > bar_list
It can be complicated to find which files are present in both directories , which is where combine really comes into its own :
$ combine foo_list and bar_list
tom
How about files that are in foo , but not in bar ?
$ combine foo_list not bar_list
harry
A note of caution , however : while using combine , ‘ or ’ can be used to find the complete list of files , it has the slightly odd effect of listing files common to both files twice :
$ combine foo_list or bar_list
harry
tom

Summary
This introduction to moreutils has only touched upon some of the commands that it provides .
It is worth experimenting with the others , very briefly described here :
isutf8
Checks if a file consists of valid UTF - 8 ts Reproduces standard input on standard output , with a timestamp prefix - good for annotating non-timestamped log files .
vidir Enables a user to “ edit ” a directory with their text editor .
That is , to conveniently delete and rename files .
ifdata Outputs requested information about a specific Linux network interface , without the need to parse ifconfig output .
pee
Acts like tee , but pipes to given commands , instead of standard out and files .
zrun Automatically recognises compressed files passed to a given command , uncompresses them to a temporary file and passes the uncompressed files in place of the original compressed file arguments .
mispipe Connects two commands with a pipe , as in command1 | command2 , but returns the exit value of the first command , rather than the second .
moreutils has been available in Debian in testing and unstable distributions , and in Ubuntu from Edgy onwards .

A 13 - year - old boy who lives with his grandmother has been exposed as one of Britain 's biggest Internet conmen .
The boy earned more than £ 250,000 by posing as the boss of several multinational companies selling vacuum cleaners , stationery and office supplies .
Many of the goods were never dispatched , but the fraudster used the cash to revel in a luxurious lifestyle way beyond his years : he wore designer suits , drank vintage champagne and travelled only by chauffeur - driven limousine .
He even employed a personal bodyguard , flew abroad on business trips and claimed he was going to buy a private jet .
The astonishing case echoes the film Catch Me If You Can ( itself based on a true story ) in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a teenage con artist who makes millions posing as an airline pilot , doctor and lawyer .
And just as in the film , the boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - became criminally obsessed with appearing wealthy and successful .
Scroll down for more ...
A source close to the police investigation said : " Despite coming from a relatively humble background , he became an outrageous snob .
He claimed public transport was ' for commoners ' .
" He would not eat sandwiches unless the crusts were cut off .
And once he started making money he refused to attend school unless the local council paid for him to go to a private school .
" He is a total bully and an extremely arrogant young man . "
This week , Balham Youth Court in South London heard that the boy - now 16 - embarked on a three - year fraud spree after his mother died of cancer .
He received a £ 16,000 inheritance , some of which he spent on crime books that detailed the methods of successful conmen .
Then , working from his bedroom at his grandmother 's house in Chiswick , West London , he set up a website which purported to sell plasma screen televisions at vastly discounted prices .
Despite not supplying the goods , the money started to roll in and he gave up going to school in order to expand the " business " .
He eventually set up a stationery and office supply firm , a dating website and a modelling agency .
The teenage conman quickly outgrew his grandmother 's bedroom and moved into a succession of offices - including one in Mayfair , one of the most exclusive areas of Central London .
However , he would never stay longer than two or three months and would always move out without paying the rent .
He also took on staff , employing dozens of people after placing advertisements in a Jobcentre .
Unsurprisingly , many are still waiting to be paid .
Trading Standards and the police were inundated with complaints and the boy was initially arrested in October 2004 .
But he was given bail and went on to reoffend - a pattern that repeated itself four times over the following two years .
A police source said : " It was like he was addicted to conning people .
And whenever he was confronted with what he did , he showed absolutely no remorse .
He even appeared to enjoy the police and court attention . "
On Tuesday the court heard that between 2004 and 2006 the boy racked up unpaid bills of more than £ 19,000 at three luxury cab firms .
He also made bulk purchases on credit from expensive stores and took so - called " business trips " to Paris and Edinburgh .
On one occasion he even claimed he wanted to buy an aeroplane and walked around a private jet salesroom , afterwards revealing that he loved the way the staff ' sucked up ' to him .
He also spent his money hiring women from escort agencies , taking horse - riding lessons and going drinking in exclusive London clubs .
Yesterday a police source revealed that despite the boy 's intelligence , his lack of a formal education was exposed in emails he sent to one of his victims , which were littered with simple spelling and grammatical errors .
A police source claimed he could be very convincing nonetheless .
He said : " He is 6ft tall and looks a lot older than he is .
He was able to rent the business addresses by putting down a deposit and then simply disappearing when the rents were due .
" When finding staff he would use different Jobcentres , so that he was never blacklisted . "
In court on Tuesday , he admitted 16 charges of fraud totalling £ 50,000 but a further 105 charges , worth £ 135,000 , were taken into consideration .
The court was told that the boy 's latest project is an online lingerie store , which his solicitor insisted was a genuine business .
Despite this , the boy was warned he could face a custodial sentence when he returns to court later this month .
Yesterday , one of the teenage conman 's former employees revealed how he owes her almost £ 4,000 in backpay .
Claire Young , 26 , from Mortlake in South - West London , was until yesterday working as the teenager 's personal assistant .
She said : " He used to take me to a polo club and expensive bars in the City .
He would take his friends along , too , saying he would pay for everything .
I just thought he was a very generous boss .
" I feel like a fool because all the time he was just conning me .
My boyfriend even bought two printers from his website but they never arrived .
" But he always managed to convince me when I asked for my money .
There was always an excuse like : ' I could n't get to the bank .
It was shut ' . "
Following his conviction , his victims are now likely to club together to bring a civil court case in order to recover their money .
Although it is not known how much money he has , the teenager is thought to be named as the sole beneficiary of his grandmother 's £ 900,000 house .
Last night three of the fraudster 's websites remained up and running , but he told the Daily Mail that many of his customers had received their goods , boasting : " I have many very happy customers . "
Asked whether he would repay those who were n't so pleased , he said : " That 's up to the courts . "
However , he did admit that considering buying a private jet was " a bit silly - I was only 13 at the time " .

The inset shows the log returns on a 10 - minute scale in region C ( black Monday ) .
The probability of large fluctuations at this time accompanies the onset of the crash .
Source : Kiyono et al .
On Monday , October 19 , 1987 – infamously known as “ black Monday ” – the Dow fell 508 points , or 22.9 % , marking the largest crash in history .
Using an analytical approach similar to the one applied to explore heart rate , physicists have discovered some unusual events preceding the crash .
These findings may help economists in risk analysis and in predicting inevitable future crashes .
Although stock prices fluctuate , the variations across the overall market are relatively small , as well as similarly random ( or “ Gaussian ” ) on a large time scale .
Nobody knows what causes the giant drops that result in market crashes , except that crashes involve a variety of factors .
This graph shows the probability of 10 - minute price variations during 1984 - 1995 .
The significant increase in 1987 resulted in black Monday , and the increase in 1990 did not result in a crash , likely because of the influence of the Iraq - Kuwait and Gulf wars causing sluggish stock activity .
Source : Kiyono et al .
While analyzing stock - price fluctuations based on critical dynamics and phase transitions , physicists from the University of Tokyo ( Kiyono et al. ) have observed some surprising behavior preceding market crashes .
During the year before black Monday , the team found that the probability of large price fluctuations increased unexpectedly ( “ non-Gaussian ” behavior ) , as if approaching a critical point signifying a major change .
At the critical point – or day of the crash – an abrupt phase transition did indeed occur as the probability model changed from being scale dependent to scale invariant .
Scale invariance , which in this case meant that the prices no longer depended on the time scale , is characteristic behavior observed at a critical point .
“ Because the probability of the occurrence of extremely large fluctuations shows a sharp increase before black Monday … our observations suggest that , through the internal dynamics , the system gradually approaches a critical point where inherent , multi-scale fluctuations are likely to result in a crash , ” said the scientists in a study published in a recent Physical Review Letters .
This “ critical ” model builds on the idea that the volatility , or variation , of price changes can quantitatively measure how much the market may fluctuate .
In fact , volatility – not actual price – is the key input in Black and Scholes ’ “ option pricing ” model on price variation over time , developed in 1973 and highly influential in financial markets .
However , volatility alone could not explain the occurrence of large price fluctuations found by Kiyono et al .
The team also studied price changes on a short ( 10 - minute ) time scale , and discovered a probability of large fluctuations on this scale , as well .
This similarity of fluctuations on different time scales resembles the behavior of earthquakes and heartbeats , which are also scale invariant .
The physicists think that the small - scale stock price fluctuations may have caused highly clustered behavior of individual traders , which then grew rapidly through internal interactions in the stock market .
“ If the same characteristics can be observed in other stock indices , our approach may be applicable to quantitative risk evaluation , ” the scientists reported .
Does an increasing probability of price fluctuations necessarily mean a crash will occur ?
Not at all , since even the most statistically promising analysis cannot account for external factors .
For example , the team observed extreme price fluctuations in log returns before 1990 .
However , because the Iraqi attack on Kuwait in August 1990 and the Gulf War in 1991 led to declining stock prices and action , the internal dynamics of the market underwent a radical change and a phase transition and critical point did not occur .

How waste CO2 is helping to turn renewable energy into liquid fuel
Howdy , Moz fans , and welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday .
This week we are going to chat about how to choose a domain name .
Maybe you 're starting a new company , a new brand , or have an existing brand you 're trying to take online .
Either way , you 're going to need a website .
Domain names have a massive impact all over the web in terms of click - through rate , from search to social media results , to referring links , to type - in traffic , brandability , and offline advertising .
There 's a huge wealth of places that your domain name impacts your brand and your online marketing , and we can't ignore this .
1 . Make it brandable
Brandable , meaning that when you hear or see the domain name , it sounds like a brand .
Which means that hyphens and numbers are a real problem because they do n't sound like a brand .
They sound generic , or strange .
For example , if we wanted to create a pasta website that has pasta recipes and sells some pasta related e-commerce products on it ,
Pasta - shop.com would be hard to brand , say , or remember .
PastaAficionado.com sounds brandable , is unique , but quite challenging to say .
PastaLabs.com would be amazing because it has a scientific connotation to it , is very brandable , unique , memorable , and stands out .
2 . Make it pronounceable
You might be thinking , " Rand , why is it so important that it 's pronounceable ?
Most people are going to be typing it or clicking a link . "
It matters because of " processing fluency " .
A cognitive bias that human beings have where we remember ( and have more positive associations with ) things that we can easily say and think about .
That includes pronounceability in our own minds .
This is going to vary on the language and region that you 're targeting .
If you can't easily say the name , you 're going to lose processing fluency , memorability , and the benefits of brandability that you 've created .
3 . Make it short
Length matters because of the processing fluency that we talk about above .
The fewer characters a domain name has , the easier it is to type , say , share , and the less it gets shortened on social media sharing platforms and search results .
Shorter is better .
4. Bias towards .com
I know , it 's 2017 .
Why are we still talking about .com ?
The internet 's been around 20 - plus years .
Why does .com matter so much when there are so many TLD extension options ?
The answer is , .com is the most recognized and most accessible TLD .
Cognitive fluency dictates that we should go with something easy , that people have an association with , and .com is still the primary TLD .
If you want to build up a very brandable domain that can do well , you want a .com .
Probably , eventually , if you are very successful , you 're going to have to try and go capture it anyway , and so I would bias you to get it if you can .
If it 's unavailable , my suggestion would be to go with the .net , .co , or a known ccTLD .
Those are your best bets .
A known ccTLD might be something like .ca in Canada or .it in Italy .
5 . Avoid trademark infringement
You have to be careful because it's not whether you think your domain name could be confused .
It 's whether you think a judge in a jurisdiction , where a company might take legal action against you , would consider your domain name confusable .
This can also create brand confusion , which is hard for your brandability .
You should talk to an attorney or a legal professional if you have real concerns .
Trademark owners can attempt to sue a domain name owner , who 's owning the domain legitimately and using it for business purposes , and that sucks .
6 . Make it intuitive
A good domain name gives people a strong idea of what a website will be about .
Being able to look at a domain name and say , " Oh , they probably do this .
This is probably what that company is up to " is a big win .
PastaPerfected.com , for example , is pretty obvious , intuitively about pasta , and anyone could figure that out .
7 . Use broad keywords
Keywords in a domain name can help with the cognitive fluency biases , but also from an SEO perspective .
Google has been biasing away from these exact match and partial match domains , but the anchor text you get from people linking to your domain can help .
If you can get a keyword mention in your domain name that helps make it obvious what you 're website is about , go for it .
But if you 're trying to secure a keyword rich or a keyword targeted domain , I would stay away from those in 2017 .
They do n't carry the weight that they used to and have negative associations ( with users and search engines ) that you should avoid .
For example , I would not purchase a domain name like ; RecipesForPasta.com or BuyPastaOnline.com .
I would instead , go for something very broad like Gusto.com .
Think about Amazon.com or Google.com , which clearly has no association with what it is .
These are very well - branded but do n't have keyword richness to them .
It 's more of a creative association , just like " gusto " means " taste " in Italian .
So I might be tempted to go in that direction instead .
8 . It 's okay to append or modify it
If your domain name is not available , it 's okay to go out and add a suffix or a prefix .
It is okay to use an alternate TLD extension , like we talked about previously , and it 's okay to be a little bit creative with your online brand .
For example , let 's say my brand name is Pastaterra .
Maybe I 've already got a shop somewhere maybe in the Seattle area and I have been selling pasta at my shop and now I 'm going online with it .
Well , it is okay for me to do something like ThePastaterra.com , or PastaterraShop.com , or even Pastaterra.net .
With these rules in mind , I would love to hear from all of you about your domain choices , domain name biases , and what you think is working in 2016 .
Hopefully , we 'll see you again next week for another edition of Whiteboard Friday .
Take care .

I 'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person , I must believe in " A , " " B , " " C " and " D. " Just who do they think they are ?
And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me ?
I ’m in the middle of reading This is Your Brain on Music : The Science of a Human Obsession , a delightful work by Daniel J. Levitin .
I plan to write about this book when I ’m finished reading it , but one thing he wrote in his introduction especially intrigued me .
Levitin writes that our culture makes a distinction between “ expert ” performers and the rest of us .
We defer to experts to produce music .
In most traditional cultures , it was n’t that way .
In traditional cultures , everyone who could talk was expected to sing .
Singing and dancing were both natural activities involving everyone .
Nowadays , expert performers command high prices for their often high - quality work .
“ Two concert tickets can easily cost as much as a week ’s food allowance for a family of four … ”
It seems as though we ’ve turned over many important functions to the experts .
Sports is now something that should be done by experts .
The rest of us pay to see them play sports .
This is true , even though many of us who pay the high prices for those sports tickets could really use a lot more workouts ourselves instead of sitting on our butts downing overpriced beer and nachos .
In fact , when most of us try to play music or compete athletically , we do so feeling decidedly inferior , because we have been convinced that we are nothing compared to those well - known performers , X , Y or Z .
Many woman have developed psychological complexes about wearing clothes , due to the constant notoriety given to professional models .
Those “ experts ” are intimidating .
The same goes for all forms of art , though Youtube and other Internet sites are starting to change that with regard to music and writing .
This site is one of the many blogs written by people who are not paid a living wage to write about these sorts of topics ( in fact , none of the writers at this site has been paid anything at all to write at this site ) .
Bloggers are thus breaking a taboo of sorts .
Is this a source of some of the resentment expressed against bloggers by some members of the mainstream media ?
In some fields , it ’s really not true that all well - known performers are far superior to all amateurs .
Perhaps the experts got an early break and perhaps their continued financial success is path dependent on that early break .
I ’m especially thinking of music , where many high paid performers have mediocre talent while many local low - paid performers are superb musicians .
The general rule , promoted by the media , however , is that the experts are the experts and the rest of us are the amateurs .
With regard to many of the relevant skills , this is literally true , of course .
Most of us could n’t compete with the experts .
Most of us would look foolish if directly compared with Albert Pujols or Eric Clapton .
But it seems as though a harmful broader message has also been spread in the process : amateurs should n’t even try .
We seem to be a culture that does n’t simply admire the skills of experts .
We give homage to them .
This makes me wonder whether there ’s any connection between this general tendency give homage to experts and the willingness of so many Americans to defer to half - baked religious “ experts ” rather than doing the hard work to carve out their own meaning of life .
I ’m still thinking this one through .
A management consultant at Bain wrote me a nice email , that included the following sentence :
“ Our team is conducting a benchmarking effort to gather an outside - in view on development performance metrics and best practice approaches to issues of process and organization from companies involved in a variety of software development ( and systems integration ) . ”
I did n’t understand a thing he wrote .
The email contained a lot of words ( “ benchmarking , ” “ outside in , ” “ performance metrics , ” “ best practice , ” “ process and organization ” ) each of which set off a loud buzzing alarm - like sound in my head .
The noise from the buzzing was so loud and so distracting that I found myself completely unable to parse the email .
I think it was something about measuring performance in software organizations ?
aHA !
YES !
I know all about that .
You ca n’t do that .
Quit it .
Stop it .
Listen .
Let me tell you a secret about management consulting companies and software organizations .
Here is how the game is played .
Big Consulting Company calls up Big Oil Company .
“ Hey , ” they say , “ do you guys need help being more productive developing software ? ”
Big Oil Company says , “ Yeah , sure , whatever , we ’ll buy anything , ” and they buy a $ 1,000,000 software productivity consulting deal .
The consulting company comes on site , measures a bunch of bogus things like Lines of Code Per Developer , or , if they ’re really fancy shmancy , Number of Function Points Per Programmer Per Day .
Then they tell the oil company , “ Gosh , you ’re only getting 73.844 % productivity .
Pay us another $ 2,000,000 and we ’ll double your productivity . ”
Oil company pays the $ 2 m .
Consulting company comes in , gets all the programmers in a room , tells them all about Function Points and stuff , and how productivity is REALLY IMPORTANT .
Programmers remember that scene from Office Space where Bob and Bob , the consultants , recommended all the people to get fired .
Programmers start writing a heck of a lot more function points .
For example you can triple the number of function points in your code simply by round tripping everything through an XML file .
Big waste of time , prone to bugs , does nothing , but each file you touch adds a function point .
W00t !
Consulting company comes back , measures again , and lo and behold , with all the round trips through XML the function point count is up drastically .
Consultant announces that Oil Company is now at 151.29 % productivity .
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED .
But there ’s one more step .
Now the consultant goes to another Oil Company .
“ Hey , did you know your peers are getting 151.29 % productivity ?
How are you doing ? ”
Oil Company # 2 is scared .
They pay for the initial study .
They ’re only getting 83.948 % productivity .
Shit .
And the cycle starts anew .
The whole fraud is only possible because performance metrics in knowledge organizations are completely trivial to game .
The best part is that most management consultants , the stunningly good - looking , bright , earnest chipmunks with 4.0s in Russian Lit from Harvard who work for these companies , have absolutely no way of knowing this , so they can go through this whole exercise without even knowing that they ’re doing it !
They get all the way through the 2 - year associate program on their way to MBA school without even realizing that they have n’t done a goddamn thing about productivity , all they ’ve done is caused a fairly pointless transfer of wealth from ExxonMobilConoco to BainMcKinsey Gartner ’s senior partners .
And it ’s a lot of fun !
First class flights to Houston and Oslo !
Helping the world be more productive !
Rock on , young stunningly - good - looking Management Consultant .
My Israeli friend Moshe Behar has forwarded this letter from his friend Rasha .
She is in Beirut :
Dear All ,
I am writing now from a cafe , in West Beirut 's Hamra district .
It is filled with people who are trying to escape the pull of 24 hour news reporting .
Like me .
The electricity has been cut off for a while now , and the city has been surviving on generators .
The old system that was so familiar at the time of the war , where generators were allowed a lull to rest is back .
The cafe is dark , hot and humid .
Espresso machines and blenders are silenced .
Conversations , rumors , frustrations waft through the room .
I am better off here than at home , following the news , live , on the spot documentation of our plight in sound bites .
The sound of Israeli warplanes overwhelms the air on occasion .
They drop leaflets to conduct a " psychological " war .
Yesterday , their sensitivity training urged them to advise inhabitants of the southern suburbs to flee because the night promised to be " hot " .
Today , the leaflets warn that they plan to bomb all other bridges and tunnels in Beirut .
People are flocking to supermarkets to stock up on food .
This morning , I wrote in my emails to people inquiring about my well - being that I was safe , and that the targets seem to be strictly Hezbollah sites and their constituencies , now , I regret typing that .
They will escalate .
Until a few hours ago , they had only bombed the runways of the airport , as if to " limit " the damage .
A few hours ago , four shells were dropped on the buildings of our brand new shining airport .
The night was harrowing .
The southern suburbs and the airport were bombed , from air and sea .
The apartment where I am living has a magnificient view of the bay of Beirut .
I could see the Israeli warships firing at their leisure .
It is astounding how comfortable they are in our skies , in our waters , they just travel around , and deliver their violence and congratulate themselves .
The cute French - speaking and English - speaking bourgeoisie has fled to the Christian mountains .
A long - standing conviction that the Israelis will not target Lebanon 's Christian " populated " mountains .
Maybe this time they will be proven wrong ?
The Gulfies , Saudis , Kuwaities and other expatriates have all fled out of the country , in Pullman buses via Damascus , before the road was bombed .
They were supposed to be the economic lifeblood of this country .
The contrast in their sense of panic as opposed to the defiance of the inhabitants of the southern suburbs was almost comical .
This time , however , I have to admit , I am tired of defying whatever for whatever cause .
There is no cause really .
There are only sinister post - Kissingerian type negotiations .
I can almost hear his hateful voice rationalizing laconically as he does the destruction of a country , the deaths of families , people with dreams and ambitions for the Israelis to win something more , always more .
Although I am unable to see it , I am told left , right and center that there is a rhyme and reason , grand design , and strategy .
The short - term military strategy seems to be to cripple transport and communications .
And power stations .
The southern region has now been reconfigured into small enclaves that cannot communicate between one another .
Most have enough fuel , food and supplies to last them until tomorrow , but after that the isolation of each enclave will lead to tragedy .
Mayors and governors have been screaming for help on the TV .
This is all bringing back echoes of 1982 , the Israeli siege of Beirut .
My living nightmare , well one of my living nightmares .
It was summer then as well .
The Israeli army marched through the south and besieged Beirut .
For 3 months , the US administration kept dispatching urges for the Israeli military to act with restraint .
And the Israelis assured them they were acting appropriately .
We had the PLO command in West Beirut then .
I felt safe with the handsome fighters .
How I miss them .
Between Hezbollah and the Lebanese army I do n't feel safe .
We are exposed , defenseless , pathetic .
And I am older , more aware of danger .
I am 37 years old and actually scared .
The sound of the warplanes scares me .
I am not defiant , there is no more fight left in me .
And there is no solidarity , no real cause .
I am furthermore pissed off because no one knows how hard the postwar reconstruction was to all of us .
Hariri did not make miracles .
People work hard and sacrifice a lot and things get done .
No one knows except us how expensive , how arduous that reconstruction was .
Every single bridge and tunnel and highway , the runways of that airport , all of these things were built from our sweat and brow , at 3 times the real cost of their construction because every member of government , because every character in the ruling Syrian junta , because the big players in the Hariri administration and beyond , were all thieves .
We accepted the thievery and banditry just to get things done and get it over with .
Everyone one of us had two jobs ( I am not referring to the ruling elite , obviously ) , paid backbreaking taxes and wages to feed the " social covenant " .
We faught and faught that neoliberal onslaught , the arrogance of economic consultants and the greed of creditors just to have a nice country that functioned at a minimum , where things got done , that stood on its feet , more or less .
A thirving Arab civil society .
Public schools were sacrificed for roads to service neglected rural areas and a couple Syrian officers to get richer , and we accepted , that road was desperately needed , and there was the " precarious national consensus " to protect .
Social safety nets were given up , healthcare for all , unions were broken and coopted , public spaces taken over , and we bowed our heads and agreed .
Palestinian refugees were pushed deeper and deeper into forgetting , hidden from sight and consciousness , " for the preservation of their identity " we were told , and we accepted .
In exchange we had a secular country where the Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces could co-exist and fight their fights in parliament not with bullets .
We bit hard on our tongues and stiffened our upper lip , we protested and were defeated , we took the streets , defied army - imposed curfews , time after time , to protect that modicum of civil rights , that modicum of a semblance of democracy , and it takes one air raid for all our sacrifices and tolls to be blown to smithereens .
It 's not about the airport , it 's what we built during that postwar .
As per the usual of Lebanon , it 's not only about Lebanon , the country has paradigmatically been the terrain for regional conflicts to lash out violently .
Off course speculations abound .
There is rhetoric , and a lot of it , but there are also Theories .
1 ) Theory Number One .
This is about Syria , Hamas and Hezbollah negotiating an upper hand in the negotiations with Israel .
Hezbollah have indicated from the moment they captured the Israeli soldiers that they were willing to negotiate in conjunction with Hamas for the release of all Arab prisoners in Israeli jails .
Iran is merely providing a back support for Syria + Hamas .
2 ) Theory Number Two .
This is not about solidarity with Gaza or strengthening the hand of the Palestinians in negotiating the release of the prisoners in Israeli jails .
This is about Iran 's nuclear bomb and negotiations with the Europeans / US .
The Iranian negotiator left Brussels after the end of negotiations and instead of returning to Tehran , he landed in Damascus .
Two days later , Hezbollah kidnapped the Israeli soldiers .
The G8 Meeting is on Saturday , Iran is supposed to have some sort of an answer for the G8 by then .
In the meantime , they are showing to the world that they have a wide sphere of control in the region : Afghanistan , Iraq and Lebanon .
In Lebanon they pose a real threat to Israel .
The " new " longer - reaching missiles that Hezbollah fired on Haifa are the message .
The kings of Jordan and Saudi Arabia issued statements holding Hezbollah solely responsible for bringing on this escalation , and that is understood as a message to Iran .
Iran on the other hand promised to pay for the reconstruction of destroyed homes and infrastructures in the south .
And threatened Israel with " hell " if they hit Syria .
3 ) Theory Number Three .
This is about Lebanon , Hezbollah and 1559 ( the UN resolution demanding the disarmement of Hezbollah and deployment of the Lebanese army in the southern territory ) .
It stipulates that this is no more than a secret conspiracy between Syria , Iran and the US to close the Hezbollah file for good , and resolve the pending Lebanese crisis since the assassination of Hariri .
Evidence for this conspiracy is Israel leaving Syria so far unharmed .
Holders of this theory claim that Israel will deliver a harsh blow to Hezbollah and cripple the Lebanese economy to the brink of creating an internal political crisis .
The resolution would then result in Hezbollah giving up arms , and a buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon under the control of the Lebanese army in Lebanon and the Israeli army in the north of Galilee .
More evidence for this Theory are the Saudi Arabia and Jordan statements condemning Hezbollah and holding them responsible for all the horrors inflicted on the Lebanese people .
There are more theories ...
There is also the Israeli government reaching an impasse and feeling a little wossied out by Hezbollah and Hamas , and the Israeli military taking the upper hand with Olmert .
The land of conspiracies ...
Fun ?
I can't make heads or tails .
But I am tired of spending days and nights waiting not to die from a shell , on target or astray .
Watching poor people bludgeoned , homeless and preparing to mourn .
I am so weary ...
Rasha .
Why would criminals want to visit a mosque ?
Could it be that the difference between crime and Jihad is n’t that great ?
A quote from the Dutch news service NIS , 5 May 2007 :
Most criminals in the Netherlands should be able to serve their sentence at home in the future .
Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin is to introduce house arrest as a new main punishment .
Criminals can then also visit friends or a mosque for two hours a day .
[...]
Under the bill , whether criminals remain in the vicinity of their homes will be monitored by an electronic ankle or wrist - band .
Those convicted will however be able to leave their homes for two hours a day .
This will only be allowed according to a schedule agreed beforehand .
The two hours can be used for doing shopping , visiting family , sports activities or a visit to a mosque or other religious event .
[...]
Those under house arrest will receive welfare payments .
Only if they run a company from their living - room or do other work that yields sufficient money will they receive no financial support from the minister .
A UN report published recently showed that the number of mercenaries working in Iraq has been steadily increasing and is now estimated that the number of such professional mercenaries to over 30 % .
Between 30,000 and 50,000 mercenaries are working in Iraq , making them the second largest military force there after the occupying United States .
The case of Iraq " is a new manifestation of the use of mercenaries that has caught the UN by surprise " , Spain 's Jose Luis Gomez del Prado -- a member of the UN working group on mercenaries -- said Friday during a visit to Peru .
The United States has 130,000 soldiers in Iraq , he noted .
Britain has 10,000 troops .
The report published by the UN working group on mercenaries and being presented to the committee for human rights described the increasing tendency by the invading forces to use paid mercenaries in areas of high tension in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Mr Prado who heads the study group said that there is no doubt that the mercenaries are the second largest armed forces in Iraq after the US forces of occupation , and their duties include the protection of the Green Zone and other areas in Baghdad , which are the responsibility of the American forces of occupation .
Indeed , contrary to common belief and the vibrant war propaganda , mercenaries in Iraq are given fighting duties as well as logistics .
The use of mercenaries is favoured by the forces occupation as a form of ' human - sheild ’ inserted between US regulars and the forever rising potency of Iraqi insurgency .
The mercenaries are seen as ' dispensable ’ because the killing of mercenaries is not reflected in the US government statistics of 3,245 dead soldiers as reported by CNN online at the time of writing this article .
Mr Prado warned of the danger of using mercenaries since they are not accountable to any law or the type of chain of command often associated with regular armies .
Other experts who contributed to the report went further by saying that it is in the interest of those mercenaries and the firms they work for , to keep Iraq in a constant state of war since this guarentees constant flow of work for them .
This can explain the numerous reports from local Iraqis of mercenaries involvement terrorist activities .
Besides the diminished responsibility and conformance to any law or discipline , most of the mercenaries often do not know the goals of their missions , and their focus is on the exercise of barbarities for a fistful of Dollars .
Pardo indicated that the majority of the mercenaries are supplied to the forces of occupation by US security firms which are in close collaboration with the US Department of Defence .
Pardo estimates that the mercenary industry in Iraq alone is worth a total of $ 100 billion paid for by western tax - payers .
Most mercenaries are recruited from South America , whilst those at officer level tend to come from eastern Europe and South Africa .
The report warns that these mercenaries are highly trained in the inhumain methods of torture , brutality and barbarity ; they often employ these methods against the local population .
In addition , former officers in the former South African aparthide regime are known to be training of Iraqi goverenment secret security forces and police .
The report reveals that only 5 % of the crimes committed by the mercenaries in Iraq have been prosecuted with sentencing being extremely light in comparison to the crime committed .

Growth promoters are banned in Europe
A US study has linked use of the chemicals to damage to human sperm .
The University of Rochester found men whose mothers ate a lot of beef during pregnancy had lower sperm counts .
The Human Reproduction study found they were three times more likely to have a sperm count so low they could be classified as sub-fertile .
It confirms that Europe was justified to ban the use of these hormones when they did
Dr Allan Pacey
University of Sheffield
The use of growth promoting chemicals was banned in Europe in 1988 .
But although the US banned the use of some growth promoters in 1979 , others , such as the sex hormones testosterone and progesterone , are still in use in the beef industry .
The Rochester team examined sperm counts among US men born between 1949 and 1983 .
They found those whose mothers ate more than seven beef meals a week had an average sperm concentration of 43.1 million sperm per millilitre of seminal fluid .
In contrast , the sons of mothers who ate less beef had an average of 56.9 million sperm .
Fertility threshold
GROWTH PROMOTERS
Six growth promoters are legally in use in the US : Natural steroids :
estradiol
testosterone
progesterone Synthetic hormones :
zeranol
trenbolene acetate
melengestrol acetate
Among sons of mothers who ate a lot of beef , 17.7 % had a sperm concentration below the World Health Organization sub- fertility threshold of 20 million sperm per millilitre of seminal fluid .
The figure for the sons of lower beef consumers was 5.7 % .
Lead researcher Professor Shanna Swan said the findings suggested that exposure to growth promoters contained in the beef eaten by the boys ' mothers was to blame .
However , she admitted the research team had no specific data on which chemicals the meat contained , and conceded other possible causes , such as exposure to pesticides , or lifestyle factors could not be ruled out .
She said : " Theoretically , the foetus and young children are particularly sensitive to exposure to sex steroids .
" Therefore , the consumption of residues of steroids in meat by pregnant women and young children is of particular concern . "
Professor Swan said to pin down the role of growth promoters the study would have to be repeated in men born in Europe after 1988 .
Damaging effects
EU POSITION Hormonal growth promoters banned in EU in 1988 UK government runs a system of surveillance for residues of such substances in UK cattle to monitor compliance with the ban EU law bans meat from hormonally treated animals being exported to the EU by non-member countries
Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield , said : " Even though males do n't start producing sperm until puberty , it is during the time in their mother 's womb , and in the early years of their life as an infant , that the testicles develop their capacity to produce sperm .
" Scientists have been concerned for a number of years that oestrogen mimicking chemicals in water supplies , plastics or make - up can affect the critical stages in the development of young boys ' testicles .
" In extreme cases of exposure , this could lead to sperm counts in adult men that are low enough to be the cause of infertility
" That hormones given to cattle might have lowered the sperm counts of adult men because their mothers ate a lot of beef when they were pregnant with them is alarming to say the least .
" But it confirms that Europe was justified to ban the use of these hormones when they did . "
Professor Alastair Hay , an expert on environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds , said one weakness of the study was that it relied on women being able accurately to recall how much beef they had eaten during pregnancy - something which may have happened many years earlier .
Everyone knows about the good old number 2 pencil .
But who knows what that number 2 actually means ?
Have no fear , I 've taken the time to research this pointless topic for your pleasure .
First , a little history .
Today pencils are numbered and / or lettered to tell us how hard the lead is .
The higher the number , the harder the lead , and the lighter the markings .
However , it was n't always this way .
The earliest pencils were made simply from filling a wood shaft with raw graphite .
The hardness of the graphite would differ depending on the quality of the graphite , thus it was different depending on where the pencil was made .
The current style of making pencils was developed in 1794 by Nicolas - Jacques Cont� ( 1755 -1805 ) .
Cont� , a painter , chemist , physicist , balloonist , and inventor , put into practice a new method of making pencils so that they would be much more functional .
The Cont� Process , as it became known , mixes powdered graphite with finely ground clay .
This mixture is then shaped into a long cylinder and then baked in an oven .
The more clay that is added versus graphite the harder the pencil lead .
In January 1795 , Cont� patented his method as patent number 32 .
( Pretty high up there ! )
Cont� 's first pencils were numbered for varing degrees of hardness .
As the Cont� process made its way into the world , other pencil makers decided to use the same technique .
Of course , like any product , each company came up with their own standards for how their product should be labeled .
To further complicate things , English pencil decided to use letters instead of numbers .
Soft leads were labeled ' B ' for black , and harder leads with ' H ' for hard .
For varying grades they would just add more letters , thus very soft was ' BB ' , very hard was ' HH ' , and extra hard was ' HHH ' .
Simple right ?
Later they switched again to a combination of numbers and letters !
Where you would see 2B , 9H , etc .
Although more complicated , this system allowed for a much wider variety of grades to be made with no more than a two character description .
This was the last major change in the English grading system , the same they use today .
The full English scale is :
Why an F and an HB ?
Who knows .
They 're crazy !
Many of the United States companies use a number only system for writing pencils ( 1 , 2 , 2� , 3 , 4 ) , but the number letter combination for graphic and artist pencils .
I guess they could n't make up their mind .
The No. 2 / HB grade pencil is the middle grade and is the most commonly used pencil for generic use .
Harder grades are used for drafting and engineering , while softer grades are used usually by artists .
If you ever need to convert from American to English pencils use the table below , listed as an approximate .
USA English # 1 B # 2 HB # 2 � F # 3 H # 4 2H
Still to this day there is not a " universal " pencil grading method .
The foolish pencil makers have yet to sit down and come up with one .
We should lobby our governments .
This site is supposed to be about software management .
But sometimes you do n’t have the power to create change in your organization by executive fiat .
Obviously , if you ’re just a grunt programmer at the bottom of the totem pole , you ca n’t exactly order people to start creating schedules or bug databases .
And in fact even if you ’re a manager , you ’ve probably discovered that managing developers is a lot like herding cats , only not as fun .
Merely saying “ make it so ” does n’t make it so .
It can be frustrating when you ’re working in an organization that scores low on The Joel Test .
No matter how good your code is , your coworkers write such bad code that you ’re embarassed to be associated with the project .
Or management is making bad decisions about what code to write , so you ’re forced to waste your talent debugging the AS / 400 version of a retirement - planning game for kids .
You could just leave , I suppose .
But presumably , there ’s some reason you ’re stuck there .
The stock options have n’t quite vested , there ’s no better place to work in Podunk , or perhaps your boss is holding someone you love hostage .
In any case , dealing with life on a bad team can be infuriating .
But there are strategies for improving your team from the bottom , and I ’d like to share a few of them .
Strategy 1 Just Do It
A lot can be done to improve the project just by one person doing it .
Do n’t have a daily build server ?
Make one .
Set your own machine up with a scheduled job to make builds at night and send out email results .
Does it take too many steps to make the build ?
Write the makefile .
Nobody does usability tests ?
Do your own hallway usability tests on the mailroom folks with a piece of paper or a VB prototype .
Strategy 2 Harness the Power of Viral Marketing
Many of the Joel Test strategies can be implemented by a single person on an uncooperative team .
Some of them , if done well , will spread to the rest of the team .
For example , suppose nobody on your team can be persuaded to use a bug database .
Do n’t let it bother you .
Just keep your own .
Enter bugs that you find in your own code .
If you find a bug that somebody else really should fix , assign the bug to them using the bug database .
If you have good bug tracking software , this will send them an email .
But now , you can keep sending them emails if they do n’t fix the bug .
Eventually , they ’ll see the value of bug tracking and start to use the system as it was intended .
If the QA team refuses to input bugs to the bug tracking system , simply refuse to listen to bug reports through any other channel .
About the three - thousdandth time that you say to people , “ listen , I ’d love to fix that , but I ’m going to forget .
Can you enter a bug in the system ? ” they ’ll start using the database .
Nobody on your team wants to use source control ?
Create your own CVS repository , on your own hard drive if necessary .
Even without cooperation , you can check your code in independently from everybody else ’s .
Then when they have problems that source control can solve ( someone accidentally types rm * ~ instead of rm *~ ) , they ’ll come to you for help .
Eventually , people will realize that they can have their own checkouts , too .
Strategy 3 Create a Pocket of Excellence
The team wo n’t make schedules ?
Or specs ?
Write your own .
Nobody ’s going to complain if you take a day or two to write a minimal spec and schedule for the work you ’re about to do .
Get better people into the team .
Get involved in hiring and interviewing , and recruit good candidates to join the team .
Find the people who are willing to improve and capable of it , and get them on your side .
Even on poor teams , you ’re likely to have some smart people who just do n’t have the experience to create great code .
Help them out .
Set them up to learn .
Read their code checkins .
If they do something stupid , do n’t send them a snooty email explaining what ’s stupid about their checkins .
That will just make them angry and defensive .
Instead , innocently report the bug that you know is the result of the checkin .
Let them figure out what ’s causing it .
When they find the bug for themselves , they ’ll remember that lesson a lot better .
Strategy 4 Neutralize The Bozos
Even the best teams can have a bozo or two .
The frustrating part about having bad programmers on your team is when their bad code breaks your good code , or good programmers have to spend time cleaning up after the bad programmers .
As a grunt , your goal is damage - minimization , a.k.a. containment .
At some point , one of these geniuses will spend two weeks writing a bit of code that is so unbelievably bad that it can never work .
You ’re tempted to spend the fifteen minutes that it takes to rewrite the thing correctly from scratch .
Resist the temptation .
You ’ve got a perfect opportunity to neutralize this moron for several months .
Just keep reporting bugs against their code .
They will have no choice but to keep slogging away at it for months until you can’t find any more bugs .
Those are months in which they ca n’t do any damage anywhere else .
Strategy 5 Get Away From Interruptions
All happy work environments are alike ( private offices , quiet working conditions , excellent tools , few interruptions and even fewer large meetings ) .
All unhappy work environments are unhappy in their own way .
The bad news is that changing the working environment is almost impossible in virtually any company .
Long term leases may mean that even the CEO ca n’t do anything about it .
That ’s why so few software developers get private offices .
This hurts their companies in at least two ways .
First , it makes it harder to recruit top notch developers , who will prefer the firm that gives them cushier conditions ( all else being equal ) .
Second , the level of interruptions can dramatically reduce the productivity of developers , who find it impossible to get into the zone and stay in it for any length of time .
Look for ways to get out of this environment .
Take a laptop to the company cafeteria , where there are lots of tables that are empty most of the day ( and nobody can find you ) .
Book a conference room for the whole day and write code there , and make it clear through the preponderance of checkins just how much more work you get done when you ’re in a room by yourself .
The next time there ’s a crunch on and your manager asks you what you need to Get This Done By Tomorrow , you know what to say .
They ’ll find you an office for the day .
And pretty soon they ’ll start wondering what they can do to keep that productive thing going year round .
Come into work late and leave late .
Those hours after the rest of the company goes home can be the most productive .
Or , if you ’re on a team of developers who regularly come in late , get into work at 9 am .
You ’ll do more work in the two hours before other people come in and start bothering you than you do in the rest of the day .
Do n’t keep your email or IM client running .
Check your email every hour , if you want , but do n’t keep it running .
Strategy 6 Become Invaluable
None of these strategies work if you ’re not really an excellent contributor .
If you do n’t write good code , and lots of it , you ’re just going to be resented for messing around with bug databases when you “ should be ” writing code .
There ’s nothing more deadly to your career than having a reputation of being so concerned with process that you do n’t accomplish anything .
Once , when I started a new job as a grunt programmer at a new company , I discovered that the company was running somewhere around 2 on the Joel Test , and I was determined to fix it .
But I also knew that making a good first impression was crucial .
So I allocated the first seven hours of every day to just writing code , as was expected of me .
There ’s nothing like a flurry of checkins to make you look good to the rest of the development team .
But I reserved another hour every afternoon before going home to improving the process .
I used that time to fix things that made it hard to debug our product .
I set up a daily build and a bug database .
I fixed all the longstanding annoyances that made development difficult .
I wrote specs for the work that I was doing during the day .
I wrote a document explaining step - by - step how to create a development machine from scratch .
I thoroughly documented an important internal language which had been undocumented .
Slowly , the process got better and better .
Nobody but me ( and my team , when I was put in charge of one ) ever did schedules or specs , but other than that we hit about 10 on the Joel Test .
You can make things better , even when you ’re not in charge , but you have to be Caesar ’s Wife : above suspicion .
Otherwise you ’ll make enemies as you go along .
Any other ideas ?
Los Angeles , CA - Motion Picture Association of America President and CEO Dan Glickman announced a bold new strategy to combat the " pernicious effects of piracy " .
After many failures to stop piracy by technological and litigious means , Hollywood will rely on psychological tactics to thwart would - be file - swappers by making only movies that suck .
Using one - dimensional characters and predictable plots lines , movies will be so insulting to the intellect of the viewer that no one that can use a computer would bother to download them .
The MPAA has already tested the method in releases such as Baby Geniuses 2 , Son of the Mask , Alone in The Dark , and Coach Carter .
In a focus group of computer - literate adults , test films were able to elicit such reactions as , " Oh God , why , " " I want those two hours of my life back , " and " I 'll be skull - fucked by imps before I ever sit through that horseshit again . "
" We are sending a clear message to pirates , " said MPAA Chairman Dan Glickman , " One way or another ; you will pay for your crime .
Your punishment may come in the form of a lawsuit , or in the mind - numbing mediocrity of Gigli , but you will be punished .

When asked how the changes would effect box office sales , Glickman responded , " We think the success of Hilary Duff has shown there is plenty of money in releasing movies that suck . "
Pressed specifically about the buying power of the intellectually underdeveloped market , Glickman countered , " Are you suggesting we have overestimated the idiocy of the public ? "
Glickman and Glickman then snickered uncontrollably .
Hollywood will eventually only produce movies based on canceled TV series .
For the near future , studios are rushing to raise the suck level in existing franchises .
Ashton Kutcher will replace Toby McGuire as Peter Parker in Spider -man 3 .
The film rights to The Hobbit have been wrestled from Peter Jackson and given to George Lucas .
In addition , Joel Schumacher will direct and star in all future films from Pixar Animation Studios .

Two of Greenland 's largest glaciers shrank dramatically and dumped twice as much ice into the sea during a period of less than a year between 2004 and 2005 .
And then , less than two years later , they returned to near their previous rates of discharge .
The variability over such a short time , reported online Feb. 9 on Science magazine 's Science Express , underlines the problem in assuming that glacial melting and sea level rise will necessarily occur at a steady upward trajectory , according to lead author Ian Howat , a post - doctoral researcher with the University of Washington 's Applied Physics Laboratory and the University of Colorado 's National Snow and Ice Data Center .
The paper comes a year after a study in the journal Science revealed that discharge from Greenland 's glaciers had doubled between 2000 and 2005 , leading some scientists to speculate such changes were on a steady , upward climb .
" While the rates of shrinking of these two glaciers have stabilized , we do n't know whether they will remain stable , grow or continue to collapse in the near future , " Howat says .
That 's because the glaciers ' shape changed greatly , becoming stretched and thinned .
" Our main point is that the behavior of these glaciers can change a lot from year to year , so we can't assume to know the future behavior from short records of recent changes , " he says .
" Future warming may lead to rapid pulses of retreat and increased discharge rather than a long , steady drawdown . "
The findings come on the heels of the widely publicized Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change 's report issued Feb .
2 . Some scientists criticized the report for disregarding the surprisingly high discharges of ice from Greenland 's glaciers since 2000 when the panel estimated the amount of future sea level rise that will be caused by melting glaciers .
In the summary for policy makers , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change explained its position saying , " Dynamical processes related to ice flow and not included in current models but suggested by recent observations could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming , increasing sea level rise .
Understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude . "
" I think the IPCC authors made a responsible decision in producing their estimates while noting the recent discharges are a real concern that we do not yet understand well enough to make accurate predictions , " says Ian Joughin , a glaciologist with the UW 's Applied Physics Laboratory and co-author on the Science Express article .

Getting accurate computer models of Greenland and Antarctic glaciers is important because 99 percent of the Earth 's glacial ice is found in those two places .
Glacial ice is second only to the oceans as the largest reservoir of water on the planet .
Previous findings published a year ago showed that Greenland 's glaciers had doubled their discharge between 2000 and 2005 , but these results were based on " snapshots " of discharge taken five years apart , Howat says .
" Did an equal amount of discharge occur every year ?
Did it happen all in one year ?
Is there a steady upward trajectory ?
We did n't know , " he says .
Last week 's Science Express article adds details from Greenland 's second and third largest glaciers , Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim , in the southwest part of Greenland .
The two are known as " outlet " glaciers because their front edges reach all the way to the sea , unlike other glaciers that are landlocked .
Together the two glaciers represent 35 percent of East Greenland 's total discharge .
The scientists examined the glaciers ' speed , geometry and discharge between 2000 and 2006 .
At Kangerdlugssuaq , roughly 80 percent of the total increase in discharge occurred in less than one year in 2005 , followed by a 25 percent drop the following years , the authors say .
At Helheim , discharge increased between 2000 and 2003 , and then by an even greater amount between 2004 and 2005 .
It then dropped in 2006 to its near 2000 value .
The scientists say what they 've learned is that the shape of these two glaciers changed as they surged toward the sea , changes that put the brakes on .
The glaciers lost ice as their front edges began calving , became lighter and floated off the bottom , which led to more ice breaking off as the ice was buoyed up by water .
The fronts stablized once the ice had retreated to shallower parts of the fjords and again rested on the bottom .

They also found the pace toward the sea was faster at the front edge of the glaciers than farther up the mountain .
For example Kangerdlugssuaq 's front edge increased in speed by 80 in 2005 percent while 19 miles inland the speed increased 20 percent .
This caused the glaciers to thin , stretch and weigh less overall , which also slowed them down .
" All this in a matter of a few short years for these two glaciers is not the way glaciologists are used to thinking , " Howat says .
" We 're used to thinking of the ice sheets in terms of millennia or centuries . "
The third co-author on the paper is Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado 's National Snow and Ice Data Center .
The work was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .

I wrote a little Python - based web application to do XML - style search of my blog entries .
It was a laboratory in which I studied structured search , microformats , in - memory data , and lightweight web applications .
Today I converted that application to IronPython .
My purpose is to explore what can be done with the combination of IronPython and the .NET Framework .
I ’ve reconstituted the original CPython - based searcher here :
services.jonudell.net:8000 /?
The new IronPython - based searcher is here :
services.jonudell.net:8001 /?
They look just the same , but you can tell which is which by looking in the browser ’s title bar .
One says CPython , the other IronPython .
Both are running on a Windows Server 2003 box — the same one , actually , that ’s been running the CPython version for the past few years .
The code ’s mostly the same too , except for the infrastructure parts .
The CPython version uses the simple BaseHTTPServer that comes with Python , and it uses libxml2 for XML parsing and and libxslt for XSLT transformation .
The IronPython version , instead , uses the .NET Framework ’s built - in webserver ( System. Net.HttpListener ) and XML facilities ( System.Xml ) .
It ’s pretty much an apples - to - apples comparison , as far as these things go .
Neither version is , or pretends to be , robust or scalable .
Both are using bare - bones HTTP implementations in single - threaded mode , which is a technique that I find perfectly appropriate for lots of handy little services and applications that are used lightly .
The two versions seem to perform about the same on most queries as well , though the IronPython version is way faster when you use the box labeled “ all paragraphs containing phrase ” .
So what ’s the point of this exercise ?
It demonstrates an unusual approach to using .NET , one that bridges between two very different cultures .
In the open source realm , an enormous amount of work gets done in dynamic languages that leverage components , or modules , or libraries , to do the heavy lifting in areas like HTTP and XML .
But it ’s a big challenge to integrate Python with , say , libxml2 , and it ’s that same challenge all over again when you want to connect PHP or Ruby to libxml2 .
Meanwhile , in the realm of Microsoft - oriented development , most of the work is being done in statically - typed languages .
These languages also rely on components , or modules , or libraries to do the heavy lifting .
But they can more effectively share the common heavy - lifting capability that ’s in the .NET Framework .
The best of both worlds , I believe , is dynamic languages fully connected to common infrastructure .
I ’m not alone in thinking that , and the Python / .NET combo is not the only way to get there .
Sean McGrath has said :
Jython , lest you do not know of it , is the most compelling weapon the Java platform has for its survival into the 21st century . [ 2004 ]
Today ’s experiment confirms my hunch that IronPython will be at least as compelling , and will open up the .NET Framework to lots of folks for whom the traditional methods of access are n’t appealing .
There was one fly in the ointment .
I had wanted to host this IronPython application on the Windows Communication Foundation ( WCF ) which would provide a much more robust engine than System .
Net ’s HttpListener .
And at first it looked like it would work .
But WCF service contracts require the use of a .NET feature called attributes .
It turns out there is n’t yet a way to represent those in IronPython .
If someone has figured out an intermediary that enables IronPython to implement RESTful WCF services , I ’d love to see how that ’s done .

In a retrieval once thought unattainable , scientists have recovered and identified proteins in a bone of a well - preserved Tyrannosaurus rex that lived and died and was fossilized 68 million years ago .
The scientists say the success , with advanced research techniques , opens the door for the first time to the exploration of molecular - level relationships of ancient , extinct animals , instead of just relying on their skeletal remains .
Dinosaur fossil hunters are planning nine expeditions this summer to search wide and deep for more specimens as promising candidates for similar tests .
A few large dinosaur bones already in laboratories may be examined for surviving traces of organic matter .
The earliest previously identified ancient proteins were from mammoths that died about 300,000 years ago .
The oldest confirmed samples of DNA , a more direct bearer of information of molecular evolution , but more degradable , have come from Neanderthals that lived 30,000 to 50,000 years ago .
The extraction of DNA would be necessary for studies in dinosaur genetics and for cloning experiments .

A comment from “ Archonix ” ( an Englishman ) at Gates of Vienna , 30 April 2007
[ T ]he EU economies are not substantially better than they were in the 90s .
Many are at the same level , others are worse .
Ask any Italian what he thinks of the economy at the moment and if you 're lucky he ’ll just shout at you for a few hours .
The only reason your dollars do n’t seem to go far any more is because the dollar has fallen significantly , not because the euro has risen .
The euro is placing a massive inflationary burden on the EU economies , which no longer have the mechanism of altering interest rates in order to control inflation .
Further , there is no mechanism for national debt transfer , as exists in the US , which places further inflationary pressure on individual member states .
This pressure is compounded by inflation in members states that are net recipients of EU funding ( Spain and Ireland as examples ) who are able to cut taxes to miniscule amounts because they ’re getting funded by the other EU member states .
All of this is combining to produce an inflationary economy with no control mechanism .
Unemployment has risen constantly within the euro zone since the euro was introduced , and productivity has fallen just as constantly .
National debts are going up , taxes are rising , GDP is falling .
[ …]
Individual nations are slowly losing their national customs as laws and regulations are ‘ unified ’ across the continent .
National institutions might appear unchanged , which might then present an image that the nations in question are unchanged , but this is simply a signature of how the EU functions .
Those national institutions have been hollowed out from the inside and replaced with EU functionaries and apparatchiks .
The EU bypasses national legislatures and operates through the implementation of an ever more powerful unelected bureaucracy of civil servants and managers .
Thus normality appears to remain .
However , in my country , the traditional and ancient freedoms of common law are being slowly abrogated by the implementation of bureaucratic systems .
Habeas corpus is being erased , the right to travel within the borders of this country are being erased , the freedom of the individual is being erased .
In fact , this country no longer officially exists .
Look at any EU - approved map and you ’ll notice that , while the UK is marked clearly , its constituent parts are not England , Ireland Scotland and Wales , but Scotland , Wales , northern Ireland , The North West , The North East , The Midlands , the south east , the south west and greater London .
My country is gone .
Your [ American ] revolutionary war was started with the cry of “ no taxation without representation ” .
Well , I am definitely no longer represented in the government that runs my country .
In all but a few areas , the laws that are implemented through Parliament are defined by the EU .
The elected government of this country now only has the freedom to legislate in a few areas ; foreign policy , health and education being the main .
Agriculture and environmental policy , transport , internal affairs of various sorts , prisons policy , immigration , these are all legislated by the EU , with barely a nod to the national legislature .
MPs will get perhaps 12 hours to examine a draft law in these areas before putting it to vote — which will generally be ignored anyway — and these drafts will often run to 30 pages .
An MP will get several of these drafts every single day , dozens in a week .
And this is just the legislation that is passed through Parliament .
The EU can simply define legislation as an administrative or technical regulation and bypass the elected legislature entirely .
All of this from an organisation that was sold to us on a lie .
The EEC was put across as a free trade zone .
I never voted for the creation of a supranational , unaccountable government that does not submit to the will of the people via an election .
In fact , I did not vote at all .
I have never had a say on whether I want my country — which no longer exists — to be a part of this .
The EU has no mandate and never has .
Now , Germany is a more apt comparison than you might realise .
Bismarck conceived the unification of Germany as a means to prevent the German kingdoms from fighting each other .
He began to implement it when those same kingdoms were on the verge of signing an unprecedented peace treaty ; his manipulations caused a war that gave him the pretext to simply conquer those other kingdoms , or trick them in to treaties that irrevocably tied them to his Imperial Germany .
He began with a customs union .
The EU has not resorted to wars to implement itself , but it began in the same way , and with the same aims .
The EU was conceived as a means to prevent another war like the Great War , but it was interrupted by the Second World War .
By the close of that war the political landscape had so changed that the concept of the EU was obsolete before the first treaties were even signed .
It is consequently an institution looking for a role , and it has since found that role by re-positioning itself as a counter to American ‘ hegemony ’ , a second pole against the US ’s presence in the world as a super - power .
This is in itself a foolish proposition ; historically it is more foolish still , because history demonstrates that it will cause more trouble than it is worth .
Bismarck ’s united Germany did become peaceful for a while , but that peace did n’t last long .
The internal fractures of the new Imperial Germany soon started to cause strife and resentment amongst the people of that country .
A solution was found in the redirection of the national angst toward external enemies .
The eventual result was the great war .
The result of that was World War 2 .
The ‘ unification ’ of the nations of Europe is the same thing on a much larger scale .
It is perhaps no coincidence that incidents of anti-Americanism have risen sharply since the signing of Maastricht .
The EU has placed itself in opposition to the United States .
It has inveigled itself so deeply in to the lives of its ‘ citizens ’ , so deeply embedded itself in to every aspect of life , that everything a person does is regulated in some way by the EU .
As examples ;
In order to install an electrical socket in my kitchen I must comply with at least eleven separate regulations .
Some are sensible , governing the type of wire to use and the general direction that wire should go in .
Others are nonsense ; in order to comply I have to place my sockets a certain distance from the floor no matter what their purpose .
EU regulations now mandate by law the kind of taps I ’m allowed to use in my bathroom .
They mandate the height of my door , the height of the gap between the door and the ceiling and the angle of my stairs , to millimetre precisions .
Every day I break about 30 laws whilst engaged in what were previously lawful activities .
Most of these laws are EU - inspired regulations prescribing the details of how activities are to be carried out .
My computer does not comply with regulations on lead content , electrical output or anything else , despite being perfectly safe .
The lights in my house will soon be made illegal .
None of this was done with the consent of Parliament .
None was done with the consent of the people of this nation .
These are just little things , little examples of how the EU interferes in every - day life .
They are a tiny fraction of the laws and regulations that are implemented by the EU ; thousands each year , each one limiting the freedom of people just that little bit more .
Sooner or later the sheer volume of regulations will start to affect people culturally .
Our culture is slowly being eroded and destroyed by this vile institution , our national identities removed , our freedoms erased , and the end result ?
Inevitably , it will be war , but before that will be a morass of dull , lifeless existence for millions of people shorn of everything that once made their nations great .
What price the ability to spend the same coin in 20 countries ?
We 'll admit , even we 're a bit frightened that immensely intelligent humanoid bots may one day oust us from these seats , but according to whispers going around at IBM's HQ , something just as momentous could be going down as early as this year .
Shortly after Lenovo told 1,400 of its US - based employees to politely hop off the payroll , IBM 's LEAN plan could call for over 100,000 American workers to be canned in favor of ( surprise , surprise ) hiring overseas .
Already , the firm has laid off 1,300 employees in 2007 , but according to a recent report , an ongoing " planning meeting " for how to handle the company 's Global Services could eventually axe " up to 150,000 US jobs " while hiring cheaper labor in China and India .
Interestingly , this news could actually be sweet music to Wall Street , at least in the short term , but we can't imagine how this logistical nightmare will ever bode well for Big Blue 's future .
クール なURIとは？
クールなURIとは変わらないもののこと。
どんなURIが変わってしまう？
URI は変わらない：人がそれを変更するのだ。
理屈の上では、人々がURIを変更するべき（もしくはドキュメントのメンテナンスをやめてしまう）理由は全くありません。しかし、現実には山ほど理由があります。
理論上では、ドメイン名空間の所有者はその空間を所有しており、したがってその中に含まれるURIも所有権を持ちます。ドメイン維持料が支払えない場合を除いて、その名前を保有し続けることを妨げるものはありません。そして理論上は、あなたのドメイン名のもとにあるURIは、完全にあなたの管理下にあり、望む限りそれを安定的に保つことができるのです。
ウェブからあるドキュメントが消えてしまう唯一の納得できる理由は、そのドメイン名を保持していた会社が廃業してしまうか、サーバーを維持できなくなったという場合ぐらいでしょう。では、どうして世の中に行き先を失ってしまったリンクがこれほどまでにたくさん存在するのでしょうか？
そのひとつは、単なる将来の見通しの欠如です。いくつか、よく耳にする理由を挙げてみましょう：
ウエブサイトをよりよいものにするために、再構築しました。 本当に以前のURIをそのままにしておくことは不可能だと思いますか？
もしそうであれば、よほどまずいURIを付けていたということです。新しいURIは、次のデザイン更新後にもそのまま使えるように、よく考えてください。
あまりにたくさんのファイルがあって、どれが古くなっていて、どれが秘密文書で、どれが正しいものか把握しきれなくなってきました。だから、全部取り除いてしまった方がよいと考えました。
これは私も分かる部分があります - W3Cも、アーカイブを公開するにあたって、非公開にするべきものはどれか慎重にふるいにかけなければならなかったときは、同じような状況でした。解決策は、将来をきちんと見通しておくことです
- 全てのドキュメントについて、配布しても良いもの、作成日と、できれば有効期限をきちんと把握しておきましょう。このメタデータをきちんと管理しておいてください。
つまりその、ファイルを移動しなければならないことになったので…
これはもっとも下手な言い訳の一つですね。多くの人は、URIとそれが指し示す実際のファイルの関係付けについて、Apacheなどのサーバーが多彩で柔軟なコントロール手段を提供しているということを理解していません。URI空間は抽象的な空間で、完全に整備されているものだと考えてください。そのうえで、実際に利用する実体に対応づけをおこないます。その対応関係を、サーバーに指示してください。ちょっと指示命令を書くだけで、サーバーにそれを実行させることだってできます。
ジョンはもうそのファイルを管理していなくて、今はジェーンが担当なんです。
ジョンの名前が、URIのどこかに関係があるのでしょうか？
ファイルが彼のディレクトリに入っている？ ああ、なるほど。
以前はこのためにCGIスクリプトを使っていましたが、今はバイナリのプログラムを使っています。
スクリプトによって生成されるページは" cgibin"もしくは" cgi"という領域におかなければならないと固く信じられているようです。これはあなたがサーバーを運用するメカニズムを露け出していることになります。サーバーの運用方法を変えたとすると（内容はまったく同じだとしても）おーっと、URIも全部変えなくてはなりません。
たとえ ばThe National Science Foundationを例にとってみましょう： NSF Online Documents
http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/pubsys/browser/odbrowse.pl ドキュメントを探す出発点となるメインページは、どう見てもこの先何年も同じ形でアクセスできるという保証を与えてくれそうにありません。" cgi-bin" や" oldbrowse"や " . pl" といったものはみな「私たちは今こうやっています」ということを示すものです。逆に、このページでドキュメントを探すと、その結果として最初に出てくるのも同様に芳しくない

http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf9814 という一覧ページです。しかしHTMLドキュメントそのものは遙かに優れた形になっています：
http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1998/nsf9814/nsf9814.htm
これを見ると、" pubs/1998"という最初の部分は、将来のアーカイブサービスがどんな形になっても、かつての1998というドキュメントの分類方法はそのまま使われると考えてよいように思えます。2098年にはドキュメント番号の付け方は違ったものになっているかもしれないけれど、このURIはそのまま有効で、NSFあるいはこのアーカイブの管理者はURIについて問題を抱えることはまずないでしょう。
URLが永続的である必要はないと思っていました - 永続的でなければならないのはURNなのだと。 これはURNについての議論の、もっとも問題のある副作用です。
より永続的な名前空間についての研究がなされているので、リンクが切れてしまっても「URNが問題を解決してくれる」から気にしなくてもいい、と考えているらしい人もいます。もしあなたがそう考えているなら、悪いけどちょっとがっかりしてもらいましょう。
私がこれまで目にしたURN手法のほとんどは、認証IDに日付と任意の文字列の組み合わせ、もしくは単なる任意の文字列といった類のものです。これは、見たところほとんどHTTPのURIと違いはありません。別の言い方をしてみましょうか。もしあなたの組織が永続的なURNをつくることができると思うなら、今すぐに実行して、それを自分たちのHTTPのURIに適用してそのことを証明してみてください。HTTPにはあなたのURIを不確実ものにするような要素はありません。原因はあなたの組織にあるのです。ドキュメントのURN
[ URI ]と現在のファイル名を対応づけるデータベースを作り、ウェブサーバーがそれを使ってきちんとファイルを呼び出せるようにしてください。
この点に納得がいったとして、あなたがソフトを開発するための時間と資金と依頼先をもっていない限り、次の言い訳がでてくるでしょう：
Editor ’s note :
The former New York Times Mideast Bureau chief warns that the radical Christian right is coming dangerously close to its goal of co-opting the country ’s military and law enforcement .
The drive by the Christian right to take control of military chaplaincies , which now sees radical Christians holding roughly 50 percent of chaplaincy appointments in the armed services and service academies , is part of a much larger effort to politicize the military and law enforcement .
This effort signals the final and perhaps most deadly stage in the long campaign by the radical Christian right to dismantle America ’s open society and build a theocratic state .
A successful politicization of the military would signal the end of our democracy .
During the past two years I traveled across the country to research and write the book “ American Fascists : The Christian Right and the War on America . ”
I repeatedly listened to radical preachers attack as corrupt and godless most American institutions , from federal agencies that provide housing and social welfare to public schools and the media .
But there were two institutions that never came under attack — the military and law enforcement .
While these preachers had no interest in communicating with local leaders of other faiths , or those in the community who did not subscribe to their call for a radical Christian state , they assiduously courted and flattered the military and police .
They held special services and appreciation days for all four branches of the armed services and for various law enforcement agencies .
They encouraged their young men and women to enlist or to join the police or state troopers .
They sought out sympathetic military and police officials to attend church events where these officials were lauded and feted for their Christian probity and patriotism .
They painted the war in Iraq not as an occupation but as an apocalyptic battle by Christians against Islam , a religion they regularly branded as “ satanic . ”
All this befits a movement whose final aesthetic is violence .
It also befits a movement that , in the end , would need the military and police forces to seize power in American society .
One of the arguments used to assuage our fears that the mass movement being built by the Christian right is fascist at its core is that it has not yet created a Praetorian Guard , referring to the paramilitary force that defied legal constraints , made violence part of the political discourse and eventually plunged ancient Rome into tyranny and despotism .
A paramilitary force that operates outside the law , one that sows fear among potential opponents and is capable of physically silencing those branded by their leaders as traitors , is a vital instrument in the hands of despotic movements .
Communist and fascist movements during the last century each built paramilitary forces that operated beyond the reach of the law .
And yet we may be further down this road than we care to admit .
Erik Prince , the secretive , mega- millionaire , right - wing Christian founder of Blackwater , the private security firm that has built a formidable mercenary force in Iraq , champions his company as a patriotic extension of the U.S. military .
His employees , in an act as cynical as it is deceitful , take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution .
These mercenary units in Iraq , including Blackwater , contain some 20,000 fighters .
They unleash indiscriminate and wanton violence against unarmed Iraqis , have no accountability and are beyond the reach of legitimate authority .
The appearance of these paramilitary fighters , heavily armed and wearing their trademark black uniforms , patrolling the streets of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , gave us a grim taste of the future .
It was a stark reminder that the tyranny we impose on others we will one day impose on ourselves .
“ Contracting out security to groups like Blackwater undermines our constitutional democracy , ” said Michael Ratner , the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
“ Their actions may not be subject to constitutional limitations that apply to both federal and state officials and employees — including First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights to be free from illegal searches and seizures .
Unlike police officers they are not trained in protecting constitutional rights and unlike police officers or the military they have no system of accountability whether within their organization or outside it .
These kind of paramilitary groups bring to mind Nazi Party brownshirts , functioning as an extrajudicial enforcement mechanism that can and does operate outside the law .
The use of these paramilitary groups is an extremely dangerous threat to our rights . ”
The politicization of the military , the fostering of the belief that violence must be used to further a peculiar ideology rather than defend a democracy , was on display recently when Air Force and Army generals and colonels , filmed in uniform at the Pentagon , appeared in a promotional video distributed by the Christian Embassy , a radical Washington - based organization dedicated to building a “ Christian America . ”
The video , first written about by Jeff Sharlet in the December issue of Harper ’s Magazine and filmed shortly after 9/11 , has led the Military Religious Freedom Foundation to raise a legal protest against the Christian Embassy ’s proselytizing within the Department of Defense .
The video was hastily pulled from the Christian Embassy website and was removed from YouTube a few days ago under threats of copyright enforcement .
Dan Cooper , an undersecretary of veterans affairs , says in the video that his weekly prayer sessions are “ more important than doing the job . ”
Maj. Gen. Jack Catton says that his being an adviser to the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a “ wonderful opportunity ” to evangelize men and women setting defense policy .
“ My first priority is my faith , ” he says .
“ I think it ’s a huge impact … .
You have many men and women who are seeking God ’s counsel and wisdom as they advise the chairman [ of the Joint Chiefs ] and the secretary of defense . ”
Col. Ralph Benson , a Pentagon chaplain , says in the video : “ Christian Embassy is a blessing to the Washington area , a blessing to our capital ; it ’s a blessing to our country .
They are interceding on behalf of people all over the United States , talking to ambassadors , talking to people in the Congress , in the Senate , talking to people in the Pentagon , and being able to share the message of Jesus Christ in a very , very important time in our world is winning a worldwide war on terrorism .
What more do we need than Christian people leading us and guiding us , so , they ’re needed in this hour . ”
The group has burrowed deep inside the Pentagon .
It hosts weekly Bible sessions with senior officers , by its own count some 40 generals , and weekly prayer breakfasts each Wednesday from 7 to 7:50 a.m. in the executive dining room as well as numerous outreach events to , in the words of the organization , “ share and sharpen one another in their quest to bridge the gap between faith and work . ”
If the United States falls into a period of instability caused by another catastrophic terrorist attack , an economic meltdown or a series of environmental disasters , these paramilitary forces , protected and assisted by fellow ideologues in the police and military , could swiftly abolish what is left of our eroding democracy .
War , with the huge profits it hands to businesses and right - wing interests that often help bankroll the Christian right , could become a permanent condition .
And the thugs with automatic weapons , black uniforms and wraparound sunglasses who appeared on street corners in Baghdad and New Orleans could appear on streets across the U.S.
Such a presence could paralyze us with fear , leaving us unable to question or protest the closed system and secrecy of an emergent totalitarian state and unable to voice dissent .
“ The Bush administration has already come close to painting our current wars as wars against Islam — many in the Christian right apparently have this belief , ” Ratner said .
“ If these wars , bad enough as imperial wars , are fought as religious wars , we are facing a very dark age that could go on for a hundred years and that will be very bloody . ”
Anyone paying attention to recent technology headlines knows that buying servers is just one part of the total cost .
It costs power to run them , and power to cool them , and power costs money .
AMD has just sponsored a study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory staff scientist Jonathan Koomey that tries to answer the question : just how much power do US servers slurp down each year ?
Koomey , who is also a consulting professor at Stanford , claims that his analysis is the most comprehensive to date and is based on the best available data from IDC .
He concludes that in 2005 , the total power consumption of US servers was 0.6 percent of overall US electricity consumption .
When cooling equipment is added , that number doubles to 1.2 percent — the same amount used by color televisions .
Between 2000 and 2005 , server electricity use grew at a rate of 14 percent each year , meaning that it more than doubled in five years .
The 2005 estimate shows that servers and associated equipment burned through 5 million kW of power , which cost US businesses roughly $ 2.7 billion .
Koomey notes that this represents the output of five 1 GW power plants .
Or , to put it another way , it 's 25 percent more than the total possible output from the Chernobyl plant , back when it was actually churning out power and not sitting there , radiating the area .
Data source : Jonathan Koomey
If current trends continue , server electricity usage will jump 40 percent by 2010 , driven in part by the rise of cheap blade servers , which increase overall power use faster than larger ones .
Koomey notes that virtualization and consolidation of servers will work against this trend , though , and it 's difficult to predict what will happen as data centers increasingly standardize on power - efficient chips .
Server power usage has become a big enough issue to interest the Environmental Protection Agency .
Andrew Fanara , who heads the team that develops the Energy Star specifications , applauded the new research and expressed hope that it would spur changes in the industry .
" The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) applauds AMD and this latest benchmarking effort to better understand the global impact data centers have on energy consumption , " he said .
" We are looking forward to continuing our work with the IT industry to forge new , energy - efficient solutions that benefit both consumers and our global environment . "
AMD hopes that these energy - efficient solutions will include their chips , and they now feature an entire line of efficient processors .
They 've even gone so far as to develop a ticker that shows the worldwide cost of not using AMD servers — an amount that currently stands at $ 1 billion .
Not that Intel has been sitting still .
The rollout of the Core platform has shown what the chip giant can do when it sets its collective mind to dealing with power - per - watt concerns , and Intel has been aggressively trumpeting the efficiency of its chips in speeches and through whitepapers for more than a year .
It 's hard to find any downside to the current focus on efficiency , unless you happen to be the CEO of Exelon .
It 's become so popular to " go green " ( and save money ) that the SPEC benchmarking consortium has even drawn up a metric for measuring power efficiency .
Saving money and lessening the Internet 's environmental impact should please both baby seals and corporate suits , something that 's tough to do , so more power to those working to use less .
NY Times slams Bush 's ' nasty and bumbling comments ' on US Attorney firings ; Calls on Congress to subpoena Rove , others Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday March 21 , 2007 Print This Email This According to the lead editorial in Wednesday 's New York Times , Democratic leaders were right to reject an " unacceptable " offer presented by the White House on Tuesday , which would allow unsworn testimony by White House officials behind closed doors , and should press on with planned subpoenas for Karl Rove and others .
" In nasty and bumbling comments made at the White House yesterday , President Bush declared that ' people just need to hear the truth ' about the firing of eight United States attorneys , " the Times editorial states .
" That s right .
Unfortunately , the deal Mr. Bush offered Congress to make White House officials available for ' interviews ' did not come close to meeting that standard . "
In his address , Bush defended his administration 's disclosure of an " unprecedented " amount of documents showing how the firing of those U.S. attorneys was handled .
" There is no indication that anybody did anything improper , " said Bush , asserting that Democrats were more interested in " scoring political points " than constructing an honest account of the firings .
The Times editorial continues , " Mr. Bushs proposal was a formula for hiding the truth , and for protecting the president and his staff from a legitimate inquiry by Congress .
Mr. Bushs idea of openness involved sending White House officials to Congress to answer questions in private , without taking any oath , making a transcript or allowing any follow - up appearances .
The people , in other words , would be kept in the dark . "
In a statement released before Bush 's remarks that was sent to RAW STORY , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) called on Rove to testify under oath .
" After telling a bunch of different stories about why they fired the U.S. Attorneys , the Bush Administration is not entitled to the benefit of the doubt , " Reid said .
" Congress and the American people deserve a straight answer .
If Karl Rove plans to tell the truth , he has nothing to fear from being under oath like any other witness .
Not very happy with the offer , Senator Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) called it a " very clever proposal , " and said that it will be considered by the Congressional committee leaders .
Democrats have been calling for on - the - record testimony by Rove , Miers and others , and the Senate may issue its own subpoenas .
" The Democratic leaders were right to reject the offer , despite Mr. Bushs threat to turn this dispute into a full - blown constitutional confrontation , " the Times editorial states .
" Congress has the right and the duty to fully investigate the firings , which may have been illegal , and Justice Department officials  statements to Congress , which may have been untrue . "
However , the Times editors find it " no great surprise that top officials of this administration believe they do not need to testify before Congress , " since " this is an administration that has shown over and over that it does not believe that the laws apply to it , and that it does not respect its co-equal branches of government . "
Still , the editorial adds , " Congress should subpoena Mr. Rove and the others , and question them under oath , in public .
If Congress has more questions , they should be recalled . "
Excerpts from Times editorial : #
It is hard to imagine what , besides evading responsibility , the White House had in mind .
Why would anyone refuse to take an oath on a matter like this , unless he were not fully committed to telling the truth ?
And why would Congress accept that idea , especially in an investigation that has already been marked by repeated false and misleading statements from administration officials ?
The White House notes that making misrepresentations to Congress is illegal , even if no oath is taken .
But that seems to be where the lack of a transcript comes in .
It would be hard to prove what Mr. Rove and others said if no official record existed .
The White House also put an unacceptable condition on the documents it would make available , by excluding e-mail messages within the White House .
Mr. Bushs overall strategy seems clear : to stop Congress from learning what went on within the White House , which may well be where the key decisions to fire the attorneys were made .
The White House argued that presidential advisers rarely testify before Congress , but that is simply not true .
Many of President Clintons high - ranking advisers , including his White House counsels and deputy chief of staff , testified about Whitewater , allegations of campaign finance abuses and other matters .

A team of scientists from Texas A&M University and The University of Glasgow Veterinary School in Scotland has discovered that naturally occurring endogenous retroviruses are required for pregnancy in sheep .
In particular , a class of endogenous retroviruses , known as endogenous retroviruses related to Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus or enJSRVs , are critical during the early phase of pregnancy when the placenta begins to develop .
Retroviruses , such as human immunodeficiency virus or HIV , are one class of viruses .
They are best known for their ability to cause diseases , said Dr. Thomas Spencer , a reproductive biologist with the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and Texas A&M University .
Findings published Sept. 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences demonstrate enJSRVs are essential for the development of the placenta in sheep .
Retroviruses are unique for their ability to permanently insert their genetic material into the DNA of host cells , he said .
During evolution of mammals , some retroviruses infected the germline ( cells of the ovary and testis that have genetic material that are passed to their offspring ) of the host , which is then inherited by their children .
These retroviruses , known as endogenous retroviruses , are present in the genome of all mammals , including humans .
Consequently , endogenous retroviruses can be considered remnants of ancient retroviral infections , Spencer said .
Many scientists believed these endogenous retroviruses were junk DNA , he said .

" Indeed , these endogenous retroviruses are usually harmless and generally contain mutations that prevent them from producing infectious retroviruses , " he said .
However , several endogenous retroviruses appear to provide protection from infection and are involved in reproduction .
For instance , the exogenous Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus or JSRV causes lung tumors in sheep and led to the death of Dolly , the world 's first mammal cloned from an adult cell .
The idea that endogenous retroviruses are important for reproduction in mammals has been around for about 30 years , Spencer said .
Studies in cultured cells have shown that a protein of a human endogenous retrovirus might have a role in development of the human placenta .
The team blocked expression of the envelope of the enJSRVs using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides , which inhibit translation of specific messenger RNA .
When production of the envelope protein was blocked in the early placenta , the growth of the placenta was reduced and a certain cell type , termed giant binucleate cells , did not develop .
The result was that embryos could not implant and the sheep miscarried , Spencer said .

Miscarriage is a serious medical problem for all mammals , including humans .
" Our research supports the idea that endogenous retroviruses shaped the evolution of the placenta in mammals and then became indispensable for pregnancy , and thus may be why they are expressed in the placenta of many mammals , " he said .
Further , Palmarini said , " The enJSRVs arose from ancient infections of small ruminants during their evolution , " said Dr. Massimo Palmarini , a virologist at The University of Glasgow Veterinary School .
" This infection was beneficial to the host and was then positively selected for during evolution .
In other words , animals with enJSRVs were better equipped than those without .
Therefore , enJSRVs became a permanent part of the sheep genome and , in these days , sheep can't do without them . "
The research team is trying to determine exactly how enJSRVs function in development of the sheep placenta .
Their results should have implications for both human health and animal production .
The team was led by Spencer and Palmarini .
Team members are Kathrin Dunlap , Robert Burghardt , Kanako Hayashi and Jennifer Farmer at Texas A&M , and Mariana Varela at The University of Glasgow Veterinary School .
The work of the research team has been funded by the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the National Institutes of Health in the U.S .
Last week was my birthday and I did n't feel very well waking up that morning .
I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say , " Happy birthday ! " , and possibly have a present for me .
As it turned out , she barely said good morning , let alone " Happy birthday " .
I thought ... well , that 's marriage for you , but the kids will remember .
My kids ate breakfast and did n't say a word .
So when I left for the office , I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent .
As I walked into my office , my secretary , Jane said , " Good morning boss , happy birthday ! "
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered .
I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said , " You know , it 's such a beautiful day outside , and it's your birthday , let 's go out to lunch , just you and me " .
I said , " Thanks Jane , that 's the greatest thing I 've heard all day .
Let 's go ! "
We went to lunch .
But we did n't go where we normally would go .
We dined instead at a little place with a private table .
We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously .
On the way back to the office , Jane said , " You know , it 's such a beautiful day ...
We do n't need to go back to the office , do we ? "
I responded , " I guess not .
What do you have in mind ? "
She said , " Let 's go to my apartment " .
After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said , " Boss , if you do n't mind , I 'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment .
I 'll be right back " .
" OK " , I nervously replied .
She went into the bedroom and , after a couple of minutes , she came out carrying a huge birthday cake ... followed by my wife , kids , and dozens of my friends and co-workers , all singing " Happy Birthday " .
And I just sat there ...
On the couch ...
Naked ...
YET ANOTHER INVESTIGATION ….ABC
News reports that the Office of Special Counsel has opened an investigation of GSA chief Lurita Doan .
You ’ll recall that she was the deer in headlights last week who pretended not to remember nothin ’ bout no PowerPoint presentations and , once the presentation in question was waved in front of her face , not to know what the word “ target ” meant vis-a - vis Democratic - held congressional districts in 2008 .
Not a clue in the world .
In the grand scheme of things , this investigation is n’t even in the top 20 .
But that says a lot about the Bush administration , does n’t it ?

We women hear the word " makeover " and we 're usually up for it because we know we 'll look cuter in the end .
A hair makeover , a style makeover -- who would n't want that ?
But a sex makeover ?
Uh - huh -- and here 's why .
No matter how satisfying ( or not ) your sex life is right now , you probably would n't mind adding a little more heat , a little more surprise , and a lot more closeness to the mix .
That means finding fresh ways to discover and delight in each other , whether you 've been together two years or 20 .
Our four - week plan delivers all that and helps you and your man have more fun in bed , to boot .
Here 's how it works :
Each week of the makeover has a different theme plus a list of activities to try - - building from no - touch intimacy boosters in Week 1 to sexy push - your - limits games in Week 4 .
Aim to do three or four activities per week -- you and he can take turns choosing which ones .
Most of them take less than half an hour , so you can do them all during the weekend , or spread them out over the course of the week .
Finally , for more on deepening your sexual connection , check out " The Love Doctor Is In " for further advice from Laura Berman , Ph.D. , host of the Showtime series Sexual Healing , who 's bean helping women and couples develop their passion potential for nearly two decades .
Now grab your guy and get ready to have fun !
[ WEEK ONE ] warm up
It 's hard to really enjoy sex with your guy if you 're mad at him .
That 's why it 's important to do a little healing before heading into new sexual territory -- think of it as cleaning out your emotional closet .
So for the first week of this makeover , you 'll stick to nonsexual activities that 'll get you primed for the sexy stuff .
* Feed each other 's ego
Build his self - esteem -- and yours -- by taking 10 minutes to say what you like about each other , both in and out of bed .
Be sure to cover three kinds of compliments : physical ( " You have a sexy butt " ) , appreciative ( " I really appreciate that you always pick up the kids " ) , and emotional ( " I feel so safe when I 'm with you " ) .
Aim for at least one of each , but the more , the better !
Then try to incorporate at least one additional compliment per day , all week long .
* Write each other forgiveness letters
Often , your sex life can be affected by emotional issues that you 're carrying around -- things you 've never talked about , but should .
Ava Cadell , Ph.D. , a Los Angeles sex therapist , uses " forgiveness letters " to help couples communicate important thoughts and feelings .
" The letter has to be specific , such as , ' When you made that joke about me at Joe and Lisa 's party , I felt really embarrassed .
I never said anything , but I 've been upset with you since then , and I 'd like to forgive you , ' " says Cadell .
" Then I make him read your letter back to you , to mirror your thoughts and make sure he is listening . "
( He gets to write his own letter , too . )
This process helps you to let go of anger and disappointment -- about things both small and large -- and feel that you 're being heard and understood by your partner .
* Play the " How I Like to Be Touched " game
Get prepped for the sexier activities in weeks to come by talking about the nonsexual touches that make you feel good .
You 're not allowed to have sex or touch each other 's genitals while doing this exercise .
Lie on the bed ( or wherever is comfortable ) , clothed or unclothed , and have your guy stroke you all over .
Have him try different strokes , such as kneading or sliding his fingers , to see what you like best .
Take turns , switching off after 15 to 20 minutes .
Ask each other questions like , " Do you like circular strokes or when I go up and down ? "
Narrate what you 're doing : " I 'm rubbing your legs , and now I 'm moving up to your buns . "
And it 's okay to giggle -- being goofy and loose together sparks your sex connection , too !
( This exercise has a perk :
You 'll end up using some of the strokes you liked as a warm up to steamy sex another time . )
* Critique each other -- constructively
Just as important as knowing what your partner likes is knowing what he does n't like .
This is the time to come clean and tell each other what you 'd like done a little differently , in a nonjudgmental way .
To soften the blow , try sandwiching each negative between two positives .
For example : " You know , I like it when you give attention to my nipples .
But sometimes you 're too rough .
I really love when you massage them softly with your fingers and lick them . "
Take turns giving each other suggestions and listening without interrupting .
( It 's harder to do that than you think ! )
* Just breathe
This is a tantric technique that helps you synchronize your sexual energy .
It will relax both of you and put you in the mood .
Sit facing each other and take slow , deep breaths together .
Hold hands .
Look into each other 's eyes .
Do n't talk .
Send him mental messages of love .
Try to stay like this for five minutes -- it can be very sexy to tap into each other 's rhythms this way .
* Redo your boudoir
A few small changes can turn your bedroom into a pleasure palace .
First , banish clutter -- the kids ' toys , stray socks , piles of bedside reading .
While you 're doing that , remove family photos , too ; this is the " romance room , " so the only photos you should have in there are shots of you and your husband .
To set a seductive mood , install a dimmer switch ( $ 5 at hardware stores ) on the bedside lamp so you can adjust it .
Candles are also essential .
( We all look sexier by candlelight . )
If you do n't already have a CD player in the bedroom , add one , along with some get - in - the - groove tunes .
For extra fun , create a " naughty box " -- a shoe box filled with sexy accessories like blindfolds , a feather , a vibrator , lube , massage oil , novelty condoms , and breath mints .
You two might enjoy browsing for supplies together online ( try babeland.com ) or at a bricks - and - mortar adult store .
Finally , put a lock on the door -- to keep the kids , the dog , and anyone else from barging in on you .
( See page 102 for tales from three readers who did n't ! )
the love doctor is in WEEK ONE
Sex Rx : A huge part of any sexual transformation happens outside the bedroom , says REDBOOK Love Network expert Laura Berman , Ph.D. , author of The Passion Prescription .
" Particularly for women , the brain is the main sex organ , " she says .
" More than orgasms , more than sexual response , more than body image , the one thing that predicts sexual satisfaction is the emotional connection we feel to the person we 're having sex with . "
That 's why much of the work Berman does with women and couples is emotional , not sexual .
( You can see her in action on her reality show , Sexual Healing , currently on Showtime . )
" Past hurts , trust issues , communication -- all of that is a huge part of what we focus on , " she says .
Berman starts couples off with an exercise similar to " feed each other 's ego . "
" Even if they 're angry , they have to put their anger aside and think of things they appreciate , " she says .
" Or we do ' Three things that make me feel loved ' or ' Three things that make me feel safe . ' "
On the other hand , sometimes a sexual activity opens up new ways of connecting .
One woman Berman worked with discovered just how much resentment she was holding toward her husband when she had trouble touching him in a tender way during a sexual exercise .
This inspired them to discuss some of their tough relationship issues .
If any activity in this makeover is truly upsetting to you , if either of you have a history of trauma or abuse , or if there are other emotional issues involved ( such as depression or infidelity ) , then consider seeing a therapist for help , says Berman .
You can find one in your area through the American Association of Sexuality Educators , Counselors , and Therapists ( aasect.org ) or the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy ( aamft.org ) .
If you 're looking for a sex therapist , make sure they 're also licensed in your state as a regular therapist .

[ WEEK TWO ] pleasure him
This week , you 'll be focusing on his sexual satisfaction .
( Do n't worry , you 'll go next ! )
By zeroing in on one partner at a time , you 'll both learn way more about what works and what does n't in bed -- and the person being treated gets to enjoy a week of sexual pleasure with no distractions .
* Treat him to an erotic massage
Even the most macho man likes a little pampering .
Pull his clothes off , throw him in the shower or tub , and soap him up .
Then explore his erogenous zones with a sensual massage .
Use your favorite massage oil or body lotion to smooth your strokes , and caress him everywhere .
Men are so penis - oriented that they themselves do n't often focus on their other hot spots .
Discover his .
Some guys have sensitive nipples , others have sensitive necks .
Try rubbing his feet or between his butt cheeks .
( He 'll probably like it all ! )
* Perform sexy shiatsu
What does he really want ?
For you to play with his penis !
Experiment with different strokes , suggests San Francisco sex educator Annie Sprinkle , Ph.D. , author of Dr. Sprinkle 's Spectacular Sex .
Try the technique Sprinkle calls " penis shiatsu " -- using finger pressure to drive him wild .
" Squeeze up and down with your thumb and forefinger , " says Sprinkle , " first front mad back and then on the sides . "
Sprinkle also recommends the " King 's Delight " : " Pay special attention to the frenulum , the area just below the head on the underside of the penis , " she explains .
" With one thumb on each side of the underside of the head , press and rub , making circles with your thumbs . "
* Get creative with oral sex
First of all , do n't worry too much about doing it " right . "
Men say that the number one thing that turns them on with oral sex is enthusiasm .
Your technique does n't have to be perfect , but it does n't hurt to mix it up with creative extras .
Try putting a Mentos in your mouth and then adding club soda .
This will create a fizzing , bubbly eruption in your mouth .
( And no , it 's not dangerous . )
You can also pop a strong mint for a fresh sensation .
* Heat things up with hot / cold play
Hot and cold sensations can add a whole new layer to sexy play .
Try sipping a hot drink before licking him in a sensitive spot and see how that feels .
Then drink something cold and see how he likes that .
Or try rubbing on a heated lube ; K-Y and FDS make ones that are available at any drugstore .
* Rough him up a little
Guys are very physical when it comes to sex , and they love to up the sexual energy with something that gets the adrenaline going .
Try " wrestling , " with or without clothes on .
If your guy is a lot stronger , handicap him by making him tussle with just one arm , or with his legs gently tied together .
Or get on top and pin down his arms yourself .
the love doctor is in [ WEEK TWO ]
Sex Rx : " It 's so rare that we get to be totally focused on receiving pleasure without simultaneously having to pleasure the other person , " says Berman .
" It 's also so difficult -- we feel anxious , serf - conscious , and guilty . "
Letting go and receiving pleasure can be as hard for a man as it is for a woman , Berman points out , " Contrary to what many women believe , a large part of a man 's sexual self - esteem comes from pleasuring his partner , " she says .
Men also experience a lot of performance anxiety -- is my erection hard enough ?
Will I last long enough for her ?
Slowing things down by using techniques such as the breathing exercise from Week One can help him get pest these anxieties .
Another exercise Berman suggests is to have your guy identify on a scale of one to 10 how aroused he is .
Repeatedly bring him to level six , then let him use breath and muscle control to come back down again .
" This exercise teaches him about sexual control , and you learn how to stimulate him , " says Berman , " but it 's very intimate and caring , as well as sexual . "
-- J. K .
[ WEEK THREE ] pleasure you
Now it 's your turn to let him do all the work .
Relax into it as he experiments with new ways to please you .
( If any of the activities from Week Two appeal to you , feel free to demand them instead - - or in addition ! )
* Play the " Hand Over " game
If you already played " How I Like to Be Touched " in Week One , get ready to take it one step further .
Put your hand over his and glide his hand over all ( yes , all ) the areas of your body that you want him to touch .
Have him experiment with different touches ( all controlled by you , of course ) :
Try the " petting " stroke , where he uses long , slow strokes , or the " orbit " stroke , where he swirls his finger up and around your most sensitive spots .
The " rock around the clock " stroke involves making tiny circles around your clitoris , with his forefinger stopping at 12:00 , 3:00 , 6:00 , and 9:00 .
" Many women seem to like the 2:00 or 3:00 positions the best , " says Sprinkle .
* Set an O goal
Extend this challenge :
You must have five orgasms this week .
( Five seem too easy ?
Make it 10 !)
He can give you one a day , or all five in one gloriously long session , but you have to reach the goal within seven days .
Not only will this trigger his goal - oriented , competitive side , but he 'll also be inspired to new heights of creativity as he works to take you across the finish line .
* Enjoy an erotic bedtime stow
Buy a book of erotica ( browse at cleispress.com ) and have him read you a story .
Hearing his voice describing the sex other people are having can be amazingly arousing .
And soon enough you 'll probably find yourself saying , " We should do what they 're doing . "
* Try a " trigasm "
You probably have a few tried - and - true ways of reaching orgasm , but adding extra stimulation can kick everything up a notch .
Have him stimulate your clitoris with his tongue , touch your G - spot ( located an inch or two inside your vagina , on the front wall ) with his finger , and stroke your anal area with another finger , all at the same time .
This can produce a more powerful orgasm .
* Light up with pleasure
Turn off the lights , take a flashlight , and guide the glow to areas of your body that you want him to lick or rub .
Start with your neck , ears , nipples -- go wherever you want him to explore .
Even if it 's a nonsexual area like your back , he has to pay attention to that area until you stop shining the flashlight on it .
the love doctor is in [ WEEK THREE ]
Sex Rx : Surrendering to being pleasured can be especially difficult for women , who are often taught to put their own needs last , says Berman .
" Also , when the focus is on you , you feel more vulnerable , more insecure about your insecurities , whether it 's about your body or your genitals or your sexual response , " she says .
" You might feel like you 're taking too long and he 's getting bored . "
Sit back and do n't worry about what he 's thinking -- just concentrate on the sensations throughout your own body .
-- J.K.
[ WEEK FOUR ] take it to the next level
Now it 's time to push your limits , just a little , together .
In this final week , you 'll add more hot moves to your sexual repertoire , get honest about your desires , and embark on some fun new adventures .
* Make a wish list
Sometimes simply asking for what you want in bed can be scary .
Writing it out makes it easier .
Each of you should write down five new things you would actually like to try ( no fantasies you 'd never really do ) .
You can also list things you 've already done but want to do more of .
Then share lists , and each of you pick one thing off the other 's list to try this week .
If you like , turn this fantasy fulfillment into a fun game by writing each idea down on a slip of paper , then drawing them out of a hat .
Pick two to try this week -- and keep your lists to refer to after the makeover is finished !
* Talk dirty
Not comfortable with dirty talk ?
Ease into it , says Sprinkle , who suggests starting with simple phrases like " That 's good " or " Yes , there . "
Then work up to " Mmm , it feels so good when you ?. "
Once you 're comfortable , add more detail , maybe even some spicy language .
Do n't be shy ; this is the time to enjoy saying dirty words and being a bad girl .
This week , each of you should try talking dirty , whatever that means to you -- at least once .
Even if you do n't love it , you 'll get to stretch yourselves by trying on a new way of expressing yourselves in bed , which will help both of you to be more open .
* Take turns taking control
Ever wanted to be more take - charge in bed but were afraid to tell him ?
Or maybe he wants you to be more dominant , but he 's never had the courage to ask .
One day this week , you get to be completely in charge - - yes , completely .
Try tying him up , blindfolding him , spanking him ( gently ! ) , bossing him around .
( This is especially satisfying when you have PMS . )
Then switch roles .
If you like , you can add in some role - play , like being a cop and a crook , or a teacher and a naughty student .
You might burst out laughing at first , but keep going -- playing with control and submission can be a powerful way of reaffirming your trust in each other , both in bed and within your relationship .
At the very least , you 'll have some silly fun with it .
* Strike a few new poses
Experiment with at least one new position , such as the " reverse cowgirl , " where you sit on his lap facing away , or the " doorman , " where you lift up your leg and do it standing up against a door .
( Want more ideas ?
Check out the books Position of the Day Playbook from Nerve.com or The Little Bit Naughty Book of Sex Positions by Siobhan Kelly . )
Afterward , each of you can rate the position 's hotness on a scale of one to five .
* Do it somewhere different
Make it your mission to have sex in at least two different rooms this week .
Or try a road trip :
Next time you head to the store , pick a secluded place to pull over and get some lovin ' .
Try a little backseat action , or sit on his lap in the passenger seat .
Just like a road trip , passionate sex is all about looking at new things , discovering surprises , getting lost , and getting back on the road again .
Make sure your " road trip " has its exciting moments and challenges -- and enjoy the adventure !
the love doctor is in [ WEEK FOUR ]
Sex Rx : Moving beyond your comfort zone is key to growing , both emotionally and sexually , says Berman .
" You have to take risks to make the change you want , " she says .
Changing your usual routine can also shake things up physically , she points out : " Doing things that feel just a little frightening inspires dopamine production , which can boost your libido .
That 's why I often direct couples to go rock climbing or skydiving as part of their therapy . "
If any of these exercises brings up anger or frustration with your partner -- or simply makes you a little uncomfortable -- it 's important to express yourself honestly without attacking , just as you should with any conflict
Try to work through your discomfort , Berman says , but if you 're feeling very upset or unusually uncomfortable , do n't push yourself ; read the information in Week One about how to know if you might benefit from working with a therapist .
Whether you do it on your own or with help , exploring your sexual boundaries can help you two maintain a passionate bond for a lifetime .
" Your sexual responses change throughout your life , so it 's important to take the pulse of your sex life every now and then , " Berman notes .
" Something you might have been totally opposed to trying five years ago might be something you 're now fantasizing about .
Or the moves that worked before to get you in the mood might not work anymore .
Revisiting your sexual needs will help you to keep growing and changing as a couple , and that 's all part of being in a vibrant , healthy sexual relationship . "

On The Situation Room yesterday , John McCain told Wolf that the surge is so encouraging that General Patraeus now travels around in unarmored Humvees and American soldiers can walk around the streets of Bahdad safely .
When confronted today by John Roberts , McCain backpeddled faster than he did on gay marriage in Iowa .

Roberts : I checked with General Petraeus ' people overnight and they said he never goes out in anything less than an up armored Humvee .
You also told Bill Bennett on his radio program on Monday .. you said there are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhood today , yet retired General Barry McCaffrey said no Iraqi government official , coalition soldier , diplomat reporter could walk the streets of Baghdad without heavily armed protection .
We ’ve got two different stories here ... Who ’s right ?

Let 's go back to our teenage years WHEN I COULDN " T KEEP MY HANDS OFF OF YOU !!!
Recall when I wanted to have sex in the stairway , at the bus stop , during gym under the bleachers , after school before my parents got home , in the parked car , and even climb through your window at night while your parents were asleep ?!!!!
AND THAT WAS ALL IN ONE DAY !!!
Hell , I could last for hours , shoot my load , and be ready to go again in 15 minutes !!!
But what did I hear from you , a young , demure , selfish , cock tease ?!!!
" No ... wait till tomorrow . " , " Let 's just cuddle . " , " The cat is watching . " , and the classic " Is that all you think i'm good for ? " !!!!!
Well ladies , the shoe is on the other foot and guess what ?
I 'm tired !!!
I 'm tired from sheer exhaustion of chasing your cock teasing ass for the last 25 years !!!!
Constantly , going home with " blue balls " and " whacking off " because you want me to " respect you in the morning " !!!!
Well guess what years of cock abuse has done to my sex drive ?!!!!
Yes ladies , it 's your fault I have no interest in sex !
Not getting any and whacking off to porn for 25 years has desensitized my nerve endings to the point that I feel nothing from my navel to my knees !!!!
Fantasizing about every possible way of f'ing your brains out has distorted reality for me !!!
You , walking in with nothing on under a fur coat pales in comparison to me fantasizing about you rimming my ass while I fuck your sister in front of 18,000 adoring fans at the United Center !!!!
It 's your fault for teasing away the most potent years of my life .
You should have taken advantage of my erections from your cat jumping on my crotch when you had the chance , but nooooooo !!!!
You wanted to babysit your neice and " pretend " we were a family !!!!
Now , in the height of your sex drive , you want muah to pin your legs behind your ears after a long day at work , and give it to you for more than 10 minutes a month ?!!!!!
PUH-LEASE !!!!
Nope !
You see ... now you will suffer the same inglorious defeat I experienced many moons ago .
So .... go to ' The Exotic Emporium ' , get yourself a multi-speed , gyrating , flesh feeling , thingamabob , a handful of Peter North dvds , and come up with creative ways to sneak aroud the house and have yourself a little " Par- tay " !!!!
Otherwise , be prepared to wine me , dine me , take me golfing , and stroke my little ego until I 'M IN THE MOOD !!!
And ... do n't give me that crap about going out and getting some " young , dumb , and full of cum " kid .
I 'll divorce your ass so fast your fallopians will get twisted !!!
AND afterward , I will get the chance to re-live those glory years with some young , nubile , tight bodied , coed looking for a sugar daddy !
( Even if it is once a month ! )
Better than thinking of her while trying to have sex with your old , sagging , " has - been " ass !!!
So , the next time you think about making some smart ass remark like , " Mr. 5 minute man . " , or " I did n't even get started . " just remember that 25 years of neglect is the reason why Mr. Willie does n't get excited to see you anymore !!!!
The National Institutes of Health began the Women ’s Health initiative in 1992 to determine if there were ways to help prevent the most common causes of death , disability and impaired quality of life among mature women .
This 15 - year project is one of the largest prevention studies of its kind .
We all want to know how to stay healthy and youthful as we age !
The clinical intervention part of the study is a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial of 39,876 healthy women followed for just over a decade .
Half took vitamin E and the others a placebo ( “ sugar pill ” ) .
Last year , the results were released finding that vitamin E proved to be of no benefit in protecting women from cardiovascular disease , stroke or cancer .
And it did n’t matter what were the women ’s menopausal status , hormone use , BMI ( body mass index ) , alcohol intake , smoking status or physical activity .
The researchers have now reported that vitamin E also failed to offer any benefits for preventing type 2 diabetes .
There has been a lot of public interest in antioxidants and what seemed like the magic bullet for preventing chronic diseases of aging .
This is a terrific illustration of why careful clinical trials on real people followed for many years are so important before we jump to conclusions about the cause or benefit of something based on observational epidemiological studies on large groups of people or select populations ( “ cohort ” ) ; or laboratory or rat studies .
In the laboratory and in animal experiments , vitamin E appeared to work as a vigorous antioxidant against those free radicals that can lead to diabetes .
And several population studies found an association between higher intakes of vitamin E in the diet and lower incidences of type 2 diabetes .
Similarly , laboratory and animal research suggested that vitamin E might prevent the accumulation of fatty deposits inside arteries and reduce clogged arteries .
Large observational studies also found associations between people eating foods high in vitamin E or taking supplements and lower risks for heart disease .
But as these researchers noted , those types of studies can never indicate a cause because they cannot account for bias and measurement errors and , most importantly , isolate if the effect was actually due to the thing being measured or if that was simply a marker for something else entirely .
Only a well - designed , carefully conducted clinical trial can do that .
Perl tricks by N EIL K ANDALGAONKAR

Look here for a nicer version of this page that Neil made .

Primality regex
I found the actual one - liner Abigail originally used from http://www.mit.edu:8008/bloom-picayune.mit.edu/perl/10138:
perl - wle ' print " Prime " if ( 1 x shift ) !~ /^1 ?$ |^( 11 +? ) \1+$ /' [ number ]
How it works
STATEMENT if COND
Cool perl syntax , a statement may have ' modifiers ' at the end like this .
See man perlsyn .
shift
shift normally removes the first element of an array and returns that element , like popping from the beginning .
Since we are in file scope , shift without array is magically interpreted to mean " shift @ARGV " , which means the number we fed in as an argument .
( see perldoc - tf shift ) .
1 x shift
x is the repetition operator .
In this context , 1 is treated as a string " 1 " .
If the number was 9 , " 1 " x 9 yields " 111111111 " .
( see man perlop , grep for ' repetition operator ' . )
!~
The logical negation of =~ , will succeed if the regex does NOT match .
Since we are looking for primes , the regex will should match all NON - primes .
The regular expression
/ ^1 ? $ # matches beginning , optional 1 , ending .
# thus matches the empty string and " 1 " .
# this matches the cases where N was 0 and 1
# and since it matches , will not flag those as prime .
| # or ... ^ # match beginning of string
( # begin first stored group
1 # match a one
1+? # then match one or more ones , minimally .
) # end storing first group
\ 1+ # match the first group , repeated one or more times .
$ # match end of string .
/x
Example
To see how it works let 's consider the case of N = 9 .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \1 ) The ^( 11 +? ) will match two ones at the start , and call it \ 1 .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \1 ) [ ] [ ] [ ]
Next \ 1 + matches one or more strings identical to \ 1 .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \1 ) [ ] [ ] [ ] END Oops , but the string does n't end there : backtrack !
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \1 ) [ ] [ ] END no ... backtrack !
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \1 ) [ ] END no ... backtrack !
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \ 1 )
Try matching three ones at the start store it as \ 1 .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \ 1 ) [ ] [ ] \ 1 + Matches 2 more times .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
START ( \ 1 ) [ ] [ ]
END
The end of string is next -- match !
So , you can see how this process is analogous to trying to divide a number by successively larger divisors , leaving no remainder .
In the case of a prime number , this is never going to succeed .
This vs. mine
BTW : this also is much more efficient than the one I showed the group , with the addition of a single character !
My regex always had to backtrack from the maximal match ; since Abigail made the 11 +?
match minimal it will start by trying to " divide " the number by 2 , then 3 , etc .
It will reject 32000 instantly , and take somewhat longer to determine that 32003 is prime .
A good reminder that backtracking does n't always reduce the size of a matched portion ; with minimal matches it will backtrack and try matching more .
As Hugo Chavez continues in his quest to drag the nation of Venezuela into the hell hole known as the “ worker ’s paradise ” , those Venezuelans who can afford it are packing up and leaving in ever increasing numbers :
As Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez further tightens control of the South American country ’s economy , wealthy Venezuelans who once thought they could live with his socialist edicts are turning to their backup plan – flight to the United States , particularly Florida .
Venezuelans have long gobbled up condos and pre-construction deals in Florida as investments , but the latest buyers want homes where they can live and business properties that will help them earn a green card .
“ First the people who come are the businessmen in the highest circles , then the losing politicians , then the military and then the professionals , ” said Miami - based immigration attorney Oscar Levin .
“ You ’re beginning to see the ( Venezuelan ) professionals . ”
This latest and largest potential group of emigrants say they fear the effect Chavez ’s socialist policies will have on the economy and on proposed educational reforms that could mirror the ideologically imbued education of Chavez ally and mentor , Cuba ’s Fidel Castro .
And , as Chavez comes to even more closely resemble his hopefully soon - to - be - dead mentor , the number of people getting out of the country is increasing :
Between 2000 – a year after Chavez took office – and 2005 , the number of Venezuelans living in the U.S. doubled to about 160,000 , according to the latest U.S. Census numbers .
Nearly half live in Florida .
But those numbers are deceptive .
In 2005 , 10,645 Venezuelans received their green cards allowing them to live in the United States , almost doubling the 6,222 who received them in 2004 , according to the latest Department of Homeland Security statistics .
And another 400,000 Venezuelans came to the United States in 2005 on business and tourism visas .
It is unclear how many stayed .
Colombia , with nearly twice Venezuela ’s roughly 27 million residents , sent the same number that year .
And it ’s not just rich Venezuelans who are trying to leave .
As I noted back in January , Venezuelans from all economic groups have been lining up at American and foreign embassies in Caracas for the visa that will allow them to leave the country .
We can , I think , expect more of this as Venezuelas slide into socialism continues .
There is one thing that could save the country , and it ’s something that has happened in Central and South American before when leftist regimes started going too far .
A military coup that deposes Chavez and puts the country back on the road to sanity would not necessarily be a bad thing right now .
H/T : QandO
Earth to Educators : People Hate School By Bryan Caplan
Brad DeLong raises an important puzzle :
One would have thought that the rise in the value of a sheepskin from a 30 % lifetime wage premium over a high - school diploma in 1975 to a 90 % premium in 2005 would have called forth an extraordinary wave of public support and public funding for investment in education that would have pushed that premium down somewhat : lots more Americans should be getting a higher education now than were getting one in the mid-1970s .
But they are n’t .
Part of the explanation is that this “ lifetime wage premium ” blends the return to education with the return to ability .
Clever counter - arguments notwithstanding , people who currently do n’t go to college would n’t earn the “ expected ” return if they enrolled because they have less ability to begin with .
Even so , I am convinced that – holding ability constant – a college degree pays a lot more than it used to .
So Brad ’s puzzle remains .
Why are n’t more people going to college ?
The best explanation is one that educators – and above all college professors – find almost impossible to believe : Lots of people truly hate school .
They find it insufferably boring , pointless , and pompous .
Even a massive increase in the return to education is n’t enough to make them willing to endure four more years of pointless , pompous boredom .
In technical terms , my claim is that our currently high return to education is a compensating differential .
As demand for educated labor has gone up , the marginal college student has rapidly become a person who hates school , and has to be paid a ton of compensation for the pain and suffering of listening to people like Brad and me for hours on end .
If you ’re tempted to respond , “ But I love school , and so do all my friends .
Ah , the life of the mind , what could be better ? ” let me gently remind you that readers of economics blogs are not a random sample of the population .
Most people would hate reading this blog ; you read it just for fun !
To paraphrase Rambo , “ What you call home , they call hell . ”

France 's Maginot line was sidestepped by German forces early in the second world war , rather than the first as we stated in the article below .
This has been corrected .
The new age of the wall has begun .
Ramparts and stone fortifications , regarded until recently as national relics and tourist attractions , are back with a vengeance in the " global war on terror " .
The White House indicated yesterday it would press ahead with building a three - mile wall between Sunni and Shia neighbourhoods in Baghdad , despite the objections of the Iraqi government .
The US insists it will be a temporary barrier , made of moveable sections .
But each giant concrete segment weighs 6.3 tonnes and recent history suggests that once such substantial barriers go up , it takes a lot to take them down .
In Belfast , the " peace walls " are still there , years after the guns fell silent .
When the Berlin Wall first went up in August 1961 , East Germany portrayed its construction as an emergency measure but it grew into a concrete behemoth that divided Europe for 28 years .
When it was finally brought down in 1989 , it seemed for a while as if such barriers had had their day as a means of resolving political problems .
The Baghdad barrier is just the latest of a string of fences , screens and other such engineering solutions to the quest to keep people apart , for their own protection or for the benefit of rulers .
The conflict resolution business is in decline and the concrete industry is taking its place .
Nowhere is that more evident than in the Palestinian occupied territories , where peace initiatives have taken a back seat in recent years to the construction of a " separation barrier " that has been built around the West Bank to match the one enclosing the Gaza Strip since 1994 .
Israel insists the barrier is serving its purpose , sharply reducing the incidence of suicide bomb attacks .
Palestinians who live in the West Bank look on the ramparts as a prison wall , designed to make the fragmentation of their ancestral lands an established fact .
The West Bank barrier and Baghdad 's wall are not the only solid dividing lines rising from the map of the Middle East .
The United Arab Emirates is building a fence along its border with Oman .
The Saudi government , meanwhile , may resume work on a half - built barrier of sandbags and pipes on its frontier with Yemen , after a three - year delay brought on by furious Yemeni objections .
The UAE wall is primarily intended to keep immigrants out , while the Saudi barrier is being built principally with terrorists in mind .
But most of the walls under construction now are meant to serve both functions .
The fences built around the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in north Africa , and the barrier on the Mexican border proposed by the US Congress to join up existing barriers , are two such dual - purpose projects .
The walls of ancient citadels became redundant with the development of high - explosive tank shells and aerial bombing .
France 's Maginot Line , effortlessly sidestepped by German forces early in the second world war , signalled the end of that era .
However , in the post - September 11 world , the principal threats to national security do not come in tanks and warplanes but a single terrorist crossing a border wielding a passport .
For that reason , Thailand is proposing to build a 400 - mile barrier along its border with Malaysia in the hope that it will insulate the country from the scourge of Islamist extremism .
In some places walls still serve their ancient purpose of enclosing territory and keeping enemy hordes at bay .
The modern descendant of the Great Wall of China and Hadrian 's Wall is the huge sand berm built by Morocco to keep Polisario guerrillas out of the slice of the Western Sahara it claims as its own .
Unlike its predecessors , which relied on height and sentries to keep the enemy out , the Moroccan wall is enforced with electronic surveillance equipment and landmines , but the purpose is similar .
Not since medieval times have walls been so in demand around the world .
They are even springing up among old fortifications in Europe , where the tradition of the ghetto is rising again in its birthplace , Italy .
In Padua , the city fathers have erected a wall around a district inhabited mostly by African immigrants , blamed for the local proliferation of drugs and prostitution .
Similar walls were contemplated in Milan and in the Czech Republic , both aimed at keeping Roma , or gypsies , away from the host community , but both projects were abandoned after an outcry by civil rights groups .
While such concerns have won sporadic battles , there is no doubt that walls are once more in the ascendant , propped up by communal fears of outsiders .
The few years following the fall of the Berlin Wall may be seen in years to come as an exception in the broad stretch of human history , during which people briefly thought they could live unprotected by physical barriers .
For some rock and roll fans it may forever be " only baloney " .
But Roy Orbison devotees are about to be able establish for sure that the singer was in fact warbling " only the lonely " .
The age - old confusion over song lyrics , a source of fascination to some and frustration to others , is about to be cleared up , thanks to the internet .
Under a deal between leading US publishers and Yahoo.com , authorised music lyrics will for the first time be offered on a website .
" You mean Bob Dylan is n't actually saying ' The ants , my friend , are in a bowling pin ? ' " said Ian Rogers , general manager of Yahoo !
Music .
" Finally , a free , legal and definitive way to settle a bet with the guy sitting next to you at the bar who is certain the Ramones ' most famous anthem declares ' I wanna piece of bacon ' .
It fills a huge gap out there . "
Initially , Yahoo's database will include the lyrics to 400,000 songs by 9,000 artists , ranging from the Beatles and Bob Dylan to Prince and Beyoncé .
Nearly 100 music publishers , including BMG Music Publishing , EMI Music Publishing , Sony / ATV Music Publishing , Universal Music Publishing Group , and Warner / Chappell Music , have signed up to the deal .
" We think we can build a really healthy business for lyrics and I think publishers stand to gain quite significantly from this new revenue stream , " Mr Rogers said .
" With the popularity of lyrics on the internet , advertisers want to be there .
This is definitely a selling point . "
Music lyric searches are a popular aspect of the internet , and Yahoo hopes to cash in on the trend by charging for any advertising accompanying the lyrics .
" Song lyrics are continually among the top 10 searches performed on major search engines , though the results often [ give ] consumers a frustrating experience filled with inconsistent and incomplete lyrics , and annoying pop-ups , " said Craig Palmer , president of Gracenote , the digital media company offering the service in partnership with Yahoo .
Mr Palmer said that within 10 years the revenue from licensing lyrics this way would reach $ 100 m a year , boosting the current worldwide music publishing revenues , estimated at $ 4bn annually .
The deal comes at the end of years of negotiations between leading publishers searching for a service that would provide revenue and counter the success of unauthorised websites .
Dozens of websites , with names such as lyrics.com and azlyrics.com , offer free lyrics , but the music publishing industry , represented by the Harry Fox Agency , has taken legal action to shut down many of them .
" The major advantage is that they 're going to start getting paid for something that has been available for free , " said Phil Leigh , an analyst with Inside Digital Media , who added that he thought publishers had been adapting to the internet " at the speed of a glacier " .
He said : " It 's just taken the publishers a long time to get their act together . "
Other sites , such as Google and iTunes , will probably follow suit .
" We would n't be in the business to launch just one service , so stay tuned , " said Mr Palmer .
Word play
Everyone 's suffered a lyrical faux pas .
A friend was once heard singing along to Prince with the words " Do you recollect ? "
The fact the song was named Little Red Corvette did not seem to offer a clue .
Obtuse personal interpretations aside , there is also the often misquoted " Rebel , Rebel put on your dress " , Bowie 's actual words being " Rebel , rebel , you 've torn your dress " .
There 's no excusing those who missed the point entirely in Jimi Hendrix 's Purple Haze , singing " Excuse me , while I kiss this guy " .
The sky , surely ?

Wormhole anti-pattern
Somebody ( I will get the name ) at TW once described this ( and coined the name as far as I can tell ) but I have n't seen anything much about ( at least by name ) online .
So here goes :
The Wormhole Anti-Pattern arises when each change on one end of your application ( e.g. the Database ) requires a corresponding change on the other end ( e.g. you Web page ) ( and often all the layers in between ) as if there was a wormhole that opened up and teleported those changes right through your pretty little architecture .
It seems to happen when the design encompasses many layers , but these layers are not there to abstract one functioning sub-system from the others so much as to simply separate it .
Jon Tirsen has nice little rant over on his blog that describes the effects ( and some of the causes ? ) of the wormhole ( although he does n't call it that ) .
As Jon points out , distribution is a key component of a wormhole opening up .
Its also ironic , because a big reason that system designers cite for doing all of this separation by layer is to insulate each one from changes in the other .
The best way to avoid wormholes ?
For one , do n't separate the layers .
If you do n't have an explicit -- and specific -- benefit to include a separation then its a good bet you 've over - architected the system .
Second , look for abstractions along the layering boundaries .
The first guideline covers all of the cases where your app is just passing data through , so this one is for all of that behavior you have left .
Move the behavior to the right layer , and leave the other layers to do their job .
Patterns seem to get people in trouble here , so I am going to single that out : Patterns are guidelines , and descriptions of common system designs , not blueprints that you shoehorn your system into .
If you have wormholes , and you are n't just doing data pass - through , chances are you 've got behavior in the wrong layer , and are having to duplicate the data accordingly -- I do n't care what the pattern book says .
Are there always going to be changes that will affect every sub-system ?
The answer is unfortunately , probably yes .
But they should be the rare exception .
If they are happening all the time , look to plug those wormholes .
Directions :
Spray on generously after penis is erect ( hard ) , taking care to completely cover organ with gooey tar - like substance .
Quickly pinch a half to 1 inch " go large " reservoir tip , during Holidays form reservoir into Santa hat or snowman shape for extra fun .
If you partner requires extra stimulation , take pencil or similarly shaped object and bang out ribs into shaft portion of product .
Proceed to sex , if you feel the Spray - On break , stop immediately .
Apply more product before continuing .
After ejaculation and before penis gets soft , soak in boiling water then remove carefully with putty knife .
Warning :
Drugs and alcohol may affect your judgment , do not use Spray - On if you have consumed a case of beer or 6 - 10 shots of tequila .
The Federal Communications Commission will soon release a new cable ownership order that would bar cable companies from serving over 30 percent of pay television subscribers in the US .
If the order is adopted by the FCC , it would make the currently enforced 30 percent limit a matter of law .
The 30 percent cap stems from a 1992 change to the nation 's cable - ownership regulations by the FCC .
Spurred by a concern that cable networks would have too few distribution outlets if the cable industry consolidated , the FCC decreed that no single company could serve more than 30 percent of the homes passed by cable companies .
A few years later , the homes - passed metric was dropped in favor of total cable subscribers , but the 30 percent cap was kept in place .
In 2001 , a federal court overturned the FCC 's ownership limit and told the Commission to come up with a new set of guidelines for cable ownership .
The new order in the works is a belated response to the 2001 ruling ; in the intervening period , the FCC has continued to enforce the 30 percent limit , refusing to approve mergers where the combined entity would serve more than three in ten cable subscribers .
Last month , Comcast formally challenged the FCC 's unofficial limit , forcing the FCC 's hand .
Comcast argued that the rationale for limiting ownership — a lack of outlets for broadcasters — was a " relic that can not be justified . "
The cable giant points to the growing number of alternatives in the video marketplace , including the Internet , mobile phones , P2P networks , satellite , and other on - demand services as evidence that the market has changed to the point where a cap is no longer necessary .
The National Cable Television Association is also opposed to the new rules .
" Any FCC order adopting the same 30 percent cap tossed out by the courts would be astonishing , " NCTA President & CEO Kyle McSlarrow told Ars.
Pointing to the entry of Verizon and AT&T into the video market and the FCC 's willingness to sign off on massive consolidation in the telecom industry ( AT&T and BellSouth , Verizon and MCI ) , McSlarrow says that " in this day and age , given the competitive environment , the right answer is to say there is no cap . "
Comcast is the largest cable provider in the US , currently serving around 28 percent of US cable subscribers , and may soon find itself bumping up against a 30 percent cap , be it formal or informal .
Should that happen , Comcast would be forced to turn away new customers , and the cap rules out the possibility of the cable company purchasing anything other than a very small player in the cable market .
The TV landscape has changed in ways that the 1992 and even 2001 actions could not have envisioned , but it is not clear that opening the door to widespread consolidation in the cable television industry is going to make things better for consumers .

Zadnji četrtek sem preživel prav zanimiv večer v kiberpipi .
Tisti dan je bilo na sporedu predavanje z naslovom Večer za inovativne in podjetne : Andrej Nabergoj .
Kot je že iz naslova razvidno je bil gost Andrej Nabergoj , CEO podjetja Parsek .
Bilo je zanimivo , gost je pokazal veliko znanja in je zraven vsega še odličen retorik ... Povedanih je bilo veliko zanimivih stvari , a tukaj se nameravam osredotočiti na en zelo majhen delček .
Je pa tukaj še ena zvrst , katera v zadnjih časih zelo pridobiva na publiciteti in to je ... vir : sockap.pdf
Na en zanimiv način gre tematika z osnovnim konceptom tega bloga , čeprav mogoče to ni vidno na prvi pogled .
Pri optimizaciji spletnih strani gre v veliki meri za referenčne povezave , se pravi katera stran ima povezavo na katero stran .
Pri socialnem mreženju je zelo podobno , v bistvu je samo kontekst zamenjan .
Kdo koga " linka " ?
O vrednosti takega povezovanja verjetno ni potrebno veliko razlagati .
Veze in poznanstva delujejo .
Ko začneš resno razmišljati o neki poslovni ideji je zelo dobro , če imaš veliko znancev .
Po vsej verjetnosti boš potreboval pomoč kakšnega od njih .
Mogoče pri kapitalu , mogoče pri izpeljavi ideje ali pa za kaj drugega .
Povezanost ima vrednost .
Moj dober prijatelj , ki je v mlajših letih uspešno prodajal vse od bicklov do kompjutrov mi je enkrat dejal , .
Dodal je še , da če ne prodajaš kakovosti je boljše da sploh ne prodajaš , ker boš izgubil več kot imaš .
Nekako ne morem , da se ne bi strinjam z njim .
Se motim ?
Nekje sem tudi zasledil , da poznanstva veliko pripomorejo pri iskanju novih zaposlitev .
Vem , da ko nekdo išče dodatne pridne roke , najprej pogleda v svoji bližnji okolici .
Nekaj mora biti na tem .
Vidim veliko prednosti v povezovanju , spoznavanju , mreženju , ampak seveda ... Čisto možno , da so imele tiste mame res prav , ki so svojim otrokom govorile , da ni vse v sedenjem za knjigami .
Odlične ocene so lahko slabše od dobrih z odličnimi poznanstvi .
Se strinjaš ?
Ostaja še vprašanje kako bolj uspešno širiti mrežo svojih socialnih povezav .
Vem , da nisem najbolj komunikativna oseba tega sveta , ampak vseeno mislim da se da .
Le širnemu svetu je treba povedati kak šno stvar o sebi .
Kdo si ?

Legal immigrants in the United States have opted to become American citizens in historically high numbers in the last decade , according to a study published yesterday by the Pew Hispanic Center .
The number of naturalized citizens in the United States population in 2005 was 12.8 million , a record high , the study found .
The number reflected not only a growing number of legal immigrants coming to the United States , but also a growing eagerness among them to adopt American citizenship , the study reported .
Of all the immigrants now living legally in the United States , 52 percent are naturalized citizens , while others are permanent residents or have some other immigration status .
The last time that citizens made up more than half of all legal immigrants was in 1980 , the study found .
The research , which is based primarily on census data , was done by Jeffrey S. Passel , a demographer at the Pew center , a nonpartisan organization based in Washington .
The nature of the female
One needs only to see the way she is built to realize that woman is not intended for great mental or for great physical labor .
She expiates the guilt of life not through activity but through suffering , through the pains of childbirth , caring for the child and subjection to the man , to whom she should be a patient and cheering companion .
Great suffering , joy , exertion , is not for her : her life should flow by more quietly , trivially , gently than the man ’s without being essentially happier or unhappier .
Women are suited to being the nurses and teachers of our earliest childhood precisely because they themselves are childish , silly and short - sighted , in a word big children , their whole lives long : a kind of intermediate stage between the child and the man , who is the actual human being , ‘ man . ’
One has only to watch a girl playing with a child , dancing and singing with it the whole day , and then ask oneself what , with the best will in the world , a man could do in her place .
Natural weapons
In the girl nature has had in view what could in theatrical terms be called a stage - effect : it has provided her with superabundant beauty and charm for a few years at the expense of the whole remainder of her life , so that during these years she may so capture the imagination of a man that he is carried away into undertaking to support her honorably in some form or another for the rest of her life , a step he would seem hardly likely to take for purely rational considerations .
Thus nature has equipped women , as it has all its creatures , with the tools and weapons she needs for securing her existence , and at just the time she needs them ; in doing which nature has acted with its usual economy .
For just as the female ant loses its wings after mating , since they are then superfluous , indeed harmful to the business of raising the family , so the woman usually loses her beauty after one or two childbeds , and probably for the same reason .
Female truth
The fundamental defect of the female character is a lack of a sense of justice .
This originates first and foremost in their want of rationality and capacity for reflexion but it is strengthened by the fact that , as the weaker sex , they are driven to rely not on force but on cunning : hence their instinctive subtlety and their ineradicable tendency to tell lies : for , as nature has equipped the lion with claws and teeth , the elephant with tusks , the wild boar with fangs , the bull with horns and the cuttlefish with ink , so it has equipped woman with the power of dissimulation as her means of attack and defence , and has transformed into this gift all the strength it has bestowed on man in the form of physical strength and the power of reasoning .
Dissimulation is thus inborn in her and consequently to be found in the stupid woman almost as often as in the clever one .
To make use of it at every opportunity is as natural to her as it is for an animal to employ its means of defence whenever it is attacked , and when she does so she feels that to some extent she is only exercising her rights .
A completely truthful woman who does not practice dissimulation is perhaps an impossibility , which is why women see through the dissimulation of others so easily it is inadvisable to attempt it with them .
–
But this fundamental defect which I have said they possess , together with all that is associated with it , gives rise to falsity , unfaithfulness , treachery , ingratitude , etc .
Women are guilty of perjury far more often than men .
It is questionable whether they ought to be allowed to take an oath at all .
Feminine charms
Only a male intellect clouded by the sexual drive could call the stunted , narrow - shouldered , broad - hipped and short - legged sex the fair sex : for it is with this drive that all its beauty is bound up .
More fittingly than the fair sex , women could be called the unaesthetic sex .
Neither for music , nor poetry , nor the plastic arts do they possess any real feeling or receptivity : if they affect to do so , it is merely mimicry in service of their effort to please .
This comes from the fact that they are incapable of taking a purely objective interest in anything whatever , and the reason for this is , I think , as follows .
Man strives in everything for a direct domination over things , either by comprehending or by subduing them .
But woman is everywhere and always relegated to a merely indirect domination , which is achieved by means of man , who is consequently the only thing she has to dominate directly .
Thus it lies in the nature of women to regard everything simply as a means of capturing a man , and their interest in anything else is only simulated , is no more than a detour , i.e. amounts to coquetry and mimicry .
Absence of genius
Nor can one expect anything else from women if one considers that the most eminent heads of the entire sex have proved incapable of a single truly great , genuine and original achievement in art , or indeed of creating anything at all of lasting value : this strikes one most forcibly in regard to painting , since they are just as capable of mastering its technique as we are , and indeed paint very busily , yet cannot point to a single great painting ; the reason being precisely that they lack all objectivity of mind , which is what painting demands above all else .
Isolated and partial exceptions do not alter the case : women , taken as a whole , are and remain thorough and incurable philistines : so that , with the extremely absurd arrangement by which they share the rank and title of their husband , they are a continual spur to his ignoble ambitions .
They are sexus sequior , the inferior second sex in every respect : one should be indulgent toward their weaknesses , but to pay them honour is ridiculous beyond measure and demeans us even in their eyes .
Insipid women- veneration
This is how the peoples of antiquity and of the Orient have regarded women ; they have recognized what is the proper position for women far better than we have , we with our Old French gallantry and insipid women - veneration , that highest flower of Christian - Germanic stupidity which has served only to make women so rude and arrogant that one is sometimes reminded of the sacred apes of Benares which , conscious of their own sanctity and inviolability , thought themselves at liberty to do whatever they pleased .
Monogamy and ‘ filles de joie ’
In our monogamous part of the world , to marry means to halve one ’s rights and double one ’s duties .
But when the law conceded women equal rights with men it should at the same time have endowed them with masculine reasoning powers .
What is actually the case is that the more those rights and privileges the law accords to women exceed those which are natural to them , the more it reduces the number of women who actually participate in these benefits ; and then the remainder are deprived of their natural rights by just the amount these few receive in excess of theirs : for , because of the unnaturally privileged position enjoyed by women as a consequence of monogamy and the marriage laws accompanying it , which regard women as entirely equal to men ( which they are in no respect ) , prudent and cautious men very often hesitate before making so great a sacrifice as is involved in entering into so inequitable a contract ; so that while among polygamous peoples every woman gets taken care of , among the monogamous the number of married women is limited and there remains over a quantity of unsupported women who , in the upper classes , vegetate on as useless old maids , and in the lower are obligated to undertake laborious work the y are constitutionally unfitted for or become filles de joie , whose lives are as devoid of joie as they are of honour but who , given the prevailing circumstances , are necessary for the gratification of the male sex and therefore come to constitute a recognized class , with the specific task of preserving the virtue of those women more favoured by fate who have found a man to support them or may reasonably hope to find one .
There are 80,000 prostitutes in London alone : and what are they if not sacrifices on the altar of monogamy ?
These poor women are the inevitable counterpart and natural complement to the European lady , with all her arrogance and pretension .
For the female sex viewed as a whole polygamy is therefore a real benefit ; on the other hand there appears no rational ground why a man whose wife suffers from a chronic illness , or has remained unfruitful , or has gradually grown too old for him , should not take a second .
No argument about polygamy
There can be no argument about polygamy : it is a fact to be met with everywhere and the only question is how to regulate it .
For who is really a monogamist ?
We all live in polygamy , at least for a time and usually for good .
Since every man needs many women , there could be nothing more just than that he should be free , indeed obliged , to support many women .
This would also mean the restoration of woman to her rightful and natural position , the subordinate one , and the abolition from the world of the lady , with her ridiculous claims to respect and veneration ; there would then be only women , and no longer unhappy women , of which Europe is at present full .
Property and inheritance
In India , no woman is ever independent , but in accordance with the law of Manu , she stands under the control of her father , her husband , her brother or her son .
It is , to be sure , a revolting thing that a widow should immolate herself upon her husband ’s funeral pyre ; but it is also revolting that she should spend her husband ’s money with her paramours – the money for which he toiled his whole life long , in the consoling belief that he was providing for his children .
Happy are those who have kept the middle course – medium tenuere beati .
In almost all nations , whether of the ancient or the modern world , even amongst the Hottentots , property is inherited by the male descendants alone ; it is only in Europe that a departure has taken place ; but not amongst the nobility , however .
That the property which has cost men long years of toil and effort , and been won with so much difficulty , should afterwards come into the hands of women , who then , in their lack of reason , squander it in a short time , or otherwise fool it away , is a grievance and a wrong as serious as it is common , which should be prevented by limiting the right of women to inherit .
In my opinion , the best arrangement would be that by which women , whether widows or daughters , should never receive anything beyond the interest for life on property secured by mortgage , and in no case the property itself , or the capital , except when there cease to be male descendants .
The people who make money are men , not women ; and it follows from this that women are neither justified in having unconditional possession of it , nor fit persons to be entrusted with its administration .
When wealth , in any true sense of the word , that is to say , funds , houses or land , is to go to them as an inheritance they should never be allowed the free disposition of it .
In their case a guardian should always be appointed ; and hence they should never be given the free control of their own children , wherever it can be avoided .

You 've seen the story of the presidential doodles .
There are many odd and revealing examples , such as GHW Bush 's " any more dead ones ? "
( ABC News says his sad and teary face " gives the note a bit of melancholy , or maybe humor , " appropriately ambiguous for a man of shimmering surface and black depths ) , but the one perhaps receiving the most notice has n't even been reproduced online .
It 's a page from John F Kennedy , on which he 's written , repeatedly , " 9 - 11 , " and underscored the word " conspiracy " next to it .
Paul Joseph Watson wondered whether this was some kind of " inside joke " or a " hat tip to the 9/11 truth movement " before concluding " one thing 's for sure - it 's weird . "
I 'd say rather that two things are certain : it 's both weird , and it 's not .
ABC explains the numbers , without accounting for the word " conspiracy , " by saying that " It turns out that was the tally of a committee vote , not a foreshadowing of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks . "
But that 's a misapprehension of foreshadowing , which always carries within it a duality , referencing both a prosaic explanation and a supra- prosaic that is revealed only in hindsight .
If this were , say , a Richard Condon novel and not living history , and so foreshadowing just a literary device , there would be no dispute that Kennedy 's doodle fit the definition .
It 's disputed now because people object to the impression that we may be the characters instead of the authors of our lives .
Kennedy 's doodle did n't " predict " 9/11 any more than The Coup 's cover art or 's pilot episode , but all three are suggestive of a grander conspiracy - the grandest - that encompasses all of human history .
I 'm talking about the conspiracy of consciousness .
That by encoding the narrative of history with artful gestures of interpretation - the things that make us go- consciousness conspires to bring us to comprehension .
Consider for a moment the familiar JFK and Abraham Lincoln coincidences , how their stories seem to enfold , and unfold , one another .
Such details as Lincoln 's election to congress in 1846 , JFK 's exactly 100 years later , and each entering the presidency 14 years after that ; Lincoln 's having a secretary named Kennedy , and Kennedy 's a secretary Lincoln , and each being succeeded by a man named Johnson ; both were shot in the head on a Friday , Lincoln by a man with three names born in 1839 who fled a theatre to a warehouse , while Kennedy 's alleged three - named gunman , born in 1939 , fled a warehouse to a theatre ; " Kennedy " and " Lincoln " each contain seven letters , and John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald , 15 - you know the list , and how it goes on .
Of course , a grab bag of coincidence a century apart should defy the conventions of even the loosest conspiracy model .
But in a holographic model , things change .
It is consciousness - not individual consciousness , but the collective consciousness of all life - that draws locality and temporality out of the wave pattern of higher vibrations that form the holographic universe and constructs the space and time setting for our life narrative .
And consciousnessa storyteller , employing literary devices such as foreshadowing as well as metaphor in our waking curiosity and dream state , while some astral project and remote view , and as plant shamans , with heads full of snakes , explore innerspace via such gateways as DMT and ayahuasca JFK did n't " plan " 9/11 , or have " inside info " as I 've seen some Randiesque skeptics sarcastically assert .
But repeating patterns , even across centuries or great distances , may still evidence a conspiracy .
But the better kind : one of undifferentiated consciousness provoking us within the continuum towards greater reading comprehension .
Perhaps to help it write a happier ending .
Western strategists and policymakers should stop talking about a clash of civilizations and focus on the real problem : extreme tribalism .
Recent events - riots in many nations protesting cartoons of the prophet Muhammad , Sunni -Shiite warring in Iraq , the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan - confirm that the West is not in a clash with Islam .
Instead , Islam , which is a civilizing force , has fallen under the sway of Islamists who are a tribalizing force .
Unfortunately , the tribalism theme has difficulty gaining traction .
After the end of the cold war , many American strategists preferred the optimistic " end of history " idea that democracy would triumph around the world , advanced by Francis Fukuyama in 1989 .
A contrary notion - reversion to tribalism - made better sense to other strategists , such as France 's Jacques Attali in 1992 .
Indeed , the emergence of ethnic warring in the Balkans and elsewhere confirmed that when societies crumble , people revert to tribal and clan behaviors that repudiate liberal ideals .
Perhaps partly because the idea of " tribalism " sounds too anthropological for modern strategists , it has not taken hold .
American thinking has shifted to revolve around a more high - minded but less accurate concept : " the clash of civilizations " articulated by Samuel Huntington in 1993 .
But what troubles the world is far more a travail of tribalisms than a clash of civilizations .
The major clashes are not between civilizations per se , but between antagonistic segments that are fighting across fringe border zones ( like Christian Serbs vs. Muslim Kosovars ) , or feuding within the same civilization , such as Sunnis vs. Shiites in Iraq .
Most antagonists , no matter how high - mindedly they proclaim their ideals , are operating in terribly tribal and clannish ways .
Some , such as Al Qaeda terrorists , are extreme tribalists who dream of making the West start over at a razed , tribal level .
This travail is sure to persist , fueling terrorism , ethnonationalism , religious strife , sectarian feuds , and clannish gang violence and crime .
Thus , the cartoon protest riots pose an effort to mobilize an Islamic global tribe , not a civilization .
Al Qaeda and its affiliates comprise an information age network , but they , too , operate like a global tribe : decentralized , segmental , lacking in central hierarchy , egalitarian toward kith and kin , ruthless toward others .
What are tribes like ?
The tribe was the first major form of social organization .
The hierarchy , market , and network forms developed ages later .
Classic tribes are ruled by kinship principles about blood and brotherhood that fix one 's sense of identity and belonging .
Tribes are also egalitarian and segmental .
Everyone is deemed equal and must share .
Each part , such as a clan , is structured similarly , aiming for self - sufficiency .
And there is no formal chief , though a " big man " may arise .
Democracy may appear in tribal councils , but it is not liberal , since it does not tolerate minority rights and dissident views once a consensus emerges .
What maintains order in a tribe is not hierarchy and law - it is too early a form for that - but kinship principles stressing mutual respect , dignity , pride , and honor .
Reciprocal gift giving is essential .
Humiliating insults upset peace more than anything else , for an insult to one is seen as an insult to everyone of that lineage .
And there are only two ways to restore honor : compensation or revenge .
Finally , a tribe may view itself as a realm of virtue , but see outsiders as a different realm that may be treated differently , even brutally , especially if they are " different . "
Much of the world is still like this .
Of particular concern to strategists , a dense arc of tribal and clan systems runs across North Africa , the Middle East , and South Asia , up into the " stans " of Central Asia .
Even modern societies still have tribal cores and impulses .
That shows in their cultures , nationalisms , identity politics , kindred glues like sports clubs and social fads , and in cronyism , nepotism , and gang life .
Tribalism , for good and ill , is alive everywhere , all the time .
We just do n't think about it much , and use other terms .
So let 's shift away from the civilization paradigm .
The tribalism paradigm is better for illuminating the crucial problem : the tribalization of religion .
The more that extremists create divisions between " us " and " them , " vainly claim sacredness solely for their own ends , demonize others , revel in codes of revenge , crave territorial and spiritual conquests , and suppress moderates who disagree - all the while claiming to act on behalf of a deity - the more their religious orientation becomes utterly tribal and prone to wreaking violence of the darkest kind .
They can only pretend to represent a civilization .
The " war of ideas " should be rethought .
Western leaders keep pressing Muslim leaders everywhere to denounce terrorism as uncivilized .
But this approach , plus counterpressures from sectarian Islamists , has put moderate Muslims on the defensive , stymieing them from speaking out .
An approach that focuses on questioning extreme tribalism may be more effective at freeing up dialogue and inviting a search for common , ecumenical ground .
Shifting to a travail - of - tribalisms perspective would have to be carefully thought out .
The point is not to condemn all tribal ways .
Many people around the world appreciate ( indeed , prefer ) this communal way of life and will defend it from insult .
It is not always uncivilized to be tribal .
The point is to strike at the awful effects that extreme tribalization can have - to oppose not a terrorist 's or insurgent 's religion , but the reduction of that religion to raw tribalist tenets .

It appears that way :
Banana company Chiquita Brands International said Wednesday it has agreed to a $ 25 million fine after admitting it paid a Colombian terrorist group for protection in a volatile farming region .
The settlement resolves a lengthy Justice Department investigation into the company 's financial dealings with terrorist organizations in Colombia .
In court documents filed Wednesday , federal prosecutors said several unnamed high - ranking corporate officers at the Cincinnati - based company paid about $ 1.7 million between 1997 and 2004 to the United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia , known as AUC for its Spanish initials .
Not very GOP sounding , unless you know about Chiquita .
Chiquita was run by Carl Lindner until March of 2002 ( the time frame in which these crimes happened ) .
If you are not from the Cincinnati area then you might not know old Carl , so let me fill you in :
Carl is a huge GOP supporter .
If you go to the site Newsmeat and search for Carl Lindner and Carl Linder ( some records have his name misspelled ) , you will get some interesting results .
Here is a big one for you :
LINDER , CARL
CINCINNATTI , OH 45243 SWIFT BOAT VETS AND POW'S FOR TRUTH
$ 350,000
primary
10/14/04
Yup , some of the same money that went to these terrorist organizations also went to the old Swift Boaters .
Very interesting indeed .
As matter of fact , Wikipedia has this to say about Carl and Bush 's relationship :
A close ally of George W. Bush , Lindner secured the use of Great American Ballpark for the Bush 's re-election campaign on October 31 , 2004 , a few days before the 2004 Presidential Election .
Ahh , so maybe that explains why the company Carl used to run ( and of which he still owns a large part ) received the harsh punishment of a $ 25 million dollar fine .
If this was some blue company like Costco doing this the CEO 's would now be in Gitmo .
Remember - if you want to support terrorism then just give to the GOP .
That will make sure you get off easy if you are busted supporting terrorist organizations .
Note to corporate media :
This is news , that 's n-e - w-s .
The GOP presidential candidates have begun to weigh in over Ann Coulter 's outrageously bigoted comments yesterday at the largest conservative conference of the year .
Coulter was the putative keynote speaker of the entire event - her speech was the most widely anticipated of all , according to those who attended .
Here 's what McCain 's camp ( McCain did n't even attend the conference , yet they weighed in ) and Romney 's camp ( he did attend ) had to say , per the NYT blog , since the real media refuses to cover this story :
Democrats were not the only denouncing Ms. Coulter .
“ The comments were wildly inappropriate , ” said Brian Jones , a spokesman for Senator John McCain , a Republican candidate for president who did not attend .
Kevin Madden , a spokesman for Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , said : “ It was an offensive remark .
Governor Romney believes all people should be treated with dignity and respect ....
.... attendees said that Ms. Coulter not only spoke warmly about Mr. Romney but all but endorsed him .
No word yet on whether the Romney campaign was taking the endorsement or , acceding to Mr. Dean ’s demands that he “ denounce her hateful remarks .
Kudos to McCain , and half a kudo to Romney .
McCain has gone off the deep end in flip - flopping / sucking up to conservatives on social issues , the war , and more .
But in this case , he repudiated Coulter even though he did n't even attend .
As for Romney , whose " I 'm pro-gay , no , I 'm anti-gay " flip - flops make McCain look like Jerry Falwell , per the Times , Coulter all but endorsed him .
Is Romney going to welcome that endorsement , or rebuke it , as he should ?
And just as importantly , now that Romney and McCain have weighed in , where are the other GOP candidates , and our own PFLAG parent Dick Cheney , who was also there ?
The following GOP candidates attended , what do they have to say about this outrageous bigotry ? - Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani - Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee - Congressman Tom Tancredo ( R-CO ) - Senator Sam Brownback ( R-KS ) - Former Congressman Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) And of course , Vice President Dick Cheney .
PS
Top NYT reporter Adam Nagourney is the one who writes today 's blog post on the Times Web site about this episode .
Nagourney says that " There ’s some big fallout from the meeting in Washington of the Conservative Political Action Conference . "
Okay .
Then if it 's big fall out , New York Times , then how about permitting your premiere political writer to actually write about this story in the dead - tree version of the paper ?
Army officials have defended the treatment provided to most patients at Walter Reed , especially the most serious cases , those admitted to inpatient wards on the hospital ’s campus a few miles from the center of Washington .
But they have acknowledged that the large number of wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan , currently around 650 patients , has taxed doctors , nurses and other care providers and forced them to rely more heavily on overflow facilities to house outpatients who must remain near the hospital for treatment .
The Army has admitted in recent weeks that the system it uses to decide whether wounded soldiers who have been moved to outpatient status will be able to return to active duty often takes too long and has promised to change the system .
At Walter Reed the process has taken an average of more than 200 days , a source of frustration to soldiers and families who are awaiting decisions about what benefits they will receive if they retire .
Treatment of wounded soldiers has also been spotlighted recently in a documentary recounting the treatment received by the ABC News anchorman Bob Woodruff , who was wounded in Iraq last year .
Mr. Woodruff contrasted his care with that of soldiers , finding that Veterans Administration regional medical centers provide retired soldiers with good care but that local V.A. hospitals are less skilled at dealing with complex problems like traumatic brain injuries .
Mr. Harvey told reporters Thursday that the Army was also examining conditions at other medical facilities , both in the United States and abroad .
“ We ’ll fix as we find things wrong , ” he said .
Paralleling the Army effort , Defense Secretary Gates appointed a panel last week to examine conditions at Walter Reed and other Defense Department hospitals it chooses , including the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Md .

Mr. Gates endorsed the decision to relieve General Weightman in a statement Thursday .
“ The care and welfare of our wounded men and women in uniform demand the highest standard of excellence and commitment that we can muster as a government , ” he said .
“ When this standard is not met , I will insist on swift and direct corrective action and , where appropriate , accountability up the chain of command . ”

BOEING : This ad tells me how Boeing is working to ensure that the future is wonderful , because they 're , I dunno , creating planes that will fly in space or something .
So I went to Boeing 's website to see if they had anything I could buy now , but alas , they do n't .
I did , however , find reference to programs such as their commercial airplane division , integrated defense systems , Boeing aircraft trading , airport technology , and something with the somewhat dubious title of what possible return could Boeing get out of advertising to me ? :

I did , however , find reference to programs such as their commercial airplane division , integrated defense systems , Boeing aircraft trading , airport technology , and something with the somewhat dubious title of Phantom Works .
As much as I thought how much fun it might be to set up an account for MyBoeing Fleet , turns out it 's only for airplane owners , operators , and repairers .
Which makes me wonder
DOW CHEMICAL : This ad takes great pains to tell me how Dow is awesome because they make the chemicals that everything in the world needs to be produced .
Which is great , but what the hell do I care ?
I 'm not in the market for Ethylene Oxide , nor Vinyl Acetate Monomer , and as much as Dow 's `craft products ' page tells me I can get a great deal on Styrofoam to make something called a `pumpkin block tower ' , I 'm not entirely sure how much of a spike in Styrofoam business the company would need to generate from their ads to make them worth the money spent running them during CNN 's prime time .
Dow does , however , spend millions ( $ 2.1 m in 1997 ) on lobbyists .
In fact , the company Greenpeace named ' polluter of the century ' has so the question remains ... why are they advertising to me ? :

In fact , the company Greenpeace named ' polluter of the century ' has over 25 full - time lobbyists in DC , and another 17 in Texas , where many of their plants are located .
They seem to have no trouble getting whatever they want from our politicians ,
Lockheed Martin sells nothing I can buy .
And thus I again wonder ... why are they spending money advertising to me ?
LOCKHEED MARTIN : Watching this ad made me feel really good about being in North America , and about how Lockheed Martin is ensuring that we all remain free .
But when I went to their website to thank them by purchasing some of their fine products , there was nothing I could buy !
They list their customers as the Departments of Agriculture , Commerce , Defense , Energy , Health & Human Services , Homeland Security , Housing and Urban Development , Justice , Transportation , Environmental Protection Agency , NASA , the Social Security Administration , the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the governments of Japan , Turkey , Chile and China , and the US Postal Service ... but nowhere does it list `me ' .
So I looked deeper , at their products page ... hmm ...
I guess if I save up I could maybe afford a C - 141 Starlifter , or have the LM boys come around and turn my basement into a Center of Command Operations , with my very own Command Readiness Trainer System .
And you know , that Compact Kinetic Energy Missile they 're pushing would look REALLY good on the Prius ...
But here 's the bottom line : .
And thus I again wonder ... why are they spending money advertising to me ?
So , once again ...
Why is a company that I can't buy anything from spending money advertising on CNN to me ?
Update :
As others below have pointed out , it seems there are BP gas stations in the US now .
I 'll concede the point , though their website does n't make mention of them .
BRITISH PETROLEUM : BP is great !
How do I know this ?
Because they tell me so !
According to this ad , which features a barely legibile `everyman ' wondering where the next great advance in fuel will come from once oil runs out , BP leads the way because they plan to invest $ 1b in expanding natural gas production next year .
Actually , when I think about that , it 's completely irrelevant , especially since my car does n't run on natural gas AND natural gas has risen in price by about 6000 % in the last , I dunno , three days ?
Regardless , I wanted to tell BP that I was down with their bold plans to make lots of money on a natural resource , but then it dawned on me ... there are no BP gas stations in the US !
Oh sure , they have a stake in Amoco and Arco , but neither of those was being advertised on CNN - just BP .
So , once again ... Update :
As others below have pointed out , it seems there are BP gas stations in the US now .
I 'll concede the point , though their website does n't make mention of them .
The UNITED STATES TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION :
The TV ad for the USTA wants me to know that I can make a whole whack of investment profit if I invest in their member companies and tell the government to update the nation 's telecom laws " to encourage market - based competition for communications . "
I guess they 'd prefer I do n't use a little independent thought and realize that such a move would mean my phone bill would go through the roof , but either way , I wanted to reward their advertising spend by buying something from them ... like Adelphia .
Alas , they sell nothing I can purchase .
I could potentially join their association if I wanted to , but I 'm not sure they 're my kind of social crowd .
So again I ask ...

CONOCOPHILLIPS : Now this was a weird one .
After a fairly generic ad that seemed to be saying how wonderful ConocoPhilips was for selling energy , or something ( it was unclear what they do , much like the old ad that would tell me to `try the Purple Pill ' but not tell me what it does ) , when I accidentally typed " canocophillips " into my Firefox URL window , it Google - forwarded me to a pdf file telling me about the effluent monitoring requirements of a Californian Conocophillips `tank farm ' , complete with lists of acceptable mercury , silver , lead and arsenic that can be pumped into the water supply .
I figured that was n't CP 's actual website , so I corrected my typo and put a .com at the end , and lo and behold , : Now this was a weird one .

I figured that was n't CP 's actual website , so I corrected my typo and put a .com at the end , and lo and behold , I was right .
So what can I buy from ConocoPhillips ?
Not a lot .
I can go to one of the many gas stations they own , but then again , not once in the ad did the parent company mention those brands they own , nor encourage me to use them .
What they were seemingly advertising was how awesome the corporate HQ is .
So I 'm baffled ... why advertise to me ?
Of course , there have been other advertisers like these that I 've noticed on CNN in the past , like the one a few weeks back that seemed to be telling me , without actually saying the words , that they'd be an awesome company to buy a nuclear reactor from .
Another doozy was the Royal Saud Investment Group , which was advertised about a year ago , when the Saudi royal family was copping a lot of flack for their close friendship with the President , and terrorists , and not necessarily in that order .
As reported by Air America 's Randi Rhodes , the ad basically ran along the lines of ...
" We 're Saudi Arabia ...
We love you ! "
It would have been hilarious if not for what was behind it .
Around the time that ad started running , which had been very critical of Saudi Arabia , suddenly stopped discussing the Saudi royals .
They stopped criticizing Saudi Arabia 's lack of democracy , and their continual raising of oil prices , and their torture of prisoners .
They no longer mentioned the talk , pre-election , that the Saudi Prince had told George W. Bush that they 'd lower gas prices just before the November 2004 election .
It was as if the words " we love you " had convinced CNN that Saudi Arabia really did have a boner for every American .
If you 've ever seen the excellent documentary , The Corporation , you 'll recall a story about a pair of Fox reporters , Jane Akre and Steve Wilson , that had exposed that Monsanto were pushing cow steroids as a means of expanding production for dairy farms .
The udders , they reported , would expand to the point where the cow was in agony .
Much of the time , the udders would bleed , and infections and pus would leak into the milk itself .
For some cows , their udders dragged along the ground , they were so big .
And what was worse , the steroids would then leech through into the milk itself , to be fed to our children at school .
Fox demanded the report be altered some 30 + times before it finally ran , demanding words such as " cancer " be switched for " health concerns " , etc .
The journalists refused , stating that this was important news , only to be told , " We paid $ 3 billion for these television stations .
We 'll decide what the news is .
NEWS IS WHAT WE SAY IT IS . "
Eventually ,
Fox killed the piece altogether , and as one of the journalists recounted , she was told that Monsanto spent tens of millions of dollars a year advertising their products on Fox , and so there was no desire at all to piss them off , nor retain the journalists in question .
The journalists went to court to fight their unfair dismissal , but Fox was let off by the judge because , and I quote , " It is n't illegal to lie on TV , " which meant they were n't officially whistleblowers , and thus had no case .
I caught up with one of those reporters , Jane Akre , a veteran of several decades of TV journalism , at the Sundance Film Festival when The Corporation played there in 2004 , and I asked where she was working now .
She replied that she has n't really worked since .
" Who would hire me now ?
They know they can't make me shut up - so I 'm done . "
Then she asked ME about freelance corporate copywriting !
I was gobsmacked - a trailblazing woman who should be celebrated and iconized was asking me for work .
And that , in my opinion , tells me all I need to know about the above advertisers and why they 're running non-stop ads on CNN , CNN Headline News , MSNBC , Fox News ... because when the ads are running , the criticism and investigation stops .
See for yourself - start taking notes of the ads you see on CNN .
The next time you see an ad telling you how great it is that GE makes weaponry for the Department of Defense , mark it down .
The next time you see a defense contractor advertise products you can't buy - mark it down .
Because these are the companies that REALLY own CNN .
A quick look around the net will tell you WHY it 's important for these companies to shut CNN up .
Dow is STILL Refusing to properly compensate the dead and disfigured after the Bhopal disaster , Boeing has accepted liability for the Alaskan air crash that killed 88 people in 2000 , while hiding sneaky sub-contracting scams on defense projects , and recent mass sackings have n't helped their image , while Lockheed Martin spends more time in court than your average DA for their corruption and kickbacks .
BP and ConocoPhillips could do without any further discussion of the fact that gas prices have doubled , and CNN seems to no longer be interested in that topic , or if they are , they blame it on hurricanes , even though prices were skyrocketing for months earlier .
Now , some may say that the reason these ads are running is because they drive up the share price or the companies in question , so I looked them up :
ConocoPhillips up 75 % since Nov 04
Dow Chmical same as Nov 04
Boeing Air up 40 % since Nov 04
Lockheed Martin up 10 % since Nov 04
British Petroleum up 10 % since Nov 04
Considering gas prices are nearly double what they were a year ago , and we 're engaged in TWO wars , these share prices are pretty dire , which I would think would disprove the ' advertising as a share price motivator ' theory .
Which only really leaves one viable theory : that the ads pay for journalists to look the other way .
The advertising of defense contractors and energy giants on news networks is nothing short of payola .
And it must be stopped - NOW .
UPDATE !
Thanks to Elise for pointing out the ads from Kerr - McGee , a company that calles themselves " a leader in oil and natural gas exploration and production " , in their CNN ads , yet sells nothing any of us can buy - in fact , they do n't list ANY products on their website at all .
Additionally , thanks to CakeStick for pointing out the oh - so - regular Tyco ads , which tell us how vital a part of " our world " they are , despite being based in the tax haven of Bermuda .
Next time I need a " safety needle [ that ] provides engineering controls that maximize clinician safety without sacrificing clinical flexibility " , I 'll be sure to give them a call .
Just do n't talk about former owner Dennis Koslowski's $ 6000 gold - laced shower curtains if there 'a TV camera on you , Mr Blitzer .
Further Update : I decided to do a little further research , to see how entwined these companies are with the corporate side of CNN , and what I found was n't surprising .
Then there was this blurb about Kerr - McGee 's advertising on their website , complete with links to the ads themselves , which made me vomit a little in my mouth :
Kerr -McGee has seven television commercials that air on network and cable programming in the United States .
The 30 - second spots air on CBS ’s Face the Nation , NBC’s Meet the Press and various news programs on FOX News , CNN and MSNBC .
Environment :
The environmental spot highlights the company 's long - standing commitment to environmental stewardship , as well as Kerr - McGee 's use of innovative spar technologies to provide the United States with vital energy resources .
Uinta Basin : Kerr -McGee places priority on caring for the environment as it explores for and produces oil and natural gas .
This television spot features the company ’s U.S. onshore operations in Utah ’s Uinta Basin , and describes how the company focuses on being a good neighbor to the environment .
Yuck .
Clearly neither of those are intended to push up share prices , they 're nothing more than ' do n't hate us for destroying the environment ' propaganda pieces .
Remember Silkwood .
Peace out .
Though he 's written scientific studies like “ The Chimpanzees of Kibale Forest ” ( Columbia University Press , 1984 ) and treatises on psychology like “ The Dark Side of Man : Tracing the Origins of Male Violence ” ( Perseus Books , 2000 ) , his work took a sharp turn in 2001 .
When his proposal for “ Over the Edge : Death in Grand Canyon ” was rejected by the publishing arm of the Grand Canyon Association , he wrote and self - published the book with Thomas M. Myers , a canyon physician .
Part of the gruesome appeal of “ Death in Grand Canyon ” are the tales of hapless victims who backed up over the canyon rim while posing for photographs ( seven ) — or who slipped while relieving themselves into the chasm ( at least five ) .
But both books are also filled with serious historical information .
In “ Death in Yosemite , ” sections are devoted to the 19th - century persecution of the Sierra Miwok Indians and the construction , over the objections of environmentalists , of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir on the Tuolumne River to satisfy the water needs of San Francisco .
But the book 's most stirring episodes are its chronicles of bad decision - making , often by experts whose wits abandoned them at key moments .
In 1999 , Jan Davis , a 58 - year - old stunt woman , jumped from the top of El Capitan as the fourth of five demonstrators protesting the park 's ban of BASE - jumping — the sport of leaping from mountains , bridges or buildings with a parachute .
Because she expected her equipment to be confiscated by park rangers , Ms. Davis borrowed a less valuable rigging with a leg - sheath pilot chute , which was different than her own back - mounted gear .
Spectator videos of her fatal 3,000 foot fall showed her swatting at her back in an apparent attempt to clear her chute , but she was unable to activate the less - familiar equipment effectively .
Strung together , the tales in “ Off the Wall : Death in Yosemite ” offer some simple rules .
Do not underestimate the spectacular , unforgiving terrain .
Capturing that perfect photograph , if it involves wading anywhere near the edge of a waterfall , is suicide .
Hiking alone , particularly off trail or in winter , has proven disastrous again and again .
A bloody conflict between Hispanic and black gangs is spreading across Los Angeles .
Hundreds are dying as whole districts face the threat of ethnic cleansing .
Paul Harris reports from the epicentre of America 's new urban warfare
Father Greg Boyle keeps a grim count of the young gang members he has buried .
Number 151 was Jonathan Hurtado , 18 - fresh out of jail .
Now the kindly , bearded Jesuit mourns him .
' The day he got out I found him a job .
He never missed a day .
He was doing really well , ' Boyle says .
But Hurtado made a mistake : he went back to his old neighbourhood in east Los Angeles .
While sitting in a park , Hurtado was approached by a man on a bike who said to him : ' Hey , homie , what 's up ? '
He then shot Hurtado four times .
' You can't come back .
Not even for a visit , ' says Boyle , who has worked for two decades against LA 's gang culture .
Boyle 's Los Angeles , where daily slaughter is a grim reality , is a world away from the glamorous Hollywood hills , Malibu beaches and Sunset Strip - the celebrity - drenched city that David Beckham and Posh Spice will soon make their home .
Boyle 's Los Angeles is where an estimated 120,000 gang members across five counties battle over turf , pride and drugs .
It is a city of violence as a new race war escalates between new Hispanic gangs and older black groups , each trying to ethnically cleanse the other .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who has referred to his city as ' the gang capital of America ' , has launched a crackdown on the new threat .
The latest front is the tiny strip of turf known as Harbor Gateway , a nest of streets between malls and office blocks .
It was here , just before Christmas , that Cheryl Green , a 14 - year - old fond of junk food and television , died .
At school she had just written a poem beginning : ' I am black and beautiful .
I wonder how I shall live in the future . '
She never found out .
As she stood on a corner talking with friends , two Hispanic members of the neighbourhood 's notorious 204th Street gang walked up and opened fire , killing Green and wounding three others .
They were targeted because they were black .
Traditionally the outside view of LA gangs has been of black youths like the Bloods and the Crips and their countless subsets .
It focused on the streets of Compton and South - Central and the culture of gangsta rap .
But Hispanic gangs are in the ascendant , spreading across America .
They have names such as Mara Salvatrucha , La Mirada Locos and Barrio Van Nuys , and now the 204th Street gang - who made it clear that they will kill innocent girls to force black families off their turf .
Last year there were 269 gang - related killings in LA .
Gang - related crime leaped 15.7 per cent last year , as most other types of crime fell .
Hate crimes against black people have surged .
With a rapidly growing Hispanic population , LA 's gang culture is shifting .
It means that being black in the wrong neighbourhood can get you killed .
Green 's murder was the latest in a line of killings by the 204th Street gang .
In 1997 , 11 - year - old Marquis Wilbert was killed on his bike .
In 2001 , Robert Hightower , 19 , was killed .
In 2003 , Eric Butler , 39 , was shot dead trying to protect his daughter from being harassed .
There are streets that blacks have been forbidden to cross .
Green 's death brought the gang war between ' brown and black ' to public awareness .
Next week a summit will be held called the Black and Brown Strategy Meeting which aims to head off a race war .
' All of the signs are there that a racial war is going to explode in this city , ' says Khalid Shah , director of Stop the Violence , one of the groups organising the meeting .
Memories of the 1992 Rodney King riots , which claimed 53 lives , remain fresh , but Shah believes that worse is ahead .
' It will be 10 times bigger than what happened after King .
You are looking at an event which could not only paralyse an entire city but an entire state , ' he warns .
Green 's death sparked Villaraigosa 's crackdown .
The police took the unprecedented step of publishing a list of the 11 worst gangs , including 204th Street .
They vowed to go after them with police , FBI agents and injunctions to prevent members meeting .
An extra 50 police were assigned to anti-gang duties in San Fernando Valley .
In south LA , a team of 120 detectives and 10 FBI agents has been set up .
An extra 18 officers have been put into Harbor Gateway .
But Angelenos have seen it all before .
The city 's history is littered with anti-gang initiatives , and what the new effort shows is just how widespread the gangs have become .
They have spread into the San Fernando Valley , an area previously famed for suburban prosperity .
Last year one area of the north Valley saw a 160 per cent rise in gang crime .
Publishing the ' hit list ' could backfire .
In the warped gang sub-culture , being on the list is a badge of pride .
The lesson of the 204th Street gang seems apt .
They number only a few dozen members in a tiny strip of city that was open fields half a century ago , but killing blacks has propelled them from obscurity to enviable notoriety .
' Putting out a list was a bad idea .
Groups that do n't make the list will want to be on it .
They do n't exactly think rationally , ' said Alex Alonso , a gang historian who has testified in more than 100 court cases .
Yet there is hope .
Alfonso ' Chino ' Visuet , 23 , was sucked into the gang life as a teenager .
There was the lure of excitement and riches , the push of a difficult home life .
' People who join a gang are always running away from something .
They flee to the gang , ' Visuet says .
Visuet is not running any more .
He works for Father Boyle 's Homeboy Industries ( homeboy - industries.org ) , a project that helps people leave gang life .
It provides jobs , an education , pays to have gang tattoos removed and gives counselling .
It aims to remove the circumstances that lead to crime : poverty , abuse and unemployment .
It is staffed almost entirely by former gang members and has spun off a bakery , a silk - screen printers and a restaurant .
' You have to address the lethal absence of hope .
I have never seen a hopeful person join a gang , ' Boyle says .
It worked for Visuet .
He starts college this autumn and wants to be a probation officer .
' I was on the edge of doing something that would ruin my life , either by doing violence or having it done to me .
That 's over now , ' he says .
For the moment it is organisations like Homeboy Industries that pick up the slack .
Father Boyle has a catchphrase : ' Nothing stops a bullet like a job . '
But that can be a hard message to get across in a city whose political classes see gangs as primarily a police issue .
That is not the way it is on the street .
Visuet despairs at the conflict .
' A brown gang member now just sees a black gang member .
What they do n't see is how that person comes from the same place they do .
They might have a mother who is an alcoholic as well or a father who beats on them .
They have the same story , ' he says .
Boyle and others have mixed feelings about the crackdown .
The road to LA 's problems is littered with failed plans and policing , and incompetence .
Over the past decade the main anti-gang scheme , LA Bridges , has spent more than $ 100 m yet keeps no record of whether those it helps leave gang life or return to it .
Then there is political scheming .
The list of 11 gangs , critics say , was drawn up deliberately to present a ' balance ' by covering the whole city .
Politicians use the presence of a high - profile gang to act tough on law and order and police chiefs use it as a way of upping manpower .
' It is a ridiculous list , ' says Alonso .
LA is a city of two worlds - Hollywood and gangs .
On a two - lane highway that roars through the middle of Harbor Gateway , a few hundred yards from where Cheryl Green was gunned down , there is a billboard for a new TV show called Sons of Hollywood .
It shows three rich young men against a backdrop of palm trees .
It claims to be a ' reality ' show , but for most of the impoverished , racially torn citizens it is nothing more than a fantasy .
New research provides a model for improving an alternative energy source .
In the debate over alternative energy resources , geothermal technology has received scant media attention .
Advocates call it one of the cleanest , sustainable energy resources available .
However , steep construction , equipment and drilling costs have prevented more widespread development of geothermal technology .
An Ohio University hydrothermal systems expert is working to change that .
Geothermal technology harnesses energy created by heat at the Earth ’s core .
Internationally , geothermal power plants supply electricity to about 60 million people , mostly in developing countries .
In the United States , geothermal power plants supply four million residents with electricity .
Power plants are built where there is access to a geothermal reservoir , which typically occurs along continental plate margins .
The Pacific “ Ring of Fire ” provides some of the hottest spots on the planet for geothermal power .
Because of this , Central America is a prime building area for geothermal power plants and draws researchers such as Ohio University hydrogeochemist Dina Lopez .
Lopez recently completed a study in El Salvador of one of the biggest problems plaguing the geothermal industry .
That study earned Lopez and her co-authors a best paper award from the Geothermal Resources Council .
The researchers integrated findings from several studies examining the process of silica scaling .
Power plants are built at geothermal reservoirs , where wells release steam , heat or hot water to spin turbine generators and produce electricity .
Silica , which is released from dissolving rock , is a common element found in water .
After extraction from the reservoirs , hot water cools down and silica precipitates , forming hard , glassy deposits that clog pipelines and injection drill holes at geothermal plants .
Removing the silica buildup is costly and difficult due to the high volumes of water involved .
Lopez , an associate professor of geological sciences at Ohio University , and her co-authors created a model to better understand the impact of silica scaling and the rate at which it occurs .
Their research shows that a combination of experimental field work and geochemical modeling programs can provide accurate indicators of the impact of silica scaling in geothermal wells .
“ We used simple experiments to show the big picture , ” said Lopez , who believes the group ’s findings will help guide efforts to control silica scaling at geothermal power plants .
Better control of silica scaling will help reduce the cost of maintaining geothermal plants .
That ’s good news for Lopez , who hopes her research will encourage the use of geothermal energy , which she says has been overshadowed by the debate over nuclear energy and the public ’s reliance on fossil fuels .
“ Geothermal energy has enormous potential , ” she said .
“ There are hundreds of geothermal fields in the world , but they have n’t been exploited because of our ability to easily get energy from oil and other sources . ”
M. Castro and J. Reyes Lopez from the University of Baja California , Mexicali , Mexico , and A. Matus , W. Guevara , F. Montalvo and C.E. Guerra from LaGeo , El Salvador , co-authored the paper presented at the annual meeting of the Geothermal Resources Council .
There ’s an interesting articlle in The Washington Post today about a little - known Federal law , beefed up by an Executive Order issued in the wake of 9/11 that is having an impact on the ability of ordinary Americans to buy products or obtain services :
Private businesses such as rental and mortgage companies and car dealers are checking the names of customers against a list of suspected terrorists and drug traffickers made publicly available by the Treasury Department , sometimes denying services to ordinary people whose names are similar to those on the list .
The Office of Foreign Asset Control ’s list of “ specially designated nationals ” has long been used by banks and other financial institutions to block financial transactions of drug dealers and other criminals .
But an executive order issued by President Bush after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks has expanded the list and its consequences in unforeseen ways .
Businesses have used it to screen applicants for home and car loans , apartments and even exercise equipment , according to interviews and a report by the Lawyers ’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area to be issued today .
“ The way in which the list is being used goes far beyond contexts in which it has a link to national security , ” said Shirin Sinnar , the report ’s author .
“ The government is effectively conscripting private businesses into the war on terrorism but doing so without making sure that businesses do n’t trample on individual rights . ”
Basically , the list is similar to the no-fly list , except when you end up on it , you may find it impossible to conduct business or even buy a house .
Consider this example :
Tom Kubbany is neither a terrorist nor a drug trafficker , has average credit and has owned homes in the past , so the Northern California mental - health worker was baffled when his mortgage broker said lenders were not interested in him .
Reviewing his loan file , he discovered something shocking .
At the top of his credit report was an OFAC alert provided by credit bureau TransUnion that showed that his middle name , Hassan , is an alias for Ali Saddam Hussein , purportedly a “ son of Saddam Hussein . ”
The record is not clear on whether Ali Saddam Hussein was a Hussein offspring , but the OFAC list stated he was born in 1980 or 1983 .
Kubbany was born in Detroit in 1949 .
Under OFAC guidance , the date discrepancy signals a false match .
Still , Kubbany said , the broker decided not to proceed .
“ She just talked with a bunch of lenders over the phone and they said , ‘ No , ’ ” he said .
“ So we said , ‘ The heck with it .
We ’ll just go somewhere else . ’ ” Kubbany and his wife are applying for another loan , though he worries that the stigma lingers .
“ There ’s a dark cloud over us , ” he said .
“ We will never know if we had qualified for the mortgage last summer , then we might have been in a house now . ”
Want to lose weight ?
Too bad , no treadmill for you :
In another case , a Roseville , Calif. , couple wanted to buy a treadmill from a home fitness store on a financing plan .
A bank representative told the salesperson that because the husband ’s first name was Hussein , the couple would have to wait 72 hours while they were investigated .
Though the couple eventually received the treadmill , they were so embarrassed by the incident they did not want their names in the report , Sinnar said .
There are other examples cited in the article , each of which makes clear that the OFAC list , much like the TSA ’s infamous no - fly list is fast approaching the point where it ’s out of control and clearly is n’t designed in a way where it targets people who might actually try to buy harmful substances that could be used in terrorist attacks .
It ’s a combination of bueracracy and bad intelligence , and it ’s yet another way in which ordinary Americans are finding their lives turned upside down by measures enacted in response to the War on Terror .
Reports that AT&T wants to shed DirecTV are not new , but now is an excellent time for AT&T to simplify and clean up its stable of video distribution services .
