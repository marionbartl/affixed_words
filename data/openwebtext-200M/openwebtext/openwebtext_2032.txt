Blogging will be allowed , but there will be restrictions
The IOC has set out guidelines for blogging at the Beijing Games to ensure copyright agreements are not infringed .
They include bans on posting any audio or visual material of action from the games themselves .
The move follows the increasing use of unofficial blogs by athletes in previous Games , including Athens in 2004 and the Turin Winter Games .
" It is required that , when accredited persons at the games post any Olympic content , it be confined solely to their own personal Olympic - related experience , " said an IOC statement .
' Personal expression '
Posting confidential information about other people is also outlawed .
" The IOC considers blogging ... as a legitimate form of personal expression and not a form of journalism , " the Olympic authority said .
" Blogs should be dignified and in good taste . "
The IOC guidelines follow concern that the games could become highly politicised , with China 's human rights record , its treatment of dissidents and links with Sudan becoming major issues .
Some national Olympic committees in Europe found themselves at the centre of a row after being accused of trying to prevent athletes from speaking out on issues such as Darfur .
The presidents of two large labor unions have written to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to complain that Mark Penn , her pollster and chief strategist , is chief executive of a public relations firm that is helping a company fight a unionization drive .
In the letter sent Friday , which a labor official released yesterday , James P. Hoffa , president of the Teamsters , and Bruce Raynor , president of Unite Here , wrote that they did not want to see Mrs. Clinton or the Democratic Party embarrassed by the anti-union activities of Mr. Penn 's firm , Burson - Marsteller , one of the nation 's leading public relations companies .
" If Hillary is pro-worker and pro-union , she will certainly take steps to rein in Mr. Penn , " Mr. Hoffa said in an interview .
" He cannot serve two masters , working for a pro-union candidate and working for anti-union companies . "
In the letter , Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Raynor said , " It is with distress that we write you today , " adding that they valued Mrs. Clinton 's positions on many worker - related issues .
They said the public relations firm's " activities in the effort to undermine workers ' right to organize at Cintas , a campaign our unions are involved in , is particularly disheartening . "
Four years ago , the two unions began a major drive to unionize 17,000 workers at the Cintas Corporation , the nation 's largest uniform rental company .
Cintas , helped by Burson - Marsteller , has responded with a vigorous - and thus far successful - effort to resist unionization .
Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Raynor , whose union represents apparel , hotel and restaurant workers , noted that they had learned of Burson - Marsteller 's anti-union activities in an article last week in The Nation magazine .
Their action comes as Mrs. Clinton prepares to speak at an A.F.L. - C.I.O. forum on Saturday in Detroit .

Mr. Penn did polling for Bill Clinton when he was president and has long been a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton .
Thirty years ago , Mr. Penn founded a prominent polling firm , now known as Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates .
In December 2005 , he was named chief executive of Burson - Marsteller .
In interviews , Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Raynor stopped short of calling on Mrs. Clinton to disassociate herself from Mr. Penn .
Mr. Raynor said , " She ought to send a clear message to this guy Penn that she is unhappy about this union - busting stuff and that he should n't be associated with it . "
Mr. Penn , speaking for himself and for the Clinton presidential campaign , said : " Senator Clinton 's well - documented support for pro-union causes would not in any way be affected by some clients in a firm related to the corporate network of one of her advisers .
There is no connection whatsoever with her pro-union record . "
Mr. Penn said that he had worked for Democratic candidates for 30 years and that Burson - Marsteller worked for Democrats and Republicans .
As for Cintas , he said , " I personally had zero involvement in any of the work related to Cintas . "
He said Burson - Marsteller had begun representing Cintas well before he joined the firm .

An unprecedented battle is taking place inside the Kremlin in advance of Vladimir Putin 's departure from office , the Guardian has learned , with claims that the president presides over a secret multibillion - dollar fortune .
Rival clans inside the Kremlin are embroiled in a struggle for the control of assets as Putin prepares to transfer power to his hand - picked successor , Dmitry Medvedev , in May , well - placed political observers and other sources have revealed .
At stake are billions of dollars in assets belonging to Russian state - run corporations .
Additionally , details of Putin's own personal fortune , reportedly hidden in Switzerland and Liechtenstein , are being discussed for the first time .
The claims over the president 's assets surfaced last month when the Russian political expert Stanislav Belkovsky gave an interview to the German newspaper Die Welt .
They have since been repeated in the Washington Post and the Moscow Times , with speculation over the fortune appearing on the internet .
Citing sources inside the president 's administration , Belkovsky claims that after eight years in power Putin has secretly accumulated more than $ 40 bn ( Â£ 20 bn ) .
The sum would make him Russia 's - and Europe 's - richest man .
In an interview with the Guardian , Belkovsky repeated his claims that Putin owns vast holdings in three Russian oil and gas companies , concealed behind a " non-transparent network of offshore trusts " .
Putin " effectively " controls 37 % of the shares of Surgutneftegaz , an oil exploration company and Russia 's third biggest oil producer , worth $ 20 bn , he says .
He also owns 4.5 % of Gazprom , and " at least 75 % " of Gunvor , a mysterious Swiss - based oil trader , founded by Gennady Timchenko , a friend of the president 's , Belkovsky alleges .
Asked how much Putin was worth , Belkovsky said : " At least $ 40 bn .
Maximum we can not know .
I suspect there are some businesses I know nothing about . "
He added : " It may be more .
It may be much more .
" Putin 's name does n't appear on any shareholders ' register , of course .
There is a non-transparent scheme of successive ownership of offshore companies and funds .
The final point is in Zug [ in Switzerland ] and Liechtenstein .
Vladimir Putin should be the beneficiary owner . "
Putin has not commented on Belkovsky 's claims .
The Guardian put the allegations to the Kremlin but was told Putin 's chief spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , was not available .
Discussion of Putin 's wealth has previously been taboo .
But the claims have leaked out against the backdrop of a fight inside the Kremlin between a group led by Igor Sechin , Putin 's influential deputy chief of staff , and a " liberal " clan that includes Medvedev .
The Sechin group is made up of siloviki - Kremlin officials with security / military backgrounds .
It is said to include Nikolai Patrushev , the head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , Russia 's KGB successor agency , his deputy Alexander Bortnikov , and Putin 's aide Viktor Ivanov .
Those associated with the liberal camp include Roman Abramovich , the Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club who is close to Putin and the Yeltsin family .
Other members are Viktor Cherkesov , the head of the federal drug control service , and Alisher Usmanov , an Uzbek - born billionaire .
Insiders say the struggle has little to do with ideology .
They characterise it as a war between business competitors .
Putin 's decision to endorse as president Medvedev - who has no links with the secret services - dealt a severe blow to the hardline Sechin clan , they add .
Some analysts have said Putin would like to retire but has been forced to carry on to shield Medvedev from siloviki plotting .
Others disagree and say Putin wants to stay in power .
On Monday Putin confirmed he intends next year to become Russia 's prime minister .
" The siloviki are not at all nice , " Yulia Latynina , a Russian political commentator said .
Latynina , who hosts a political talkshow on the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy , was one of the first journalists to draw attention last month to Putin 's reported links with Gunvor .
The company is based in Zug , a picturesque Swiss canton known as a bolthole for publicity - shy international businessmen .
Gunvor has neither a website nor a Moscow office - but in 2007 posted profits of $ 8bn on a turnover of $ 43bn , an astronomic figure , according to industry experts .
Like Putin , its reclusive owner , Timchenko , worked in the KGB 's foreign affairs directorate .
He is said to have met Russia 's president in the late 1980s through KGB circles .
Gunvor , which has its head office in Geneva , failed to comment .
Critics say the wave of renationalisations under Putin has transformed Putin 's associates into multimillionaires .
The dilemma now facing the Kremlin 's elite is how to hang on to its wealth if Putin leaves power , experts say .
Most of its money is located in the west , they add .
The pressing problem is how to protect these funds from any future administration that may seek to reclaim them .
" There 's no point in having all this money if you can't travel to the Maldives or Paris and spend it , " Elena Panfilova , the director of Transparency International in Russia said .
The first hints of the intra-clan warfare gripping the Kremlin emerged last month , when the FSB arrested General Alexander Bulbov , the deputy head of the federal drug agency , and part of the liberal group .
His arrest saw a surreal standoff , with his bodyguards and FSB agents pointing machine guns at each other .
Earlier this month Russia 's deputy finance minister , Sergei Storchak - another " liberal " - was also arrested and charged with embezzling $ 43.4 m .
He is currently in prison .
His boss , Russia 's finance minister , Alexei Kudrin , part of the liberal clan , says he is innocent .
But the liberal group - one of several competing factions inside the Kremlin - has struck back .
Earlier this month Oleg Shvartsman , a previously obscure businessman , gave an interview to Kommersant newspaper claiming he secretly managed the finances of a group of FSB officers .
Their assets were worth Â£ 1.6bn , he revealed .
The officers were involved in " velvet reprivatisations " , Shvartsman , a fund manager , said - in effect forcibly acquiring private companies at below - market value and transforming them into state - owned firms .
These assets were redistributed via offshore companies , he said .
According to Panfilova , the " randomised " corruption of the 1990s has given way to the " systemic and institutionalised corruption " of the Putin era .
Members of Putin 's cabinet personally control the most important sectors of the economy - oil , gas and defence .
Medvedev is chairman of Gazprom ; Sechin runs Rosneft ; other ministers are chairmen of Russian railways , Aeroflot , a nuclear fuel giant and an energy transport enterprise .
Putin has created a new , more streamlined oligarchy , his critics say .
" The crown jewels of the country 's wealth have ended up in the hands of Putin 's inner circle , " Vladimir Rzyhkov - a former independent MP - wrote in Monday 's Moscow Times .
Belkovsky - who published a book about Putin 's finances last year , and who is the director of the National Strategic Institute , a Moscow thinktank - claims he is confident of his assessment of Putin 's hidden wealth .
" It 's not a secret among the elites , ' he said .
" But please pay attention that Vladimir Vladimirovich [ Putin ] has never sued me . "
Belkovsky adds that the west has misunderstood Putin and has been distracted by his " neo - Soviet " image .
Putin , Belkovsky claims , is ultimately a " classic " businessman who believes money can solve any problem , and whose psychology was shaped by his experiences working in the St Petersburg mayor 's office in Russia 's crime - ridden early 1990s .
" He is quite sure of this .
A problem that can't be resolved with $ 1bn can be resolved with $ 10bn , and if not with $ 10 bn then $ 20bn , and so on , " Belkovsky said .
In an interview on Wednesday with Time magazine , which named Putin its person of the year , the president vehemently denied that those inside the Kremlin were corrupt .
Asked whether " some of the people closest to you are getting rich " , Putin said : " Then you know who and how .
Write to us , to the foreign ministry , if you are so confident .
I presume you know the names , you know the systems and the tools .
" I can assure you and everyone who would listen to us , watch us and read us , that the reaction would be swift , immediate , [ and ] within the prevailing law . "

INTRODUCTION
I use both digital and film cameras all the time .
They each serve a different purpose .
Film and digital capture are completely different media .
They are used for similar purposes , but they themselves are completely unrelated to each other .
I 'd have an easier time and get in less trouble comparing my mom to a maid or my wife to something else than attempting a comparison of film to digital cameras .
That said , here goes .
Most people get better results with digital cameras .
I prefer the look of film .
Film takes much more work .
Extremely skilled photographers can get better results on film if they can complete the many more steps from shot to print all perfectly .
Because there are so many ways things can go wrong with making prints from film , especially from print ( negative ) film , beginning photographers and hobbyists usually get better prints from digital because there are fewer variables to control .
I get my digital prints made at Costco and they look stunning .
Mark the Costco bag " Print as - is. No corrections " and your prints will look like your screen , so long as you 've left your camera in its default sRGB mode .
Labs usually make awful prints from film , which is why people who do n't print their work personally get better results from digital .
I 've never been happy with prints from negatives made for me by any lab regardless of cost .
This is because prints from negatives are at the mercy of the eye of the person making the print .
If you 're not making the prints yourself you usually get something completely different than you wanted , which means junk .
That 's why most photographers shoot slide ( transparency ) film , since the printer can see exactly what the photographer intended .
Large format film still rules for serious landscape photography .
I use digital for people , fun shots and convenience .
Digital replaced film in 1999 for big -city newspapers .
The biggest reason the results look different is the highlights .
We 're used to the way film looks .
It overloads gracefully when things get too light or wash out .
This mimics our eye far better than digital .
Digital 's weak point is that highlights abruptly clip and look horrible as soon as anything hits white .
Unlike film there is no gradual overload to white .
Digital cameras ' characteristic curve heads straight to 255 white and just crashes into the wall .
it 's the same with video versus motion picture film .
If any broad area like a forehead is overexposed your image looks like crap on digital .
This effect is similar on cheap pocket cameras , my expensive Nikon D200 and $ 250,000 professional digital cinema cameras .
A smaller reason is that film , especially larger format film used in landscape photography , has more resolution .
This becomes important as print size increases to wall size but invisible in 5 x 7 " prints .
Which is Better ?
Neither is better on an absolute basis .
The choice depends on your application .
Once you know your application the debate goes away .
The debate only exists when people presume erroneously that someone else 's needs mirror their own .
I can get great 12 x 18 " glossy prints for $ 2.99 at Costco every day from my digital camera , and we all can get fuzzy results on film .
It 's the artist , not the medium , which defines quality .
If and only if you 're an accomplished artist who can extract every last drop from film 's quality then film , meaning large format film , technically is better than digital in every way .
Few people have the skill to work film out to this level , thus the debate .
Most people get better results from digital .
Artists print their own work , but if you use a lab for prints you 'll have more control and get better results from digital .
Convenience has always won out over ultimate quality throughout the history of photography .
Huge home - made wet glass plates led to store - bought dry plates which led to 8 x 10 " sheet film which led to 4 x 5 " sheet film which led to 2 - 1 / 4 " roll film which led to 35 mm which led to digital .
As the years roll on the ultimate quality obtained in each smaller medium drops , while the average results obtained by everyone climbs .
In 1860 only a few skilled artisans like my great - great - great grandfather in Scotland could coax any sort of an image at all from a plate camera while normal people could n't even take photos at all .
In 1940 normal people got fuzzy snaps from their Brownies and flashbulbs while artists got incredible results on 8 x 10 " film .
Today artists still mess with 4 x 5 " cameras and normal people are getting the best photos they ever have on 3 MP digital cameras printed at the local photo lab .
So why the debate ?
I suspect the debate is among amateurs who 've really only shot 35 mm since it's been the only popular amateur film format for the past 25 years .
Pros never say " film , " they say a format like " 120 , " " 4x5 , " " 6x17 , " " 8x20 " or " 35 " since " film " could mean so many things .
Amateurs say " film " since they only use one format and presume 35 mm .
Therein lies the potential for debate when people do n't first define their terminology .
Today 's digital SLRs replace 35 mm , no big deal .
Most people will get far better prints from a 6MP DSLR like the D70 than they will paying someone else to print their 35 mm film .
I 'm a little crazy : I shoot 4 x 5 " transparency film for serious gallery work and large prints .
Most film shooters shoot the smaller 35 mm size film and use print film , not transparencies .
Digital cameras give much better results than 35 mm print film unless you are custom printing your own film because the colors from digital are not subject to the whims of the lab doing the printing .
Digital cameras give me much better and more accurate colors than I 've ever gotten with print film .
If I can spend all day making a custom print from a large transparency I 'll use film , and if all I need is a 12 x 18 " print ( small for me but big to most people ) then a print from my D70 is better and faster .
Digital is far more convenient and offers great quality for photojournalism and portraits , and film is king for large prints and reproduction where textures in nature and landscapes are important .
The violent film vs. digital WWF death match smackdown articles are just to sell magazines and digital cameras .
I 'll get to the detailed differences below , but first let me put the whole issue in perspective .
It 's really too bad that many hobbyists and photo magazines present this as a warlike win / lose issue with film somehow involved in a death struggle against digital and waste their time arguing amongst themselves in vacuous chat rooms instead of just going out and trying it for themselves .
One first needs to define just what one is going to do with the photographs .
For most things digital is far more convenient if you 're shooting hundreds of images , making prints smaller than a few feet on a side and posting on websites and email , and for other things like landscape photography for reproduction and large fine prints film is better .
Ignore me .
Just look here for why a magazine like Arizona Highways simply does not accept images from digital cameras for publication since the quality is not good enough , even from 16 megapixel cameras , to print at 12 x 18 . "
Arizona highways does n't even accept 35 mm film , and rarely medium format film ; they usually only print from 4 x 5 " large format film .
Here 's a comment from Arizona Highways after they got a lot of hate mail from amateurs on the previous link .
As of November 2005 Arizona Highways admits here that it will take digital , but only for smaller images .
To quote from Peter Ensengerger , Arizona Highways Director of Photography , in that most recent article : " digital still ca nât touch large - format film for the full - page reproductions that have made Arizona Highways famous " and " The 4x5 view camera remains unsurpassed for landscape photography . "
Film and digital do different things better and complement each other .
Neither is going away , although film will decline in areas where digital excels , like news .
Film has already disappeared from professional newspaper use a year or so ago , although small town papers may still use it , and likewise , no digital capture system has come anywhere near replacing 8x10 " large format film for huge exhibition prints that need to be hellaciously detailed .
Film is not going away
I have a whole article on this here
WHY YOU HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR YOURSELF back to top
Other people 's abstract technical analysis or magazine articles or websites can't tell you which looks better .
You have to look for yourself .
If you want to do a technical analysis the things you should be investigating instead of resolution and bit depth are the far more important issues of color gamut , highlight rendition , convolved spectral response curves , sharpening algorithms and overall transfer functions , although only the math Ph.Ds. understand these .
Honestly , if you do n't trust your own vision then you should give up photography right now , since vision and power of observation are the most important aspects of photography !
Artists just look at the images and realize each does different things better and each has a very different look for different subjects .
WHICH IS BETTER back to top
Debating which is better is as silly as debating girls vs. boys or apples vs. oranges or oils vs. Prismacolor .
It all depends on what you want done .
Ignore people who insist that one is better than the other without stating their end purpose .
It all depends on what you are trying to accomplish .
I shoot about 1,000 images every week on my D1H or D70 and I 'll go out and shoot $ 1,000 worth of film on another week .
It all depends on the subject .
Sometimes I shoot on both formats if I need film for quality and am too lazy to want to wait and scan my chromes for immediate distribution .
Let 's explore the advantages and disadvantages of each .
If you 're in a rush you 'll find the " disadvantages " section of digital particularly enlightening , since there are very good reasons digital looks as it does unknown to newcomers ( people who have only been in this ten or fifteen years ) .
I 've been studying digital imaging since I was a kid and making my living at it full time since the 1980s .
One also needs to define what sort of digital and what sort of film one is comparing .
There are at least two different classes for each .
For " film " we have slide film ( used by most professionals and I ) and negative ( print ) film ( used by amateurs ) .
As you know , all film looks different , and in my case , I love the look I get from Velvia .
Most other film looks boring to me .
When I speak of " film " I mean Velvia ; others of course may mean something else .
Black and white again is even more different .
For " digital " we have many fixed - lens digital point - and - shoot cameras with smaller , noisier CCDs and lots of JPG compression , and DSLR cameras with huge , clean CCDs and mild or no JPG compression .
HOW TO GET THE BEST DIGITAL IMAGE back to top
The best way to get a digital image is by shooting film and having it scanned .
I 'm not comparing that here ; this is a camera discussion .
CAUTION : In Hollywood movie production we have a phrase called " finishing . "
" Finishing on film " means the end product is film .
" Finishing on video " means the end product is video .
One can start and capture images on any medium and we have ways to convert anything to anything .
In other words , we can shoot either on film or video , and convert either to the other if we need it .
Yes , some major motion pictures today , like " Panic Room , " were scanned from film , color corrected , edited and color timed in a computer , and written back out to film on the Arri Laser film recorder for duplication and release .
We also can take video and write it onto film , too , and you as a still photographer also have these options .
I have taken digital camera files and had them written onto slides .
That costs about $ 5.00 - 2.50 a slide .
When doing any comparisons you need to pay attention to the medium in which the comparison is made .
Every other film vs. digital comparison I 've seen finished in digital , and unfortunately they were always using a cheap consumer scanner to convert the film to digital .
A $ 1,500 Nikon scanner and my $ 3,000 Minolta scanner are both cheap consumer scanners , as is the $ 10,000 Imacon , all intended for use by end user - owners .
A professional scanner costs about $ 50,000 and takes years of experience to learn to get great results .
The $ 3,000 scanners still lose information from the film when trying to make a comparison , and even a $ 50,000 scanner 's images still have to be displayed on the limited color range of a computer monitor .
These typical comparisons of course put the film at a huge disadvantage since they are eliminating all of film 's advantages and reducing the comparison to the trivial resolution issues the newbies argue about .
Worse yet , one comparison in American Photo magazine did this in the March / April 2002 issue , and the same thing happened here .
They only compared prints made on an Epson !
The folly is that they were not comparing film to digital , but film scanned and printed at the consumer level to digital .
In this case digital is at its very best , and the film is of course at the limit of the cheap consumer scanners and printer .
They did n't bother to have their color house use the $ 50,000 scanner everything else gets scanned on for reproduction in the magazine , and of course they are limited by the limited color range of the Epson printer and whatever color space they used .
A legitimate comparison would be to compare an Epson print from the digital camera to a Fuji Supergloss print directly from the slide film or a Heidelberg scan .
If your final product is printed on an Epson then this is a valid way to compare .
If you want to see how good film really looks you have to look at the slides directly or printed properly on Cibachrome or Supergloss .
By definition , anything you see on the Internet is obviously limited by this issue .
The flaw here is that one is not comparing to film but comparing to a cheap scan of the film and then presented at screen resolution ( 72 DPI ) .
Another way to make a real comparison is to write the digital file back out to film and look at the two under a loupe .
I 've done this .
The original film always looks so much better this way due to the greater color range and more vivid reds and greens .
Let 's begin !
ADVANTAGES :
FILM :
IMAGE QUALITY
RESOLUTION : A glass plate from 1880 still has more resolution than a Canon 1Ds - MkII .
Film always wins here when used by a skilled photographer .
One source of confusion is here , which uses bad science using prints too small ( 13 x 19 " ) to show the difference .
Also note that you 're not even seeing the actual prints , but screen resolution images ( about 72 - 100DPI ) at that site .
He throws away most of the resolution of the film .
( It does n't matter that his film was scanned at 3,200 DPI and it 's completely irrelevant that the printer was set to 2880 DPI , since all that resolution was down - converted for your screen . )
As I keep trying to say , if all you want is 13 x 19 " inkjet prints made on a $ 700 Epson by all means get an $ 8,000 1Ds .
If you want to feel the texture of every grain of sand on a 40 x 60 " print , stick with 4 x 5 " as photographers do .
Forget the naive debate over pixel counts .
There are far more important aspects to picture quality .
If you do fret this , film has far more equivalent pixels , there 's no question about that .
I show this further down here .
You also can see that in the March / April 2004 edition of Photo Techniques magazine where a guy actually shot USAF resolution targets with both 35 mm film and a digital SLR and immediately discovered that even 35 mm film has three times the resolution , duh .
A great page by one of those people who actually has the time to post all this is here .
This is much less important than " the look . "
Here is the biggest difference between film and digital .
Just as one film looks different from another , digital looks very different from any film .
Either you like it or you do n't .
Film is the result of over 100 years of refinement .
Digital is just starting out .
Pixel count is just a secondary issue .
If you do fret the pixel counts , I find that it takes about 25 megapixels to simulate 35 mm film 's practical resolution , which is still far more than any practical digital camera .
At the 6 megapixel level digital gives about the same sharpness as a duplicate slide , which is plenty for most things .
Of course I use much bigger film than 35 mm for all the pretty pictures you see at my website , so digital would need about 100 megapixels to simulate medium format , or 500 megapixels to simulate 4x5 , " even if the highlight issue was resolved which it is n't .
This resolution issue is invisible at Internet resolutions or 13 x 19 " Epson prints , but obvious in gallery size prints .
35 mm is mostly used by amateurs at this time , since the news guys all went digital two years ago.
35 chromes ' last vestige as of 2004 is monthly sports and journalism magazines .
The travel mags usually are shot on 120 .
The key to resolution debates is to ask yourself how big you will ever need to print an image .
If you are happy with small sizes like 13 x 19 " then by all means digital cameras are all you 'd need if you can work around their highlight issues .
Some people want to ensure that we will be able to offer prints of any size to future clients , and big film provides this safety .
And with that :
OK , I 've had it with this idiocy .
back to top of article
Here are the examples I 've been too busy shooting to waste my time scanning and posting .
We all know the other websites showing a big name digital SLR looking as good as film resolution .
Baloney .
You may not realize that those sites are actually sponsored by those camera companies and the guy running them does n't really know how to get good results on film .
He then only compares them at such low resolution that you can't see what film 's resolution is all about .
It takes skill to get optimum resolution on film .
These are two crops out of this image , one shot on a brand new digital camera and the other on a cheap film camera with a 50 year - old lens :
Full frame showing crop enlarged below
Crop from Film Image
Crop from Digital Camera Image
The digital camera photo looks like crud !
How can this be ?
This is why professional landscape shooters shoot 4 x 5 " film , even in 2005 .
Just read Outdoor Photographer 's August 2005 annual landscape issue where they profile prominent shooters .
The film was scanned at just 1800 DPI and the digital image rescaled to match exactly for a fair and balanced comparison .
As enlarged here on your computer 's 100 DPI screen the full images would both print at 60 x 80 . "
They 'd print at 20 x 24 " at print 's usual 300 DPI .
The wind was blowing so some of the leaves are in different positions , not that you even can see them in the digital image .
For the film image I used the cheapest landscape camera there is , a $ 700 4 x 5 " Tachihara and my 50 year old Schneider Symmar 150 mm f/5.6
Convertible lens with a huge dent in the lens barrel and ordinary Fuji Velvia film .
This camera is very popular with landscape photographers due to its low cost , light weight and flexibility .
The 150 mm lens is normal for a 4 x 5 " camera .
This image was scanned on a cheap consumer $ 500 flatbed scanner , the EPSON 4990 , at 1,800 DPI , which does n't even give you all the film 's detail .
If I really wanted to reproduce the film 's sharpness I 'd have it scanned at 5,000 DPI on a professional $ 100,000 Heidelberg .
There 's more detail on the film than you can see here .
It would be a fairer test to have a real drum scan made , but I 'm too cheap to send it out for scanning since the point is pretty obvious even at 1,800 DPI .
The digital camera image is the same crop from a brand - new multi-megapixel digital camera made by the same company that keeps paying some bad - science photography websites to pimp it as being better than film .
Here are examples of what 's actually on film compared to how little scanners can see today .
Comparisons to Other Formats
Some ask why do n't I compare to a 35 mm film camera or to a 4 x 5 " digital system ?
Simple : landscapes as I shoot are shot most commonly in 4 x 5 . "
Others shoot them in 8x10 " or larger film formats .
Using the smallest serious 4 x 5 " format is probably handing film a disadvantage in this comparison for landscapes .
35 mm is an amateur format when it comes to landscapes .
You can get a complete 4 x 5 " system like I use , including a lens and digital scanner making fabulous 100 MB images , for under $ 2,000 !
People shooting landscapes with digital are using small , under - $ 10,000 cameras exactly like I used for this practical and equitable comparison .
4x5 " digital systems cost $ 25,000 , and those backs are scanning backs , not area sensors .
There are no 4 x 5 " CCDs !
You have to wait around for the back to scan across the image just like a film scanner .
If you used them for a shot of the tree , motion between passes for the three colors would turn the entire live tree into all sorts of whacky color outlines !
4x5 " digital systems are for still lifes in the studio , not nature .
They also need huge batteries and tethered computer systems .
They are for the studio , not nature .
Digital systems still are n't players in 4 x 5 " for outdoor photography because they scan an area smaller than 4 x 5 . "
This means that 1 . ) you can't get the wide angles I need , and 2 . ) they require even more precision in their adjustments .
4x5 " cameras are adjusted by hand while looking at the ground glass .
it 's enough of a pain to do this well with a 75 mm wide angle lens .
I would n't be able to make these fine adjustments if I needed a 47 mm lens to cover the same area .
More Comparisons
Here you can see a comparison between a Nikon D100 and a 4x5 .
Here 's another comparison which shows if you 're concerned about resolution that even medium format film , scanned even on an amateur scanner like the Nikon 8000 , still is in a completely better class than anything digital .
Note like most of these comparisons there are no explanations of the scales used , and most importantly that the film is shown at a disadvantage because amateur CCD scanners are used , not PMT drum scanners .
Even with the cheap ( $ 2,000 ) scanners film is clearly better when blown up enough to see , unlike in the example in the last paragraph .
My crummy medium - resolution 1,800 DPI scan of the 4x5 film gives me over 8,500 x 6,500 clean , complete RGB pixels .
Heck , even scanning a small 6x7 transparency at 4,800 DPI at home I get over 12,000 x 9,000 complete RGB pixels ( 108 MP in a 324 MB file ) .
Today 's digital cameras only produce images between 3,000 and 5,000 Bayer - interpolated pixels wide at best .
This difference should now be obvious , even to the blind .
And if mere numerical comparisons are not obvious enough to the Braille crowd , remember the under $ 10,000 digital cameras are only producing interpolated pixels at best , usually Bayer ( info here and for you Ph.D.s here and here ) , which means that each pixel is n't a full - resolution RGB pixel anyway , as they are in film scans .
Film is Future Proof
Scanners always get better .
Film shot today will be scanned better tomorrow .
I first wrote this page two years ago and made the scan in 2003 on a Microtek 1800f scanner , the best $ 1,500 scanner of 2003 .
In 2005 I got a $ 500 EPSON 4990 scanner and made a much better scan from the same piece of now two - year - old film .
Enlarged Crop from Film Image scanned in 2003
Enlarged Crop from Film Image rescanned in 2005 ( OK , I grabbed another shot made at the same time .
I gave up trying to find the same exact frame . )
Digital is always stuck in whatever quality you shot it .
Digital or video has nothing to rescan .
What you got it is all you 're every going to get .
This is why Hollywood shoots movies , and even the better TV series , on film .
10 or 50 years from now they can still get better and better images by rescanning them .
Go watch the latest DVD of The Wizard of Oz shot on film in 1939 .
They simply went to the vault and rescanned the film with modern technology .
DYNAMIC RANGE : Film has a huge advantage in recording highlights .
We take for granted the fact that specular highlights and bright sunsets look the way they do in painting and on film .
Digital has a huge problem with this ( see disadvantages under digital below . )
COLOR : Film records and reproduces a broader range of color .
This is important for wild landscapes , deep red cars and flowers .
It 's not at all important for photos of skin .
The deepest red one gets on a computer screen or inkjet print is really just a reddish - orange !
Computer greens are n't all that vivid either .
Your screen cannot make a deep red like the red you get on a red LED , as you see on the new traffic signals .
Your screen can make a dark red-orange , but it 's nothing like the red you get from Velvia on a light table or even a Kodachrome red .
Of course artists can make great looking images on computer screens .
You do n't appreciate what you are missing until you look at a Velvia transparency on a light table after staring at scans on a CRT for a while .
Likewise , Cibachrome and Fuji Supergloss prints made from transparencies can hit these deeper reds and greens that your inkjet printer or monitor can't .
Both the artists and engineers agree on this one .
Just look for yourself if you 're an artist , and look at where the primary colors plot on the CIE diagram if you 're an engineer .
In other words , what I see on computer screens ( and as you see on my site here ) may be seductive , but is nothing compared to a transparency on a light table or projected .
LONG EXPOSURES : Film works great for long exposures running into the minutes .
You may have some color shift or loss of speed due to reciprocity issues , and otherwise the image quality is the same as for normal short exposures .
DOUBLE EXPOSURES : No problem .
Almost no digital camera can do this .
PERMANENCE : Film does not erase itself .
Film does not become unreadable for no reason .
It does n't have file compatibility problems .
Traditional black and white film and prints will outlast any of us .
COST :
FILM : A processed 120 format frame of film costs less than a buck and has more resolution and dynamic range and color gamut than any digital system available to anyone .
Even military satellite reconnaissance uses sensors with lower resolution .
Those satellites just make a lot of smaller images which are pasted together later .
CAMERAS AND LENSES :
These are effectively free .
I try to buy my film cameras and lenses used .
I often sell them for more than I paid for them years later .
Therefore film hardware is essentially free .
A good lens today is still a good lens in 20 years .
The most exotic film cameras cost the same or less than middle - of - the - road digital cameras which will need to be thrown away in two years , and the film cameras will still be making great images in ten years .
Likewise , a new $ 100 film camera can whup any digital camera for color and resolution .
CONVENIANCE :
LEGIBILITY
You always can see film by looking at it , even 100 years from today .
You can file and catalog everything quickly just by looking at it or contact sheets .
200 years from now anyone can look at a black - and - white print .
People may or may not have the ability to play back JPG files , and probably no ability to play back any of today 's proprietary RAW digital formats in 20 years .
WORKFLOW SPEED
Because of its direct legibility you can lay out a few hundred transparencies on a light table and edit them all immediately .
With digital you need special software and it's much more cumbersome to manage a few hundred images at the same time .
There are no 5 foot wide computer monitors with enough resolution to do this .
We make do with what we have and it 's slower in digital .
IMMEDIACY
We take it for granted , but when you turn on a camera or push the shutter it just works as it should with no waiting around .
SLIDE SHOWS
These are easy and excellent .
Shoot slide film and any $ 100 projector gives better results than the $ 200,000 digital cinema projectors I 've been around , unless of course you have an 80 ' screen .
DIGITAL : back to top
IMAGE QUALITY :
Digital SLR cameras like the Nikon D70 have no grain .
I get cleaner results at ASA 200 on my D70 than I get with scanned ASA 50 Velvia film .
I can shoot at ASA 1,600 and still have very little grain ; far less than any ASA 1,600 film .
The colors are the same with a digital camera as you change the speed ; not so with film .
Therefore , if I need speed I get better results shooting on digital then shooting film .
Digital has no " negative " stage .
Because of this , digital usually looks much better than most prints made from negatives .
This is because most negatives are usually is printed poorly by automated photo finishing equipment .
Digital gives me better and more consistent color than I get with regular print film .
I prefer digital quality to print film .
Long exposures are a problem .
The image sensors have leakage which add random white dots into your image with long exposures .
Some cameras try to compensate for this .
This is never an issue with film .
One cannot make double or multiple exposures with digital cameras except for maybe one model of Pentax .
WORKFLOW SPEED :
If you are publishing in print or Internet or email you already know how great it is to have your files ready to go right from the camera .
It 's wonderful not to have to process and then scan each of your film images .
With digital I post web galleries with hundreds of images the same morning I shoot them .
With film it takes me months to get around to scanning all the images the hard way .
With my digital camera I have shot a thousand images at a wedding and handed the groom a CD with all the original images on it before he left .
Simple !
I left it to him to print them as he sees fit .
Of course consumer digital camera do n't work fast enough to get off that many images .
PERMANANCE :
With digital you can use standard computer methods to backup and store exact copies of your original images in multiple physical locations .
When on the road I mail CDs back to myself each day just in case my car is hit by an asteroid .
This way I have all the original images both in my laptop computer and in a second location , the mail .
Duplicates of film images on the other hand are worse than the originals .
You can send your digital images to your clients and never have to trust your original to leave your possession .
Of course since digital is only starting to become popular , ordinary people who do n't back up their computers will soon be discovering that they will lose years of work and family memories when their computer dies or if they forget to copy everything to a new computer .
FUN
Come on , there is nothing more fun than shooting away and seeing what you just shot , and then emailing it to everyone you know .
You can experiment and fool around and learn a ton , which then you can apply to your film shooting , too .
I sometimes fool around with my digicam and when I get a winner I then whip out the 4x5 " camera to make the same shot .
The digicam is not only a great composition tool , but also can preview exposure for your film camera .
PHYSICAL STORAGE SPACE :
Hard drives and CDs can store bazillions of images in far less space than binders and files full of film .
INDEXING
Since you 're already in the computer , file indexing and organization is easy .
Film needs to be tagged physically by hand .
Personally I love it that my digital camera tags every image with the date and time , as well as all the technical data .
SPEED
With film I 'm too shy to shoot 100 images of nothing just for the hell of it .
With digital it 's common for me to shoot 900 images in an hour - long hockey game just because I can .
FRUITFULNESS
If you get a DSLR you 'll make so many images that you 'll be constipated in your ability to sort through them as fast as you make them !
You 'll have to buy software to allow you to sort through what you have .
How else are you going to sort through 1,000 images ?
I use iView on my Mac. Windows people have to use BreezeBrowser .
The newspaper photographers use Photo Mechanic .
iView is a program that lets you sort through all your images , either as big thumbnails or full screen , really fast .
COST
Shoot as much as you like , it costs you nothing .
On the other hand the cameras cost four times as much as film cameras .
SLIDE SHOWS
If you want to see the images on your screen it 's trivial to show them , and with the internet you can show them to anyone anywhere anytime , as I do on my Gallery pages .
If you want to project them on a screen you 're in big trouble , see the section under disadvantages below .
DISADVANTAGES : back to top
FILM :
IMAGE QUALLITY
High speed ( ASA 1,600 ) film is poor .
Prints from color negatives usually have poor colors unless printed yourself .
PERMANENCE
Color film fades .
Digital files do n't .
STORAGE SPACE
I have shelves and shelves of images I 've made over the years .
Digital stored on CDs or hard drives can take much less space .
Every time a separate a special image for some purpose I usually forget to put it away , and because of this I can't find some of my favorite images .
I have to index every image by hand , and I hate that .
TRANSMISSION
You have to send the original image everywhere .
If you lose it , you 've lost it .
Backup copies are always a little worse than the original .
COST
you pay as you go .
DIGITAL : back to top
The question " have you gone digital yet ? " is a presumptuous fallacy is pushed by camera stores and camera makers , since they make big bucks when you buy a digital camera that you 'll want to replace in a few years .
" Going digital " is by no means inevitable or even desirable .
Digital does not replace your film camera for many kinds of fine art .
Even today your dad's 20 year old Canon AE - 1 can make technically better images than any digital camera .
The Canon AE - 1 is about the same as a 20 megapixel camera .
The AE - 1 Program is about the same as a 25 megapixel camera , presuming you are using Canon brand lenses .
Image Quality :
Highlight Rendition : Digital still has a huge problem with highlight reproduction , presuming you , like me , shoot into the sun or other sources of light .
Film for hundreds of years has naturally had " shoulders " in its characteristic curve .
This means that even with severe overexposure in places that the highlights are rendered naturally on film , even contrasty slide film like the Velvia I love .
On the other hand , at the dawn of the 21st century digital capture is more linear than logarithmic as film is .
This means that digital cameras often have better shadow detail than my Velvia , but can have horrid , unnatural highlights if overexposed even a third of a stop .
Specifically , digital clips hard as soon as you are a few stops over zone V .
This could be OK , however unfortunately in color one of the three color channels ( red , green or blue ) usually clips first , throwing the hue ( color ) into all sorts of weird shifts in the areas the image transitions from bright to pure white .
This is why digital camera images may show all sorts of nasty , unnatural hue ( color ) shifts in the brightest areas .
Unfortunately this highlight issue is a basic characteristic of CCD sensors , amplifiers and sampling and quantization electronics and wo n't be fixed soon .
To simulate film 's shoulder one needs to add several more stops of highlight capture in the digital camera so the image processing electronics can use this information to simulate a decent shoulder curve .
CCDs and the related capture electronics will need about ten times more dynamic range ( three stops ) than they have today to be able to simulate film 's shoulder .
Of course negative film has more range still , but that 's not really relevant to good photography since the dynamic range of negative film already exceeds what you ought to be photographing .
For instance , a negative can be way overexposed and still retain detail in otherwise blown out highlights , if you custom print and burn in those areas .
Heck , you can scan a negative from a $ 6 disposable camera and have more highlight dynamic range than any digital capture system .
The $ 100,000 three - CCD studio high - definition television cameras around which I work today still have problems with this , and so our cheap $ 5,000 single - striped CCD digital SLRs will , too .
Everyone is working on solving this .
This is the biggest image defect in digital cameras today .
BLACK -AND -WHITE back to top
This is simple : digital cameras usually only go to zone VII , after which they are completely devoid of texture and tone .
You have to shoot your zone tests and work accordingly .
If you are n't familiar with the zone system for B / W you need to be , since knowing it will simplify everything you do since for the first time you 'll really understand what 's going on .
You can learn a little here .
I suggest trying deliberate underexposure and pulling up the curve 's midpoint to create a shoulder above zone VII .
Digital does have more shadow detail than film .
What camera makers have done is traded off important highlight detail for lower noise so their cameras look better in lab test reports .
Today 's digicams have great shadow detail but clipped highlights .
As I said , you can fix that by underexposing a stop or two ( which looks awful in camera ) and then messing with the curves .
Depth of Field : Digital SLRs have about the same depth of field as 35 mm film cameras .
Compact digital cameras have almost infinite depth of field , meaning you can't deliberately blur backgrounds .
Why is this ?
Simple : the tiny image sensors of compact digital cameras ( meaning everyone selling for less than $ 2,000 ) use much shorter focal length lenses to get the same angle of view .
These shorter lenses have much greater depth of field .
Exposure : Digital has the advantage of immediate feedback , but also the disadvantage that exposure is more critical than film .
Even 1/3 of a stop makes a big difference on my D1H .
Underexposure is easy to correct in post , but overexposure renders an image useless .
1/3 of a stop on Velvia is subtle ; on a D1H it 's blatantly obvious .
Permanence : I have lost days of work when memory cards became unreadable .
In just the first month I had my D1H I lost hundreds of images .
In all my decades of shooting film I have only lost one half of one roll of film , and that was my fault for forgetting to check the rewind crank for proper film advance .
With the D1H I knew what I was doing , and one part of the system ( I think the Microtech CF card I was using ) destroyed hundreds of images which could not be replaced .
Sluggishness : Unless you drop four grand on a Nikon D1 series you are going to have to wait for the camera to turn on , and then wait when you press the shutter for the camera to get around to focusing and setting itself and eventually making a photo , and then wait around for it to finish writing the file to your storage medium until you can take the next photo .
Because of this most digital cameras cannot be used efficiently for photos of people or anything that moves .
Worse , if you have a digital viewfinder then the image in that viewfinder is also delayed for a fraction of a second , ensuring you 'll always miss the right moment for a powerful image .
If you splurge for a D1 then by all means you are in the drivers ' seat ( it 's faster than any film camera I own ) , but today 's 2003 cameras priced below $ 2,000 still have a long way to go .
This means that in 2007 you 'll think back to any consumer digicam you 've used today and laugh about how anyone could have put up with such sluggish foolishness .
Cost .
Digital cameras are very , very expensive for what they do .
They become obsolete in a year , unlike film cameras which , in the case of 4x5 , even 50 year old cameras and lenses are in use daily .
DO NOT buy a digital camera as an " investment . "
I bought my $ 4,000 D1H knowing it is a disposable camera , which just like a $ 4,000 computer will be worth nothing in a few years .
You pay this for the work you can beat out of it today and next month , not because you 'll have any use for it in a year or two .
Digital cameras pay for themselves if you use them a lot as I do , they are far more expensive than any film camera if you only shoot a few hundred shots every month .
Go spend $ 1,500 on a film camera and you have a fine machine you 'll be using to create great images 20 years from now .
Spend that same $ 1,500 on a digital camera and you will have given it to The Salvation Army or Goodwill in three years .
( Hint : check out their thrift stores as I do for buys on cameras .
You may find my D1 H there in 2005 since I donate to these great people . )
Think of that D100 you want as a $ 1,700 batch of Polaroid film .
It 's a lot of fun , but not usually as good as real film .
If you do n't use it all up in a year or two you have to throw it away .
Likewise , I know you want a digital SLR , but it 's a DISPOSABLE camera .
Get one as I did if you will use it a lot in the next couple of years and have money to burn .
Do n't expect me to bless it as some sort of an investment : it 's not : it 's an expenditure just like a car .
Slide Shows :
These , along with big paper prints , are poor for digital .
You have two options : 1. ) the obvious , a digital projector , and the less obvious , 2 . ) just having regular slides made from your digital files .
Unfortunately digital projectors are still poor for still images , and writing files to slides still costs $ 4 to $ 5 a slide .
Here are the details :
DIGITAL PROJECTORS : Unfortunately digital projector technology as of 2003 is still too crude for serious still photographic images .
I have worked with $ 200,000 digital cinema projectors and these give swell color and dynamics , but unfortunately do n't have enough resolution for still images .
The top digital cinema projectors today are still limited to 1,280 x 960 resolution which is great for moving images , but still too low for a good still image .
Your eye sees far more detail when the subject is not moving .
As of November 2003 TI is introducing the M25 - based digital cinema 2,048 x 1,024 which sells for around $ 100,000 .
Likewise , the $ 2,000 projectors used by businessmen for presentations look great for graphics , but unfortunately are also limited to the same resolution and , unlike the digital cinema projectors , have awful color .
The business projectors you are likely to borrow from your office or buy today at best have a mercury or metal halide or HMI lamp , which are seriously deficient in red .
This gives them a brilliant bluish white color that makes them look extra bright and impressive for boring bar charts of sales figures , but make your reds look dull and dark .
If you borrow one of these I 'd try putting a pinkish gel over the lens to try to add back in some of the deficiency in red .
If you 're a real hacker you could try to profile it .
Of course the older dim LCD projectors are all obsolete today and the DLP ones are the way to go .
Watch out : I know these look great for business presentations because I use them for this all the time .
When I realized before doing a business talk that I could fire up Photoshop and see my work on the big screen I realized what is only obvious after you try it : there are not enough pixels for real pictures .
You can see the individual pixels on many of these which looks fine for graphics , but looks hideous for real pictures .
The problem with the under $ 100,000 projectors is the light source .
If you can find a projector with a commercial motion picture xenon arc or halogen light source you 'll be OK for color except that you 'll still too low for resolution .
Avoid the vast majority of projectors with HMI lights , which are all the ones I 've seen for business use .
I 'm warning you : I 've had access to some pretty exotic projectors as part of my real job in Hollywood and they look bad for still photos , even if movies and business charts look spectacular .
MAKING SLIDES FROM DIGITAL FILES :
This is easy .
I use my local lab , Chrome , or you can use Slides.com .
In either case , you have to pay several dollars a slide .
Projecting this slide will look better than using one of the projectors above , unfortunately you may have to shell out $ 400 for a tray of 80 slides .
Cost is the only real disadvantage , and its a big one .
You also realize that you need a lot more pixels than you thought to render a slide as sharp as a camera original piece of film .
I 've written files 2,000 x 3,000 pixels out to film and they are only as sharp as a dupe slide .
They look OK , but if you look close you 'll realize why I offer that one needs more like 4,000 x 6,000 pixels , or 24 Megapixel files , to look like film .
You only get this resolution by scanning film , bringing us back to where we started .
Thus , if you want a slide show , just shoot slide film !
RECOMMENDATIONS back to top
As you see , film and digital all excel and stink at different aspects of the same things !
Digital has already replaced film in sports and news coverage for a couple of years .
I love the way people 's skin looks on my D1H .
For any sort of action I shoot Nikon D1H digital .
Since the only legitimate professional application of 35 mm film has been for news , action and sports , 35 mm film for professional use is becoming obsolete as more and more people and organizations move to the Nikon D1 series digital cameras .
For instance , the big newspaper here in San Diego got rid of their darkrooms in 1999 .
Even printing presses have forgone plates and now many take just digital inputs .
Film is just a pain to have to use for publication .
The only high - end pro use of 35 mm today is for sports on posters and magazines , since larger format cameras are not fast enough .
Film will remain king for landscapes and anything that holds still and requires big prints .
I even prefer its color rendition for Internet use .
It 's also the king for anything you intend to want to print years from now .
In 5 years anything shot on today 's digital cameras will look awful compared to what was shot on film today , by the standards of the future .
Remember , digital already has replaced 35 mm film , but the economies of the market and scale will not have it approach larger film format quality any decade soon , since the demand is not there to justify development at any price you 'll want to afford .
My real job is in Hollywood .
The reason most of what you see on TV is shot at huge expense on 35 mm movie film and then transferred to video ( also at great expense ) instead of being shot digitally ( video ) in the first place is for two simple reasons :
1. ) The future .
Years from now we 'll use the latest telecine machines ( scanners ) to get even better results from the film we shot today .
On the other hand , years from now we may not even be able to play back the tapes if we shot on video .
Ever seen " Gone with the Wind " on video ?
It looks pretty good for something shot in 1934 on film .
Ever seen " Welcome Back Kotter ? "
It looks awful since it was shot on video in 1974 and is stuck in that quality level forever .
2. ) Quality .
Film just looks better than things shot on video , mostly because we have enormous control in telecine ( film - to - video transfer ) after the fact .
If we got everything technically perfect in the original shoot there 's not that much difference in the final video .
However in real life it 's not that simple .
We can take whatever part of the huge dynamic range film has and use it in telecine in post production .
On video you either got it right when you shot it , or you missed it .
There is much more room for correcting screw - ups and fine - tuning in post production with film than video , and we are always fine - tuning in post .
Video only has dynamic range suitable for release , it does not have any extra headroom or footroom to allow decent tweaking in post production .
Remember too that in Hollywood we roll up three trucks of lighting and generators and make whatever light we need , so we can get around the highlight issues that I can't in my available light shooting .
Even with this we still prefer film because it 's still easier to light .

A friend of mine ( and recently - initiated student , go her ! ) requested that I post this story which was originally written for my personal journal , which is not public .
I agree with her - - a story this good deserves to be retold .
And so , submitted for your perusal , " My Last Two Dollars and My Last Good Nerve . "
August 30 , 2005
I nearly punched someone today .
The scene is Book People , a Monday evening .
The cafe area .
Having spent the day feeling like ass and laying around watching TV bundled up in various wubbies on the futon , I decided to make a pilgrimage to the library , then on the way back to Mecca itself , my all - time favorite bookstore and Austin landmark .
I can't count the hours I 've spent at Book People curled up on a couch or in the cafe sipping chai and collecting recipes , or paging through the latest metaphysical tripe .
It 's a comforting ritual and a way that my last couple of bucks could support local business .
So I score a table against the wall , put down my stack of cookbooks and various other and my purse , grab my wallet , and head for the counter .
( My purse is in plain sight , do n't worry ; I wanted it to mark my table . )
Today 's coffee jockey is an adorable pierced - and - tattooed boy en flambe , as most BP baristas tend to be .
There 's one woman in line in front of me , waffling between a decaf skim milk latte and some other thing .
Now , this woman ... oy .
There are thin women , and then there are Skinny Bitches , and my radar went screaming off on the latter immediately .
She 's standing there in her overpriced workout clothes - - you know , the kind nobody wears to actually work out in , they just wear around town to make it look like they 're oh - so - health - conscious .
She has one of those stupid little pink leather purses that should have a dog in it , and an armload of magazines about pilates and yoga ; her hair is that expensive streaky blonde that 's all the rage in people trying to look young and hip .
She 's making fake small talk with the adorable pierced - and - tattooed boy en flambe , and taking forever to decide what she wants , talking herself into and out of a piece of cake about five times .
I 'm barely paying attention , as I am scanning the menu myself ( you know , making up my mind BEFORE I get there ? ) , but she has one of those nasal voices that worms its way into your brain and makes your spine hurt , so before long I 'm listening to her ; I think she was trying to be flirty .
Anyone with half an IQ would have known her charm was absolutely wasted on our friendly neighborhood cafe lad .
The woman is now weighing the pros and cons of having skim milk versus two percent milk in her latte , and she says , " God , I do n't know , I just feel so , like , fat today .
I feel like such a big fat cow . "
Then she turns to me , and she says , GET THIS , " How do you stand it every day ? "
I blink .
The adorable pierced - and - tattooed boy en flambe blinks .
Several heads in the cafe pop up because nobody can believe this woman actually said this to a total stranger .
I feel as if the sitcom camera is pulling in tight for a closeup on my reaction .
But the gods of snark are smiling upon me today .
I reply , straightfaced , " You know , it 's normally not too bad , but today I 'm having one of those days where I feel like a shallow dumb bitch .
How do you stand it every day ? "
Just then the barista , who is holding back laughter so hard he 's beet red , hands her her skim milk yuppie whatever and says , " Here you go , ma'am . "
She too is kind of pink , but she does n't say a damn word , or leave a tip - - she storms off , her cell phone already to her ear , because clearly she 's the wronged party here .
The pierced - and - tattooed boy en flambe busts out laughing , and I notice a few of the popping - up - heads are laughing too .
I 'm both shell - shocked and proud of myself , because usually when I 'm insulted I 'm not quick on the draw enough for the witty retort .
" Oh my God , I can not believe she fucking said that to you , " he says , shaking his head .
I can't , either , but at the same time I can .
It 's not the first time people have made comments like that to me .
They only do it when you 're alone , because if you 're with friends you 're upholding the Fat Girl Contract -- you 're playing the part of asexual sidekick to whoever is the pretty girl .
But if you 're by yourself , and gods forbid having a good time or -- gasp !-- eating something besides a salad with the dressing on the side , you 're fair game .
If you walk up to a black man and call him that dreaded " n word " or tell him he should be tap dancing and eating fried chicken , you 'll be thought of as a bigot , but if you insult someone 's appearance to their faces in public or tell a fat woman she should be on Atkins , it 's considered " helpful advice . "
You do n't know this woman , why she 's fat , or anything about her life , but it 's okay to be cruel , because obviously she 's lazy and self - indulgent and you , as a skinny evangelist , have the right to say whatever you want if you think it 's for her own good .
People do n't believe this kind of shit happens , but it happens every day .
I order a cherry Italian soda .
The adorable pierced - and - tattooed boy en flambe waves my money away .
" On the house , " he says .
" The comeback was worth two - fifty at least . "
I slip the two dollars in the tip jar and go back to my table , shaking my head , still too amazed at the whole thing to really process it .
A few minutes later I hear a quiet laugh , and I look up to see the adorable pierced - and - tattooed boy en flambe holding a milk jug and grinning a little sheepishly .
He sees me looking and holds up the jug .
" I think I gave her whole milk by accident , " he says , and winks .
" Oops . "
The route to running in November 's US presidential election is via a series of elections known as primaries and caucuses .
This is the process by which supporters of the Democratic or Republican parties , in each US state , say which candidate they would like to see representing their party in the presidential poll .
How does it work ?
KEY GUIDES
Quick guide : US election Primary and caucus dates A caucus guide
What is a primary ?
Each state gets to send a certain number of delegates to the parties ' national conventions in the late summer , where each party 's nominee is formally chosen - and the primaries and caucuses determine which candidate those delegates vote for .
Broadly speaking , the more voters from a given state give their backing to candidate X , the more delegates pledged to support candidate X will be sent from that state to the national convention .
Why did Iowa and New Hampshire come first ?
No particular reason , it just happened that way .
This year Iowa held its caucuses on 3 January and New Hampshire held the first primary on 8 January .
It 's sometimes argued that they do n't deserve it , because they are not representative of the US as a whole - they are small ( especially New Hampshire ) , they do n't have big cities , and their populations are not very diverse .
The counter - argument is that both states have politically - educated voters who put would - be candidates through a lot of tough questioning .
What was Super Tuesday ?
A day ( a Tuesday ! ) when a lot of states hold primaries or caucuses simultaneously .
The practice began in the 1980s .
In 2000 , 16 states held primaries on 7 March , at which about 60 % of all delegates were up for grabs .
In 2004 , Super Tuesday split in two .
There was a Mini- Tuesday ( or Super Tuesday I ) on 3 February , followed by a Super Tuesday II on 2 March .
California , Ohio and New York all held their votes on Super Tuesday II .
On 5 February 2008 , 24 states took part in " Super - Duper Tuesday " , including California , New York , Illinois and New Jersey .
Caucus or primary - what 's the difference ?
Caucus procedures vary according to state law .
In most states , such as Iowa , voters meet in private homes , schools and other public buildings to discuss the candidates and the issues .
They then elect delegates to the county conventions .
County convention delegates elect delegates in turn to state conventions , where delegates to the national conventions are chosen .
At Democratic caucuses , the voters sometimes publicly divide into groups , gathering in different corners of a room to show their support for the different candidates , and delegates are allocated accordingly .
Republican caucuses usually take the form of a secret ballot , the results of which inform the allocation of delegates .
In primary elections , all registered voters in a state directly vote for their preferred candidate .
Are the caucuses and primaries held at the same time every election year ?
No .
This year everything happened earlier .
From 1972 to 1992 the exercise began in late January ( or occasionally early February ) and the nominations were not usually settled until the first Tuesday in June , when California , New Jersey and Ohio held their primaries .
This year they began on 3 January , and the Republican nomination was effectively settled on 5 February , the earliest ever Super Tuesday ( though John McCain only became certain of victory on 4 March ) .
The Democrat battle looks set to continue until June , and with early start the contest will have lasted longer than ever - more than five months .
Is a long nomination contest a bad thing ?
To spend several months criss - crossing the country meeting voters is a good test of a candidate 's strengths and weaknesses , and it gives Americans lots of opportunities to decide which politician they like best .
Also , a little - known candidate who does well in the early caucuses or primaries has a chance to attract financial support , and organise a strong campaign .
The shorter the primary campaign , the less time there is for an outsider to gather momentum .
However , a long primary season can mean the eventual nominee has less time to prepare for the general election battle against the other party 's candidate - and that their own party is more divided .
Why did the primary calendar change ?
Some states felt the established system gave too much prominence to the states which began the selection process , and too little to those at the end of the process , so in the 1990s a trend began for states to move their primaries and caucuses forward .
This just increased the disadvantage of coming last and gave states more of an incentive to rush to the front of the queue .
States such as Iowa and New Hampshire , which have traditionally come first , responded by moving their own events earlier still .
Did the Democratic and Republican parties attempt to stop states changing the electoral calendar ?
Yes .
The Democratic Party punished Michigan and Florida by refusing to accept their delegates at the national convention .
The Republican Party penalised Florida , Michigan , New Hampshire , South Carolina and Wyoming , by reducing their quota of delegates by half .
Do these penalties matter ?
They could , in theory , if it 's a close race .
The Democrats have closed the door to about 8 % of delegates , the Republicans to about 5 % .
It 's possible the decisions to impose the penalties could be reversed before the convention .
However , proposals by Democrats in Florida and Michigan to stage their contests again have foundered .

GCC unplugged
LWN .net needs you !

Many programs - free and proprietary - offer a plug - in interface to make it easy to add new functionality .
In many situations , the existence of a well - defined plugin interface has been a key driver for the success of the system as a whole ; imagine Firefox , for example , without its extension mechanism .
The GNU compiler collection ( GCC ) is an example of a complex system which could benefit from such an interface , but which currently lacks one .
GCC developers have been talking about adding a plugin API , but it is far from clear that this will be done ; how this decision goes may have major consequences for how GCC works with its wider development community and the free software community as a whole .
GCC is designed as an extended pipeline of cooperating modules .
Language - specific front - end code parses code in a specific source language and turns it into a generic , high - level , internal representation .
Various optimization passes then operate on that representation at various levels .
At the back end , an architecture - specific module turns the optimized internal code into something which will run on the target processor .
It 's a long chain of modules ; at each point in the chain , there is an opportunity to see the code in a different stage of analysis and processing .
There can be a lot of value in hooking into an arbitrary point in that chain .
Static analysis tools need to look at a program at different levels to get a sense for what is going on and look for problems or opportunities for improvement .
New types of optimization passes could be added at specific points , making the compiler perform better .
Project - specific modules could look for problems ( violations of locking rules , perhaps ) tied to a given code base .
Language - specific modules can provide tighter checking for certain constructs .
And so on .
Currently , adding this sort of extension to GCC is not a task for the faint of heart .
The GCC build system is known to be challenging , and GCC 's internal documentation is , one might say , not quite as complete as one might like .
Researcher Alexander Lamaison described it this way :
Out of the 6 months , 4 were spent learning the GCC internals and fighting the GCC build process , 1 was spent writing up leaving 1 month of actual productive research ...
I fully understand that this can seems strange to people who know GCC like the back of their hand , but to a newcomer it is a huge task just to write a single useful line of code .
I 'm sure many give up before ever reaching that point .
Once they have overcome these problems , developers adding extensions to GCC run into another problem : if they want to distribute their work , they end up in the business of shipping a whole new compiler .
Brendon Costa , who works on the EDoc++ GCC extension , noted :
I approached the debian maintainers list with a debian package for this project to see if they would include it in the official repositories .
It was not accepted and the reason for that is because it includes another patched version of GCC which takes up too much disk space .
They do n't want to accept these sorts of projects because they all effectively require duplicates of the same code ( GCC )
Both of these problems could be addressed by adding a plugin mechanism to GCC .
A well - defined API would make it relatively easy for developers to hook a new tool into the compiler without having to understand its internals or fight with the build process .
If an off - the - shelf GCC could accept plugins , distributors could ship those plugins without having to include multiple copies of the compiler .
Given that we would all benefit from a more capable GCC , and given the many examples of how other systems have benefited from a plugin architecture , one would think that the addition of plugins to GCC would not be a controversial thing .
It seems that one would be wrong , however .
In a recent discussion on plugins , two concerns were raised :
Adding plugins to GCC would make it easy for people to create and distribute proprietary enhancements .
A plugin API would have to be maintained in a stable manner , possibly impeding further GCC development .
There were also some suggestions that , if the effort put into a plugin API were , instead , put into documentation of GCC internals , the overall benefit would be much higher .
The proprietary extensions concern is clearly the big stumbling block , though .
Some participants stated that Richard Stallman has blocked any sort of GCC plugin mechanism for just this reason - though it should be noted that Mr. Stallman has not contributed directly to this discussion .
But , given that GCC remains a GNU project , it is not hard to imagine anything which could lead to proprietary versions of GCC would encounter a high level of opposition .
The attentive reader may have spied some similarities between this discussion and the interminable debate over kernel modules .
The kernel 's plugin mechanism has certainly enabled the creation of proprietary extensions .
In the GCC case , it has been suggested that any plugins would have to be derived products and , thus , covered by the GPL .
This , too , is an argument which has been heard in the kernel context .
In that case , concerns over the copyright status of proprietary modules have kept them out of most distributions and , in general , cast a cloud over those modules .
Something similar would probably happen to proprietary GCC modules : they would not be widely distributed , would be the subject of constant criticism , and would be an impetus for others to replace them with free versions .
It is hard to imagine that there would be a thriving market for proprietary GCC extensions , just like there is no real market for proprietary GIMP extensions - even though Photoshop has created just that kind of market .
It has also been pointed out that the status quo has not prevented the creation of proprietary GCC variants .
As an example , consider GCCfss - GCC for Solaris systems .
This compiler is a sort of Frankenstein - like grafting of the GCC front end onto Sun 's proprietary SPARC code generator .
Back when Coverity 's static analysis tools were known as the " Stanford checker , " they , too , were a proprietary tool built on top of GCC ( the current version does not use GCC , though ) .
People wanting to do proprietary work with GCC have been finding ways to do so even without a plugin mechanism .
The GCC developers could also look to the kernel for an approach to the API stability issue and simply declare that the plugin API can change .
That would make life harder for plugin developers and distributors , but it would make it even harder for any proprietary plugin vendors .
An unstable API would not take away the value of the plugin architecture in general , but it would avoid putting extra demands onto the core GCC developers .
In general , GCC is at a sort of crossroads .
There are a number of competing compiler projects which are beginning to make some progress ; they are a long way from rivaling GCC , but betting against the ability of a free software project to make rapid progress is almost never a good idea .
There is a pressing need for better analysis tools - it is hard to see how we will make the next jump in code quality without them .
Developers would like to work on other enhancements , such as advanced optimization techniques , but are finding that work hard to do .
If GCC is unable to respond to these pressures , things could go badly for the project as a whole ; GCC developer Ian Lance Taylor fears the worst in this regard :
I have a different fear : that gcc will become increasing irrelevant , as more and more new programmers learn to work on alternative free compilers instead .
That is neutral with regard to freedom , but it will tend to lose the many years of experience which have been put into gcc .
In my view , if we can't even get ourselves together to permit something as simple as plugins with an unstable API , then we deserve to lose .
Back at the beginning of the GNU project , Richard Stallman understood that a solid compiler would be an important building block for his free system .
In those days , even the creation of a C compiler looked like an overly ambitious project for volunteer developers , but he made GCC one of his first projects anyway ( once the all - important extensible editor had been released ) .
His vision and determination , combined with a large ( for the times ) testing community with a high tolerance for pain , got the job done .
When Sun decided that a C compiler was no longer something which would be bundled with a SunOS system , GCC was there to fill in the gap .
When Linus created his new kernel , GCC was there to compile it .
It is hard to imagine how the free software explosion in the early 1990's could have happened without the GCC platform ( and associated tool chain ) to build our code with .
The vision and determination that brought us GCC has always been associated with a certain conservatism which has held that project back , though .
In the late 1990's , frustration with the management of GCC led to the creation of the egcs compiler ; that fork proved to be so successful that it eventually replaced the " official " version of GCC .
If enough developers once again reach a critical level of frustration , they may decide to fork the project anew , but , this time , there are other free compiler projects around as well .
Perhaps , as some have suggested , better documentation is all that is really required .
But , somehow , the GCC developers will want to ensure that all the energy which is going into improving GCC does n't wander elsewhere .
GCC needs that energy if it is to remain one of the cornerstones of our free system .
Google âs court filing gives few new details of its legal thinking , which relies heavily on the so - called â safe harbor â provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , enacted in 1998 .
Those provisions generally hold that Web sites â owners are not liable for copyright material uploaded by others to their site as long as they promptly remove the material when asked to do so by the copyright owner .
The 1998 law â balances the rights of copyright holders and the need to protect the Internet as an important new form of communication , â Google said in its filing .
â By seeking to make carriers and hosting providers liable for Internet communications , Viacom âs complaint threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information , news , entertainment , and political and artistic expression . â
Viacom said Google âs response misses the mark .
â This response ignores the most important fact of the suit , which is that YouTube does not qualify for safe harbor protection under the D.M.C.A. , â Viacom said .
â It is obvious that YouTube has knowledge of infringing material on their site , and they are profiting from it . â
Mr. Kwun , the Google lawyer , said there had been no talks between Google and Viacom to discuss a settlement .
â We feel pretty confident about the case and are ready to take it to court , â he added .
In the suit , Viacom had complained that it was unfairly forced to devote significant resources to police YouTube .
â Every day we have to scour the entirety of what is available on YouTube , so we have to look for our stuff , â Philippe P. Dauman , Viacom âs chief executive , said in an interview earlier this year .
â In The Mythical Man-Month , Frederick Brooks proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers does not grow linearly with its size .
As the size of the group increases , the productivity of individual programmers goes down .
The experience of Lisp programming suggests a more cheerful way to phrase this law : as the size of the group decreases , the productivity of individual programmers goes up .
A small group wins , relatively speaking , simply because it âs smaller . â
( On Lisp , p 5 . )
â Sophisticated users now demand so much from software that we canât possibly anticipate all their needs .
They themselves canât anticipate all their needs .
But if we ca nât give them software which does everything they want right out of the box , we can give them software which is extensible .
We transform our software from a mere program into a programming language , and advanced users can build upon it the extra features that they need . â
( On Lisp , p 5 . )
â So yes , reading a bottom - up program requires one to understand all the new operators defined by the author .
But this will nearly always be less work than having to understand all the code that would have been required without them . â
( On Lisp , p 59 . )
I imagine that most people picking up On Lisp these days are mainly interested in two things : how do you use macros and what can lisp do that other languages ca nât do ?
But after an inspiring introduction that deftly weaves in themes that are regularly discussed and debated even fifteen years after the book âs publication , the reader is faced with several dry chapters that focus on functions and utilities .
To someone with little experience with functional programming , basic computer science , or extensive lisp coding , much of it will seem pointlessly tedious and pedantic .
I was just such a person last May just before starting this blog .
I really wanted to skip ahead to the good stuff and savor Graham âs prose , but I was like Luke Skywalker cutting out on his training to go fight Darth Vader .
( I was just about to get my face smashed by gigantic futuristic heavy things as I tried to wrap my mind around a lot of mind - blowing material .
Or something like that . )
I strained myself through several chapters of On Lisp even though I understood little of it and finally exhausted myself .
And yet , I have code that I wrote about that time that violates the spirit of everything Graham was trying to say !
I was completely lost .
There âs really only a few core ideas that you need to know about , though .
You need to know what functions can do inside and out before you can understand when to use macros .
You need to know about recursion , iteration , accumulators , and mapping .
You need to be able to reflexively see the skeleton of a function , know how to abstract it out , and know how create customizable functions that take functions for arguments .
And you need to have coded enough of this stuff in Lisp such that you âve done certain things over and over and over again .
If you get to chapter 4 and do nât immediately think , â man , these utility functions are all stuff I wish was already built into the language ! â then you probably have nât done enough Lisp coding to appreciate the book .
SICP covers all of these things and more .
If you can work through the first two chapters of SICP , then you âll be more than prepared for On Lisp .
Reading On Lisp now after working through parts of SICP and doing a few small practice projects , I can finally understand what it âs saying .
It âs really satisfying to finally â get â what Paul says about closures .
Here âs a brief summary of the points about closures he covers :
* Closures emerge from lexical scoping .
( Lexical scoping forces the system to save copies of variables when functions are defined and then associate those copies with the functions . )
* Example 1 : Create a function that uses a lambda function that references one of the original arguments .
( Make an implicit â function factory â . )
* Example 2 : Define two functions that share the same counter variable .
( Eliminate the need for messy global variables . )
* Example 3 : Create a function that returns a customized function based on the arguments .
( Make an explicit â function factory â . )
* Example 4 : Alter example three so that the customized functions can change their state after they âve been created .
( Use optional arguments on a closure to allow the users to change it âs behavior laterâ sort of like properties on an object . )
* Example 5 : Create a function that returns a group of closures that all use the same data objects .
* Example 6 ( Chapter 5 ) : Create a function that takes a function as its argument and returns a function for its value .
( In the examples , we get one for Complement and another for Composition .
These functions are mainly used to simplify and refactor the core Common Lisp library .
SICP âs coverage of Newton âs Method is much more exciting and as a bonus , it will help you understand the famous fast inverse sqrt routine . )
* Example 7 ( Chapter 6 ) : Elegance and speed with closures : Instead of defining a data structure and then defining a set of functions to access it , you can define a â smart â data structure by using closures that keep their own state and reference other closures .
The line between code and data can be further blurred here by writing routines to compile your closure - based data structures .
â In Lisp we can sometimes use closures as a representation .
Within a closure , variable bindings can store information , and can also play the role that pointers play in constructing complex data structures .
By making a group of closures which share bindings , or can refer to one another , we can create hybrid objects which combine the advantages of data structures and programs . â
( On Lisp , p 76 . )
Looking at these examples together , it becomes clear that a typical OOP style emphasizes a top - down approach , while closures encourage a more finely grained bottom - up style .
Keep in mind that the examples of closures here are not the final iterations that Graham wants you to take away from the book .
In later sections he will improve the code using macros to increase the efficiency and generality of the samples .

It seems to me that everywhere I else I turn to for information on the status of American electoral procedures and processes , with the exception of Black Box Voting , I get a smokescreen of illogical rhetoric trying desperately to divert everyone from getting to the logical and honest truth : what is really on the ballots , if the ballots even exist ?
( I am referring to DRE's , etc with that last , where there is no physical ballot to check )
Brad has it absolutely correct - and seems to be one of the few Americans left capable of using simple logic instead of emotional angry / whiny bullshit .
You keep right on going , Mr. Friedman , these others are spewing a smokescreen .

" While professional pollsters are suprised [ sic ] that the results were so different than predicted , they are quietly going about the business of determining where they went wrong .
They are taking a scientific approach to the problem - something that Friedman has rejected in favor of hysteria and paranoia , " Moran continues , before taking another swipe at me as an " intrepid lefty dolt . "
Yeah , right .
Pollsters are trying to figure out what went wrong scientifically - well , the reality is , if you do this scientifically , you go back and analyze the data you used and the DATA OF THE RESULTS .
No scientific approach would exclude the potential that the producer of the results - voting machines - would be excluded from inquiry .
That means that you hand count the ballots too because you have to take out the variable that maybe the machines miscounted .
Nothing the pollsters do means a bucket of warm spit if the scientific process is not completely carried out .
You have to inspect the potential , affecting variable of every part of the process .
Those alluding to a scientific process by the pollsters are hung by their own canard .

Another great job , Brad .
Keep up the great work !
You will probably enjoy what I found out Friday afternoon .
South Carolina Elections Are UNCONSTITUTIONAL !?!
South Carolina elections are unconstitutional ?
How could that be ?
Surely , no one in our government would conduct any election which violated the Constitution , and if any scheme threatened to undermine the very foundation of our government , our power to elect our leaders , the press would expose it , would nât it ?
See why those who walk the halls of power in South Carolina have been sweating all weekend .
Read the article at http://www.opednews.com/...south_carolina_elect.htm
Spread the word like Paul Revere !
It âs time to demand an end to the unconstitutional practice of counting our votes in secret !
It âs time to restore our ability to control our government by returning to hand counted paper ballots which are counted in public at each precinct on election night !
It âs time to throw everyone out of office who fails to abide by the Constitution !
Anyone who says they want to keep counting the votes in secret on a computer is either a fool or a flack for those who want unlimited power .
Of course , they would be fools , too .

I am ordinarily a loud opponent of statistical analysis because way too many IMPORTANT specifics are missed with it , but , with big enough samples , this is one area where it can really do its job ; to wit : give us a nearly accurate idea of where people stand on the candidates and issues .
When the polls by seasoned professionals are this far off the result , any objective observer would be suspicious of the vote count before they would suspect poll error .
And anyone worthy of becoming president would demand the NH ballots be actually counted by humans .
Period .
And that goes double for the winner .
That is NOT stating there was fraud , and not even saying there was a mistake .
That is just stating that the numbers were off so far that it is utterly irresponsible ( and unAmerican ) not to go back and insure that we get it right .
It is outright unbelievable to me that there are intelligent people out there making such a hairy deal against this , and yet it 's right here on the internet , big as heck .
I 'm not kidding : this stuff makes me feel as though someone slipped LSD into my coffee .

If Tuesday 's results really were the likely result of malfeasance , the Obama and Edwards campaigns would be raising holy hell .
They would be seeking a recount , and investigation of the voting , and they would be doing it because they saw the irregularities in the vote results .
Of course they would , Mr. Kerry .

" While professional pollsters are suprised [ sic ] that the results were so different than predicted , they are quietly going about the business of determining where they went wrong .
( bd : HOW ?
Are they hand - recounting ? )
They are taking a scientific approach to the problem ( bd : WHAT is that scientific approach ? ) - something that Friedman has rejected in favor of hysteria and paranoia ( bd : Where is there ' hysteria and paranoia ' ? ) , " Moran continues , before taking another swipe at me as an " intrepid lefty dolt .

The " straw man " argument : " Make up " that there 's " hysteria and paranoia " , then assign it as an attribute of your opponent .

Markos is kind of a strange bird .
I thought he was real smart , until I met him .
We were at a Udall event in San Francisco , and I proposed to him that CA Sec. of State Debra Bowden should run against Nancy " impeachment off the table " Pelosi .
He thought that was a bad idea on two counts .
First of all , why should Bowden scuttle such a promising political career ( ironically , her claim to fame is de-certifying touch - screen balloting for the entire state of California ) , by running against Pelosi .
That made a kind of sense .
But what made a lot LESS sense was Markos ' other reason : Namely , that we should not try to impeach George Bush .
We should , instead , let him bring down the entire Republican Party with him .
This kind of thinking reminded me of Delay and his " permanent Republican majority " nonsense .
It was pure stupidity to give the president such sweeping powers , given that these powers would descend to the next Democratic president .
To think that there would never be another Democratic president to take advantage of those powers was , well , beyond optimistic .
But it seems equally stupid to think that Bush would completely destroy the Republican Party .
Utter nonsense .
The electorate have short memories , and the Republican media is the master of spin .
I tried to ascribe these opinions to the youth and inexperience of Markos - - as a voter .
But the ban on any discussion of these voting catastrophies tells me that Markos is afraid of having his site being branded left wing looney if he allows discussion of so - called " conspiracy theories . "
I would remind Markos of what he writes on a weekly basis -- that the right is going to brand us thus no matter what we write , and we should not give a shit what they think .
Somehow , when it comes to the core principle of our democracy , Markos lacks the required nerve .
Funny , that .

99 is right : " When the polls by seasoned professionals are this far off the result , any objective observer would be suspicious of the vote count before they would suspect poll error . "
We saw what happens when there 's obviously questionable results before actually proving it , and sitting around saying nothing :
The politicians who did n't win take office , a few years later it 's proven they did n't win the election , and a few lower - level operatives get thrown in jail ( maybe ) .
In the meantime , our country is ruined !

NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL RECOUNT From Huffington Post :
The recounts will begin on January 16 , at a time and location to be announced after the state has completed an estimate of the cost and received payment based on that estimate .
The questions revolve around the AccuVote optical scanning system , used by 111 of New Hampshire 's municipalities .
The scanner , made by Premier Election Systems ( formerly Diebold ) was one of the machines analyzed by the Ohio Secretary of State 's office in a recent review of the voting systems used in that state .
The reviewers , a mix of academics and corporate computer security experts , described how the AccuVote works :

Analogy : A group of scientists conduct a study and research on a new metal made of several different kinds of ore .
They have good information on results of the performance of that new metal because they have exhaustively studied similar mixtures .
They then produce the product but it does not meet expectations .
They go over their research again and scratch their heads .
Nope , should have worked .
Studies have been correct in the past and current studies do n't differ too much from previous ones .
Variable : the manufacturing process .
( Not an intentional pun ) Conclusuion : Audit the process and find out if the problem is there .
Ooops , there was a mistake entered in the computations , a glitch in the robotics , slightly wrong ratio entered - it was the process that botched the results .
How the heck can a study be scientific if the process is not studied ( audited ) too ?

The MSM wo n't touch the story of election fraud and vote rigging because they would have to do some investigative reporting , and it 's expensive and messy to do real investigative reporting .
It 's much simpler , and way easier on their bottom lines ( the main goal of the MSM industry ) , to forgo the investigative part of journalism and instead , pose an unsubstantiated counterpoint to the argument that our elections are fraudulent .
They get more viewers this way , too , because , as everyone here at Brad 's blog has discovered , it takes some time and some reading up on the subject to get a complete understanding of what has happened in the past and where we are today .
Kos is a humongous and messy site .
I think it 's great for people who are beginning to question the status quo , to get their feet wet for the first time in the national political dialogue .
But at some point , those people will recognize that Kos feeds itself too much from the same riled - up , inarticulate , ready - to - fight mindset that FOX does .

In every single discussion I have listened to on NPR re the NH primary , every single commenter refers to the polling / results discrepancy as a case of the polling being wrong .
( Insert loud scream , with the sound of a keyboard being slammed against a wall . )
Are we THAT unable to critically think ?!
THAT is a conclusion , not an observation of fact .
The fact is that there is a discrepancy between the polling and the results .
Period .
Everything else is a conclusion , which you can't simply state as fact w/o backing it up with additional factual information .

Elections need to be transparent and verifiable .
The only way to ensure that they are transparent and verifiable is to have transparent and verifiable counts and recounts and recounts - of - recounts if necessary .
Chain - of - custody must always be a key element since even a transparent recount is worthless if its possible that ballots were tampered with .

A concern on Kos by the supporters of the two anonymous bloggers mentioned by Brad is that it would be prohibitively expensive to do a hand count of all ballots cast of , let 's say , California for example .
By gosh !!
Can you imagine having to count 12 million ballots by hand ?
My response to that is : 1 . Canada , as far as I am aware , counts all their ballots by hand and they do n't seem to have a problem with it .
That said , I think there is an effort gaining steam to do what we do here because everyone likes an instant result whether it is a correct result or not .

Here is some hard evidence of questionable vote counts ... backward vote counts !
It does not matter that it is a reflection of a lesser known candidate , what else has gone wrong ?
Howard is the Republican candidate seeking a recount in NH with the help of Ron Paul supporters .
http://www.concordmonito...0112/FRONTPAGE/801120402
Primary votes to be recounted
Excerpt : Howard said he grew concerned watching the results roll in on C - SPAN on Tuesday .
With 12 percent of the precincts counted , Howard said , C - SPAN showed he had 150 votes , then 187 .
Suddenly , Howard said , his name disappeared and his vote total dipped down to 30 .
" I was actually ahead of Alan Keyes for a while , " Howard said .
" That 's what triggered some real emotion in me . "
According to unofficial tallies , Howard won 44 votes in the primary .
Keyes snagged 203 .
... Yeah , I would get emotional too if my votes totals started counting backwards !

I have followed Kos almost from his first postings and have seen a tightening of free speech towards a more centrist attitude .
I too read every salacious comment on the election ballot recount issue .
I was disappointed and have moved Kos further down my priority bookmarks .
The salient issue is , as Brad states , every vote needs to be counted , and tallied accurately .
On another related thought ... ex-Bush Press Secretary , Tony Snow , recently used the repug talking point of calling this issue " voter fraud " with Bill Mahr and guests letting him do it twice .
HELLO !
We are talking about the possibility of " Election Fraud " which has to do with the election officials , voting machine programers or machines counting the voter ballots .
This is real misdirection !
One item Brad should look into is posting a tip jar as I would tip him generously with kudos on this one .

Cheers to Brad .
Thanks for not letting attack dogs get you down .
Also , thanks for maintaining a positive , journalistic outlook on this , no matter what folks may say .
I too have been a frequent visitor at Kos and am more than a little discouraged at the dismissive nature of the recent diaries there .
To his credit , Kos does unconditionally support counting paper ballots .
While I am unsettled by their dismissive approach to recently voiced concerns about voting integrity , I also think there is a virtue in holding posts to a high standard and promoting unity - we all need to work together to get through this .
In truth , voting integrity should be a centerpiece of the Democratic platform .
Democrats should welcome all recounts with gratitude , regardless of the state , contest or outcome .
We should immediately begin fundraising for random recounts of large states at a moment 's notice to act as a deterrent to hacking and increasing the possibility of uncovering even stronger smoking guns .
And we should approach the issue with a sense of unity that will be welcome at the larger sites , galvanizing the vocal support of millions .
Kudos to Brad for doing his best for staying above the fray of infighting and divisiveness .
It must be tough , but it 's an honest path of integrity .
Thankfully , we 're not waiting until the general to revive this issue .

Fact - machines that count or collect votes have been shown to be absolutely hackable .
Fact - the employee in charge of the machines in New Hampshire is a convict .
Fact - that employee had access to the machines throughout the voting process .
Fact - people across the country have reported machines flipping their votes in past elections .
Fact - private companies owned by people who have made large political contributions control the voting machines before , during and after the election , and they count our votes in private .
Fact - an employee of a voting machine company testified to congress that he was asked to manipulate the machines so the votes could be controlled .
And so on , and so on , and so on â¦ .
Is this evidence extraordinary enough for the doubters ?
To my way of thinking , knowing all these things , what we need at this time is extraordinary evidence to support the extraordinary claim that our votes are safe .

In 2004 here in Washington State we had an election for Governor which made headlines everywhere for the extraordinarily close result .
The election was conducted with hand - marked paper ballots and opscan machines .
[ a few DREs ]
State - wide , Gregoire won by about 130 votes after a hand recount of more than 2.8 million ballots .
It was finally settled at the Appellate Court level after as bitter and well - funded battle by the Republican losers as you can imagine - even they could not stomach appealing the judge 's analysis of the count / process to the State Supreme Court ....

The problem is not simply that some electronic voting machines may be rigged .
The problem is that it is so easy in our time to determine the few machines in which precincts in which state (s ) need to be rigged to control an entire national election .
I 've been trying today to get NPR stations / shows to pay some attention to this problem , so far without much success .
Saturday I was appalled to hear jokes on " Wait , Wait , Do n't Tell Me " ( news quiz show on NPR ) about how the pollsters all got it wrong .
No questioning , no reasoning --- no thought at all , apparently .
Their expert guest was a pollster who made no attempt to say anything other than 'gee , we sure screwed that up , and do n't know how ! '
No explanation I 've seen accounts for the exit poll discrepancies , regardless of whether the predictive polls should be so strangely off ( only in machine - counted precincts ) .
Btw , I used to teach statistics and investigative methodologies at University , and my IQ is in the neighborhood of 170 .

Brad mentions DemFromCT on dKos .
I had a revealing exchange with this person .
( Note : I go by a different name over there . )
In a nutshell , I replied to someone else that appeared to be taking up Karl Rove 's wet dream that we should do away with exit polling because they just " are n't accurate " anymore .
I made the comment that exit poll inaccuracy seems to coincide with the privatization of the ballot box .
DemFromCT jumps in and tries to cut me down with a quote from Mark Blumenthal about the 2004 exit polls .
DemFromCT must have missed the fact that the paragraph he chose included a final sentence that agreed with my premise , " The problem with this reasoning is that exit polls similarly " wrong " before , though perhaps not to the same degree or consistency . "
In reply , I chose not to provide him with numerous links that support the use and accuracy of exit polls ( if done correctly ) , but rather came back at him with a quote from the same Mark Blumenthal who stated clearly , " I have always been a fan of exit polls .
Despite the occasional controversies , exit polls remain among the most sophisticated and reliable political surveys available . "
But DemFromCT responded with the rock solid one - line argument , " you reveal your misunderstanding of the basics . "
My point of view was crushed .
How can you not agree with such deep understanding of the issues ?

Brad , I want to offer my unconditional support for the work you do .
The matter of the NH primary defies consensus for its results .
Matters of elections must have consensus as to the results or we must rely on assumptions as to the results , and that 's not democracy .
I have read diligently every post to your site since the election and from the start your conclusion has been that it 's reasonable to hand count the ballots when the results are unexpected .
There is a feeling among many Americans that there have been too many elections where the results have been unexpected .
Confidence in elections must be restored and stolen elections revealed .
What I 'm sorry to see is that you are losing sight of the goal of confidence in free and fair elections and have been pulled into discourse with those who disagree with you .
Tell those who disagree to stick it in their ear and go on with your work .
I enjoy dkos and admire some of their work but they have not been granted Papal Infallibility .
Do n't waste your energy on those who do n't have your vision .

I had forgotten about this video and it might help explain the reason Kucinich asked Iowa voters to support Obama ( in Iowa only ) if he did n't get enough votes .
It 's Hillary and Edwards caught discussing ( whispering ) eliminating some of the candidates from debates .
I do like Edwards but find this disturbing .

DHinMI is a dick .
I 've noticed that in pro-impeachment diaries , his mission in life is to pepper each one ( even the not - so - good ones that just scroll by without getting on the rec list ) with 50 comments about how stupid and futile it is , how it 's never going to happen , where the fuck will 17 Repub votes come from in the Senate , etc , etc .
The dude 's entitled to his opinion , of course , but he does it with an incredibly obnoxious attitude that makes me want to kick him in the balls .
And he goes way over the top with putting down the persuit of impeachment .
OK , I get it .
He 's against it .
But the degree to which he WORKS at putting it down is rediculous .
There are many activists working on many causes , many of which have low - probability goals , and I do n't see him writing 50 comments in scroll - by diaries for those other causes .

A simple hack .
NH designs a ballot with 20 + names on it .
Each name has a circle next to it .
To vote , you must fill in the dot next to your candidate .
A new program has to be written and loaded on every Diebold machine in the state to correctly read this new ballot .
The scanner reads your ballot and records what number is filled in .
Your candidate gets credit for the vote .
Let 's say some friend of mine , say Larry H. Scammer , made a mistake when he wrote the program for the scanner to read this ballot .
Say he mixed up who was on line # 8 with line # 14 .
Who would know ?
Candidate # 8 would get all of # 14 's votes and vice versa .
Oops .
The total vote count would still be correct .
All that would be left is the crying .

Another question about recount fees : are the Republicans seperate from Democrats ?
e.g. if Albert Howard / Ron Paul / Granny Warriors pay $ 56,000 but Kucinich does not , does that mean only the Republican race will be recounted ?
Do we need to raise $ 111,000 to pay for both a Democratic and Republican recount ?
I do n't see much at the Kucinich website to indicate his people are on top of these breaking developments .

Final Exit Polls : Adjusted to Match the Recorded Vote
TruthIsAll http://www.geocities.com...nalExitPollToTheVote.htm
The controversy surrounding the New Hampshire Primary proves once again that the vast majority of Americans are uninformed regarding the exit polls .
Final state and national exit poll results presented on corporate media web sites , the television networks , NYT and Washington Post are not the actual raw , unadjusted ( â pristine â ) results .
The distinction between unadjusted and adjusted exit poll data is the cause of much confusion and misinformation .
CNN has reported the Final New Hampshire Exit Poll results .
Now that a recount is going to take place , thanks to Dennis Kucinich , the media should also be reporting the earlier â pristine â , unadjusted Exit Poll results .
The Finals â contaminate â the raw polling data as they are â adjusted â to force a match to the recorded vote totals .
If the vote count is fraudulent , simple logic dictates that the Final Exit Poll does not provide the True Vote , but rather a corrupt one .
The demographics would also be wrong .
It âs standard operating procedure for exit pollsters to force the final state and national exit polls to match the recorded vote - even if it means using impossible weights and implausible vote shares .
The procedure assumes a fraud - free election â not exactly a reality - based assumption .
Media pundits and politicians always claim that pre-election and / or early exit polls are wrong if they do nât match the recorded vote .
Few dare mention the possibility of Election Fraud as the cause of the discrepancies .
In 2004 , the pundits never considered that the recorded votes may have been miscounted and the preliminary exit polls essentially correct .
They just accepted that the count was accurate .
In so doing , they promoted the myth that the election was fraud - free .
They also believed that the final exit poll results were confirmed by the vote count .
They dismissed the accuracy of the early exit polls , claiming they were not designed to predict the True Vote , only to provide a demographic snapshot of the electorate .
But if that âs the case , and the recorded vote count is corrupted , then so are the demographics .
They never did the analysis which would have proved that the adjusted Final NEP weights were impossible and that the adjusted vote shares were implausible .
If they had , they would have come to the same conclusion as the spreadsheet - wielding bloggers - that the election was most - likely stolen ( view the spreadsheet analysis below ) .
There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the 2004 and 2006 elections were fraudulent .
Since the final state and national exit polls were forced to match the official results , a serious analyst needs to focus on changes in vote shares and weights from the unadjusted , â pristine â exit polls to the adjusted , â contaminated â final .
In 2004 , John Kerry held a steady 51 - 48 % lead throughout the National Exit Poll timeline : at 4 pm ( 8349 respondents ) ; 7:30 pm ( 11027 ) ; 12:22 am ( 13047 ) - after the polls closed .
But of course Bush won the Final NEP by 51 - 48 % ( 13660 respondents ) .
The Final was posted the day after the election and was forced to match the Recorded Vote count by using impossible weights and implausible vote shares .
The 12:22 am NEP â Voted 2000 â category indicated that Bush 2000 voters comprised 41 % of the 2004 electorate ; Gore voters 39 % - and Kerry was a 51 - 48 % winner .
But in the Final NEP , the weights were adjusted to 43 % and 37 % , respectively â and Bush won by 51 - 48 % .
The 4 % increase in the spread between Gore and Bush voters was a major component of the reversal .
In the 2006 midterms , the 7 pm NEP â Voted 2004 â Bush / Kerry weights were changed from 47/45 to 49/43 in the Final .
Once again , just like in 2004 , the exit pollsters had to match the vote count by increasing the spread by 4 % !
This had a major effect in reducing the Democratic margin- from 55 - 43 % at 7 pm to 52 - 46 % in the Final .
The Democratic Tsunami gained 31 congressional seats .
But they actually did much better than that .
A regression trend analysis of 120 pre-election Generic polls ( all won by the Democrats ) projected they would win by 56 - 42 % and gain over 40 seats .
The 7 pm National Exit Poll confirmed the pre-election trend .
But the next day , the Final NEP was once again forced to match a corrupted vote count with implausible weights and vote shares .
The Democratic margin was cut in half .
The fraud resulted in the loss of 10 - 20 seats .
The State Exit Poll Aggregate Timeline Edison - Mitofsky provided four aggregate state exit poll measures .
Kerry won the first three ; Bush won the Final :
1 ) WPE 51.8 - 47.2 % ( unadjusted )
2 ) GEO 51.0 - 48.5 % ( adjusted to incoming recorded votes )
3 ) Composite 50.3-49.1 % ( 12:22 am - adjusted to pre-election polls )
4 ) Final 48.5 - 51.1 % ( matched to recorded vote ) WPE is the only unadjusted ( â pristine â ) method .
It is based on the average discrepancy between the exit poll result and recorded vote for all precincts polled in the state .
Measures ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are adjusted estimates which incorporate pre-election polls and recorded votes .
The final state exit polls were forced to match the recorded votes , therefore implying ZERO election fraud .
Why should we believe them ?
And why bother doing exit polls at all if they will just assume that the recorded vote count was the True Vote ?

Brad focuses on an axiomatic moment :

Right ?
You'd be an irresponsible fool to do otherwise .

Here Brad becomes very opinionated , but his opinion is the exact same as mine .
The first thing I do is count the money !
I have decades of experience as a high paid software developer ( a.k.a. programmer ) .
And I do n't " have faith in " the machines or in the software .
In America we keep religion and the state seperate , and so I habitually check up on the machine .
But we need to face the fact of Amurka vs. America .
The basic reason is the same as the astronaut that was asked " What do you think about as you sit strapped into your seat as the countdown goes 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... " , to which he replied , " I think about this machine having been built by the low bidder out to make a profit " .
The election machine business world has been in various troubles from day one , and they have taken every shortcut " profit enchancer " known .
And the results are obvious to those who know night from day .
The MSM of Amurka frankly does not know night from day .
The first thing they do when they get cash from an ATM is not count the money .
Indeed , they are very , very FAITHFUL Amurkans in their ideology but they think feel that they are Americans in their ideology .

Anyone who reads a little history knows this : where there 's power , there 's conspiracy .
I 'm thinking of Richard the Third sticking the princes in the tower , then ( probably ) murdering them and stealing the throne , Mary Stewart 's conspiracy , while incarcerated , to take the crown of England from Elizabeth , Perkin Warbeck 's conspiracy with European heads of state to take the English throne from Henry vii .
Maybe Musharaff had Benazir Bhutto killed , she seemed to think he was good for it .
Bradbloggers could add a slew of others .
History is made of 'em .
So why is it that so many folks here in the US think conspiracy does n't happen in this country ?
A country with so much power ?
For people not to question voting machines known to be hackable , created and serviced by supporters of a president who has taken power twice because they were , is really , well , madness !
And / or it 's a really great defense mechanism , a life - raft to keep the fiction afloat that everything 's really alright , order prevails and there are no sharks in that dark water underneath .
I 'd like to know the genesis of the crazy idea blinding this country , that conspiracy does n't happen here .
Because that idea really has been of great benefit to people in control who want to keep a lid on us .
It 's the perfect cover and the ultimate urban legend , one that may have helped screw us out of our democracy , and seems to work every time .
What a useful tool for those who intend to conspire us into fascism .
Brad has said over and over , that he has no idea whether the vote was hacked , but he knows his facts and the facts say you can't trust private , partisan , machine owning companies , or vote tallies that emerge from the secret guts of these machines and reverse all the polling figures .
His request is simple : if anomalies appear , recount the vote by hand to make sure it is correct .
Because there is a lot of evidence from previous elections that it might not be .

The fuzzy future of high - definition DVD came into sharper focus Friday after Warner Bros . said it would release movies for the home video market exclusively on the Blu-ray disc format .
The decision , announced on the eve of the influential Consumer Electronics Show , delivers a de facto knockout punch to the rival HD DVD format backed by Toshiba Corp .
and others now supported by only two of Hollywood âs six major movie studios .
It also averts a further costly format war that has been stymieing the growth of the next generation of DVD with promises of enhanced video images and digital audio to match the popularity of flat , big - screen television sets .
For the first time , sales of movies on regular DVDs declined last year , jeopardizing a longtime and important source of profits for Hollywood .
The studios hope the new , higher - quality format will spur consumers to restock their DVD shelves .
In addition to Warner Bros. , studios supporting the Blu-ray format include News Corp .'s 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney Co. , Sony Pictures and Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer .
Taken together , they represent about 70 % of the home video market .
HD DVD is supported by General Electric âs NBC Universal , Viacom Inc. 's Paramount Pictures and the independent studio DreamWorks Animation .
â Expect HD DVD to die a quick death , â said Richard Greenfield , an analyst with Pali Research in New York , in a research note Friday .
Late Friday , the HD DVD group canceled a news conference scheduled for Sunday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
â We are currently discussing the potential impact of this announcement with the other HD DVD partner companies and evaluating next steps .
We believe the consumer continues to benefit from HD DVD âs commitment to quality and affordability , â the group said in a statement .
The larger question , however , is how long even the winning high - definition DVD format may survive .
Some analysts say the battle between Blu-ray and HD DVD may become irrelevant as high - speed Internet and on - demand video become the pipelines of movies into the home .
â I think the fat lady just sang , â said Rob Enderle , principal analyst with Enderle Group in San Jose .
â This gives Blu - ray a decisive lead .
The question now is whether it is too little too late . â
Enderle said consumers might have moved on to digital downloads to get movies rather than wait to buy them on next - generation DVDs .
The next big chance to sell high - definition movie players wo nât be until next Christmas , he said .
â By then , it may all be moot . â
Warner Bros. had remained neutral as the rival technology camps spent millions to win over consumers .
Each group engaged in aggressive price cutting and promotions this holiday season in an attempt to persuade consumers to take the high - definition DVD plunge .
But sales of these next - generation discs fell short of expectations , given the huge summer box office from popcorn movies , said Kevin Tsujihara , president of Warner Bros .
Home Entertainment Group .
Nor , he added , did the high - definition DVD players keep pace with the sale of high - definition TVs .
â There âs a window of opportunity here , â Tsujihara said .
â There are a number of high - definition television sets being purchased .
The best time to sell one of these high - definition DVD players is when the consumer walks out the door with that television set .
That window was beginning to close on us . â
Warner Bros. even sought its own solution to the format war at the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show , proposing a high - definition disc that combined the Blu-ray and HD DVD formats .
But Warner was the only studio to embrace the dual format , so it never reached stores .
Sony Corp .'s
Blu-ray discs have had a 2 - 1 sales edge since the beginning of 2007 , thanks to its exclusive studio deals and the sale of Sony PlayStation 3 game consoles that play films in that high - definition format .
That prompted the HD DVD camp to flash its cash to remain viable .
It paid $ 150 million to Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation in August to secure exclusively the rights to such major movies as â Transformers â and â Shrek the Third â on HD DVD .
Paramount had previously released movies in both high - definition formats .
â HD DVD had a lot of momentum in 2007 when they had their own defection of Paramount .
That was a very big move , â said J.P. Gownder , an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge , Mass .
â Now , the balance of power shifts back to Blu-ray . â
The Paramount deal reportedly sparked a furious courtship of Warner , which was the last of the major studios to support both high - definition DVD formats .
Warner will begin releasing movies exclusively on Blu-ray in June .
Barry Meyer , chairman and chief executive of Warner Bros. , flatly denied that the studio was offered a big check to choose the Blu-ray format .
â This was not a bidding contest between the two formats .
This is a huge business for us , â Meyer said .
â We âre the market leader globally .
We âre not going to make a strategic decision based on any kind of short - term financial gain . â
Nonetheless , studios such as Warner are facing pressure to grow the nascent high - definition video business at a time when consumer spending on DVDs is declining .
And it âs clear that the format war -- though benefiting consumers by driving down the price of high - definition DVD players -- has been confusing them too and keeping them from replacing their DVD players and their movie collection .
â Unfortunately , the loser here with the format war has been the consumer , â Gownder said .
â We found that 28 % of people said the fact that there was a format war meant they were nât going to buy a high - definition DVD player .
They were nât going to try to figure it out . â

WASHINGTON â Senator Barack Obama won his 11th straight nominating contest on Thursday , carrying the Democrats Abroad global primary by a 2 - to - 1 margin over Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and prevailing among American expatriates in every region of the world .
The results represented thousands of ballots submitted from Americans in 164 countries and territories from Feb. 5 to 12 .
The overseas Democrats were allocating a small number of delegates âÂ­ 4.5 â on Thursday , under a proportional system that allotted 2.5 to Obama and 2 to Clinton .
A further 2.5 will be determined at a Democrats Abroad convention on April 12 in Vancouver , Canada .
The group also holds 4 superdelegate votes , for a total of 11 votes at the national convention in late August in Denver .
But in a close contest , Democrats Abroad said they felt particularly engaged .
Democrats Abroad for the first time allowed votes to be cast online , though others were cast by mail , fax or in person , and they came in â from Antarctica to Zambia Â­â from A to Z , â said Christine Schon Marques , the group âs international chair , in a phone interview from Geneva .
â Many people overseas are very concerned about the war in Iraq ; they âre looking for change . â
One of the Antarctica voters was Adam Lutchansky , a 26 - year - old Alaska native who just finished a six - month stint working in the power plant at McMurdo Station and voted via the Internet .
â We only get mail service six months out of the year and it takes about a month for a letter to make a round trip to the U.S. , â he said by e-mail message , â but even here in Antarctica we have a dependable Internet connection .
It was great to finally see a political body get onboard with the security and flexibility of the Internet . â
By way of comparison , Mr. Obama âs global 66 - to - 33 percent lead over Mrs. Clinton was nearly identical to the edge he recorded in states like Minnesota , or his home state of Illinois .
Mr. Obama won by strong majorities in every region and nearly every country .
The senator , who was born in Hawaii , did particularly well in the Asia - Pacific region , winning 79 percent of the vote in Japan and 76 percent in Indonesia , where he lived as a youth .
He also did well in Europe , carrying more than 70 percent of the vote in France and Switzerland .
Mrs. Clinton won in Israel , the Dominican Republic and the Philippines .
Her best regional showing was in the Americas , with 44 percent of the vote .
Republicans do not hold a global primary .
They cast votes directly in their home districts , as overseas Democrats also have the option of doing .

So what would it be good for ?
API implmentations , quick minimal applications , and web development that does not want or need things that are included in Rails , like ActiveRecord .
Control panel mini-applications , or perhaps widgets .
With the success of Ruby on Rails , is there a place left for other Web frameworks written in Ruby ?
Everyone knows Rails , some might even have heard of Merb and Camping , but has anyone heard of Nitro , Ramaze , Sinatra , IOWA or Cerise ?
InfoQ quickly tours these frameworks and how they are appreciated ( or ignored ) by the blogosphere .
We previously talked about Merb which is maybe the most accomplished Rails alternative .
It is a fairly active project and is used in several production environments .
It is the Ruby Web framework which has the most similarities with Rails .
Camping defines itself as .
The project is 22 months old , and maintained by whytheluckystiff .
A whole web application can be defined in a single file while still following the MVC pattern ( making it easier to migrate to Rails later ) .
Camping uses ActiveRecord as the ORM ; the templating system used is Markaby keeps enhancing Camping on a regular basis .
Nitro is a 3 years old " Web 2.0 " framework .
After a period of inactivity , George K. Moschovitis seems to be active again .
Nitro apps are written in Ruby for server side and Javascript for client side .
Urubatan made a recent review of it .
Contrary to Rails which favors coding by convention , Nitro is more flexible .
Nitro also makes it possible to write Model - View - Controller based apps and non-MVC php -style apps as well .
Nitro uses xhtml files with custom Ruby tags .
Nitro also uses its own persistence layer called Og ( ObjectGraph ) .
Og allows the serialization of arbitrary Ruby objects .
Once marked as Object ( or Array or Hash ) in the attr_accessor , the engine will serialize a YAML dump of the object .
Arbitrary object graphs are supported too .
Og provides automagic database evolution : when a Ruby class is changed , Og will automatically detect it and change and alter the database accordingly .
Some of you might miss all the features of ActiveRecord Migration .
Ramaze is a 6 month old light Ruby Web Framework .
It was built using well - known Ruby principles : Ramaze is an MVC web framework which uses its own templating system called Ezamar .
But you can also plug Markaby , HAML , Liquid or ERB over it .
Ramaze does n't come with a default ORM ( Object - Relational Mapper ) , you can use the one of your choice : ActiveRecord , Og ...
It supports advanced usages such as Cache , and webapps can be served through Mongrel or Evented Mongrel .
You 'll find more details about it on the Ramaze wiki Sinatra is a one month old DSL web development framework .
Ron Evans made a short review of it .
The major difference with Rails is that it is not a Model - View - Controller based framework .
Sinatra is made of a minimal DSL - syntax , its small base core does not contain such module as ActiveRecord .
Sinatra has dynamic route definition through the use of get / post action definitions .
As Ron states , Sinatra is not made for robust web applications , but rather small prototype where mixing business logic and presentation layer is not a problem .
Of the other frameworks , IOWA has not been active for 3 years and Cerise has not been active for 1 year so we wo n't go into those .
Apart from Nitro which , like Rails , has its own complete core , the other web frameworks try to be as small as possible , making the user free to plug in their favorite ORM , Templating System , etc .
Even if some of those frameworks might suffer from a lack of documentation or even it they do not have as many features , popularity , or users Rails , they might still be worth having a look at .

Four arrested , 200,000 doses of LSD seized by DEA
Photo courtesy UK Drug Forum By Jason Bennert December 4 , 2007
The Drug Enforcement Administration yesterday announced the arrest in Santa Cruz of two Watsonville residents and two Hawaii residents and the seizure of $ 2 million worth of the psychedelic drug LSD .
According to the DEA , in November Hawaii resident David Behar , 33 , agreed to sell 5 grams of LSD to undercover agents .
On Thursday , he and Hawaii resident Lindsay Hogue , 30 , were arrested with the LSD that Behar had obtained after traveling to a residence on the 800 block of Smith Road in Watsonville .
At the time of the arrest , Hogue had $ 5,500 in cash in her purse .
Watsonville residents Tara Bergstrand , 25 , and John Lagace , 35 , were arrested after agents observed them leaving the Smith Road residence .
The agents allegedly found $ 2,200 in cash and pay / owe sheets with entries in the thousands of dollars in the couple 's possession .
A subsequent search of the Smith Road residence turned up 15 grams of LSD , 5 pounds of marijuana , $ 6,000 U.S. Currency , nine gold coins and three silver bars .
The 20 grams of LSD is enough to produce approximately 200,000 doses , according to a DEA statement .
" LSD is a drug we have not seen for a while in the Bay Area ; however , this sizeable seizure proves there still is a market for the substance , '' DEA Special Agent in Charge Javier F. Pena said in a statement .
" This alarming amount , for instance , could provide every citizen of Watsonville with four doses each . ''
Behar , Hogue , Bergstrand and Lagace are all currently in custody after being arraigned on Friday in U.S. District Court in San Jose , according to the DEA .

Not only are citizens ignorant about essential scientific , civic and cultural knowledge , she said , but they also do nât think it matters .
Image Susan Jacoby , author of Â The Age of American Unreason . Â Credit ...
Chester Higgins Jr./ The New York Times
She pointed to a 2006 National Geographic poll that found nearly half of 18 - to 24 - year - olds do nât think it is necessary or important to know where countries in the news are located .
So more than three years into the Iraq war , only 23 percent of those with some college could locate Iraq , Iran , Saudi Arabia and Israel on a map .
Ms. Jacoby , dressed in a bright red turtleneck with lipstick to match , was sitting , appropriately , in that temple of knowledge , the New York Public Library âs majestic Beaux Arts building on Fifth Avenue .
The author of seven other books , she was a fellow at the library when she first got the idea for this book back in 2001 , on 9/11 .
Walking home to her Upper East Side apartment , she said , overwhelmed and confused , she stopped at a bar .
As she sipped her bloody mary , she quietly listened to two men , neatly dressed in suits .
For a second she thought they were going to compare that day âs horrifying attack to the Japanese bombing in 1941 that blew America into World War II :
â This is just like Pearl Harbor , â one of the men said .
The other asked , â What is Pearl Harbor ? â
â That was when the Vietnamese dropped bombs in a harbor , and it started the Vietnam War , â the first man replied .
At that moment , Ms. Jacoby said , â I decided to write this book . â
Ms. Jacoby does nât expect to revolutionize the nation âs educational system or cause millions of Americans to switch off â American Idol â and pick up Schopenhauer .
But she would like to start a conversation about why the United States seems particularly vulnerable to such a virulent strain of anti-intellectualism .
After all , â the empire of infotainment does nât stop at the American border , â she said , yet students in many other countries consistently outperform American students in science , math and reading on comparative tests .
In part , she lays the blame on a failing educational system .
â Although people are going to school more and more years , there âs no evidence that they know more , â she said .

Maureen
Dowd makes me lose faith in journalism .
Apparently , I work in a field in which writing pseudo - intellectual gender - and machismo - based nonsense that is nât particularly funny , witty , or amusing , and which includes no actual reporting , does nât get you fired .
It gets you eight more years in the most hallowed space the industry offers .
Maureen Dowd helped sink Al Gore âs presidential chances in 1999 by writing crap like this :
Al Gore is so feminized and diversified and ecologically correct
that he âs practically lactating .
And how she âs writing crap like this :
The debate dominatrix knows how to rattle Obambi .
Mistress Hillary started disciplining her fellow senator last winter , after he began exploring a presidential bid .
When he winked at her , took her elbow and tried to say hello on the Senate floor , she did not melt , as many women do .
She brushed him off â¦
She has continued to flick the whip in debates .
She usually ignores Obama and John Edwards backstage , preferring to chat with the so - called second - tier candidates .
And she often looks so unapproachable while they âre setting up on stage that Obama seems hesitant to be the first to say hi .
I âm still going .
I ca nât help myself .
There âs so much here that makes me cringe .
Now Dowd introduces the â real man â character .
As Al Gore was busy lactating in the 2000 race , George W. Bush was the hot shot with two mini-kegs swinging between his legs .
And guess who wins the Down body language tests that Obama fails ?
Other guys , like Rudy , would nât even be looking for a chance to greet Hillary , as Obama always does .
Other guys , like Rudy , would nât care if she iced them .
After selectively citing a bunch potshots that Rudy has taken at Hillary , which , in truth , mirror the ones that supposedly weak - kneed Obama and Edwards have taken , Dowd ends with this :
Hillary has her work cut out for her .
Rudy will not be so easy to spank .
And â¦ vom .
PS â I know this is nât the worst Maureen Dowd article of the last eight years .
Or even the last year .
Or month .
But it is part of one of the worst op - ed days in NYT history .
Tom Friedman is suggesting an Obama - Cheney ticket for chrissakes .
In a concrete pen , basking in the warm equatorial sunshine , dozens of baby giant tortoises are about to make history .
Later this year , these animals will be the stars in one of the boldest conservation initiatives ever attempted in the Galapagos , the best - preserved tropical archipelago left on earth .
Back in 1835 , Charles Darwin marvelled at these extraordinary islands isolated in the midst of the Pacific .
Today , as some 150,000 visitors experience a similar sense of wonder every year , the influence of Darwin is stronger than ever as conservationists tirelessly toil to maintain the subtle differences in the flora and fauna found on each of the islands in the archipelago .
Just as they were for Darwin , these differences are a compelling illustration of evolution in action .
They are what make the Galapagos special .
But now , after 50 years of enforcing strict segregation of the 11 or so recognised types of tortoise , keeping each contained on its own island or within its own volcano , conservationists are about to break with their purist past and take tortoises from one island , EspaÃ±ola , and release them on to another , Pinta .
This is the first time that conservationists in the Galapagos have attempted to replace one species with another , says Felipe Cruz of the Charles Darwin Research Station ( CDRS ) , the institution on the central island of Santa Cruz that brings scientific know - how to the conservation effort .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The reason for this introduction is simple .
Pinta 's tortoises are all but extinct .
The only known individual â a hapless male called Lonesome George â has been in captivity at the CDRS since his discovery on the island in 1972 .
George was probably only one of few tortoises that survived the devastation wrought in the 18th and 19th centuries , by pirates and whalers in search of a square meal .
Without its tortoises , Pinta has suffered .
In the 1950s , someone introduced a few goats to the island .
They bred like billy -o , and within decades there were thousands crammed on to a volcano seven miles long and four miles wide .
The Galapagos National Park Service ( GNPS ) responded with an armed assault .
In the 1970s , wardens shot more than 40,000 of Pinta 's goats , all descended from the few animals set down on the island little more than a decade earlier .
Still , it was not until 2004 that the GNPS finally claimed victory against these mammalian aliens .
Since the eradication of Pinta 's goats , the vegetation has bounced back .
But in the absence of its dominant herbivore â the giant tortoise â the island 's vegetation is at risk , says Ole Hamann , a botanist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , who has been studying Pinta 's plants since the early 1970s .
Some species are starting to crowd out others , he says : " Tortoises will open up the vegetation , making room for light - loving herbs and grasses . "
The decision to replace one species with another â what 's known as " taxon substitution " â is not without its risks .
Some conservation biologists argue it's impossible to anticipate the consequences of such an intervention .
" Many people like the idea of a pure Galapagos , the idea of finding a mate for Lonesome George and repopulating Pinta with pure - bred tortoises , " says Bryan Milstead , head of vertebrate research at the CDRS .
But right now there 's also a need to manage the ecosystem properly .
It 's a tortoise - dominated , tortoise - evolved landscape .
Pinta needs a dominant herbivore â now . "
Conservationists in the Galapagos should be comforted by the experience of their counterparts in the Mascarenes and Seychelles in the Indian Ocean , the only places outside the Galapagos with wild giant tortoises .
There , tortoises from the atoll of Aldabra have been used as replacements for extinct species .
Returning tortoises to islands that once had them is good for ecological balance , says Justin Gerlach , scientific co-ordinator of the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles .
" As long as the habitat is well on the way to recovery I would have thought the EspaÃ±ola tortoises will do well , " he says .
This places the Galapagos and the Seychelles at the cutting edge of conservation biology , says Josh Donlan , a conservation biologist at Cornell University : " This should be replicated on islands around the world where suitable taxon substitutions exist and invasive mammals have been removed . "
The individuals destined to fulfil this role are the offspring of a small group of EspaÃ±ola tortoises brought to the CDRS in the 1970s .
Since then , these animals â themselves the last of their kind â have produced more than 1,500 babies , which when old enough have been shipped to EspaÃ±ola .
With these offspring now grown up and breeding on their island , the GNPS can now send some of these captive - bred tortoises â which are Lonesome George 's closest cousins â to Pinta .
The GNPS aims to introduce dozens of young EspaÃ±ola tortoises to Pinta every year .
They will be around five years old , and the size of a dinner plate â but this is too small for them to carry a satellite transponder .
Most likely , however , they will be fitted with miniature solar - powered radio - transmitters .
This should allow scientists to track the movements of each one , says Milstead , giving a unique insight into how tortoises colonise a new island and their impact on the vegetation .
The release was pencilled in for the first half of this year .
But in January , park wardens on a routine visit to Pinta to check for goats made an unsettling discovery : the bloody massacre of dozens of sea lions .
In all , they found the remains of 53 animals , including 13 pups , almost all of them with cranial fractures consistent with death by clubbing .
The last few years have seen increasing political and social stability in the islands and this episode has raised concerns that there is still a disgruntled minority prepared to sabotage the efforts of conservationists .
The GNPS , however , is determined to push ahead with its plans to restore the ecological make - up of islands such as Pinta to something like their pre-human glory .
So if all goes to plan and the EspaÃ±ola tortoises are set free on Pinta later this year , will Lonesome George be amongst them ?
It 's unlikely .
Last year , geneticists produced the best news Lonesome George has received in more than 35 years in captivity : he may not be alone after all .
A blood sample collected from a tortoise on Isabela Island in 2000 shows clear signs of Pinta ancestry .
Unfortunately , the animal is also a male .
Nevertheless , the geneticists and GNPS staff are planning an expedition to Isabela to see if they can track him down .
There is always a chance he has sisters .
If a suitable mate can be found and Lonesome George decided to breed , the radio signals emitted from the EspaÃ±ola tortoises on Pinta could be used to round them up .
But time will not be on George 's side .
The EspaÃ±ola tortoises heading towards Pinta should reach maturity in around 2020 .
Once they start breeding , it will be hard to deny that the substitution of Lonely George and perilous taxon is final .

History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all other alternatives .
Israeli diplomat ( 1915 - 2002 )
Probably , no nation is rich enough to pay for both war and civilization .
We must make our choice ; we can not have both .
America will never be destroyed from the outside .
If we falter , and lose our freedoms , it will be because we destroyed ourselves .
I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends .
Military glory -- that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood -- that serpent 's eye , that charms to destroy ...
Force is all - conquering , but its victories are short - lived .
Allow the president to invade a neighboring nation , whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion , and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such a purpose â and you allow him to make war at pleasure .
We must recognize the chief characteristic of the modern era--a permanent state of what I call violent peace .
Make the lie big , make it simple , keep saying it , and eventually they will believe it .
In war , truth is the first casualty .
Any excuse will serve a tyrant .
One is left with the horrible feeling now that war settles nothing ; that to win a war is as disastrous as to lose one .
The great armies , accumulated to provide security and preserve the peace , carried the nations to war by their own weight .
No war is inevitable until it breaks out .
No matter what political reasons are given for war , the underlying reason is always economic .
Wars based on principle are far more destructive ... the attacker will not destroy that which he is after .
from the book " The Way of Zen " When a war breaks out , people say : " It 's too stupid , it ca n't last long . "
But though a war may be " too stupid , " that does n't prevent its lasting .
The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants .
The evil that is in the world almost always comes of ignorance , and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding .
It is the job of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners .
We used to wonder where war lived , what it was that made it so vile .
And now we realize that we know where it lives ... inside ourselves .
Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war .
Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth .
The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem .
It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one .
It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder . Â«

Future Rock Band Tracks Leaked ? ( Updated )

Pistorius had his legs amputated when he was a child
The IAAF , athletics ' governing body , ruled his prosthetic limbs give him an advantage over able - bodied opponents and contravene rules on technical aids .
A scientific study revealed that Pistorius , nicknamed " Blade Runner " , used 25 % less energy than able - bodied runners to run at the same speed .
The 21 - year - old South African said last week he would appeal against any ban .
" I feel that it is my responsibility , on behalf of other disabled athletes , to stand firm , " he said .
" I will appeal [ against ] this decision at the highest levels , while also continuing with my quest to race in the Paralympic Games and hopefully the Olympic Games . "
The onus is now on us to prove that he is not getting an advantage
Agent Peet van Zyl
His agent Peet van Zyl told BBC Sport that he and Pistorius would sit down with their legal team to decide how to take their case forward .
" We are obviously very disappointed , " Van Zyl said .
" We were really hoping that he would be allowed ( to compete ) .
" The natural feeling from our side is to appeal the verdict .
The onus is now on us to prove that he is not getting an advantage . "
It is likely that Pistorius will lodge an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) .
Pistorius , who holds the Paralympic world record of 46.34 seconds , spent two days in Cologne last November undergoing tests alongside five able - bodied athletes of similar ability .
Professor Peter Bruggemann 's research concluded an athlete using the " Cheetah prosthetic " could run at the same speed as able - bodied athletes but use less energy .
The tests also revealed that running with prosthetic blades led to less vertical motion combined with 30 % less mechanical work for lifting the body .
Based on this and other test results , it was decided the blades should be considered as technical aids in clear contravention of IAAF rules .
Last year , the IAAF banned the use of any device incorporating springs , wheels " or any other element that provides the user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device " .
The IAAF 's decision means that Pistorius will not be allowed to run in any competitions involving able - bodied athletes .
Last summer he finished second in a ' B ' race in 46.90 seconds at the Rome Golden League in July and , two days later , was disqualified for running out of his lane in Sheffield .
Pistorius was 11 months old when his legs were amputated below the knee but only began running competitively on the carbon fibre blades four years ago .
He had immediate success winning the 200m at the Athens Paralympic Games and bronze in the 100m .
The South African also holds Paralympic world records for the 200 m ( 21.58secs ) and 100 m ( 10.91secs ) .
He has come close to times set by able - bodied athletes but has yet to attain the Olympic qualifying time over 400m .
Pistorius 's Paralympic world record of 46.34 seconds is also some way off the best able - bodies athletes .
The fastest active athlete is American Jeremy Wariner , whose best time is 43.50secs , while fellow countryman Michael Johnson holds the world record at 43.18 .
At last year 's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards , Pistorius won the Helen Rollason Award , given annually to an athlete showing courage in the face of adversity .
After a year of wringing their hands over their choices in the presidential race - a pro-choice mayor with an authoritarian streak , a serial flip - flopper , and a senator who is a dedicated opponent of free speech - the Republicans finally have a new front - runner .
Mike Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses Thursday night with 34 percent ( with 95 percent of precincts reporting ) of the vote , handily defeating Mitt Romney , who came in second with 25 percent in spite of heavy stumping in the key Midwestern state .
Just what Republicans longing for a new Ronald Reagan needed : a religious - right candidate who is also a big - spending nanny statist .
Reporters have been quick to jump on Huckabee 's comments in a 1992 Associated Press questionnaire that seemed to confirm their suspicions about a Baptist minister for Arkansas .
Huckabee told the AP that " homosexuality is an aberrant , unnatural and sinful lifestyle , " and called for isolating people with AIDS .
That was a position , by the way , that the venerable Reagan had firmly rejected five years earlier .
In 1997 , then - Arkansas Gov. Huckabee pushed for a reaffirmation of the state 's sodomy law , and in 1998 he compared homosexuality to necrophilia .
Huckabee says his rise in the polls can only be attributed to God 's will .
He endorsed the Southern Baptist Convention 's declaration that " A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband . "
He says he entered politics to " take this nation back for Christ . "
But Huckabee does n't just want a government that will stamp out sin .
He wants a government that will worry about your body as much as your soul .
He says that " it is government 's responsibility to try to create a culture of health , " including pressuring employers to " encourage " healthier lifestyles among their employees .
He wants a federal ban on smoking in the workplace and other " public " places .
He 's even threatened to ban cigarettes altogether .
After losing 110 pounds , he 's particularly concerned about the problem of obesity .
He can't quite figure out how to make eating Twinkies illegal , but he can at least be a national scold .
As governor , he started screening all public school students for their " body mass index " and sending reports home to parents .
He 's proposed requiring restaurants to publish the caloric and fat content of their food .
Huckabee 's determination to turn his own self - improvement odyssey into a national crusade reminds me of a Jeff MacNelly cartoon of the Carter era , when evangelistic ex-smoker Joseph Califano , Carter 's secretary of health , education and welfare , launched a national anti-smoking campaign .
MacNelly depicted Califano in Puritan garb , with the caption " And now , to discuss his decision to give up sex and what it means for you ... "
In his 10 years in office in Arkansas , Huckabee also proved to be a big spender .
Cato 's biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America 's Governors gave him an " F " for his last term and a cumulative grade of " D . "
As the study noted , " Like many Republicans , his grades dropped the longer he stayed in office ...
Nine days after being re-elected in 2002 , he proposed a sales tax increase to cover a budget deficit caused partly by large spending increases that he proposed and approved , including an expansion in Medicare eligibility that Huckabee made a centerpiece of his 1997 agenda . "
He agreed to a 3 percent income tax " surcharge " and a 25 - cent cigarette tax increase .
In response to a court order to increase spending on education , Huckabee proposed another sales tax increase ....
Huckabee 's leadership has left taxpayers in Arkansas much worse off . "
And then there 's Huckabee 's defense of federal intrusion into local schools .
He called President Bush 's No Child Left Behind " the greatest education reform effort by the federal government in my lifetime . "
In a television ad , he declared that " The federal No Child Left Behind Act is often misunderstood and unfairly maligned as a total federal intrusion . "
" As long as the states are allowed to develop their own benchmark exams to determine the manner to create standards ... " said Huckabee , without any regard for NCLB 's actual consequences , " there 's a value of having a national effort to at least set high standards . "
So . . .
Republicans looking for a presidential candidate to inspire them are now faced with a tax - and - spend religious rightist who would have the federal government regulate everything from restaurant menus to local schools .
As Dorothy Parker would say , " What fresh hell is this ? "
The new flag ( top ) ditches the stars and script from Saddam 's version
The three stars that represented Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party will be removed , to address the concerns of Iraqi Kurds .
They have refused to fly the flag since the fall of Saddam Hussein , saying it is too closely associated with a regime that repressed and killed their people .
The flag was also changed in 2004 , when a line of script , allegedly in Saddam Hussein 's own handwriting , was changed to Kufic script .
But the latest change - passed by 110 votes to 50 - is only temporary , as a design for a new flag will be sought after one year .
Agreement over the flag is another sign that the Iraqi parliament is moving forward on difficult issues , says the BBC's Jonny Dymond in Baghdad .
A measure that should allow former Baath party members to rejoin the bureaucracy and military was passed 10 days ago .
However , big obstacles to unity remain .
The Iraqi parliament said on Tuesday that attempts to pass the 2008 budget had stalled , leading to fears that infrastructure projects would be delayed .
Changing times
The new flag retains the three colours of the old one - red , white and black .
A 2004 proposal was unpopular with Iraqis and subsequently dropped
The Arabic inscription " Allahu Akbar " ( " God is great " ) in green will be retained .
As with the 2004 -2008 version , it is written in Kufic script , making clear it is no longer in Saddam Hussein 's handwriting .
Kufic is an ancient form of Arabic script that originated in what is now Iraq .
" The new flag has no signs of Saddam 's regime and is a sign that change has been achieved in the country , " said Humam Hamoudi , a prominent Shia politician and member of the powerful Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council party .
In 2004 , Iraq 's then US - appointed governing council tried to introduce an entirely new blue - white - and - yellow , flag , but it was withdrawn after protests including the objection that it too closely resembled the flag of Israel .

In response to the fiasco that flared up around Gillian Gibbons Âshe âs the British schoolteacher jailed for allowing her class of Sudanese schoolchildren name a teddy bear â Muhammad â Âthe American evangelist Bill Keller produced the above video , in which a stuffed pig named Muhammed realizes the evil of his Allah - loving ways .
Crazy fundamentalists making fun of other crazy fundamentalists is my new favorite art form .
In more important news , that British schoolteacher is now safe at home in the UK .
Alan Shalleck knew a thing or two about storytelling : how to engage his audience and build suspense , how to bring a character to life .
He honed those skills in the pioneering days of children 's TV and directed the first animated shorts featuring Curious George .
That all took place when Shalleck , a family man with a wife and two sons , resided in New York .
In South Florida , though , Shalleck lived out the second act of his life : divorced , broke , and lonely .
He turned himself into a children 's book reader called " Gramps " who would show up at libraries , schools , and bookstores wearing a straw hat and spectacles .
The children would cluster around the sturdy gray - haired man , offering to turn the pages of his book and trying to climb into his lap .
But in South Florida , Shalleck also emerged with a more private and less conventional persona , as a devotee of spanking .
In early 2006 , the 76 - year - old ran a personal ad in the Fort Lauderdale gay magazine 411 that read :
TO SPANK OR BE SPANKED
To endure the outrageous pleasure / pain of a mighty
hand , paddle or cane OTK [ over the knee ] .
That is the quest .
Let's
go beyond and stretch limits to tears of joy .
Satisfied his prose would arouse the curious , Shalleck signed his middle name , Jay , and added his phone number .
And the curious called .
That 's why , as the Pittsburgh Steelers pounded the Seattle Seahawks on Super Bowl Sunday two years ago , Alan Shalleck 's alter ego was awaiting a flogging at his trailer home in Boynton Beach .
It would be , he hoped , a kinky test of endurance , one of many romps .
Shalleck was to be the master that night , with a younger man bent over his knee .
He 'd thwack and smack until that fella's bare tush was crimson , until he could n't take another hit , until someone cried " uncle " â when the fantasy would end .
At least that 's how it was supposed to transpire .
It did n't .
The playmates that February night , enticed by Shalleck 's ad , thwarted his rules .
They came seeking cash , reasoning an older man would have money stashed somewhere in his home .
The spanking session turned bloody : Shalleck would die from multiple stab wounds .
His killers grabbed jewelry , checkbooks , and anything else that seemed valuable and then fled , leaving Shalleck 's body in his driveway like a bundle of trash .
It would be nearly two days before anyone noticed him there .
Shalleck had been barely scraping by .
His career in television and film had ended a decade earlier in personal bankruptcy .
There were no royalties rolling in .
He lived modestly off Social Security checks and a part - time job as a bookseller at a Borders store .
The night he died , Shalleck spoke one last time on the phone with his old college buddy , actor Jerry Stiller .
That was the sort of friendship he'd boast about at cocktail parties but not to his spanking partners .
There was no need to chitchat with playmates or even know their names .
Several fetish acquaintances say they did n't learn of Shalleck 's showbiz ties until after the murder .
Likewise , plenty of friends never guessed he might be fooling around with men .
And paddles .
Shalleck would n't even discuss his spanking fetish with gay friends .
He told them they could n't possibly understand and empathize with his true desires .
Jerry Bailis , a friend of 35 years , says Shalleck was an old - fashioned guy stuck somewhere in the 1930s with his Cole Porter tunes .
Bailis , who is 72 and openly gay , says his friend was just beginning to acknowledge that men might be the objects of his desire .
Shalleck kept his facets separate , like mismatched swatches of fabric that form an intricate quilt .
Few who were close to him ever glimpsed the whole pattern .
His sons , David and Adam , and his ex-wife , Joan , are so alarmed by the sexual details surrounding his death they do n't want to talk much about the man , especially because he worked with kids .
" He was a professional at entertaining children , " says David Shalleck , who at 46 is the eldest son .
" I hope to God down there [ in Florida ] they do n't perceive someone with a dark side as anything other . "
Alan Shalleck was born in Manhattan in 1929 , the youngest of three boys .
He told friends he was a " mistake baby " conceived many years after his siblings and that his mother wished he were a girl .
She did n't want him to get dirty playing outside , he claimed , so he never got into sports .
He grew up on the Upper West Side and then moved upstate to study drama at Syracuse University .
In 1950 , he got a job in the CBS mailroom in New York .
From there he moved into production of network shows .
In Jerry Stiller 's memoir Married to Laughter , he recalls marrying Anne Meara in 1953 before Manhattan Municipal Judge Ben Shalleck , his buddy Alan 's uncle .
Since the judge was once married to Broadway singer Lillian Roth , Stiller wrote , his presiding over the ceremony " seemed to stamp the moment with some sort of showbizzy significance . "
Shortly after the wedding , Stiller remembers , Alan arranged for the young couple to appear on The Price Is Right , where Shalleck was assistant director ; they won a turkey .
But Shalleck wanted to work in children 's television .
He clinched an associate producer role on Winky Dink and You , an innovative Saturday - morning show on CBS that encouraged kids to connect the dots of climactic scenes by drawing on a plastic sheet stuck to the TV screen via static electricity ; the main character , Winky Dink , was a wide - eyed pixie who needed kids to , say , draw him a bridge so he could cross a river .
The show , which ran from 1953 to 1957 , is considered the first interactive TV program .
Then , in 1960 , singer / actress Jane Norman approached a CBS station in Philadelphia with an idea for a children 's show .
She 'd dress like Peter Pan , fly around , and hang out in a forest with an owl named Oggie and a butterfly named Fliffy .
The show , Pixanne , ran for 16 years , and Shalleck got to direct some segments .
He also worked as a stage manager for Captain Kangaroo .
David Shalleck compares tagging along with his father at CBS production sets to " going into Toyland . "
In 1977 , Shalleck saw a chance to strike out on his own when Hans Augusto Rey , illustrator of the Curious George books , passed away .
Shalleck approached Hans 's widow , Margret , with an offer to direct George 's animated television debut .
She agreed .
Hans and Margret Rey published the meddlesome monkey 's first adventure in 1939 while they were living in France , where the monkey went by the name Fifi .
The husband - and - wife team concocted the tale together , with Hans painting the watercolor illustrations and Margret fussing over the words .
Just before the Nazis stormed into Paris in 1940 , the Reys , both German - born Jews , fled on bicycle .
The manuscript for Curious George was one of the few belongings they took with them .
The couple traveled to Spain , Portugal , and Brazil before settling in New York City that year .
In 1941 , Curious George hit American shelves .
The original story is a series of mishaps that commence when an inquisitive monkey ambles into the trap of a poacher ( The Man in the Yellow Hat ) .
The man acts as both captor and protector as George stirs up trouble by almost drowning on the ocean voyage from Africa , accidentally summoning the fire department , escaping from jail , and floating into the sky holding a cluster of red balloons .
The story ends with the man paying off an angry balloon vendor before tucking George under his arm and carrying him to his new residence , a big - city zoo .
The Reys , who had no children of their own , penned seven Curious George tales together , the last of which , Curious George Goes to the Hospital , was issued in 1966 .
The creative process was so tedious that each time the couple completed a new story , they 'd vow not to do another .
By the late Seventies , when Shalleck approached Margret Rey , people who grew up with Curious George had become parents , and they were ready for a fresh spin on the character .
The Shalleck - Rey collaboration was a window into the bizarre .
Shalleck would " spend entire weekends and weeks " at Rey 's house in Boston , recalls longtime friend Bailis .
" Margret Rey would jump around acting the stories out , and he would write them down .
She was the monkey . "
Rey was also a fierce protector of Curious George 's image .
A monkey ought not talk , she insisted , and George should keep puffing his beloved pipe , even if it inspired kids to smoke tobacco .
To bankroll the TV series , Shalleck turned to Canadian investor Richard Lafferty .
The 104 Curious George TV shorts Shalleck directed resemble an old - fashioned picture book .
The images are frozen , like pages , and the action is moved along by a single narrator 's voice .
Each episode lasts five minutes .
The shows first aired in Canada , between 1979 and 1982 , and then in the United States on Nickelodeon 's Pinwheel program in 1984 and Disney 's Lunch Box and Circle Time shows in 1989 .
Together , Shalleck and Rey also crafted 28 books based on the film plots for publisher Houghton Mifflin .
Rey hated them .
" The drawings are bad and the stories are bad .
They 're just third - rate , " she told a Newsday reporter .
Shalleck was n't terribly fond of working with Rey .
" She was a spoiled little child , but people would put up with her because she was so talented , " he once told the Palm Beach Post .
Shalleck said he received a flat , one - time fee of $ 500 per story .
In another interview with the Post , he recounted scolding Rey in public : " Once when we were having lunch ... she was so rude to the waiter that I snatched her wig off and told her to behave .
It was next to a spanking . "
In 1991 , Rey sued Lafferty for marketing videocassettes of the Shalleck TV shorts without her consent and without paying her royalties .
Lafferty countersued .
Rey 's finicky ways , Lafferty asserted , obstructed his attempts to capitalize on various Curious George merchandising deals .
Rey decided , for instance , that a plush doll designed by Eden Toys was " junky " and that the monkey depicted on a Sears prototype pajama appeared " plump . "
Both products suffered commercially because of her exacting standards , Lafferty alleged .
In a 1993 decision , the First District U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that although Rey could be overly meticulous and irascible , as a creator of the Curious George brand and owner of the copyright , her concerns were legitimate .
Around the same time , in the early Nineties , Shalleck had borrowed beyond his means to produce a beloved video project called Pepito 's Dream .
The 27 - minute drama , based on a story by John and Margaret Travers - Moore , is about a boy who dreams of making a speech at the United Nations to plead for world peace .
With creditors breathing down his neck , Shalleck filed for bankruptcy and moved to South Florida .
That 's where Gramps , the storybook reader , was born .
Gramps was an energetic showman â no cane or rocker here ! â who liked to share the stage .
Rather than telling children to stay still and hush up , he 'd invite them to lean forward and shout their favorite parts .
Gramps would intentionally mangle lines of cherished books so the kids could correct him and feel involved .
And he read each word with a dramatic flair that made it seem like the plot was unfolding inside that very room .
By the end of storytime , kids would often pile onto his lap .
Gramps enjoyed the attention .
He gave newspaper interviews and signed copies of Curious George books with the words " Stay Curious . "
Judy Stunda , the children 's librarian at the Lakewood Branch Library in St. Lucie County , still displays a photo of Shalleck from his 1997 visit .
" He was wonderful , " the 62 - year - old librarian remembers .
" You could tell he connected with the kids .
It 's like an extra sense â children know when you really like them or not .
They knew he liked them . "
When he could , Shalleck charged a fee of $ 100 an hour .
He needed the extra income .
Shalleck frequently complained to friends about his meager finances and having to work well into his retirement years .
When Gramps got bookings , friends say , the black rain cloud over Shalleck 's head would suddenly lift .
It was like he needed to be around children .
Toward the end of his life , he mostly read for free , driving as far as Pahokee to enthrall children .
The night Alan Shalleck died , his close friend Mike Rayber pulled up to his trailer , which was partially obscured by overgrown sea oats .
Cars lined the street for Super Bowl parties , and the yells of sports fans masked the rustling of leaves and gentle clink of wind chimes that typically filled the air .
Rayber drove Shalleck to a Boynton Beach Tony Roma 's for a late celebration of Rayber 's 59th birthday .
Shalleck paid .
With Rayber , Shalleck could let his guard down .
They 'd met more than a decade earlier when Shalleck answered a personal ad Rayber had written .
Rayber told police he saw himself and Shalleck as homosexuals but that Shalleck had trouble reconciling the idea in his mind .
" I do n't know that he necessarily considered himself gay . "
Rayber said Shalleck would often beg him for a spanking and that , on occasion , he would reluctantly indulge his pal .
Shalleck had entrusted him with keys to his trailer and an important task : to dispose of Shalleck 's " toys " in the event of his death so his grown sons would n't find them .
Both assumed he 'd die of natural causes .
Shalleck 's neighbors in Royal Manor Estates , a tidy 55 - and - over community , had long before surmised he might be gay .
Denise Zajac , a tiny blond 59 - year - old who lives due west of Shalleck 's old trailer , waves one hand like a crossing guard as she searches for the best words to describe why she suspected Shalleck was having homosexual trysts .
" He had a lot of traffic in and out .
You know , people traffic â men .
Young , old , black , white â whatever .
Day , night , morning .
C'mon , something 's going on .
We figured out what type of lifestyle he was leading . "
At that , her husband , Tom , looks up from the football game he 's engrossed in to add , " He had more guys going in there than a locker room . "
But who would have imagined the spanking sessions ?
Whenever a guest arrived , Shalleck would crank up the music â sometimes opera or soul â to mask the howls of a man getting his tail whipped .
Standing in her Florida room , Denise is just six feet from the driveway where Shalleck 's battered body was dragged and abandoned after the assault .
The Zajacs say they did n't hear or see any signs of a struggle the Super Bowl Sunday their neighbor was killed .
And nobody noticed Shalleck 's corpse , covered with black garbage bags next to his blue Honda , until Tuesday .
Across the street , 80 - year - old Russell Hall remembers his wife , Charlotte , who passed away in 2006 , intuiting the moment she met Shalleck that he was gay .
" We 're both pretty broad - minded people .
She liked him , and so did I ....
He was closet gay , I guess .
He never discussed it with us . "
At least once a week , the Halls would entertain Shalleck with a cocktail or two â vodka tonic with lime .
He 'd unload negative thoughts that had him feeling down , and the Halls would try to cheer him up .
He was envious of the couple 's adoring relationship with each other and their kids .
" He was n't too happy with his life , the way it had gone , " Hall recalls .
Shalleck often came bearing gifts : souvenirs from his travels or presents around the holidays .
The last Christmas gift , a ceramic jazz pianist and drummer , sits in the corner of Hall 's TV room .
Hall squints his pale - blue eyes as he reflects on the fate of his friend .
" Too bad he had to get hooked up into that stuff â the gay lifestyle .
Course , he could have been straight as a die and still had that happen .
You never know in this day and age .
There are a lot of predators out there . "
Jim Sirman shudders to think he might have been at Shalleck 's house the night of the murder .
Could he have prevented the crime ?
Or would he have been killed too ?
The diminutive 56 - year - old already had a date Super Bowl Sunday , so he had turned down Shalleck 's invitation .
Sirman made plans to meet Monday night instead , but then he could n't reach his play pal by phone .
This was odd .
Sirman says Shalleck was usually so eager before a play date he would phone several times that day to confirm the encounter .
It was a 50 - mile drive to Boynton Beach from his home in Davie ; Sirman decided not to make the trip .
Sirman rang Shalleck again Tuesday , and a Boynton Beach homicide detective returned the call .
" My heart sank , " he recalls .
" I knew it had to be about Alan . "
The two men , both divorcees and fathers , met through a loose - knit South Florida spanking club of roughly 20 men .
At first , Sirman says , he was turned off by Shalleck .
He seemed pushy , aggressive .
One time Sirman even saw him jump into an ongoing role - play game between two men at a spanking party ; such uninvited interruptions are a big no -no in the fetish community .
But a persistent Shalleck phoned him perhaps 10 times until finally the younger man agreed to meet for a private , one - on - one session .
Sirman inquired about health problems and established safe words : green for go , yellow to slow down , and red for stop .
They got together perhaps three times before Shalleck was killed .
Sirman says he gets off hearing older men moan , scream , and squirm under his flat hand or the swift swat of a paddle .
And Shalleck liked to be dominated .
The sessions would go on for hours .
" He had one of the toughest bottoms I 've ever seen , " Sirman remembers .
" It was like leather , his ass . "
Members of the spanking club , spooked by the homicide , disbanded for a while .
Beating one another relentlessly was suddenly unappealing after one of their brethren got pummeled and knifed to death .
Those living in the closet were so terrified of being outed after police came knocking at their doors to ask about Shalleck that they never returned to the club .
Gossip began to circulate in Fort Lauderdale 's large gay community about the two men who confessed to the murder , Rex Ditto and Vincent Puglisi .
Some wondered whether the duo might have been responsible for unsolved murders in the area .
Vincent Puglisi , a 54 - year - old fast - food cashier , and his unemployed 29 - year - old lover , Rex Ditto , were about to be evicted from their Oakland Park home when they decided to visit Shalleck in early 2006 .
The men had been dating for only a month .
Both had prison records , Puglisi for burglary and Ditto for assault and arson .
Combing through a list of recent incoming phone calls to Alan Shalleck , Boynton Beach Police found three from Puglisi â who showed up for questioning with cuts all over his hands .
Ditto appeared wearing sneakers with soles that matched a bloody print at the crime scene , and a Fossil wristwatch that belonged to Shalleck .
By Wednesday evening , just 36 hours after the body was discovered , the pair had confessed .
Puglisi told police he met Alan Shalleck a year before the murder after reading the " catchy " spanking advertisement in 411 magazine ; Puglisi was " curious to see just how kinky he was , " so he got together with Shalleck on a few occasions .
Puglisi says he and Ditto discussed robbing and killing Shalleck before they ever traveled north to Boynton Beach ; Ditto insists the plan involved only spanking .
Each blames the other for Shalleck 's murder .
Both agree that upon arriving at the trailer , around 11 p.m. , they watched a porn video .
Ditto says it depicted older European men spanking white teenage boys .
At Shalleck 's behest , Ditto stripped down to his white silk women 's underwear and bent over his host 's knee .
Then the man they knew as " Jay " slipped off Ditto 's underwear and began smacking him , first with his bare hand and then with a wooden paddle .
Ditto eventually pleaded guilty to first - degree murder and robbery with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole .
Puglisi turned down a plea and is expected to stand trial in April , when Ditto has agreed to testify against him .
Puglisi 's attorney advised him against granting an interview to New Times .
Meanwhile , Ditto agreed to discuss Shalleck 's murder with New Times at Everglades Correctional Institution , which is nestled amid the sawgrass near the Miccosukee casino in Miami .
A female corrections officer and a burly inmate with tattooed arms stood watch as a wiry - built Ditto shuffled into a large meeting room wearing royal - blue canvas loafers , baby - blue scrubs , and a flimsy black yarmulke .
The seductive face from the booking mug shot had gone gaunt and was partially obscured by a thin beard .
His tousled locks had been shorn .
Prison had erased Rex Ditto's good looks .
According to Ditto , after a few minutes under an oarlike paddle , he could n't take anymore corporal punishment .
But when he asked for a timeout , Ditto says , Shalleck told him he'd have to withstand the thwacking " till the sun comes up . "
That 's when Ditto , who says he 's a diagnosed schizophrenic , claims to have heard voices .
He 's a nasty man , they said .
Hit him in the head .
Ditto grabbed the paddle and clobbered Shalleck in the forehead .
A pissed - off Shalleck began choking him , Ditto says , and the two fell to the floor while they struggled .
Ditto says when he hollered for help , Puglisi came with a kitchen knife and began stabbing Shalleck .
As the assault dragged on , Ditto says , he decided it was time for a mercy kill ; he plunged a knife in a circular pattern all around Shalleck 's genitals , aiming for the kidneys .
Shalleck was stabbed in more than 40 places , including the anus .
In his statement to police , Puglisi said he never struck Shalleck .
Rather he witnessed Ditto bludgeoning Shalleck repeatedly over the head with the paddle ; then he held the victim down while Ditto fetched a steak knife .
He watched Ditto take up blade after blade , each of which either broke or bent under the pressure of the thrusts .
And as he punctured the old man , Ditto repeatedly said , " The son of a bitch wo n't die . "
All the while , Shalleck begged for his life .
Robert Gershman , Ditto's attorney , says he thinks the men were equally culpable â and that life in prison was the best deal Ditto could hope for in a death penalty case .
" This is probably one of the most gory and gruesome scenes anyone will ever see , " Gershman says , remembering the crime scene photos .
" The bathroom was covered in blood from floor to ceiling , and there was a handprint smeared down the length of the wall .
It was like something out of a horror show . "
Ditto and Puglisi dragged Shalleck 's body out to their car .
They planned to transport it to the Everglades and leave it for the gators .
But they got spooked when a security guard drove by and took off .
Then they dumped bloody knives and paddles in the New River in Fort Lauderdale and burned some of Shalleck 's belongings in their back yard in Oakland Park .
Their haul was meager : $ 80 in spare change wrapped in paper , some jewelry , and a check they forged to themselves for $ 450 .
Shalleck 's checkbook showed only $ 500 in his checking account at the time of his death .
Five days after Shalleck 's murder , Curious George made his big - screen debut in a long - awaited Universal film produced by Ron Howard .
One of the scenes , when the monkey climbs onto a dinosaur skeleton in a museum , was borrowed from a story line developed under Shalleck 's direction .
In the months leading up to his death , friends say , Shalleck was trying to find a lawyer to help him fight for a payout from Houghton Mifflin and Universal , but to no avail .
The movie earned $ 14.7 million on its opening weekend at the box office .
Shalleck and his heirs would n't be seeing a piece of that action .
Alan Shalleck 's sons arranged for their father 's burial in Westchester County , New York .
The wooden casket was interred February 14 , 2006 .
There was two feet of snow on the ground that day , David Shalleck says .
The funeral was n't well attended .
What I need here is a live blog .
I do n't know anything about reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Thus , in principle , it 's possible that Bush has just proposed a good idea , though the odds are against it .
By contrast , Bush 's plan to destroy America 's health care system is a very bad idea .
I like that Bush explicitly linked his plan to destroy the public school system with the idea of Pell Grants .
That 's appealing to liberals .
And , of course , conservatives like George Bush are always shortchanging the Pell Grant system just as once they 're done using poor kids as a bludgeon with which to beat down teachers they 'll lose all interest in funding vouchers and return to their usual starve the poor attitude .
" Generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions " -- a great idea ; maybe next we can develop a pony - based source of power .
Or maybe we could reduce emissions by relying on the floo network .
The climate change section actually managed to get more faith - based after the carbon capture part .
Innovation is , of course , essential to reducing emissions .
But the way you create the incentives for emission - reducing innovation is to put a price on carbon by auctioning tradable emissions permits .
Just standing around and hoping -- or even having the government shovel wheelbarrows full of money -- is n't going to do anything .
" Entitlement spending and immigration " -- fascinating to watch the lame duck returning to the scene of the two big issues that wrecked his popularity . . . guest - workers for all , Social Security benefits for none !
â We trust that people when given the chance will choose a future of freedom and peace â -- remember when conservatism was based on a dour , realistic view of human nature and the human condition ?
I miss those days .
There 's no time right now for a treatise on the full sociological naivetÃ© of this bizarre statement but it 's obviously -- obviously -- false that liberal democracy is some kind of human default condition .
It took thousands of years to emerge !
Constructing stable , legitimate political institutions is difficult .
Surge stuff .
I 've written tons about this .
Not going to do anymore in Iraq .
Just note the total , utter , complete , all - encompassing lack of candor and honesty about the conflict between the CLCs and the Iraqi government .
With regard to Iraq one has to wonder time and again why , if this policy is so great , does it need to be constantly sold by means of massive dishonesty .
Okay , wait , it 's impossible to avoid commenting on the GOP 's loud Iraq - related cheers .
Democrats take note -- the GOP thinks this is a winning issue for them and are bound to campaign on it ; the other party needs to be prepared to fight on these issues and can't afford to count on the election being all - economy all - the - time .
" The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side - by - side in peace " -- well said .
Too bad about those years worth of bad policymaking by George W. Bush whoever 's been running the country or maybe we'd be a lot closer to that goal .
" There has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11 " -- anthrax !
Anthrax !
Oh well .
For some reason that whole episode has been officially erased from the historical record or something .
Lusty applause from the power of small government for unlimited surveillance power .
Malaria -- good stuff .
AIDS , too .
I 'll also note that banal diseases like measles kill way more people in the developing world than you 'd think and we should put some emphasis on them as well .

Hillary Clinton supporter , Lanny Davis , appeared on Tucker Tuesday and found himself faced with accusations that his candidate was trying to play the victim card and claimed she had been the victim of gender discrimination during last night 's debate in South Carolina .
Davis reminds Tucker that Senator Clinton attended Yale Law School , which is predominately male , but the formerly - bow - tie - clad putz would n't hear it .
He just can't fathom the idea that any woman who is white and wealthy could ever be discriminated against in any situation .
I think there would be more than a few women out there who would take exception to Mr. Carlson 's claim ...
Doctors claim to have found the first compelling evidence that the G spot exists , but say not all women appear to have one .
Ultrasound scans revealed clear anatomical differences between women who said they experienced vaginal orgasms and a group of women who did not .
The scans identified a region of thicker tissue where the G spot was rumoured to be lurking , which was not visible in the women who had never had a vaginal orgasm .
Doctors at the University of L'Aquila in Italy , where the study was conducted , say the findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G spot .
The location , and even existence , of the G spot has been hotly contested in medical circles .
While doctors know that female sexual anatomy varies substantially , until now there has been no solid evidence to link those differences to a woman 's sexual responses .
" For the first time , it is possible to determine by a simple , rapid and inexpensive method if a woman has a G spot or not , " Dr Emmanuele Jannini told New Scientist magazine .
The G spot is only thought to affect a woman 's ability to have vaginal orgasms , so if women do not have one " they can still have a normal orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris , " Jannini said .
The team used ultrasound to scan nine women who had experienced vaginal orgasms and 11 women who said they had not .
In the first group of women , the tissue between the vagina and the urethra was found to be substantially thicker than in the other women .
Jannini , whose study appears in the Journal of Sexual Medicine , said the scans suggested that " women without any visible evidence of a G spot cannot have a vaginal orgasm " .
The research supports a previous study by the team which reported differences in the chemical make - up of the G spot tissues .
Women who appear to have a G spot produced specific chemicals , including an enzyme that processes nitric oxide , the substance that triggers male erections .
Other researchers welcomed the findings , but said it was unclear whether the team had identified a distinct G spot structure or an internal part of the clitoris .
" This may be related to the presence of the controversial G spot , " said Tim Spector , a consultant rheumatologist at St Thomas ' hospital in London .
" However , many other explanations are possible , such as the actual size of the clitoris , which although not measured in this study appears highly variable . "
Elisabeth Lloyd , a professor at Indiana University and author of The Case of the Female Orgasm , said scans should now be conducted on a larger group .
" There 's been controversy over which parts of the female anatomy might be the G spot , and what the role of it might be , " she said .
Lloyd said only 20 % to 25 % of women had vaginal orgasms during sex .
" It has never been explained why that is the case ; it 's a mystery .
This paper does n't totally explain it , but it might do partially , and that could help us understand what those numbers are about . "
â Friendster ended up with three levels of V.P. âs , C.E.O. âs and board members who , although they had great rÃ©sumÃ©s , they were not connected to the social networking concept and did nât really use Friendster , â she wrote .
Mr. Doerr , at Kleiner Perkins , disputed this .
He said that he visited the Friendster site at least once a day .
â It âs certainly not fair to say we were out of touch when we were willing to commit millions of dollars to this market , â he said .
â We understood the opportunity .
The company did nât seize that opportunity . â
But Mr. Siegelman , one of Mr. Doerr âs partners at Kleiner Perkins , said Mr. Abrams had a point .
The original board had little feel for the product , said Mr. Siegelman , who attended most meetings and eventually replaced Mr. Doerr .
But Mr. Siegelman also described Mr. Abrams as a founder in way over his head , which is why , in April 2004 , only a few months after investing in the company , the board replaced him as chief executive .
â All of a sudden Jonathan had all these high - powered investors to please , â Mr. Siegelman said .
â He had all this money in the bank , so there was all this pressure to hire people and get things done .
Open up new territories : China , Japan , Germany .
Add all these new features .
Meantime , he took his eye off the ball . â
But the board also lost sight of the task at hand , according to Kent Lindstrom , an early investor in Friendster and one of its first employees .
As Friendster became more popular , its overwhelmed Web site became slower .
Things would become so bad that a Friendster Web page took as long as 40 seconds to download .
Yet , from where Mr. Lindstrom sat , technical difficulties proved too pedestrian for a board of this pedigree .
The performance problems would come up , but the board devoted most of its time to talking about potential competitors and new features , such as the possibility of adding Internet phone services , or so - called voice over Internet protocol , or VoIP , to the site .
THE stars would never sit back and say , â We really have to make this thing work , â â recalled Mr. Lindstrom , who is now president of Friendster .
â They were talking about the next thing .
Voice over Internet .
Making Friendster work in different languages .
Potential big advertising deals .
Yet we did nât solve the first basic problem : our site did nât work . â
In retrospect , Mr. Lindstrom said , the company needed to devote all of its resources to fixing its technological problems .
But such are the appetites of companies fixated on growing into multibillion - dollar behemoths .
They seek to run even before they can walk .
I almost feel bad about this , but it seems like this sacred cow is more like Shambo .
sometimes the elders are right , and the youngsters really are too young to know the history of the idea they think that they âve just invented .
Unfortunately for Joel , QR codes have been around for over a decade and work very , very well ( they âre most well - known in Japan where they appear on virtually every item you can buy , but when British tabloid newspapers like The Sun are starting to run them , you know they âre making inroads in the UK too ) .
Given that he âs talking about mobile phones , and that he says typing URLs is not hard , I can only imagine that he âs never actually done it .
Typing URLs on a mobile phone keyboard is an awful , awful experience .
If it âs anything other than a simple www.something.com you may as well not even bother , because you âll probably make a typo anyway .
Why do you think there are so many â text us this word on this number and we âll send you the URL â services ?
Unluckily for the consumers who are expected to install new software on their phones line , he also does nât seem to realise that some phones do now come with QR code readers built in .
Oh dear .
From my point of view , where I âve been watching QR codes for about seven years , they âve always seemed like a good idea , but the mobile technology in the West has just been too poor to be able to use them .
Now that every man and his dog has a phone which incorporates a 2 MP camera and a fully - featured web browser ( none of this WAP rubbish ) it âs easy to see them becoming more and more popular .
This blogger thinks that Joel should stick to commenting on software , and leave the mobile tech world well alone .

During the war , many countries had made effort so that they would not be conquered but they would stand victorious .
But as it is the wish of every country , it could not be granted .
How can you win the war ?
If you will be able to make a great loss for them so they have no choice but to surrender then you will do it quickly .
The historical occurrence of the bombing in Japan cities has made the nuclear weapon be known and also be feared .
There are efforts that are being done by countries so they could not suffer much when there will be a nuclear war in the future .
There are many countries who had made already their own and so it is not surprising if all had their own .
But not all can afford it because it is not easy and it has high costs .
There power and impact are great that they are devastating .
That is why many fear them .
The organization of countries then are imposing regulations for the nuclear bomb .
Countries who fear for war destroy the nuclear bomb facilities of their enemy .
Sanctions are also imposed on countries that are being found to making nuclear bombs .
Each country now wants to have also their own so that they can have a defense .
As the world has already witnessed how great and devastating its effect .
But if the world will have a war and all countries use their nuclear bomb , what would be the future of the earth .
With powerful instruments scouring the heavens , astronomers have found more than 240 planets in the past two decades , none likely to support Earth - like life .
But what if aliens were hunting life outside their own planet ?
Armed with telescopes only a bit bigger and more powerful than our own , could they peer through the vastness of space and lock in onto Earth as a likely home to life ?
That âs the question at the heart of paper co-authored by a University of Florida astronomer that appeared recently in the online edition of Astrophysical Journal .
The answer , the authors say , is a qualified â yes . â
With a space telescope larger than the Hubble Space Telescope pointed directly at our sun , they say , â hypothetical observers â could measure Earth âs 24 - hour rotation period , leading to observations of oceans and the chance of life .
â They would only be able to see Earth as a single pixel , rather than resolving it to take a picture , â said Eric Ford , a UF assistant professor of astronomy and one of five authors of the paper .
â But that could be enough for them to identify our planet as one that likely contains clouds and oceans of liquid water . â
This research may sound whimsical , but it has a serious goal : to provide a road map for Earth - bound astronomers trying to study Earth - like planets â a task expected to become possible in coming decades as more powerful telescopes come on line , said Enric Palle , the lead author of the paper and an astronomer with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias .
For humans or curious aliens , observing planets is challenging for a number of reasons â habitable planets all the more so .
The planet ca nât be too close or too far away from its star , or its surface would scald or freeze .
And , it must have a protective atmosphere like Earthâs .

Most planets found so far are much larger than Earth , which means they are likely hot gas planets similar to Jupiter , a profoundly uninhabitable place with no solid surface and atmosphere composed largely of hydrogen and helium .
But astronomers are beginning to plan how future space telescopes could directly detect planets much closer to Earth âs size and proximity to the sun .
One challenge :
To figure out how to use a planet âs light to recognize if its surface and atmosphere are Earth - like .
For Ford and his colleagues , the answer lies in probing how the Earth would appear to outside or alien observers .
Astronomers have long recognized that even a large telescope would need to observe Earth for several weeks to collect enough light to identify chemicals in the planet âs atmosphere .
During these observations , the brightness of the Earth would change , primarily because of clouds rotating into and out of view .
If astronomers could measure Earth âs rotation period , then they would know when a given part of the planet was in view .
The hitch was that astronomers were unsure whether Earth âs seemingly chaotically changing cloud patterns would make it impossible for alien observers to determine this rotation rate .
Based on data retrieved from satellite observations of Earth , Ford and his colleagues created a computer model for the brightness of the Earth , revealing that on the global scale Earth âs cloud cover is remarkably consistent â with rain forests usually turning up cloudy , arid regions clear , and so on .
As a result , extraterrestrial astronomers who watched Earth for a period of several months would notice repeating patterns â a bit like watching the spots on a spinning ball come into view and then disappear .
From those repeating patterns , they could then deduce Earth âs 24 - hour rotation period , Ford said .

That done , the â E.T. â astronomers could infer that anomalies in the pattern were caused by changing weather patterns , most prominently , clouds , he said .
Although some uninhabitable planets are extremely cloudy , the repeated presence and absence of clouds indicates active weather .
On Earth , this variability results in water turning from gas to a vapor and back again , so finding similar variability on another planet would be a reasonable indication of liquid water .
â Venus is always covered in clouds .
The brightness never changes , â Ford said .
â Mars has virtually no clouds .
Earth , on the other hand , has a lot of variation . â
Not only that , but observers could likely also infer the presence of continents and oceans from Earth âs changing light pattern .
The research will be useful to astronomers designing the next generation of space telescopes because it provides an outline of the capabilities required for studying the surfaces of Earth - like planets , Ford said .
He said it appears that zeroing in on Earth - like planets orbiting the nearest stars would require a telescope at least twice the size of the Hubble Space Telescope .
Ford said he hopes that his research will help to motivate an ever larger space telescope that could search for Earth - like planets around many stars .
The other authors of the paper are P. MontaÃ±Ã©s - RodrÃ­guez and M. Vazquez , both of the Instituto de Astrofisca de Canarias in Spain , and Sara Seager , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The IAC and UF are partners in the construction of the Gran Telescopio Canarias , a 10 - meter telescope in the Canary Islands , which will start operations in 2008 .
The research was funded in part by a Ramon y Cajal fellowship for Palle , by a Hubble fellowship and UF for Ford , and by a NASA grant for Seager .

J.K. Rowling is suing the publisher of the Harry Potter Lexicon , which began life as a popular Potter blog , and wants a court to rule that she has the sole right to profit from the " descriptions , character details , and plot points " of the Potter tales .
Now , a federal judge has issued an injunction against RDR Books to prevent them from completing the typesetting , selling the books , or even marketing it on Amazon.com .
The case has been percolating for a few weeks now , but the injunction last week makes this a good time to take a look at what 's going on here .
Steve Vander Ark , the lead author of the online Lexicon , wants to publish his material in book form .
Warner Bros. and Rowling , who are jointly suing Vander Ark 's publisher , call this a " willful and blatant violation of Plaintiffs ' respective intellectual property rights , " this despite the fact that Rowling has publicly praised the site in the past .
The plaintiffs are under the apparent conviction that the material on the web site is fine , but that when put into a book , it becomes a copyright violation .
Much of this has to do with money .
" There is a big difference between the innumerable Harry Potter fan sites ' latitude to discuss the Harry Potter Works in the context of free , ephemeral web sites and unilaterally repackaging those sites for sale in an effort to cash and monetarily on Ms. Rowling 's creative works in contravention of her wishes and rights , " says the federal complaint , filed late last month in New York .
Rowling , it turns out , has long wanted to produce her own companion book to the popular children 's series and donate the money to charity .
She believes that the Lexicon would eliminate much of the demand for her product ( because past titles with " J.K. Rowling " on the cover have sold so poorly ) .
The complaint repeatedly stresses that Rowling has not " authorized " such a work , though whether such authorization is even necessary will certainly be one of the key points in the case .
The Lexicon is stuffed with plot summaries , maps , and the sort of minutely detailed timelines you 'd expect from such an endeavor .
It 's a huge treasure trove of information of Harry Potter characters and the world they inhabit .
This sort of thing is par for the course when it comes to popular series ; both Narnia and Middle - Earth have a number of such guides , and the more - common CliffsNotes include exactly this sort of material for even recent books like Cormac McCarthy 's All the Pretty Horses .
Why it 's a major copyright violation in this case is n't clear ; the complaint sometimes suggests that it contains large passages lifted verbatim from the books , but at other times seems to be saying that simple plot summaries and collections of fictional facts are out of bounds ( and it quotes a federal decision finding that detailed plot summaries of Twin Peaks episodes were copyright infringement ) .
Playground sparring
The complaint itself is a bit juvenile .
There are repeated nonfactual statements sprinkled liberally throughout , such as the fact that RDR Books once " replied cursorily " and that the plaintiffs were " patiently waiting . "
This sort of thing grows quickly tiresome , but can also prove hilarious .
Case in point : upon learning that the book would be essentially a " print version " of the online Lexicon , Warner Bros .
asked for a copy of the web site ... on paper .
RDR
Books replied " rudely , " saying , " If you do not know how to print that material please ask one of your people to show you how . "
It 's a valid point .
There 's plenty of this playground sparring to go around .
RDR
Books at one point responded to Warner Bros. lawyers by claiming that the Harry Potter filmmakers had used a copyrighted Lexicon - produced timeline .
Warner calls this " a complete fabrication . "
Despite all the unpleasantness , Vander Ark still signs recent news posts , " still Jo's man , through and through . "
" There is a crazy part of me that believes that if she and I could just sit down and chat about this , we could get it all sorted out and put this miserable incident behind us , " he wrote on November 10 .
Unlikely .
In a recent entry on her own site , Rowling complained , " It is not reasonable , or legal , for anybody , fan or otherwise , to take an author 's hard work , re-organize their characters and plots , and sell them for their own commercial gain .
However much an individual claims to love somebody else 's work , it does not become theirs to sell . "
That in itself is a highly suspect claim .
The weirdest thing of all is that similar items to the Lexicon have already been on the market for years .
Actually , I take it back ; that 's not the weirdest thing of all .
That honor is reserved for the Lexicon itself , which certainly takes liberal advantage of fair use to print hundreds of little snippets from the Harry Potter books .
But try to copy one line from the site for purposes of commentary and criticism , and you 're met with the dialog box , " copyright 2001 - 2006 The Harry Potter Lexicon . "
Nice .
( Note to the Lexicon 's designers : disabling the right mouse click does not actually disable the ability to copy . )
William Patry , Google 's senior copyright counsel , has looked into the case a bit .
His conclusion ?
" I have n't spent a lot of time on the site and so do n't know if there is other material that might be infringing , but I do n't see how a list of spells with this type of commentary is anything other than fair use . "
Patry also notes that one of the cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of their position actually was " of a very different sort " from the current conflict .
So now a judge gets to work it out , possibly most Muggle - ish solution to this magical dispute that anyone could have imagined .
Music Study & Brain Development For Increased Brain Growth , Just Add Music ?
Will listening to music make you smarter ?
Will learning to play a musical instrument make your brain grow larger than normal ?
Questions like these ones have been popping up all over the place in the past few years , and not just in scientific journals either .
In recent times the media has been fascinated by the research surrounding brain development and music , eagerly reporting on the latest studies to the delight of the music - loving parents of young children .
But all this information - and some misinformation too - has led to generalized confusion about the role of music and music training in the development of the human brain .
The bottom line is this : if you 're confused by all you read about music study and brain development , you 're certainly not alone .
In part , this is due to the manner in which the phrase " the Mozart Effect " has been popularized by the media and bandied about to describe any situation in which music has a positive effect on cognition or behavior .
In fact the Mozart Effect refers specifically to a 1993 research finding by Frances Rauscher , Gordon Shaw and Katherine Ky and published in the prestigious journal Nature .
The scientists found that 36 college students who listened to 10 minutes of a Mozart sonata performed higher on a subsequent spatial - temporal task than after they listened to relaxation instructions or silence .
An enchanted media reported this interesting research as " Mozart makes you smarter " - a huge over - simplification of the original results .

THE DOCUMENTARY WILL PREMIERE ON YOUTUBE .
This Is Paris will debut on September 14 on Hilton 's YouTube channel .
It can be streamed for free with ads or , if viewers sign up for YouTube premium , they can watch the feature 's extended cut .
The film was originally supposed to premier as part of the Spotlight Documentary category at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival , but the festival was cancelled due to the Corona pandemic .
Rutgers University physicists have performed computer simulations that show how electrons become one thousand times more massive in certain metal compounds when cooled to temperatures near absolute zero â the point where all motion ceases .
The models may provide new clues as to how superconductivity works and how new superconducting materials could be fabricated .
In a paper posted to Science Express , the researchers describe how electrons interact with other particles in these compounds to morph into what physicists call a fluid of â heavy quasiparticles â or a â heavy fermion fluid . â
While this effect has been previously observed in some materials , the Rutgers work employs new materials to provide a level of detail that has eluded scientists so far .
â In this paper , we essentially track the fate of electrons as we lower the temperature , â said Gabi Kotliar , Board of Governors Professor of Physics in the School of Arts and Sciences .
â Experimental physicists may have seen different aspects of this behavior , or they may have seen behaviors they did not understand .
Our calculations reconcile what they âve seen . â

The Rutgers researchers based their models on experiments using a new metallic crystalline compound made of the elements cerium , indium and iridium .
This and similar compounds that substitute cobalt and rhodium for iridium are excellent test beds for observing heavy electron behavior .
Earlier investigations used high - temperature superconducting materials called cuprates , which failed to give physicists a clear view of electron behavior because of disorders in the crystalline structure caused by doping .
The new cerium - based compounds are simpler to study because they are free of dopants .
â The new compounds are for us what fruit flies are for genetics researchers , â said Kristjan Haule , assistant professor of physics and astronomy .
â Fruit flies are easy to breed and have a simple gene makeup that âs easy to change .
Likewise , these compounds are easy to make , structurally straightforward and adjustable , giving us a clearer view into the many properties of matter that arise at low temperatures .
For example , we can use a magnetic field to kill superconductivity and examine the state of matter from which superconductivity arose . â
These compounds are examples of strongly correlated materials , or materials with strongly interacting electrons , that ca nât be described by theories that treat electrons as largely independent entities .
The terms â heavy quasiparticles â refers to how electrons interact with each other and , as a result of those interactions , form a new type of particle called a â quasiparticle . â
In explaining how this effect appears at low temperatures and vanishes at higher ones , Haule noted that electrons in f-orbitals are tightly bound to cerium atoms at room temperature .
But as the temperature drops , the electrons exhibit coherent behavior , or delocalization from their atoms .
At 50 degrees above absolute zero , or 50 degrees Kelvin , the researchers clearly observe quasiparticles as electrons interact with each other and other electrons in the metal known as conduction electrons .
The work done by Haule and his colleagues is in a branch of physics known as condensed matter physics , which deals with the physical properties of solid and liquid matter .
Their models of heavy quasiparticles draw from Haule âs earlier work merging two theories of atomic modeling , known as local density approximation and dynamical mean field theory , or LDA + DMFT .
Collaborating with Haule and Kotliar was Ji-Hoon Shim , a postdoctoral fellow .
The National Science Foundation âs Division of Materials Research and the Rutgers Center for Materials Theory supported their research .
Shim received postdoctoral research funding from the Korean Research Foundation .
It has become some sort of rule , some sort of perfectly delicious law of the popular culture upon which any open - minded and attuned and humor - licked and spiritually aware and intellectually curious and sexually alive human worth her moist , wine - massaged soul can now rely with utter and perfect clarity .
It goes like this :
If there is some sort of creation , a piece of art , a TV show , a column or a book or a movie or a statue or a blog or a movement , a wine bottle or sexual position or Jesus - shaped dildo that somehow deeply threatens the various ultraconservative sects of Christian - blasted America to the point where their pale , dour representatives demand boycotts and distribute angry pamphlets and try to stop people from experiencing said hunk of culture because of how negatively it portrays their seething , condemnatory God , well , you know it 's time to break out the Champagne .
Or buy that book .
Or get very , very naked .
Or all of the above .
Depending .
So it is with the first movie made from Philip Pullman 's astonishing " His Dark Materials " trilogy , " The Golden Compass , " a complex , mystically gorgeous , spiritually dense , big - budget fantasy epic so far removed from the cute wizardry of Harry Potter and the thin , simpleminded Christian morality of say , " The Chronicles of Narnia , " it might as well be a Coen brothers movie .
On acid .
Oh my God yes , they are protesting .
They are pamphleting .
The Catholic League and Focus on the Family and evangelical / fundamentalist Christian blogs from here to Colorado Springs , they are calling on their trembling armies to boycott the film because they believe that Pullman 's brilliant books â which , by the way , if I had the power , I would place in the eager and lovely hands of every youngish human on the planet right now , but especially the girls â are not only aggressively anti-Christian , they ultimately describe , as their grand finale , nothing less than the death of God .
This is what they say .
And here is the terrific thing :
They are absolutely right .
But let 's be a bit more specific , shall we ?
Because as any fan of HDM knows , it ain't really about God , per se .
Pullman 's luminous novels have nothing to do with rejecting faith or destroying the spirit or inhibiting the exploration of what it means to be divine .
They are , in fact , the exact opposite .
They relish spirit and the magic of belief and love , are soaked through with divine inspiration of a kind any intelligent Christian ( or honest spiritual seeker of any stripe , for that matter ) should crave the way Lindsay Lohan craves cocaine .
This is what makes them so incredible .
No , the nefarious thing the books aim to kill is , well , religious authority .
It 's about the destruction of dogma .
It 's about power , about who wants to control and manipulate life on Earth ; it is about blind , ignorant , even violent adherence to insidiously narrow codes of thought and belief and behavior , sex and desire and love .
This , of course , is the God of organized religion .
This is the false deity that promotes numb groupthink and inhibits growth and abhors the feminine divine ( perhaps the books ' most beautiful , inspiring theme ) , the same paranoid , dreadful God that votes for George W. Bush because , well , he will smite the icky gays and protect us from vile pagans and Buddhists and Muslims and feminists and frumpy genius atheist British writers .
Indeed , if humanity is to flourish , to get over its addiction to war and guilt and fear , this is the false God that should â that must â die .
But let us get more specific still .
Because while the books have as their evil antagonist a sinister cabal called the Magisterium ( obvious parallel : Catholic Church ) , they also have a slew of dark characters in service of the Magisterium , various assassins and double - agents and robot drones running around trying to annihilate the children 's spirit and destroy magic and lock down faith forever .
Let us call these robotic drones , oh , say , the Catholic League .
Or Focus on the Family .
Gosh , no wonder they 're a little peeved .
Ah , but it 's almost too easy , is it not ?
Even a child can see that these people , these groups are so far from true spirit , so far from open consciousness it 's a bit like comparing a lint ball to a cloud bank , a dung beetle to a flower bed .
They are spiritual caricatures , the creepy clowns in organized religion 's gloomy circus , all scrunched brows and gnarled hands and so much repressed sexuality it would make a porn star wince .
Really , why give their silly protests any attention at all ?
Well , for one thing , because these groups have proven they can be highly dangerous , utterly toxic to the culture as a whole .
You already know the list : FCC crackdowns , stem cell research , ultraconservative judges , abstinence education , anti-choice laws , vicious homophobia , intelligent design , the rejection of science , all aiming toward nothing less than the creation of a fascist theocracy in America .
In fact , director Chris Weitz , who adapted " The Golden Compass " for the screen , reportedly removed any direct mentions of God or religion from the film version , fearing , along with New Line Cinema , some sort of Christian conservative backlash .
Fans were , appropriately , outraged .
It remains to be seen how much of those vital themes Weitz left intact , but you could argue that the Bible - thumpers have already taken their sad toll .
( But oh , I do look forward to the bloodcurdling screams that will surely come from these groups when they see the third film , which , if the creators hold at all true to the original book , and presuming the movie gets made at all , features a truly luminous pair of wonderful , immensely powerful , tragic gay angels .
Oh my yes ) .
It might not matter .
With any luck and if " The Golden Compass " turns out to be even half as wondrous as the book , it will hopefully fuel a massive surge in sales of the HDM trilogy in America , and perhaps inspire an entirely new literary awakening among young readers , deeper and darker and more luminous and complex and even ( gasp ) slightly sexual , far beyond the clever but innocuous magic of Harry Potter â which , by the way , had its share of religious bonk - jobs calling for its destruction , as wizardry is clearly the dominion of the devil .
We all know what a huge drop in sales that protest caused .
But there is another note of good news , another terrific takeaway from this tale of fear and whining and outcry , and it takes the form of another delightful rule upon which your soul can happily rely , as well as a heartfelt lesson for trembling ultraconservative sects everywhere .
It goes like this :
If your ancient , authoritarian , immutable belief system is truly threatened by a handful of popular novels , if your ostensibly all - powerful , unyielding creed is rendered meek and defenseless when faced with the story of a fiery , rebellious young girl who effortlessly rejects your stiff misogynistic religiosity in favor of adventure , love , sex , the ability to discover and define her soul on her own terms , well , it might be time for you to roll it all up and shut it all down and crawl back home , and let the divine breathe and move and dance as she sees fit .
Do n't you agree ?

Real age of Hazrat Aisha July 30 , 2006
Some people claim the Bukari and Muslim hadith reporting Hazrat Aisha âs age are â weak â ( I wo nât call them weak hadits , in reality they are attack on our prophet pbuh . )
There is material from both these hadith writers and earlier Islamic histories suggesting Aisha must have been older than nine when married .
According to hadith in Bukhari and Muslim , Aisha is said to have joined Muhammad on the raid that culminated in the Battle of Badr , in 624 CE .
However , because no one below the age of fifteen was allowed to accompany raiding parties , Aisha should have been at least fifteen in 624 CE and thus at least thirteen when she was married following the Hijra in 622 CE .
Ibn Hisham âs recension of Ibn Ishaq âs Sirat Rashul Allah , the earliest surviving biography of Muhammad , records Aisha as having converted to Islam before Umar ibn al - Khattab , during the first few years of Islam around 610 CE .
In order to accept Islam she must have been walking and talking , hence at least three years of age , which would make her at least fifteen in 622 CE .
Tabari reports that Abu Bakr wished to spare Aisha the discomforts of a journey to Ethiopia soon after 615 CE , and tried to bring forward her marriage to Mut`am âs son .
Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to Islam , but if Aisha was already of marriageable age in 615 CE , she must have been older than nine in 622 CE .
Tabari also reports that Abu Bakr âs four children were all born during the Jahiliyyah , the pre Islamic period , which could be said to have ended in 610 CE , making Aisha at least twelve in 622 CE .
According to Ibn Hajar , Fatima was five years older than Aisha .
Fatima is reported to have been born when Muhammad was thirty - five years old , meaning Aisha was born when he was forty years old , and thus twelve when Muhammad married at fifty - two .
Most of these narratives are reported only by Hisham ibn Urwa reporting on the authority of his father .
All the narratives of this event have been reported through narrators from Iraq , where Hisham ibn Urwa is reported to have shifted after living in Madinah for seventy - one years .
It is reported in one of the most well known books on the life and reliability of the narrators of the traditions ascribed to the Muhammad reports that Yaqub ibn Shaibah said , â narratives reported by Hisham are reliable except those that are reported through the people of Iraq â .
It further states that Malik ibn Anas objected on those narratives of Hisham , which were reported through people of Iraq .
Another book on the narrators of the traditions of the Muhammad reports that when he was old , Hisham âs memory suffered quite badly .
According to the generally accepted tradition , Aisha was born about eight years before Hijrah .
However , according to another narrative in Bukhari ( Kitaab al - Tafseer ) Aisha is reported to have said that at the time Surah Al - Qamar , the 54th chapter of the Qurâan , was revealed , â I was a young girl â .
The 54th Surah of the Qurâan was revealed nine years before Hijrah .
According to this tradition , Aisha had not only been born before the revelation of the referred Surah , but was actually a young girl , not even only an infant at that time .
So if this age is assumed to be 7 to 14 years then her age at the time of marriage would be 14 to 21 .
According to almost all the historians , Asma the elder sister of Aisha , was ten years older than Aisha .
It is reported in Taqreeb al - Tehzeeb as well as Al - Bidayah wa al - Nihayah that Asma died in the 73rd year after migration of Muhammad when she was 100 years old .
Now , obviously if Asma was 100 years old in the 73rd year after Migration to Medina , she should have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of migration .
If Asma was 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah , Aisha should have been 17 or 18 years old at that time .
Thus , Aisha â if she got married in 1 AH ( after Migration to Medina ) or 2 AH â was between 18 to 20 years old at the time of her marriage .
According to many Ahadith in Bukhari , it is believed Aisha participated in the battle of Badr and Uhud .
Also in Bukhari ( Kitabuâl - maghazi ) Ibn ` Umar states that the Prophet did not permit me to participate in Uhud , as at that time , I was 14 years old .
But on the day of Khandaq , when I was 15 years old , the Prophet permitted my participation .
So if it was not allowed to participate in Uhud for people younger than 15 , then Aisha would be atleast 15 in those battles , making her age atleast 13 to 14 at the time of marriage .
Tabaqat ibn Saâd , 8:58 ; Ansab al - Ashraf , 1:410 .
Opinions are in disagreement concerning her marriage with Muhammad .
Their marriage seems to have taken place either two of five years after the Migration ( Usd al - ghaba , 5:501 ) .

The Iranians have released their own video of the alleged " confrontation " that occurred between three US warships and five Iranian speedboats in the Strait of Hormuz :
The Pentagon âs narrative is very different .
Coupled with a claim that the Iranians transmitted a radio message to the effect of " I am coming to you .
You will explode shortly , " here is the US government âs version :
The Iranian video is clearer , and much more convincing : there are background noises consistent with the visual images , unlike the Pentagon âs version .
And I am not the only one to note these discrepancies .
As the New York Times puts it :
" Naval and Pentagon officials have said that the video and audio were recorded separately , then combined .
On Wednesday , Pentagon officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak officially , said they were still trying to determine if the transmission came from the speedboats or elsewhere .
" The audio includes a heavily accented voice warning in English that the Navy warships would explode .
However , the recording carries no ambient noise Â the sounds of a motor , the sea or wind Â that would be expected if the broadcast had been made from one of the five small boats that sped around the three - ship American convoy .
" Pentagon officials said they could not rule out that the broadcast might have come from shore , or from another ship nearby , although it might have come from one of the five fast boats with a high - quality radio system . "
As much as I hate to say it , the video released by the state - controlled media of the tyrannical Iranian regime is more coherent , and far more credible than Washington âs cock - and - bull story .
And that âs truly a very sad state of affairs .
But remember who put out all that ersatz " intelligence " about Iraq âs " weapons of mass destruction . "
To those who reflexively take Washington âs word over Tehran , I have three words to say : Niger uranium forgeries .
Mike Nizza , writing on the New York Times blog , reports :
" The list of those who are less than fully confident in the Pentagon âs video / audio mashup of aggressive maneuvers by Iranian boats near American warships in the Strait of Hormuz now includes the Pentagon itself .
Unnamed Pentagon officials said on Wednesday that the threatening voice heard in the audio clip , which was released on Monday night with a disclaimer that it was recorded separately from the video images and merged with them later , is not directly traceable to the Iranian military . "
Well , then , who was threatening " You will explode " ?
As a commenter on the Times blog notes ,
" Over in the Gulf , Ch. 16 [ the commonly - used UHF frequency ] is like a bad CB radio .
Everybody and their brother is on it ; chattering away ; hurling racial slurs , usually involving Filipinos ( lots of Filipinos work in the area ) ; curses involving your mother ; 1970 âs music broadcast in the wee hours ( nothing odder than hearing The Carpenters 50 miles off the coast of Iran at 4 a .m. )
" On Ch. 16 , esp. in that section of the Gulf , slurs / threats / chatter / etc. is commonplace .
So my first thought was that the Â explode â comment might not have even come from one of the Iranian craft , but some loser monitoring the events at a shore facility . "
Given the likelihood of this scenario , I have to wonder : who was that " loser , " anyway .
An Iranian Revolutionary GuardÂ or an Iranian - sounding voice under American direction ?
And what about that mysterious onshore " facility , " where they just happened to be " monitoring the events " Â what a coincidence !
We were lied into war by the same people who are now trying to sell us their version of an alleged " provocation " Â but who are the real provocateurs ?
Well , we do nât know the answer to that question , but given the track record of our own government , it would hardly come as a shock if it came out that the US version is a complete fabrication .
As for the Iranians , no doubt their rather abbreviated clip has been edited to conform to Tehran âs official story , and yet , in the balance of things , theirs is the more credible account .
After all , why would the Iranians needle us , and give George W. Bush and the Israeli lobby the excuse they need to launch a war nobody wants ?
I heard a CNN reporter recently opine that the Iranians are " testing " us , but do they really need to come at our warships full bore whilst threatening to blow us up in order to do that ?
Surely a subtler feint would be more useful for " testing " purposes .
In short , it just does nât make any sense for the Iranians to have done what they âre accused of doing , and yet it does make perfect sense that an administration such as this one Â which has been gunning for Tehran , lo these many months Â would create an " incident " in the run-up to launching an attack .
As I warned weeks ago , when the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran came out , and people were shouting hosannas because they were convinced war had been averted : not so fast .
The nuclear issue was never going to spark a war with the Iranians , because they had already abandoned their program : there was no smoking gun .
The most likely path to an open armed conflict was always a border incident , either on land or in the Gulf .
That âs why I âve been hammering away at the idea that we need to get out of Iraq pronto : the longer we stay in , the higher the risk that we âll be at war with the Iranians before anything can be done to stop it .
The momentum of events will have carried us forward to a confrontation that will impact us here at home as has no other conflict in recent memory .
Oil at $ 200 a barrel , an inflationary spike that sends the markets reeling , and , perhaps , an international financial meltdown that will recall the Great Depression Â all this , and the unspeakable carnage .
It is nât going to be pretty .
So what can we do to stop it ?
This is an election season , and so we have an opportunity to influence the public debate : it âs the season when politicians are open to pressure from us plebeians .
No matter whom you support , or which party you identify with , it âs important to make your views known .
It âs an outrage that none of the supposed " front - runners " in the presidential race have made a statement on the Hormuz " incident " Â or , at least , no such statement has been reported as of this writing , nearly 48 hours later .
How disengaged from world events this election is becoming , with no real discussion of the important issues and everything taking a back seat to the Chris Matthews " horse race " school of reporting .
Here we are on the brink of war , and all they can talk about is Mitt Romney âs Mormonism and Hillary âs one recorded moment of authenticity .
The Iraq war has been pushed to the background : the " surge , " we are told , is " working . "
Move along Â nothing to see here .
As for the Hormuz incident : why are nât the candidates being asked about it ?
When it comes to directly answering the question of whether the President will come to Congress before launching an attack on Iran , this administration has a long history of evasions .
I think it is fair to say , however Â given the passage of the Kyl - Lieberman resolution and the White House âs expansive conception of presidential authority in wartime Â that the answer is clearly and emphatically no .
Senator Jim Webb ( D - Virginia ) has introduced legislation that would require the President to seek congressional authorization before taking military action against Iran , but that is stuck in committee , and failed to gain much support among the Democratic presidential aspirants .
To be fair to Hillary Clinton , she signed on as a co-sponsor of the legislation : the only problem is , she âs just as likely to vote for war with Iran as she is to vote nay .
Only two major party candidates that I know of rule out aggression aimed at Iran Â and have spoken out loud and clear on the issue Â and that is Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul .
So what about Obama , the alleged " peace " candidate now being held up as the alternative to Hillary Â and where is John Edwards on this question of a looming war with Iran ?
These guys are nowhere to be found when it comes to facing down the War Party when and where it counts Â and , worse , their " antiwar " supporters are letting them get away with it !

ACP shows support for medical marijuana Just in case you 'd forgotten , there happen to be quite a few doctors out there who support medical marijuana .
Why , just take a look at this recent position paper from the American College of Physicians , for instance :
The American College of Physicians , the largest medical specialty organization and the second largest physician group in the United States , today issued a strong statement urging a fundamental rethinking of U.S. government policy on medical marijuana , stating , " ACP strongly urges protection from criminal or civil penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted by state laws . "
ACP 's position paper specifically criticized the federal classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug , deemed by the government as not having accepted medical uses or safety for use under medical supervision .
" ACP urges review of marijuana 's status as a Schedule I controlled substance and reclassification into a more appropriate schedule , given the scientific evidence regarding marijuana 's safety and efficacy in some clinical conditions , " the statement declared .
What good might come from such a statement ?
What good might come from such a statement ?
" This statement by America 's second largest doctors ' group demolishes the myth that the medical community does n't support medical marijuana , " said Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , D.C. " The ACP 's statement smashes a number of other myths , including the claims that adequate substitutes are available or that marijuana is unsafe for medical use .
124,000 doctors have just said what our government refuses to hear , that it makes no medical or moral sense to arrest the sick and suffering for using medical marijuana . "
And LAist notes : And LAist notes :
While the country 's most respected medical collective , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , continues to ask for more research , they do not support the declassification of marijuana ; the ACP hopes to persuade the AMA otherwise .
They also hope to put pressure on the government -- particularly now , when all eyes are on the politicians who are positioned to assume the White House , and bring about change .

Finland labels Princess Galyani portrait kiddie porn-Effi February 21 , 2008
[ FACT comments : Electronic Frontiers Finland ( Effi ) was one of the earliest international supporters of FACT âs petition against all censorship .
The current censorship situation in Finland now , uncannily , mimics almost precisely the development of Internet censorship in Thailand .
Even the number of sites blocked initially is very similar to our figures of 2004 .
The Finnish blocklist is secret â¦as is Thailandâs .
Whole domains are arbitrarily blocked in Finland â¦as in Thailand .
Many websites blocked are collateral damage in Finland â¦as in Thailand .
Proper oversight to Finnish censorship has not been applied so that quirky Websites for hearing aids , teachers , musical instruments , dolls , computer repair and gay rights are blocked â¦as they are in Thailand .
What would never occur Thailand is seeing our fond memorial image of the late HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana at age 84 blocked as child pornography !
Freedom Against Censorship Thailand ( FACT ) demands an immediate apology by the Finnish government to the Royal Family , the Thai people and the Thai government , all of whom are still in mourning for the Princess â death .
FACT respectfully requests the Prime Minister of Thailand , the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Culture make diplomatic protest over this thoughtless , unforgivable slight to the Thai throne .
Lese majeste is a serious crime in Thailand , punishable by 15 years imprisonment .
FACT demands that lese majeste charges be filed immediately against the Finnish government authorities responsible .
FACT demands the Thai Ambassador to Finland be recalled immediately in protest .
Breaking diplomatic relations with Finland would not be too severe a lesson for such an insult to Thai monarchy .
We often think of ourselves here in Thailand as an emerging democracy and look to the Scandinavian countries in particular as protecting freedoms above all .
Once censorship takes poisoned root , it is very difficult for government to back down .
The Finnish situation demonstrates a classic paradox : if some censorship is good ( and who can deny that child pornography must be bad ? ) , then more must be better .
Censors never know where to stop .
The secret Finnish blocklist follows â¦ ]
Finnish Internet censorship
Electronic Frontiers Finland : February 18 , 2008
Recent developments have occurred in Finnish Internet censorship .
The Finnish police censors much more than was originally intended .
There âs been a big controversy about Internet censorship in Finland : A law was passed which allows police to maintain lists of child porn sites , but it turned out ( not surprisingly ) lots of sites with no child porn on them have been added to the list , including a site criticizing the censorship .
For
Thais in particular it might be interesting that at least one big
Thai web portal , thaimisc.com , has been blocked entirely , with the effect that lots of Thais are in effectively labeled as child pornographers even when they are nothing of the kind .
That includes the image of your recently deceased princess at the front page of http://www.thaimisc.com/.
Thais must certainly find that most offensive .
Please help our campaign against Internet censorship here , and getting this into news in Thailand would be helpful â please post as widely as possible to Thai media , Weblogs and message boards .

http://www.effi.org/blog/police_blames_usa_for_childporn.html
and
http://www.effi.org/blog/kai-2008-02-18.html
( the latter has all the gory details and links to even more info ) .
[ FACT : Links follow this article . ]
The Finnish police maintains a secret block list of web sites allegedly containing child pornography , pursuant to a law passed late 2006 .
The purpose of the law is to prevent the access to the foreign sites that contain child pornography .
Most of the censored sites are located in the United States or EU countries .
Many of the censored sites have turned out to be apparently legal pornographic sites .
Some of the censored sites are not pornographic sites at all .
The censorship list has been recently augmented with a Finnish site called lapsiporno .
info that is maintained by an Internet activist Matti Nikki .
The site does not contain any pornography , let alone child pornography , but articles that criticise censorship and a list of blocked domains .
Nikki has been one of the most vocal critics of the government âs net censorship project .
After a public outcry on the censorship practices the police decided to suspect Nikki of aiding the distribution of material violating sexual chastity .
They called him for questioning on Wednesday 20 February 2008 .
This article gives a summary of Internet censorship in Finland and an overview of recent developments in English .
What is censored
The list of censored web sites is supposedly secret .
However , due to the implementation of the censorship mechanism , described more in detail later , it has been possible to find and study the censored sites .
The censorship supposedly applies only to foreign web sites that are used to distribute child pornographic images and the block list indeed reportedly contains such sites .
However , many of the censored sites are apparently legal pornographic sites .
Most of the censored sites are located in the United States or in the EU countries which have strict legislation against child pornography .
Many of the censored US sites contain the 18 U.S.C. 2257 notice .
Many of the blocked sites are link farms , without actual independent image content .
The block list reportedly contains disproportionately many gay sites .
The censorship however extends not only to the adult sites .
For example , the following sites are censored :
* THC hearing aid devices
* IT consulting service for teachers
* Music instrument store
* Doll store
* Computer repair service
* Windows tips in Thai
* Data Management and Biostatistics Network Journal Guestbook
* English and Thai discussion of gay rights ( no images ! )
The Finnish police also censor the site http://www.thaimisc.com, root page of which is shown in the figure above .
The root page appears ( even though I do nât understand the Thai text ) to be set up in honour of the late HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand .
This is not a proud moment to be a Finn .
The case of Matti Nikki
Matti Nikki ( Muzzy ) is an Internet activist who is remembered by many of his analysis of the Sony BMG DRM spyware .
Nikki maintains an Internet site lapsiporno. info ( translates as â childpornography â . info ) .
The site contains a list of the censored sites and critical articles of Internet censorship .
The site does not contain any pornography at all .
The National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI ) added Nikki âs site to the block list on or about 12 February 2008 .
The NBI refused to comment the reasons for the blocking , but they said that generally speaking a site may be blocked if it contains even one link to alleged child pornographic site .
Previously the list of censored sites on Nikki âs site had just the names of the sites , not links .
To enter a censored site one had to copy the site name to the address bar of the browser .
The site was censored after Nikki had made the names of the sites clickable links ( after which there was no need to manually copy the site names to the address bar of the browser ) .
According to the police FAQ ( in Finnish ) the block list includes sites with â a working link to a site containing child pornography â .
There is however no apparent legal basis for the distinction between not censoring a site with a written site name of an alleged child pornographic site , and censoring a site with the corresponding clickable link .
Nikki had published the block list because it is the only way to publicly evaluate the censorship practices .
According to Nikki , most of the censored sites are in fact legal pornographic sites .
A member of the parliament that checked Nikki âs list of censored sites confirmed that the block list contains many sites that are apparently legal adult sites , with no child pornographic content .
The censorship of Nikki âs sites caused a public outcry .
A legal Finnish web site had been censored .
If Nikki âs site really had some illegal content , the correct thing to do would have been to obtain a take down order from the court , as the web server is located in the Finland and information of the owner of the site is given clearly at the root page of the site .
There was indeed no reason to censor the site .
After the public outcry the case started to look really bad for the NBI .
On or about 15 February 2008 the police announced that they would like to question him of suspected aiding of the distribution of material violating sexual chastity ( according to the criminal code the material violating sexual chastity is images presenting children , violence or animals in sexual context ; the investigation had apparently been delegated from NBI to the Helsinki police ) .
Without knowing any details , a good guess is that the police suspects that having a clickable link to a web site allegedly containing child pornographic images is equivalent to aiding the distribution of such images .
[ FACT : USA is currently trying to make website owners legally liable for material they link to . ]
The blocked sites listed on Nikki âs site should of course be inaccessible for the people that have a Internet connection that implements the block list ( even if they clicked the links , assuming that the blocking is effective in practice ) .
On same grounds the police could probably also call search engines such as Google , Microsoft Search and Yahoo for questioning .
How the censorship works
An unnamed official ( or officials , nobody knows for sure ) at the National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI ) classifies a web site as a â child pornography site â and adds it to the secret block list .
The police has announced that the site does not need to have any images to be added to the block list .
It is enough if the site contains only one link to a site allegedly containing child pornographic images .
The NBI has declared that the second degree linking , for example , the news sites linking to Nikki âs site , will not be censored .
According to the NBI , the block list contains about 1700 sites .
Apparently the police do not try to contact the site Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) or the owner of the censored site , even if the site owner would be known ( although due to the secretive administrative practices of the block list it is difficult to say how exactly the list is administered and who , if any , is contacted ) .
This is strange , because most Internet service providers would certainly react to valid announcements of child pornography sent to their abuse desk address .
The censorship is applied equally to all clients of the ISP .
There is no way to opt - out ( although circumventing the censorship is technically easy ) .
It is not clear how censored sites may to be removed from the block list .
As far as we can tell the sites are never removed , unless someone complains to the email address given by the police and the police judges that the site is no longer a â child pornographic site â .
There is apparently no way to appeal this judgement .
Appealing the judgement may be difficult in the first place because the list is secret ( you may not know that you have been censored ) and the police refuses to reveal the listing criteria for individual sites on the grounds of the secrecy of the list ( you may not know why you have been censored ) .
It is also unclear who would pay damages or how to demand punishment for a loss of income or defamation due to an incorrect block list entry .
The police send the block list to selected ISPs at regular intervals .
Most of the ISPs that implement the block list then block the access to these sites using a domain name system ( DNS ) based blocking mechanism ; some ISPs reportedly use intercepting proxy server to do the filtering .
The ISPs are required by law to keep the block list secret .
The censorship is very coarse .
Whole web servers are blocked .
A web server of a large Internet Service Provider can serve thousands of sites belonging to different customers .
For example , let âs assume someone posts a message containing a link to an alleged child pornographic site to a message board maintained by one of these customers .
The message appears on the site for a day , after which the maintainer of the message board removes the message as inappropriate .
If the NBI happens to check the site during the brief period when the offending message is visible they may censor the whole site for undetermined time .
For the same reason sites with lots of user - generated content are at risk : it may be enough that one user posts some inappropriate content to get the whole site censored .
The potential for collateral censorship is huge .
POLICE .
ENTRY DENIED .
Announcement by the police that a web site you tried to access has been censored .
When a client âs web browser sends a request for a domain name server ( DNS ) of an Internet ( IP ) address of a censored site the DNS does not return the actual IP address of the censored server but an IP address of the ISP âs server that contains an announcement that the site has been blocked .
[ FACT : Called a transparent proxy . ]
Instead of the censored site , the client is shown an announcement of the following kind ( translated from Finnish ; see the screen below for the original announcement , as shown at the Nikki âs site ) :
POLICE .
ENTRY DENIED .
Your browser has tried to access a site for which the access has been prevented due to the act on preventive measures on distribution of child pornography .
The police maintains and updates a list of these child pornography sites .
It is punishable to possess or distribute images on these sites .
For the police these images are evidence of sexual crimes against children .
Any messages on the issue can be sent the National Bureau of Investigation , email address krp-nettiesto@krp.poliisi.fi
From this link you can read the criminal code related to the child pornography .
In other words , the police claims that a blocked site contains child pornographic images , even though this is not necessarily true â even according to the police a single web link is sufficient to get a whole site blocked , no images are required .
The announcement page contains just the email address ( which reportedly even did not work originally ) .
There is no other contact information or information about who is in charge of the block list .
How the censorship can be circumvented
The censorship is easy to circumvent with minimal technical skills .
It is sufficient to use some other domain name server than that of your Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , such as OpenDNS , or a third party web proxy server .
The implementation of the censorship mechanism makes it possible to find out what is on the supposedly secret block list .
One can for example implement a web crawler that sends a domain name request of the crawled sites to the ISP âs name server .
If the name server returns the address of the ISP âs announcement server then the domain name is censored .
Getting a partial snapshot of the block list this way is possible for all customers of the ISPs that implement the censorship .
Most of the supposedly secret block list has in fact been published in several venues .
Is the censorship legal ?
The Constitution of Finland , section 12 , guarantees the freedom of expression .
Censorship is absolutely forbidden by the constitution , except that there may be restrictions relating to pictorial programmes that are necessary for the protection of children .
The censorship is implemented pursuant to the act on preventive measures on distribution of child pornography , passed late 2006 ( law in Finnish ) .
The law authorizes the National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI ) to maintain a secret block list of foreign web sites that distribute child pornographic images .
The law is supposed to be a final resort to block the access to sites that ca nât be taken down by conventional judicial means , such as by a take down order issued by the court of law .
According to the statement by the Faculty of Law of the University of Turku during the drafting of the law , submitted on request to the Ministry of Transport and Communications , the act on preventive measures on distribution of child pornography violates the constitution .
There was however a strong political pressure to appear to be doing something to the child pornography in the Internet .
The law was rushed through the parliament with no opposition as an ordinary law , disregarding the possible unconstitutionality .
( It is possible to make laws that contradict the constitution , but such laws should be passed as constitutional laws with 5/6 majority at the parliament , or 2/3 majority at two consecutive parliaments . )
The ministry implied during the drafting of the law that if the Finnish Internet Service Providers did not submit to the â voluntary â censorship the government would make the censorship mandatory .
This is why the â voluntary â in â â voluntary â censorship â is often written within quotation marks .
The law ( even though the law itself may be unconstitutional ) only authorizes blocking foreign sites that are used to distribute child pornographic images .
The NBI however has also blocked Nikki âs site , a domestic site which contains no child pornography but critique of net censorship .
It appears that much more than just sites containing child pornographic images are censored .
Because the law is infringing a civil right protected by the constitution it should be interpreted as restrictively as possible .
The legality of the current implementation of the censorship is doubtful : the coarse DNS based blocking mechanism censors whole web servers , some with thousands of sites , resulting to huge collateral censorship .
The NBI also appears to have a very expansive interpretation of the applicability of the law .
According to the law , the block list is secret .
NBI uses this secrecy as a basis to refuse to disclose the blocking criteria even of the sites publicly known to be on the block list ( such as Matti Nikki âs site ) .
It appears that the NBI uses the secrecy of the list as an excuse to keep also the administration of the list as closed and secretive as possible .
Is the censorship legal ?
The act on preventive measures on distribution of child pornography itself may be unconstitutional , the coarse technical implementation of the censorship may inherently cause illegal collateral censorship and the NBI appears to have stepped well outside the bounds set by the law in maintaining the block list .
Is the censorship effective in fighting child pornography ?
According to the ministry the censorship is supposed to prevent accessing a child pornographic site by accident â even though it is extremely unlikely to surf to a child pornographic site by accident in the first place and even though everyone has always been able to obtain a net - filtering program or service on voluntary basis .
The distribution of child pornographic images is illegal in most countries and therefore these images are not typically distributed from the open web sites for which this type of censorship could even in principle be efficient .
Even the preliminary work on the law recognized the fact that the censorship will not do much good for the real problem , that is , the sexual abuse of children .
It was also recognized early that the censorship could be easily bypassed .
It seems that it is the appearances that count here .
It is important that someone appears to be doing something to counter the child pornography in the Internet ; even though it can be argued that the censorship just makes things worse in sweeping the real problem under the carpet ( not to speak of introduction of unconstitutional censorship mechanism ) .
Any opponent of the censorship is easily labelled a supporter of child pornography .
The censorship hurts law - abiding citizens who try to visit wrongly - censored sites , and owners of the wrongly blocked sites who are labeled as distributors of child pornographic images by the police .
The censorship hurts the victims by sweeping the real problem of child abuse under the carpet , out of sight , out of mind .
Many of the censored sites in countries with a strict legislation against child pornography stay up and are not taken down .
This implies that either the sites do not really contain child pornographic images or the NBI has not informed the local authorities or Internet Service Providers of the infringing sites ; or that the local US and EU authorities are not doing anything â all explanations which are equally worrying .
The resources wasted on the futile censorship project would have been better spent on giving more emphasis to the co-operation of the police authorities in different countries so that the offending sites could be really shut down and the people responsible brought into justice .
This was in fact suggested by many , including Effi , during the drafting of the law .
Expansion of censorship
It did nât take long for people to suggest expanding the censorship further .
During the past month or so it has been suggested that the Internet poker sites should be censored with the same system .
Net poker apparently is a problem for some and the solution would be to censor all gambling sites for good .
A real reason behind this may also be the protection of the Finnish national gambling monopoly which has not managed to set up a net poker site of their own , at least yet .
There have been EU wide plans to prevent access to the sites that allegedly â promote copyright infringement â , such as the Pirate Bay ; this has also been suggested by our domestic recording and movie industry lobbyists .
Some have suggested preventing access to racist sites and so on .
Supposedly some bureaucrat at the National Bureau of Investigation would decide which sites contain copyright infringing or racist content or whatever else is on the list and add them to the secret block list .
We are on a slippery slope here .
The civil rights , such as the freedom of expression or right to privacy , are deteriorating rapidly in Finland , a fact noted in the 2007 International Privacy Ranking of the Privacy International .
One reason for the sad state of affairs is the lack of basic knowledge about how the Internet works .
The first reaction of many to the new world order brought by the Internet is to have more restrictions .
It may also be that the relatively long period of stability and democracy has made many people forget why constitutional rights , such as freedom of expression or right to privacy , are important .
These rights are too easily traded for an apparent sense of security or for the economic interests of large corporations .
What Effi will do
The act on preventive measures on distribution of child pornography has few legal remedies .
Many constitutional safeguards have already been bypassed .
Effi will , with others , appeal the law and the current censorship practices to the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice who supervise the lawfulness of the actions of Government Ministers and public officials , and who monitor the implementation of basic rights and liberties and human rights .
Hopefully real discussion of the deeper meaning of our constitutional rights will ensue .
However , there is little anyone can do in the long term if our basic rights are seen by politicians and the public as secondary to the apparent sense of security .

Hundreds of stupid , drunk and drugged partygoers danced millimetres from death at an " underground " dance party held at the base of a seaside cliff in Sydney 's east , police say .
The rave , which started at midnight on the tennis court - sized , oceanside rock platform , 30 metres below the Clovelly cliff top , was shut down by police responding to noise complaints at 3 am ( AEDT ) .
Heavy surf pounded around the party , with waves washing at times onto the dance " floor " lit with strobing coloured lights powered by a generator that also powered the music .

Saying it was ' spelling ' error , Reuters pulls article that referred to Obama as ' Osama ' John Byrne

In a little noticed flub , the Reuters news agency referred to Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) several times as ' Osama ' in a widely distributed news article Wednesday , an article they pulled later in the day .
Though transcripts of the original article are hard to find , RAW STORY located one this morning .
Many of the corrected articles distributed to news agencies scrubbed the original mistake .
The article was titled , " Obama takes on rivals over economic woes . "
The following is reproduced from the cached Reuters article on AOL .
Reuters attributed the mistake to a ' spelling error . '
A rewrite distributed later said it " Corrects spelling of Obama in paragraphs 14 and 18 . "
Many copies of the newly redistributed articles did not append the correction of the original , including one which ran on Yahoo !
Canada and America Online .
The earliest reference found to the error appeared on Daily Kos. JANESVILLE , Wisconsin ( Reuters ) - Buoyed by a string of eight consecutive victories , Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama bashed rival Hillary Clinton over the ailing U.S. economy on Wednesday and also took aim at Republican front - runner John McCain .
The Illinois senator , a day after sweeping three more Democratic presidential contests , unveiled an initiative to produce 5 million new jobs in the green energy sector and promised to create a development bank that would invest $ 60 billion to rebuild the nation 's infrastructure .
" We are not standing on the brink of recession due to forces beyond our control , " Obama said .
" It was a failure of leadership and imagination in Washington -- the culmination of decades of decisions that were made or put off without regard to the realities of a global economy . "
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president if he wins the November election , made his remarks at a Wisconsin plant that produces GM 's popular sport utility vehicles and has been seen as vulnerable to being closed .
He used the occasion to bash both his main rivals , Democrat Clinton and Republican McCain , saying they had wasted billions of dollars and cost thousands of lives by supporting an unnecessary war in Iraq as U.S. senators .
He accused Clinton of changing her stance on the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada , saying she supported it when it was signed but now says " we need a time - out on trade . "
" I do n't know about a time - out , but I do know this -- when I am president , I will not sign another trade agreement unless it has protections for our environment and protections for American workers , " Obama said , adding he would end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas .
McCain , riding his own wave of momentum after sweeping the Republican primaries on Tuesday in Virginia , Washington , D.C. , and Maryland , fired back on Iraq , saying developments showed Democrats had been premature in demanding a withdrawal of U.S. forces .
" They said that we would never succeed militarily , then we began to succeed militarily , " McCain said in Washington after picking up the endorsement of Republican leaders in the House of Representatives .
In an unusual criticism of McCain , a former prisoner of war in Vietnam , Rep. Neil Abercrombie if Hawaii , an Obama supporter who heads a House panel that overseas the Army and Air Force , accused McCain of " dim- witted " posturing on Iraq for presenting U.S. choices as either staying or surrendering .
While Obama campaigned in Wisconsin , which votes next week , Clinton focused on contests in the heavily populated states of Ohio and Texas in three weeks as her best hope to stop Osama 's surge .
Tuesday 's victories gave Obama scores of additional pledged delegates to the Democratic Party 's presidential nominating convention in August .
Obama had 1,078 pledged delegates to Clinton 's 969 , according to a count by MSNBC , and his campaign said it was unlikely the former first lady would be able to catch up .
A candidate needs 2,025 to clinch the Democratic nomination .
" We believe it 's next to impossible for Senator Clinton to close that pledged delegate count , " said David Poufs , Obama 's campaign manager .
" The only way she could do it is winning most of the rest of the contests by 25 to 30 points . "
Guy Cecil , political director for the Clinton campaign , said after the March 4 contests in Ohio and Texas the total delegate count between the two candidates would be within 25 .
The former first lady , who would be the first female president , spent the day campaigning in Texas , courting Hispanic voters , and launched a series of new ads aimed at Ohio and Texas .
She shrugged off Tuesday 's losses , saying Obama had been expected to win the contests and congratulating him on his victory .
But she issued a challenge , saying : " Tell him to meet me in Texas .
We 're ready . "
The New York senator dismissed Obama 's criticism over the economy , saying his plans fell short on extending health care to all Americans , on dealing with the mortgage crisis and expanding the use of renewable energy .
[ Editor 's note :
An even earlier version of the article substituted this paragraph : The New York senator dismissed Osama 's criticism over the economy , saying his plans fell short on extending health care to all Americans , on dealing with the mortgage crisis and expanding the use of renewable energy . ]
" I do n't know how you take on the economy and produce real results for people if you do n't stay focused on how we 're going to create the good new jobs of the future , " she said .
" It 's a difference between promises and solutions . "
As part of a new interview with Gamasutra , Id legend John Carmack has been discussing the state of PC gaming , suggesting that , though key PC differentiators like connectivity and modding are being matched by next - gen consoles , is a " train driving all the PC sales numbers altogether on gaming " .
In the interview with Carmack and spouse Anna Kang discussing the newly launched Id Mobile , part of the conversation turned to the state of PC gaming .
Theandco - creator and legendary coder has long been associated with PC gaming , so his thoughts on the state of the market are particularly thought - provoking : JC :
It 's definitely true that when you set out to make a new game now , you do wind up looking at the PC as it sits next to the console , and that drives design conditions .
If you make a cross - platform game , the PC is not going to look that much different there .
There is a little bit better graphics fidelity , and it's lot more powerful than a high - end console .
You certainly only have about half efficiency , but still , you get some influence .
But it 's not really drastic .
Historically , the real value of PC has been in connectivity , and in modification ... but the latest generation of consoles is encroaching on that territory with all the options you 've got on current consoles , the connectivity and the add-ons and things you can get there .
But on the other hand , if you look at what 's really successful on the PC -- like , that 's an insanely successful product .
It 's like a train driving all the PC sales numbers altogether on gaming .
Just in terms of games that you sit down and play in the console mode , the PC probably does n't have a huge amount of differentiation , and that 's unlikely to change .
But the different areas where the PC is still standing on its own is MMOs , and a lot of casual games are interesting , too .
The people that sit down to play games are predominantly playing them on consoles -- at least , higher - end games -- but the PC still has a strong enough margin to make games , and we continue to support it .
JC : You know , there 's not that much that I would care to ask of the PC vendors , and so on .
The interfaces we 're working with are pretty good , and stability 's pretty good on there .
There 's a lot less to talk about , because for the most part , things are generally working okay .
We still mostly run on XP here , we 're still mostly GL , but the APIs and things are pretty much working .
10 years ago , I was having quarterly conferences with Intel and AMD , trying to get all the issues right with the processor .
Then eventually , that stuff got fixed , and I did n't need to talk with them for a long time .
There was similar stuff with graphics cards issues ... but now , for the most part , things work as you 'd expect right now .
So to some degree , the lack of excitement is a sign of the maturing of the industry and the tech base that we work on .
Wednesday 's statement by Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Iran has 3,000 working uranium - enriching centrifuges could trigger an Israeli military strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities , military sources were quoted by the London Times as saying .

The American military sources were cited by the Times on Thursday as saying that 3,000 centrifuges would be a " tipping point â leading Israel to act .
Despite stern US warnings in recent weeks , the Times report said , the Pentagon is reluctant to strike Iran at this point , but Israel is a â different matter , â according to the American sources .
â Israel could do something when they get to around 3,000 working centrifuges .
The Pentagon is minded to wait a little longer , â the Times quoted one American official as saying , adding that the statement was made before Ahmadinejad 's statement on Wednesday .
On Wednesday evening , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said : " We can not take any option off the table and we need to study operational aspects . "
The defense minister also called for increased economic and diplomatic steps to be taken .
On Wednesday , the Iranian president declared : " We have now reached 3,000 machines . "
He was speaking before a crowd of thousands of Iranians in Birjand in eastern Iran , in a show of defiance of international demands to halt the program believed to be masking the country 's nuclear arms efforts .
Ahmadinejad has in the past claimed Iran succeeded in installing the 3,000 centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facility at Natanz .
Wednesday 's claim was his first official statement that the plant is now fully operating the 3,000 centrifuges .
Centrifuges are used in enriching uranium , a process that can produce either fuel for a nuclear reactor or material for a warhead .
Earlier this week , Yossi Baidatz , head of research at Military Intelligence , said Iran 's current regime is not in danger of collapsing and may go nuclear by the end of 2009 .
In August 2006 , as the war in Lebanon raged , a gang of teenage girls confronted 12 - year - old Jasmine Kranat and a friend on a London bus .
â Are you Jewish ? â they demanded .
They did nât hurt the friend , who was wearing a crucifix .
But they subjected Jasmine , a Jew , to a brutal beating â stomping on her head and chest , fracturing her eye socket , and knocking her unconscious .
According to the Community Security Trust , the defense organization of Britain âs 300,000 - strong Jewish community , last year saw nearly 600 anti-Semitic assaults , incidents of vandalism , cases of abuse , and threats against Jewish individuals and institutions â double the 2001 number .
According to the police , Jews are four times more likely to be attacked because of their religion than are Muslims .
Every synagogue service and Jewish communal event now requires guards on the lookout for violence from both neo -Nazis and Muslim extremists .
Orthodox Jews have become particular targets ; some have begun wearing baseball caps instead of skullcaps and concealing their Star of David jewelry .
Anti-Semitism is rife within Britain âs Muslim community .
Islamic bookshops sell copies of Hitler âs Mein Kampf and the notorious czarist forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ; as an undercover TV documentary revealed in January , imams routinely preach anti-Jewish sermons .
Opinion polls show that nearly two - fifths of Britain âs Muslims believe that the Jewish community in Britain is a legitimate target â as part of the ongoing struggle for justice in the Middle East â ; that more than half believe that British Jews have â too much influence over the direction of UK foreign policy â ; and that no fewer than 46 percent think that the Jewish community is â in league with Freemasons to control the media and politics . â
But anti-Semitism has also become respectable in mainstream British society .
â Anti-Jewish themes and remarks are gaining acceptability in some quarters in public and private discourse in Britain and there is a danger that this trend will become more and more mainstream , â reported a Parliamentary inquiry last year .
â It is this phenomenon that has contributed to an atmosphere where Jews have become more anxious and more vulnerable to abuse and attack than at any other time for a generation or longer . â
At the heart of this ugly development is a new variety of anti-Semitism , aimed primarily not at the Jewish religion , and not at a purported Jewish race , but at the Jewish state .
Zionism is now a dirty word in Britain , and opposition to Israel has become a fig leaf for a resurgence of the oldest hatred .
Anti-Semitism has continually changed its shape over the centuries .
In the Greco - Roman world , it expressed itself in cultural hostility , resentment of the Jews â economic power , and disdain for the separate lives that Jews led as the result of their religious practices , such as dietary laws and refusal to marry outside the faith .
Adding fuel to these pagan prejudices , Christian theology accused Jews of deicide and held them responsible for all time for killing Christ , a position that effectively associated them with the devil and , crucially , laid the blame for their suffering on their own shoulders .
Later , medieval Christianity attempted to usurp the Jewish heritage through â replacement theology , â which claimed that Christians inherited all the promises that God had made to the Jews , who were to be eliminated through either conversion or death .
These ideas underlay medieval Europe âs regular anti-Jewish pogroms , which consisted of massacres , forced conversions , and torchings of synagogues .
Theological anti-Semitism âs themes reemerged in the next mutation : racial anti-Semitism .
This ideology held that , on account of their genetic inheritance , Jews were the enemies of humanity â a demonic conspiracy whose malign influence could be countered only by removing them from the face of the earth .
Nazi Germany tried to do just that , killing 6 million Jews between 1933 and 1945 .
And now , in Britain and elsewhere , anti-Semitism has mutated again , its target shifting from culture to creed to race to nation .
What anti-Semitism once did to Jews as people , it now does to Jews as a people .
First it wanted the Jewish religion , and then the Jews themselves , to disappear ; now it wants the Jewish state to disappear .
For the presentation of Israel in British public discourse does not consist of mere criticism .
It has become a torrent of libels , distortions , and obsessional vilification , representing Israel not as a country under exterminatory attack by the Arabs for the 60 years of its existence but as a regional bully persecuting innocent Palestinians who want only a homeland .
Language straight out of the lexicon of medieval and Nazi Jew - hatred has become commonplace in acceptable British discourse , particularly in the media .
Indeed , the most striking evidence that hatred of Israel is the latest mutation of anti-Semitism is that it resurrects the libel of the world Jewish conspiracy , a defining anti-Semitic motif that went underground after the Holocaust .
Take the much - abused term â neoconservatives , â which has become code for the Jews who have supposedly suborned America in Israel âs interests .
In the Guardian , Geoffrey Wheatcroft lamented the fact that Conservative Party leader David Cameron had fallen under the spell of neoconservatives â â ardent support for the Iraq war , for the US and for Israel , â and urged Cameron to ensure that British foreign policy was no longer based on the interest of â another country â â Israel .
In the Times , Simon Jenkins supported the notion that â a small group of neo -conservatives contrived to take the greatest nation on Earth to war and kill thousands of people â and that these â traitors to the American conservative tradition , â whose â first commitment was to the defence of Israel , â had achieved a â seizure of Washington ( and London ) after 9/11 . â
According to this familiar thesis , the Jews covertly exercise their extraordinary power to advance their own interests and harm the rest of mankind .
The New Statesman took a more straightforward approach in 2002 , printing an investigation into the power of the â Zionist â lobby in Britain , which it dubbed the â Kosher Conspiracy â and illustrated on its cover with a gold Star of David piercing the Union Jack .
The image conveyed at a glance the message that rich Jews were stabbing British interests through the national heart .
The British media accuse Israel of a host of crimes .
The Guardian published a two - day special report painting Israel as an apartheid state , ignoring the fact that Israeli Arabs have full civil rights .
Another Guardian article , by Patrick Seale , portrayed Israel âs incursions into Gaza as a â destructive rampage . â
Dismissing or ignoring the rocket attacks , hostage - taking , and terrorism that those incursions were trying to stop , Seale concluded instead that Israel â deliberately inflicts inhumane hardships on the Palestinians in order to radicalise them and drive the moderates from the scene . â
When the National Union of Journalists , joining a number of other academic and professional groups , voted last April to boycott Israeli goods â a move that it has since reversed â one of its members , freelancer Pamela Hardyment , described Israel as â a wonderful Nazi - like killing machine backed by the world âs richest Jews . â
Then she referred to the â so - called Holocaust â and concluded : â Shame on all Jews , may your lives be cursed . â
The British media uncritically regurgitate Palestinian propaganda even when it is demonstrably false .
In April 2002 , many outlets labeled Israel âs assault on the refugee camp in Jenin a â massacre â with thousands dead ; in fact , some 52 Palestinian men had died ( of whom the great majority were terrorists ) , along with 23 Israeli soldiers .
In last year âs Lebanon war , the media propagated manifestly false Hezbollah claims of Israeli massacres that later proved to have been staged .
During the same war , the Guardian published a cartoon depicting a huge fist , armed with brass knuckles shaped like Stars of David , hammering a bloody child while a wasp representing Hezbollah buzzed around ineffectually .
The image suggested that Israel was a gigantic oppressor , slaughtering children in brutal overreaction to Hezbollah , a minor irritant .
It was reminiscent of an earlier cartoon in the Independent that showed a monstrous Ariel Sharon biting the head off a Palestinian baby , which won first prize in the British Political Cartoon Society âs annual competition for 2003 .
By showing Jews killing children , both cartoons employed the imagery of the blood libel â the medieval European calumny that sparked many massacres of Jews by claiming that they murdered Gentile children and used their blood for religious rituals .
The BBC , despite its claims of fairness and honesty , is just as marked by hatred of Israel , and much more influential .
It reported the Lebanon war by focusing almost entirely on the Israeli assault upon Lebanon , with scarcely a nod at the Hezbollah rocket barrage against Israel .
Its reporters blame Israel even for Palestinians â killing of other Palestinians .
Last December , in a briefing for other BBC staff , Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen wrote of the incipient Palestinian civil war in Gaza :
â The reason is the death of hope , caused by a cocktail of Israel âs military activities , land expropriation and settlement building â and the financial sanctions imposed on the Hamas led government . â
Some media websites publish readers â anti-Semitic comments .
On the Guardian âs Comment Is Free blog â which does try to remove some of the more offensive remarks â one reader wrote : â Because of their religious teachings whenever Jews have had power they have used it to persecute non-Jews â from the extermination of Amalek to the killing of Christian converts , to the oppression of medieval peasantry in Poland to the Palestinians today . â
A message board on BBC Radio Five Live âs website published a reader âs remark that â Zionism is a racist ideology where jews [ sic ] are given supremacy over all other races and faiths .
This is found in the Talmud . â
Though the site reserves the right not to post messages that are â racist , sexist , homophobic , sexually explicit , abusive or otherwise objectionable , â it refused to remove that posting , which apparently â did not contravene the house rules . â
Another force propagating the new anti-Semitism is the institution at the heart of the old theological version : the Church , which has reverted to blaming Jews for their own suffering and accusing them once again of a diabolical conspiracy against the innocent .
Although Britain is in many ways a postreligious society , it still sees the churches as custodians of high - minded conscience and truth .
And those churches are viscerally prejudiced against Israel .
The Church of England is especially unfriendly ; one might say that it is the Guardian at prayer .
In a lecture in 2001 , the archbishop of Canterbury âs representative in the Middle East , Canon Andrew White , observed with concern that propaganda accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing and of systematically â Judaising â Jerusalem had assumed great authority within the Church of England .
The Church , he said , was undergoing not just a spell of Israel - hatred but also a revival of theological anti-Semitism .
One major influence here is radical Palestinian Christian theology , such as that of Canon Naim Ateek , which revives the imagery of Christ - killing in order to claim that the Palestinians are the rightful inheritors of God âs promise of the Land of Israel .
Another is the prominent Reverend Stephen Sizer , who has said that Israel is fundamentally an apartheid state , that he hopes that it will be â brought to an end , â and that Christianity has inherited God âs promises to the Jews .
Sizer agrees with another leading Anglican , Reverend Dr. John Stott , that the idea that Jews still have a special relationship with God is â biblically anathema . â
And Colin Chapman âs book Whose Promised Land ? âhugely influential within the Church â likewise says that God âs promises to the Jews now pertain to the Christians , adding that violence has always been implicit in Zionism and that Jewish self - determination is somehow racist .
Small wonder , then , that Christian aid societies regularly represent Israel as a malevolent occupying power , distorting Jews â historical claims to the land and making scant reference to the sustained campaign of Arab terrorism against them .
A 2005 report by the Anglican Peace and Justice Network â which underpinned a short - lived move to â divest â from companies supporting Israel â compared Israel âs security barrier with â the barbed - wire fence of the Buchenwald camp . â
Jews were apparently like Nazis â and because of a measure aimed at preventing a second Jewish Holocaust .
Last Christmas , several Anglican and Catholic churches replaced their traditional nativity tableaux with montages of Israel âs security barrier , carrying the unmistakable message that the Palestinians were the modern version of the suffering Christ being crucified all over again by the Jews .
And earlier this year , the Catholic weekly The Tablet revealed that almost 80 percent of British Christians polled did not believe that Israel was fighting enemies that were pledged to destroy it .
Like the media and the churches , Britain âs political and academic Left is making common cause with Islamist radicalism .
The Islamists oppose the Left âs most deeply held causes , such as gay rights and equality for women .
Yet leftists and Islamists now march together under such slogans as â We are all Hezbollah now â during rallies protesting the Lebanon war , and even â Death to the Jews â outside a debate over whether Manchester University âs Jewish Society should be banned .
In 2005 , London âs far - left mayor , Ken Livingstone , illustrated this unholy alliance by publicly embracing Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi , the cleric who endorses suicide bombings in Israel and Iraq .
In the same year , he asked a Jewish reporter who approached him after a party , â What did you do before ?
Were you a German war criminal ? â
When the reporter said that he was Jewish and that the remark offended him , Livingstone likened him to a â concentration camp guard . â
After a government panel found that Livingstone had brought his office into disrepute , the mayor challenged the finding in court , where a judge ruled that his remarks were not anti-Semitic .
But the Community Security Trust found that a number of perpetrators of anti-Semitic attacks mentioned those comments .
And John Mann , chairman of the Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism , was in no doubt : â If you have people like the Mayor of London crossing the line . . . then it gives a message out to the rest of the community .
That is why antisemitism is on the rise again â because it âs become acceptable . â
Livingstone is not the only leftist politician â crossing the line . â
In 2003 , Labour backbencher Tam Dalyell claimed that Tony Blair was â being unduly influenced by a cabal of Jewish advisers . â Liberal Democrat Jenny
Tonge , whose party honored her with a peerage after she sympathized with suicide bombers and compared Arabs in Gaza with Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto , told her party conference in 2006 : â The pro-Israel lobby has got its grips on the Western world .
I think they âve probably got a certain grip on our party . â
Even a distinguished general told me , without a shred of evidence , that Rupert Murdoch had ordered the Times , which he owns , to limit its opposition to the Iraq War â on the instruction of the Jewish lobby in America . â
Furthermore , claimed the general , George Bush had invaded Iraq because â he had Ariel Sharon âs hand up his back . â
Moreover , a number of institutions and professional groups have tried to launch boycotts of Israel : academics , journalists , architects , doctors , public - sector unions , and again the Church of England .
Many of these have not succeeded , but they have served to remind the public that Israel is a pariah .
Given these views , widespread in the media and among political and intellectual elites , it âs no surprise that many Britons believe that global Islamic terrorism is the result of Israel âs behavior toward the Palestinians â or that hatred of both the Jewish state and Jews in general has become increasingly acceptable among the population .
As a woman said to me conversationally at dinner one evening : â I hate the Jews because of what they do to the Palestinians . â
So acceptable has the new anti-Semitism become that many left - wing Jews promulgate the idea that Israel is a racist or apartheid state , demonize those Jews who seek to defend it against slander , and claim that because they are Jews themselves , their words cannot be anti-Semitic â despite the fact that throughout history there have been Jews who have turned on their coreligionists .
One of the most conspicuous features of British anti-Semitism is that the British deny its existence .
The Parliamentary inquiry received only a muted response .
Both Mann and Richard Littlejohn , a journalist whose TV program on the subject aired in July 2007 , encountered people who , when discovering their concern about anti-Semitism , said : â Oh , I did nât know you were Jewish . â But Mann and Littlejohn are nât Jewish .
As Littlejohn noted , the implication was that no non-Jew would ever identify anti-Semitism , and therefore that anti-Semitism was generally a figment of the Jewish imagination .
When I proposed to write a book about it , I was turned down by every mainstream publishing house .
â No British publisher will touch this , â one editorial director told me .
â Claiming there is anti-Semitism in Britain is simply unsayable . â
Many Britons deny the resurgence of anti-Semitism because they think of it as prejudice toward Jews as people and believe that it died with Hitler .
The argument that attitudes toward Israel may be anti-Semitic strikes them as absurd .
But consider the characteristics of anti-Semitism .
It applies to the Jews expectations applied to no other people ; it libels , vilifies , demonizes , and dehumanizes them ; it scapegoats them not merely for crimes that they have not committed , but for crimes of which they are the victims ; it holds them responsible for all the ills of the world .
These characteristics remain precisely the same in today âs hatred of the Jewish state .
Israel is held to standards expected of no other nation ; it is libeled and vilified ; it is blamed both for crimes that it has not committed and for those of which it is the victim ; and it is held responsible for all the world âs misfortunes â most recently , Islamic terrorism .
So the Israel boycotts that have broken out in Britain are intrinsically anti-Semitic .
The boycotters do not seek to cut ties with any other country , however tyrannical or murderous .
They blame no other country for populations that have been displaced through war or other upheavals .
And they expect no other nation that has held off its mortal enemies to defer to those aggressors and accede to their demands .
Britons also tend to suspect that Jews use the charge of anti-Semitism to divert attention from Israel âs crimes .
This is why , for so many in Britain , the suggestion that anti-Semitism is enjoying a renaissance seems not only false but sinister .
Outraged to be accused of peddling bigotry , they begin to hate those who level that charge â who , they conclude , are part of a conspiracy against truth .
Thus Jews who seek to defend Israel find themselves in a trap .
By complaining that attacks on Israel are anti-Semitic , they become examples of the supposed Jewish tendency to play the anti-Semitism card to suppress legitimate debate â and provoke yet more of the very prejudice that they are trying to combat .
Such Jews find themselves in a situation that Kafka could have scripted .
The Economist hosted a 2004 debate in London proposing that â the enemies of antisemitism are the new McCarthyites â because they were trying to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel .
And at that debate , a former Conservative higher - education minister and a member of the Council for the Advancement of Arab - British Understanding stated that any British Jew who supported Israel âs policies was guilty of â dual loyalty . â
I myself , on the BBC âs Question Time in 2001 , was accused of dual loyalty for the same reason .
Insofar as Britons are forced to acknowledge a rise in anti-Semitism , they assume that Jews have brought it on themselves because of Israel âs behavior .
There is certainly a link : whenever Middle East violence surges , as in the 2006 Lebanon war or at the height of the second intifada , physical attacks on British Jews surge , too .
Since violence in the Middle East invariably consists of attacks on Israel to which it is forced to respond , the appalling conclusion is that the more Jews are murdered in Israel , the more Jews are attacked in Britain .
Not all Britons who oppose Israel are anti-Semites , of course .
Many are decent people who hate prejudice .
Indeed , that is why they hate Israel â because they have been taught that it is like apartheid - era South Africa .
Profoundly ignorant of the history of the Jewish people and of the Middle East , they have been indoctrinated with one of the Big Lies of human history .
And it is because of their very high - mindedness that the better educated and more socially progressive they are , the more likely they are to spew Jew - hatred .
But why has this poison seeped into the British bloodstream ?
Why has the country that was once the cradle of the Enlightenment values of tolerance , objectivity , and reason departed so precipitately from its own tradition ?
For one thing , Britain has always had an ambivalent relationship with the Jews .
Medieval England actually led the European charge against them .
The blood libel is thought to have originated in twelfth - century England ; and in 1290 , after numerous pogroms against its Jewish citizens , it expelled them altogether .
It was not until 1656 that , for a variety of economic and religious reasons , Oliver Cromwell allowed Jews to return to England .
Though they subsequently flourished there , a measure of social anti-Semitism persisted until the Holocaust .
Britain âs role in the creation of modern Israel is also a factor in British antagonism toward the Jewish state .
In the early 1920s , the League of Nations entrusted Britain with the administration of Palestine , holding it responsible for â placing the country under such political , administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home . â
For almost three decades , the British tried to evade that obligation in order to appease the Arabs .
The Jews of Palestine thus found themselves fighting the British as well as the Arabs , a fact that caused lasting resentment in Britain .
Public opinion recalls with undimmed bitterness the Jewish terrorism of that period , such as the 1946 destruction of the British headquarters at Jerusalem âs King David hotel .
Arabism is still the default position at the Foreign Office , where sympathetic diplomats are dubbed â the camel corps . â
But a subtler reason exists for Britain âs embrace of the new anti-Semitism .
After the Second World War , the radical Left set out to destroy the fundamentals of Western morality , but its campaign played out very differently in America and Britain .
In America , it resulted in the culture wars , with conservatives , many churches , and sensible liberals launching a vigorous counterattack in defense of Western moral values â and , as it happened , Israel .
Exhausted by two world wars , shattered by the loss of empire , and hollowed out by the failure of the Church of England or a substantial body of intellectuals and elites to hold the line , Britain was uniquely vulnerable to the predations of the Left .
The institutions that underpinned truth and morality â the traditional family and an education system that transmitted the national culture â collapsed .
Britain âs monolithic intelligentsia soon embraced postmodernism , multiculturalism , victim culture , and a morally inverted hegemony of ideas in which the values of marginalized or transgressive groups replaced the values of the purportedly racist , oppressive West .
Further , people across the political spectrum became increasingly unable to make moral distinctions based on behavior .
This erasing of the line between right and wrong produced a tendency to equate , and then invert , the roles of terrorists and of their victims , and to regard self - defense as aggression and the original violence as understandable and even justified .
That attitude is , of course , inherently antagonistic to Israel , which was founded on the determination never to allow another genocide of Jews , to defend itself when attacked , and to destroy those who would destroy it .
But for the Left , powerlessness is virtue ; better for Jews to die than to kill , because only as dead victims can they be moral .
And this general endorsement of surrender feeds straight into a subterranean but potent resentment simmering in Europe .
For over 60 years , a major tendency in European thought has sought to distance itself from moral responsibility for the Holocaust .
The only way to do so , however , was somehow to blame the Jews for their own destruction ; and that monstrous reasoning was inconceivable while the dominant narrative was of Jews as victims .
Now , however , the Palestinians have handed Europe a rival narrative .
The misrepresentation of Israeli self - defense as belligerence , suggesting that Jews are not victims but aggressors , implicitly provides Europeans with the means to blame the destruction of European Jewry on its own misdeeds .
As one influential left - wing editor said to me : â The Holocaust meant that for decades the Jews were untouchable .
It âs such a relief that Israel means we do nât have to worry about that any more . â
It is no accident that Jews find themselves at the center of Britain âs modern convulsion .
Today âs British prejudices rest on a repudiation of truth and a refusal to defend Western moral values .
And it was the Jews who first gave the West those moral codes that underpin its civilization and that are now under siege .
If British politicians were to start speaking the truth about Israel âs history and defending Jews publicly , they might help stem the new anti-Semitism .
Likewise , British Jews â who , unlike their American counterparts , are almost totally silent for fear of making things worse â need to put their heads above the parapet and start telling the truth about Israel .
But for Jews who had allowed themselves to believe that they were truly at home in Britain , the new anti-Semitism is the end of an idyll .
What is a caucus ?
Caucuses are meetings of registered Democrats and Republicans who gather across the state to show their support for the competing candidates for the party 's presidential nomination .
But voters can register , or change affiliation , at the caucus - which makes the results unpredictable
How many caucuses are there ?
There will be almost 1,800 meetings across Iowa tonight , varying from a handful of people gathering in someone 's home , to much larger meetings - and sometimes three or four at the same time - in town halls , schools , churches or other public places
How many people take part ?
Only a tiny proportion of the population of a small state .
In 2000 , the last year in which both parties held caucuses , 59,000 Democrats and 87,000 Republicans voted , in a state with 2.9 million people .
In 2004 , when the Republicans did not hold a caucus , 124,000 people turned out for the Democratic caucuses
What happens ?
Republicans hold a straw poll ; Democrats divide into groups favouring particular candidates .
On the Democratic side , the supporters of any candidate getting less than 15 % support at that caucus are asked to realign themselves to another candidate .
The winning candidates ' names are sent to a central count , which then announces statewide results
What are the advantages and disadvantages ?
It is participatory democracy in action , and many people only decide - or change their minds - at their caucus .
But people must attend in person ; there is no proxy voting .
It takes an entire evening .
If the weather is bad , attendance can be low .
The system makes it hard for parents , night workers and disabled people to participate .
And resentment is growing over the influence of such a small state , which is overwhelmingly white
Why are these caucuses so important ?
Tonight 's votes are the first test of support , and the winners can expect to get a big boost before next Tuesday 's New Hampshire primary .
But not all candidates have campaigned in Iowa ( Rudy Giuliani has ignored it , preferring to put resources into bigger swing states such as Florida ) .
And the race is so tight that tonight 's results may not produce clear winners

Battleground Quranica Sunni Islam is undergoing a gigantic tug - of - war â a power struggle â in which competing versions of the religion are facing off against one another .
The struggle , with consequences that manifest themselves in terms of dead bodies and violent accusations â¦ Read More By Ali Eteraz / September 11 , 2007
Sunni Islam is undergoing a gigantic tug - of - war â a power struggle â in which competing versions of the religion are facing off against one another .
The struggle , with consequences that manifest themselves in terms of dead bodies and violent accusations of heresy , is at its heart , an aesthetic one : how does one arrange the sources of Islam ?
This article is an effort to catalogue that discussion .
It might seem pithy and even irrelevant at time , but the fundamental questions about Islam today â the place of women , the place of minorities , the rights of non-combatants , the limits placed upon the various nation - states , the death penalty of apostasy and blasphemy , censorship , the organization of parliamentary ( or one party ) systems , Muslim democracy , Muslim republicanism , Islamism , Israel , oil and so on â all hinge on a ) whose narrative about how Islam âs sources are arranged emerges victorious , and b ) which narrative does the economically and militarily powerful West decide to empower .
The general trend among academics in the West is to list four or five presumably â standard â sources of Islam and then say â well , here are the ones the Salafis do not accept and add , here the ones the Wahhabis do not accept and add â and so on .
I suppose academics do this because they see the world in terms of what is normative ( within the academy ) and not what is normative in terms of power .
This is a flawed approach because it presumptively favors one particular brand of orthodox Sunni Muslims â the classic orthodox â which has been getting quite a proverbial beat down at the hand of the Salafis and Wahhabis for over a century .
The only reason one would treat them as normative is if one a ) truly believes they ought represent normative Islam ( I do not ) , and b ) truly believes that their position can address the various questions about Islam today ( again , I do not ) .
On the other hand , I am not comfortable with treating Wahhabis and Salafis as normative either â though they would just love that â because a ) they do not actually have a unified method , and b ) their service to a particular political ideological agenda means that we should be careful from treating them as normative .
As such , I will treat only the Quran â which is to Islam what Christ is to Christianity â as normative , and explain the fascinating , contradictory and multifarious ways in which Muslims relate to it , and the massive systems they have created emanating from it .
All of this becomes relevant because the fate of a billion people , and all those who are touched by them , depends on it .

Wait Times Up to Two and a Half or More in Metro Atlanta , While New E- Registration Computers Cause Delays
Officials Fall Back to Old Fashioned Paper Check - In , as Two and a Half Hour Delays Seen at ' Welcome All Park ' ...

Problems with new Diebold electronic registration poll books and new Photo ID restrictions are causing voting delays up to two and a half hours at some polling places across Georgia and metropolitan Atlanta according to news reports , Election Integrity problem report hotlines , and state officials who The BRAD BLOG has spoken with throughout the day .
Diebold electronic voting machines are standing idle at many precincts , as voters wait in long lines while being forced to face sign - in verification procedures on the company 's new , and once - again failing , e-pollbook system at locations across the state ...
Today 's primary is the first major test of Georgia 's new Photo ID restriction at the polling place ( O.C.G.A Â§ 21-2-417 ) , which mandates voters must show a government - issued photo identification card in order to be allowed to vote .
Pollworkers use computers to check each voter 's eligibility against the voter rolls as listed on their screens .
These electronic polling systems are yet another step away from the transparent , accurate and verifiable elections our democracy requires , subjecting yet another part of the election system to the frailties of computer security and the electrical grid , among other problems .
Until this election , Georgia pollworkers checked voters ' registrations on paper printouts of the voting rolls .
According to a report today from NBC's 11 Alive , which diminishes the importance of election security , transparency and accuracy by referring to the problems as " glitches " in its headline , " Poll workers at the [ Inman Middle School in Virginia Highland ] had just two computer terminals --- one of which keeps crashing --- to check ids against their voter registration lists . "
The Atlanta Journal - Constitution reports on the long lines caused by problems with the new , and largely untested technology ...
Big crowds and slow - moving lines throughout the morning caused DeKalb County election officials to institute a contingency plan they hope will speed the voting process during the lunch and after - work rush .
An extra voter processing station was expected to be set up at each precinct .
Poll workers at the new stations will have to verify addresses the old - fashioned way , â flipping through thick voter roll books instead of computer terminals , said Linda Latimore , the county 's director of registration and elections .
Clare Nicholas Schexnyder of Election Protection , a project of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights , which runs the 1 - 866 - OUR - VOTE hotline for voting problems , tells The BRAD BLOG , " The bottlenecks are occurring at check - in , people not actually being able to get to the voting booths . "
She confirmed that the group has many reports that " computers are crashing " in some polling places .
Schexnyder says that Election Protection has received between 400 and 500 calls today , and reminds us that the evening rush is yet to come .
Approximately 30 % of the calls so far have been to report the long voting lines .
Many callers are indicating frustration that voting machines are standing empty and they just can't get to them .
The longest line so far reported is , ironically enough , at the " Welcome All " polling place at 4255 Will Lee Rd. , where Schexnyder estimates as many as 250 people were in line , with waits of up to two and a half hours .
A news advisory issued today by Election Protection offers further details , including voters who report feeling intimidation by the presence of armed state officials ...( emphasis added )
Welcome All Park : Election Protection
Poll observers were approached by voters concerned about an armed white male officer at the predominantly African American polling place .
The Election Protection poll observers spoke with the man and determined he was a Ga. Secretary of State Elections Investigator .
They informed him the voters felt intimidated by his presence .
Georgia Election Protection contacted the Secretary of State 's office and reported the incident .
The SOS office said they would look into it .
Schexnyder says Election Protection has contacted Fulton County election officials and that they are dispatching more people to try to expedite the process .
A spokesperson at the County declined to answer The BRAD BLOG 's questions about the problems at Welcome All Park , first saying that they would n't know anything about problems at particular polling places because they are in the office and not on the scene .
When pressed about whether or not they 've received complaints about long lines at Welcome All , she said yes , but then added , " We do n't give out information like that . "
The video accompanying the 11 Alive story indicates that the Georgia Secretary of State had received about one hundred calls by 10:30 or 11 this morning , " which is not terribly bad , basically voting machines not working , paper ballots having to be used , that kind of thing . "
Viewers , we suppose , should breathe easy since " all in all , statewide , things seem to be running smoothly , " according to the report .
We 'll remind readers that things " seeming to run smoothly " is not an indication that the vote totals will accurately reflect the votes cast by voters .
Georgia polling places all use Diebold DRE / touchscreen voting machines , which have been found in state after state and study after study to be easily manipulated to produce any voting results desired by anyone with access to them --- be they Diebold employees , election office employees , pollworkers or others .
Here 's a quick sample of what can happen when non-transparent election procedures are used in states like Georgia ( or any , for that matter ) .
Diebold 's Crashing Pollbook System
Diebold , now using the name Premier Election Solutions , is also the vendor for Georgia 's electronic pollbooks , the Diebold ExpressPoll , which the company website claims " streamline the voter verification process . "
Diebold ExpressPoll systems have caused problems in other states in past elections , including Utah and Maryland , as described by Avi Rubin , a Johns Hopkins University computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University and Baltimore County election judge after the same systems melted down in that state during the 2006 primary election :
The electronic poll books presented an even bigger problem , however .
Every so often , about once every 15 - 25 minutes , after a voter signed in , and while that voter 's smartcard was being programmed with the ballot , the poll book would suddenly crash and reboot .
Unfortunately , the smartcard would not be programmed at the end of this , so the poll worker would have to try again .
However , the second time , the machine said that the voter had already voted .
The first few times this happened , we had some very irate voters , and we had to call over the chief judge .
Soon , however , we realized what was happening , and as soon as the poll book crashed , we warned the voter that it would come up saying that they had already voted , but that we knew they had n't .
Then , the chief judge would have to come over , enter a password , and authorize that person to vote anyway .
Then we had to make a log entry of the event and quarantine the offending smartcard .
Unfortunately , the poll books take about 3 minutes to reboot , and the chief judges are very scarce resources , so this caused further delays and caused the long line we had for most of the afternoon and evening while many of the machines were idle .
Another problem was that the poll book would not subtract a voter from its total count when this happened , so every time we had an incident , the poll book voter count was further off the mark .
We had to keep track of this by hand , so we could reconcile it at the end of the day
The presidential election in November 2004 provided a clear example of how long lines at polling places can disenfranchise voters , and how creation of conditions that result in long lines , such as providing a polling place with insufficient equipment , can be a way to target particular communities for disenfranchisement .
The additional requirement that voters present a photo ID to vote is , in and of itself , a method of voter disenfranchisement that disproportionately affects low income voters and voters of color ( read : Democratic - leaning voters ) .
In recent years , such Photo ID laws have been pushed by Republicans in many states , as well as at the federal level , as solutions to the virtually non-existent problem of " voter fraud , " ( not to be confused with the very real concerns of election fraud ) .
Several states , including Georgia , have found such laws , time and again , to be unconstitutional " modern day poll taxes . "
In Georgia , the combination of the new photo ID restrictions and non-transparent , unverifiable electronic voting systems used --- on which it is physically and scientifically impossible to assure that even a single vote is counted as cast --- guarantees only one thing : that Georgia voters have absolutely no basis for confidence in the election results .
Other reports of problems in Georgia today include :
A precinct in the suburban city of Covington , Ga. , opened only to discover the wrong keys â needed to turn them on â had been delivered with its new electronic voting machines , according to The Daily Report Online .
And from the 11 Alive article :
At a polling place in Covington , the first voters who showed up at Prospect United Methodist Church said poll workers had forgotten the keys to the ballot box .
Voters at MLK
Towers had to stand in line for hours to vote on a paper ballot , one person at a time .
That problem has since been fixed , the Secretary of State 's Office reported .
In Henry County , a voter said poll workers at Locust Grove Elementary had the wrong computers and people were leaving without voting .
At Murphy Candler Elementary , dozens of voters showed up to find out they had been reassigned to a new precinct .
The elections office said those voters had been sent notices of the change , but several voters said they did not receive them .
From the Election Protection News Advisory :
Cliftondale School ( Butner Road , in unincorporated Fulton , 30349 ) - 100's of people lined up ; only 1 machine working ; many people left polling place .
[ listed with this update : " RESOLVED .
Lines have shortened . " ]
Murphey Candler Elementary , 6775 S. Goddard Rd. Lithonia , GA - 50 voters turned away from polls .
Being told to go to Flat Rock Elementary .
( 3 - 5 miles away ) Sam Tillman of DeKalb Co. Elections said voters were mailed letters in June 2007 , that precinct would change to address overcrowding issues .
In July , they sent updated voter registration cards .
All but one of the voters said they were not notified of the change .
UPDATE 10:40 pm PT : The following video from the " Welcome All Community " center comes courtesy of VideoThevote and videographer John Fortuin , who report that voters at this precinct " waited two hours and longer , and many had to return to work prior to voting . "
UPDATE 2/6/08 5:15 pm PT : Wired has several audio MP3s of phone calls from Georgia to voter complaint hotlines , documenting the problems and long wait times at various polling places in the state .

Command - line processing and the need for gperf
Command - line processing is historically one of the most ignored areas in software development .
Just about any relatively complicated software has dozens of available command - line options .
In fact , it âs not uncommon to find hundreds of lines of if - else statements coded to process user input , and maintenance of such legacy code becomes a time - consuming affair even for seasoned programmers .
In such circumstances , most C developers commonly go for a rather long ( and often nested ) if - else statement with ANSI C library functions such as strcmp , strcasecmp , and strtok thrown in for good measure , as Listing 1 shows .
Listing 1 . C - style command - line processing
if ( strtok ( cmdstring , " + dumpdirectory " ) ) { // code for printing help messages goes here } else if ( strtok ( cmdstring , " + dumpfile " ) ) { // code for printing version info goes here }
Show more Show more icon
Instead of the ANSI C - based application program interface ( API ) , a C++ developer would probably use strings from the Standard Template Library ( STL ) .
Still , there âs no escaping the nested sequence of if - else statements .
Clearly , this approach is nât scalable as the number of options increases .
For a typical program invocation with N options , the code would end up doing O ( N2 ) comparisons .
To produce code that runs faster and is easy to maintain , it makes far more sense to use a hash table that stores the command - line options , then uses the hash to validate the user - specified input .
This is where gperf comes in .
It generates a hash table from the predetermined list of valid command - line options and a lookup function whose time complexity is O ( 1 ) .
Thus , for a typical program invocation with N options , the code needs only O ( N ) [ N * O ( 1 ) ] comparisons â an order of magnitude improvement over the legacy code .
Gperf usage pattern
Gperf reads in a set of keywords from a user - provided file ( which typically has a .gperf extension , although this is not mandatory ) â for example , commandoptions.gperf â and generates C/C++ sources for the hash table , hashing , and lookup methods .
All code is directed at standard output , which in turn must be redirected to a file , like so :
gperf -L C++ command_line_options.gperf > perfecthash.hpp
Show more

Note :
The -L option tells gperf that the generated code should be in C ++.
Gperf input file format
Listing 2 shows the typical format of a gperf input file .
Listing 2 . Input file format for gperf
%{ /* C code that goes verbatim in output */ %} declarations % % keywords % % functions Show more Show more icon
The format consists of several elements : a C code inclusion , declarations , keywords , and functions .
C code inclusion
The C code inclusion is an optional section enclosed between %{ and %} .
The C code and comments written in this area are copied verbatim into the output file that gperf generates .
( Note the similarities to the GNU flex and bison utilities . )
Declarations
The declarations section is also optional ; you can omit it entirely if you do nât invoke gperf with the -t option .
However , if you do enable this option , the last component in the declaration section must be a structure whose first field must be a char * or const char* identifier called name .
It is possible , however , to override the name of the first field by using the -K option in gperf .
For example , if you want to name this field command_option , make the gperf invocation :
gperf -t -K command_option

Listing 3 shows the C code inclusion and declarations sections .
Listing 3 . C code inclusion and declarations sections
%{ struct CommandOptionCode { enum { HELPVERBOSE = 1 , ... , // more option codes here _64BIT = 5 } ; } ; typedef struct CommandOptionCode CommandOptionCode ; %} struct CommandOption { const char * command_option ; int OptionCode ; } ; %%
Show more
Show more icon
Keywords
The keywords section contains the keywords â in this case , predefined command - line arguments .
Each line in this section that begins with the number sign ( # ) in the first column is a comment .
The keywords should be the first field of each non-comment line ; the string quotes that you typically associate with a char* are optional here .
In addition , fields can follow the leading keyword , and you must separate them with commas and terminate at the end of the line .
These fields have a direct correspondence with the last structure provided in the declarations section , as Listing 4 shows .
Listing 4 .
The keywords section
% % +helpverbose , CommandOptionCode :: HELPVERBOSE
+append_log , CommandOptionCode :: APPEND_LOG
+compile , CommandOptionCode:: COMPILE
Show more Show more icon
C++/STL - style initialization A C++/STL style of initialization would be equivalent to creating an stl : : map and using the insert ( ) method to repeatedly insert it into the map .
In contrast , whoever is responsible for maintaining the code would actually have to debug the code to figure out where exactly the initialization is occurring for every command - line option , which could and typically is all over the place in poorly written code .
Gperf provides a much cleaner interface from that perspective .
The first entry refers to the const char * command_option field of the structure CommandOption , as shown in Listing 3 ; the second entry refers to the int OptionCode field in the same structure .
So , what exactly is happening here ?
This is , in fact , the gperf way of initializing the hash table that will store the command - line options and their associated attributes .
Functions
Functions is another optional section .
All the text in this section starting with % % and , extending to the end of the file , is copied verbatim into the generated file .
Just like the declarations section , it is the user âs responsibility to have valid C/ C++ code in this section .
Gperf output
Gperf hashes a predefined set of keywords , then quickly performs lookups for these same keywords .
In line with this philosophy , gperf outputs two functions : hash ( ) and in_word_set ( ) .
The former is the hashing routine , while the latter is used for lookup .
Gperf output can be in either the C or C++ language â whichever you specify .
If you specify C for the output , two C functions with the above names are generated .
If the output language is C++ , gperf generates a class named Perfect_Hash , which contains these two methods .
Note :
Use the - Z option to change the generated class name .
The prototype for the hashing function is :
unsigned int hash ( const char * str , unsigned int len ) ;
Show more Show more icon
where str represents the command - line option , and len represents its length .
For example , if the command - line argument were +helpverbose , str would be +helpverbose , and len would be 12 .
Within the gperf - generated hash , in_word_set ( ) is the lookup function .
The prototype for the routine depends on the user - specified -t option .
If you have nât specified this option , you âre simply dealing with the user - specific command strings stored as data in the gperf - generated hash rather than the structure associated with the command string .
For example , in Listing 3 , you have the structure CommandOption associated with a user command argument , which is what the in_word_set ( ) routine would return .
You can change the name of this routine using the - N option .
The arguments to the routine are similar to the previously explained hash ( ) function :
const struct CommandOption * in_word_set ( const char * str , unsigned int len ) ;

Common gperf options
Gperf is a highly customizable tool that accepts several options .
The gperf online manual ( see the link in the Resources section below ) describes all the options available in gperf , including :
- L _language - name : Instructs gperf to generate output in the specified programming language .
The following options are currently supported : KR - C :
This old - style K&R C is supported by both old and new C compilers , but the new ANSI C - compliant compilers may generate warnings or , in certain cases , even flag errors .
C : This option generates C code but might not be compiled using some old C compilers without tweaking existing sources .
ANSI -C : This option generates ANSI C - compliant code , which can only be compiled by ANSI C - compliant or C++ compilers .
C++ : This option generates C++ code .
- N : This option allows you to change the name of the lookup function .
The default is in_word_set ( ) .
This option allows you to change the name of the lookup function .
The default is .
- H : This option allows you to change the name of the hashing routine .
The default name is hash ( ) .
This option allows you to change the name of the hashing routine .
The default name is .
- Z : This option is useful when the - L C++ option is provided .
It allows you to specify the name of the generated C++ class that houses the in_word_set ( ) and hash ( ) functions .
The default name is Perfect_Hash .
This option is useful when the C++ option is provided .
It allows you to specify the name of the generated C++ class that houses the and functions .
The default name is .
- G : This option generates the lookup table as a static global variable rather than hiding it by generating it inside the lookup function ( the default behavior ) .
This option generates the lookup table as a static global variable rather than hiding it by generating it inside the lookup function ( the default behavior ) .
- C : Gperf generates lookup tables as discussed earlier .
The - C option creates the lookup tables declared with the const keyword ; the contents of all generated lookup tables then are constant â that is , read - only .
Many compilers can generate more efficient code for this by putting the tables in read - only memory .
Gperf generates lookup tables as discussed earlier .
The option creates the lookup tables declared with the keyword ; the contents of all generated lookup tables then are constant â that is , read - only .
Many compilers can generate more efficient code for this by putting the tables in read - only memory .
- D : This option handles keywords that hash to duplicate values .
This option handles keywords that hash to duplicate values .
-t : This option allows inclusion of a keyword structure .
This option allows inclusion of a keyword structure .
-K :
This function allows the user to select the name of the keyword component in the keyword structure .
This function allows the user to select the name of the keyword component in the keyword structure .
-p :
This option is supported for compatibility with previous releases of gperf .
In earlier versions , it changes the return value of the generated function in_word_set ( ) from its default Boolean value ( that is , 0 or 1 ) to the pointer to wordlist array type .
This was most useful when the -t option , which allowed user - defined structs , was used .
In the latest releases of gperf , this option is not required and can be dropped .
Gperf internals overview
Static search set is an abstract data type with the operations initialize , insert , and retrieve .
Perfect hash functions are time - and space - efficient implementations of static search sets .
Gperf is a perfect hash - function generator that constructs perfect hash functions from a user - supplied list of keywords .
Gperf translates n element list of user - supplied keywords into source code containing k element lookup table and two functions :
hash :
This routine uniquely maps keywords to the range 0 .. k â 1 , where k = n .
If k = n , hash ( ) is considered a minimal perfect hash ( ) function .
Such a hash ( ) function has two properties : perfect property :
Locating a table entry requires O ( 1 ) time â that is , at most , one string comparison is required to perform keyword recognition within the static search set .
minimal property :
The memory allocated to store the keywords is precisely large enough for the keyword set and no larger .
in_word_set : This routine uses hash ( ) to determine whether a particular string belongs to the user - supplied list , using one string comparison in the most common case .
Gperf âs internal implementation centers on two internal data structures : the keyword signatures list ( Key_List ) and the associated values array ( asso_values ) .
Every user - specified keyword and its attributes are read from a user - specified file and stored as a node on a linked list , called Key_List .
Gperf considers only a subset of each keyword âs characters as the key when it searches for a perfect hash ( ) function .
The subset is called the keyword signature , or keysig .
The associated values array is generated inside the hash ( ) function and is indexed using keysig characters .
Gperf repeatedly searches for an associated values configuration that maps all n keysig s onto non-duplicated hash values .
A perfect hash ( ) function is produced when gperf finds a configuration that assigns each keysig to a unique location within the generated lookup table .
The resulting perfect hash ( ) function returns an unsigned int value in the range 0 ..( k - 1 ) , where k is the maximum keyword hash value +1 .
When k = n , a minimal perfect hash ( ) function is produced .
A keyword âs hash value is typically computed by combining the associated values of its keysig with its length .
By default , the hash ( ) function adds the associated value of a keyword âs first index position plus the associated value of its last index position to its length ; for example :
hash_value = length + asso_values [ ( unsigned char ) keyword [ 1 ] ] ;

Sample project
Here âs a small project to illustrate the concepts discussed so far .
Consider the gperf file shown in Listing 5 .
Listing 5 . command_options.gperf
%{ #include " command_options.h " typedef struct CommandOptionCode CommandOptionCode ; %} struct CommandOption { const char * Option ; int OptionCode ; } ; % % +helpverbose , CommandOptionCode : : HELPVERBOSE

The gperf command line looks like this :
gperf -CGD -N IsValidCommandLineOption -K Option - L C++ -t command_line_options.gperf > perfecthash.hpp
Show more
Show more icon
Also generated as part of the perfecthash .hpp file is the hash table .
Because the - G option is specified from the command line , the hash table is generated in global scope .
Because the - C option was used for gperf invocation , the hash table is defined with the const attribute .
Listing 7 shows the details of the generated sources .

All examples in this article have been tested using gperf version 3.0.3 .
If you âre using an earlier version , you might need to use the -p option as part of the command - line invocation .
Conclusion
The gperf utility is tuned to quickly generate a perfect hash for small to medium datasets .
But gperf has other applications , as well .
In fact , it âs the tool of choice of maintaining perfect hashes for language keywords in GNU compilers , and recent advances allow you to work with larger datasets .
So , consider making gperf part of your next development project .

Tonight 's Democratic Presidential debate in Austin was very focused on the issues that the two Democratic nominees had been discussing all along and they were very cordial to one another throughout , really a mild mannered affair until moderator Campbell Brown brought up the issue of plagiarism that popped up earlier this week after one of Senator Barack Obama 's speeches .
The question went to Obama and he answered by saying the notion that he plagiarized the national co-chair of his campaign , who encouraged him to use his words , is silly and that we 're now getting into the silly season in politics .
Senator Clinton responded that if his candidacy is going to be about words , they should at least be his own .
She went on to make a statement that did n't go over well with the audience :
Clinton : " Lifting whole passages from someone else 's speeches is not change you can believe in it 's change you can Xerox . "
She then turned right back into the health care issue .
Obama dropped the topic also and joined her in the most discussed issue of the debate --- health care .
John Amato : I thought they both did quite well tonight outside the line above .
Debating is a very good platform for Hillary and she shined --- especially her closing statement , but so did Barack .
This used to be a weakness for him in my mind , but he 's improved dramatically and is quite comfortable going one on one .
This is the tenth Rejected Mega Man Villains .
It âs been a while since I created the last one .
Believe it or note it was right after ConnectiCon last year .
Which was actually last July .
After attending KatsuCon last weekend and having numerous people asking when I was going to do another one â¦
I decided now was a good time .
Just to make sure you know , I do remember Shadow Man .
Technically , Shadow Man was a ninja .
But since you can actually see Shadow Man , he âs not a very good ninja .
One boss being like another boss is nothing knew .
And having similar gimmicks is very common for Mega Man bosses , as well .
How about Fire Man , Heat Man , Flame Man and Burner Man for starters ?
Now , something else that I have been asked about for while is if I will ever do any Rejected Mega Man Villains merchandise .
Now that I have thirty Rejected Mega Man Villains I think its time for a poster .
I might add a couple new ones to the poster , but it will definitely be the definitive Rejected Mega Man Villains collection .
I âm trying to get an idea of how many people would want one and how much its going to cost .
The poster itself would be a full - size movie poster , but the interest will dictate how many I order and how much they will cost .
So anyone interested in a Rejected Mega Man Villains poster let me know .
I will total up the responses that get an estimate of price for the pre-ordering of the posters ( letting me know you want one is not committing you to anything ) .
Or if there âs too low of a response , I might cancel the project completely .
The power is yours !
[ Edit ] I got a lot of positive responses .
Thanks to everyone that took the time to let me know .
FEBRUARY 21-- The parents of an Ohio boy who was expelled this month for creating a phony MySpace profile that described his middle school 's principal as a child molester have filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the 13 - year - old 's free speech rights have been violated by education officials .
Toader and Marianna Osan claim that their son ( who is identified only by his initials in U.S. District Court filings ) was improperly booted from the eighth grade at Hillside Middle School in Parma after educators learned of the boy 's creation of a MySpace page for principal Jeff Cook .
The MySpace profile , which was headlined ' Your Princeypal , ' did not carry Cook 's name , but it included his photo and identified him as the Hillside Middle School principal .
The since - removed profile , an excerpt of which you 'll find here , listed Cook 's general interests as ' giving students anal ' and ' jacking off in my office , ' and named his heroes as Michael Jackson , Adolph Hitler , and Saddam Hussein .
For his vulgar online handiwork , ' R.O. ' was first suspended , and then , on February 7 , was informed that he was being expelled ( for ' malicious harassment ' ) until June 10 , effectively the end of the school year , according to a February 20 court filing .
His parents argue that students ' disrespecting teachers outside of school is an age - old tradition , and one from which teachers neither need nor deserve protection ...
It would be naive to think that even the most popular principal is not the subject of student ridicule and parody . '
The Osans are seeking their son's immediate return to school and a judicial order protecting his off - campus speech , which previously included the observation that Cook had an affinity for the Purple Penetrator , a sex toy .

There are tons of games that are coming out in 2017 .
Some are going to be new games and others will be a continuation of ... by Mark Walters
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The attempt by the U.S. Navy to use an anti-missile missile to shoot down a potentially hazardous satellite will cost between $ 40 million and $ 60 million , Pentagon officials told CNN on Friday .
A missile is launched from the Navy guided missile cruiser USS Shiloh during a 2006 test .
The missile alone costs almost $ 10 million , Lt. Gen. Carter Ham said at a Pentagon briefing .
He declined to give an overall cost estimate .
" I think we 're working with all the parties to [ find ] how much did it cost to modify the missiles , the fire control , that kind of business , " he said .
Pentagon officials argue the effort is worth the expense because of the slim -- but real -- chance that the satellite 's unused fuel , 1,000 pounds of toxic hydrazine , could land in a populated area .
Because the super - secret spy satellite malfunctioned immediately after launch in December 2006 , its fuel tank is full , and it would probably survive re-entry and disperse harmful , even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields .
The missile will carry no warhead ; the objective is to break the satellite apart through the force of impact alone , defense officials said .
Learn more about the mission Â»
One Pentagon official -- who spoke on condition of anonymity because the planning for the operation remains classified -- told CNN that since early January , a Navy team , including 200 industry experts and scientists , has been working furiously to modify its sea- based Aegis missile defense system so it can shoot down a satellite in low orbit .
Do n't Miss U.S. to shoot down errant satellite
U.S. to shoot down errant satellite More on satellite , missile that will shoot it down
Among the challenges is modifying sensors designed to detect the heat from an incoming warhead so they can spot the much - cooler satellite , which has no heat source and is warmed only by the sun 's rays .
In addition , the official says , a floating X - band radar has to be modified to track the satellite 's trajectory , and the " fire - control " systems on the Navy ships also needed modification .
No attempt will be made to shoot down the satellite until after the U.S. space shuttle lands next Wednesday .
" The window will open when the shuttle is on the ground , " Ham said .
Pentagon officials say three missiles have been modified for the mission , so in theory , the Navy may get three shots at the satellite , although only one at a time .
" They want the period of a day or two to assess the effect of the first missile ... to probably get an orbit or two , to get an understanding of what effect the first intercept had on the satellite before launching another interceptor , " Ham said .
The Aegis cruiser USS Lake Erie was chosen for the mission .
It 's fully equipped with sea - based missile defense systems , has long been the Navy 's primary ship for the sea - based missile defense program and has the technology needed for the operation , officials said .
It will be accompanied by two destroyers --- the USS Decatur and the USS Russell -- at an undisclosed location in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator .
The Decatur will feed trajectory information to the Erie , and the Russell will back up the Decatur .
Defense officials say the ships ' radars and software were modified to track targets much faster than the ballistic missiles they were designed to track .
A host of ground - based radars , telescopes and sea - based radars will help determine if the satellite was hit .
The Air Force also will have a plane in the air that can detect the release of hydrazine gas .
The USNS Observation Island , a ship that uses telemetry to monitor objects in space , will collect information on the satellite both before and after the missile launch .
The Navy will use its $ 9.5 million Standard Missile 3 in the shoot - down .
The combined speed of the missile and satellite at impact is expected to be about 22,000 miles per hour .
The government started thinking about how to approach the satellite problem in December .
And on January 4 , President Bush and various senior officials agreed to begin planning for the shoot - down .
On Tuesday , the president approved the plan .

MANY people have enjoyed the fruits of someone else 's undeclared labour , whether buying a cheap DVD from a street - seller or paying the gardener in cash .
In a poll of the EU 's 27 member countries , Denmark and the Netherlands are the ( self - confessed ) biggest users of the underground economy .
In both countries 27 % of respondents said they had acquired goods or services in the past year which they thought involved undeclared work .
Less than 10 % of people in Germany and Britain admitted acquiring something on the sly , below the EU average of 11 % .
Cypriots are the most law - abiding .

Many have protested in Serbia at Kosovo 's declaration
Street protests
He also said recognition of Kosovo by some EU members would jeopardise Serbia 's path to EU membership .
His remarks came as Nato troops reopened Kosovo 's northern borders , closed after the demolition of two border posts by Serbian protesters .
Correspondents say the situation at the border is currently calm but tense .
Does anyone in this room think that the Kosovo Albanians are the only group in the world with a grievance against their capital ?
Vuk Jeremic
Serbian foreign minister
World split over Kosovo
Nato peacekeepers reopened the two demolished border checkpoints on Wednesday .
Crowds of demonstrators had used bulldozers and explosives on Tuesday to demolish the border posts at Jarinje and Brnjak , and peacekeepers were called in to restore order .
Nato commander Xavier Bout de Marnhac was quoted as blaming local Serbian leaders for the trouble .
Students in the Serb - dominated town of Mitrovica are organising daily protests at 12.44 pm , referring to UN Security Council resolution 1244 under which Serbia insists it still has sovereignty of Kosovo under international law .
' Relations compromised '
Mr Jeremic said Kosovo 's declaration of independence was illegal and illegitimate , adding that Serbia would fight tooth and nail to have it overturned .
KOSOVO PROFILE
Population about two million Majority ethnic Albanian ; 10 % Serb Under UN control since Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999 2,000 - strong EU staff to take over from UN after independence Nato to stay to provide security
EU fired up by Kosovo Anger mounts in Mitrovica Full text : Kosovo declaration
Speaking at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg , he said those who had recognised Kosovo had set a dangerous precedent .
" By the actions of some European member - states , every would - be ethnic or religious separatist across Europe and around the world has been provided with a tool kit on how to achieve recognition , " he said .
" Does anyone in this room think that the Kosovo Albanians are the only group in the world with a grievance against their capital ? "
Some Russian officials have hinted that Moscow could recognise the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in response to the Kosovan declaration .
Mr Jeremic also said Serbia 's path to full EU membership had been damaged by the recognition of Kosovo by more than half the EU 's member countries .
" The relations between Serbia and certain members of the European Union have been compromised and I do n't see how we can accelerate our efforts towards Europe , " he said .
Many - though not all - EU states have argued that Kosovo is a unique case - that Serbia lost its right to govern there because of the brutal repression of the Albanian majority .
UN divided
Earlier EU special envoy Pieter Feith began his work in Pristina as the head of the international civilian office due to take over from the UN .
STANCE ON RECOGNITION For : Norway , Denmark , Finland , Sweden , Germany , Italy , France , UK , Austria , US , Turkey , Albania , Afghanistan Against : Russia , Spain , Romania , Slovakia , Cyprus

He insisted that a 2,000 - strong EU police and justice mission would be deployed throughout Kosovo despite Serb hostility .
But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the mission was " in breach of the highest international law " .
In a separate development , the German cabinet agreed formally to recognise Kosovo 's independence .
Norway also announced its intention to accept Kosovo as an independent state .
But Serbia responded by recalling its ambassadors to Germany and Austria , another country that has recognised Kosovo .
Britain , France , and Italy were among the first to come out in favour of Kosovo 's independence but other EU countries are opposed .
The UN Security Council is divided over how to respond to Kosovo 's move , and it has failed to agree on any action .
Serbian security forces were driven out of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign aimed at halting the violent repression of ethnic Albanian separatists .
The province has been under UN administration and Nato protection since then .

It 's OK , we can all stop worrying about the state of the financial markets and the global economy now .
We 've found the culprit .
The recent carnage in the markets was all down to one man .
No , not Alan Greenspan , but Jerome Kerviel , a trader at French bank Societe Generale .
The short version is that Mr Kerviel managed to circumvent the bank 's risk management systems , placing huge unauthorised bets on which direction markets would move in .
He was discovered at the weekend , and the bank had to unwind the bets .
Of course , when SocGen started to unwind these bets on Monday , all that activity panicked the markets , sending them to the depths we saw in the last few days .
In the process , SocGen lost Â£ 3.7 bn the biggest " rogue trader " loss ever seen .
It 's an appealing idea .
Now the markets have caught the wrong - doer , we can get back to business as usual .
But it 's also a complete fiction
More than a few commentators are trying to push the idea that the recent market chaos was all down to bets made by the rogue trader ' at Societe Generale being unwound .
Where will the next rogue trader be found ?
Now I 'm not saying it did n't have an impact .
After all , as Edward Hadas points out on Breakingviews , " the bank must have sold something like 50bn euros worth of shares , the value of long positions required to lose [ Â£ 3.7 bn ] in the first few weeks of 2008 " .
But sadly , the theory that he was the sole cause of the market collapse does n't stand up to scrutiny .
Monday 's market collapse began in Asia , where stocks sold off drastically overnight , before SocGen began its great sell - off .
So while the idea that the Fed panicked and slashed interest rates solely because of the actions of a French Nick Leeson is quite amusing , it 's also somewhat exaggerated .
However , the story does flag up yet another reason for investors to be worried about what 's lurking behind the faade of the recent boom times .
Many wise investors have pointed out in the past , that fraud which goes unnoticed during the good times , rapidly becomes obvious when things start to turn bad .
As Warren Buffett puts it , it 's not until the tide goes out that you see who 's been swimming without any trunks on .
So one obvious concern is that if this chap could get away with it , who else is getting away with similar scams ?
It also shows just how much damage derivatives can do .
Mr Buffett once called them " weapons of mass financial destruction " and SocGen , having been pushed into a multi-billion euro emergency rights issue , would have to agree with him .
These bets were n't even terribly complicated .
They were straightforward bets on the market rising or falling .
Nothing to do with sub - prime or mortgage - backed securities or any of the other buzzwords of 2007 .
In other words , not where we'd have been expecting the occasions of mass fraud to crop up .
How you and I end up paying for banks ' mistakes
In many ways , SocGen and by extension , the financial system was lucky that Mr Kerviel slipped up when he did , or things could have become far worse .
As Patrick Hoskings points out in The Times , having racked up billions in losses already , there 's no reason he could n't have racked up billions more .
Instead of an emergency rights issue , SocGen could have been looking at outright bankruptcy .
And if that had happened , we 'd all have had to pay for it .
As Hoskings says , some banks are deemed " too big to be allowed to fail Governments would undoubtedly be obliged to bail out any major bank in trouble .
The squillions of dollars of bets placed every day in the wholesale money markets by such banks are underwritten by taxpayers . "
If you 're in any doubt about that , just look at the panic our own government got into over Northern Rock .
The Rock is a pretty unimportant bank even within Britain , let alone on a global scale .
Yet it was deemed too big to fail and has now caused untold damage to an already ugly - looking public sector balance sheet .
If nothing else , the first few weeks of 2008 have proved that we are in for a rough ride .

Deaf beauty queen was text - messaging when hit by train By Elizabeth Yuan
CNN
Tara Rose McAvoy was named Miss Deaf Texas in June 2005 .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Austin ( Texas ) Texas Union Pacific Corporation Massachusetts or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
Deaf beauty contest winner Tara McAvoy was walking along the railroad tracks from her Austin , Texas , home to her mother 's workplace , text - messaging family and friends , when a train struck her and killed her , according to the Austin Police Department .
A Massachusetts - born Texan , who liked to quote " Do n't mess with Texas , " the 18 - year - old was going to represent the Lone Star State at the Miss Deaf America Pageant in Palm Desert , California , this July .
It was one of many pageants McAvoy had entered , " both in the hearing community and in the deaf community , " said Claire Bugen , superintendent of the Texas School for the Deaf , on Wednesday .
McAvoy was a 2005 graduate of the school , where she played sports and acted in theater .
" She was a beautiful , bright , young deaf woman , " said Bugen .
The Austin Police Department received a 911 call from Union - Pacific , which owns the train , at 2:18 p.m. Monday , said Laura Albrecht , spokesperson for the Austin Police Department .
( Watch as witnesses describe accident -- 1:33 ) " Our understanding is that she text - messaged the family , and yes , the family members were going to pick her up , " Albrecht added .
McAvoy was walking northbound along the railroad ties , with her back to the train as it approached , said Austin Police Department detective David Fugitt .
" We have information that she was text - messaging family and friends " at the time , he added .
A horn sounded , but " they were n't able to get a response " from her , Fugitt said .
" At that point , they activated their emergency braking system , but they were n't able to stop in time . "
A snowplow -- commonly referred to as " cattle - guards " for pushing items away from the tracks to avoid train damage -- was what struck McAvoy , who was estimated to be " no more than a foot " from the tracks , Fugitt said .
" The snowplow extends approximately 16 inches on each side from the train , " he said , and was mounted to the front engine of the train .
McAvoy died at the scene from " multiple traumatic injuries , " Fugitt said .
Fugitt said there were witnesses who had heard the horn sound and that the police department was actively seeking anyone who had seen the accident occur .
An investigation is under way with Union Pacific and the Travis County Medical Examiner 's Office , Fugitt said .
He said the Austin Police Department was awaiting information from Union Pacific on how fast the train , with its 24 cars and two engines , was going .
McAvoy 's funeral is set for Saturday morning in Austin .
In addition to her schooling at the Texas School for the Deaf , McAvoy briefly attended the Model Secondary School for the Deaf , which is affiliated with Gallaudet University , in Washington .
A profile on its Web site said McAvoy was class president , a cheerleader , on the prom committee and played basketball .
" She will be sorely missed , " said Laura Loeb - Hill , director of the Miss Deaf Texas Pageant , in an e-mail Wednesday .
" Tara represented Texas with dignity and pride . "

The author of this piece requested that we identify her only as â Ann . â
Ã¢â¬ ÅThe main objective of the medic was to get the wounded away from the front lines .
Many times this involved the medic climbing out from the protection of his foxhole during shelling or into no - manÃ¢â¬â¢s - land to help a fallen comrade.Ã¢â¬ Â
Determined to escape the life of a South Texas dirt farmer , he had taken a job at a petroleum refinery and married by the time he was drafted in 1941 .
In his wedding photo he bears a noticeable resemblance to Mickey Rooney , minus the cocky leer , and his farm girl bride leans into the frame to disguise how much taller she is .
At the age of 20 , he became the third of four brothers to serve in WWII .
For reasons of personal belief , he could not carry a weapon ; for reasons of personal belief , it was impossible for him to refuse to serve .
He became a medic , an aid man , armed with sulfa , morphine and bandages .
He was about five foot five , stocky and square like his farmer father , and he could hoist an oil barrel or a wounded boy with astonishing ease .
Ã¢â¬ ÅOnce with the wounded soldier , the medic would do a brief examination , evaluate the wound , apply a tourniquet if necessary , sometimes inject a vial of morphine , clean up the wound as best as possible and sprinkle sulfa powder on the wound followed by a bandage.Ã¢â¬ Â
He never spoke about his duties during combat .
He was wounded repeatedly , once returning to Texas long enough to father his first daughter , but he did not mention these incidents in letters to his wife .
She discovered the Purple Hearts in his bag when he came home for good .
Ã¢â¬ ÅThen he would drag or carry the patient out of harms way and to the rear .
This was many times done under enemy fire or artillery shelling .Ã¢â¬ Â
Under artillery fire , lack of height became a natural advantage .
He once described to his second daughter the sound that corpses make when stepped on , the hiss of escaping gas , and the difficulty of keeping his footing among the bodies while carrying a wounded soldier .
She did not question him about the war again .
Ã¢â¬ ÅIn most cases , the Germans respected the Red Cross armband.Ã¢â¬ Â
Landmines did not .
The only exploit his family ever heard described in detail was the one that finally sent him home .
When his best friend , another medic , triggered the land mine , he was knocked unconscious .
He woke up under fire in no - manÃ¢â¬â¢s - land among the scattered remains of his companion , missing part of his own left foot .
He tied a tourniquet .
He injected himself with morphine .
He waited most of a day before another medic could reach him .
The Army at last sent him home ; he acquired another medal , but the VA would not pay for the shoe inserts he would need for the rest of his life .
In the next forty years , he built a house at night , worked during the day , raised four daughters , went to church when he couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t get overtime , rose to plant supervisor , retired from the refinery and opened a small grocery store , where his grandchildren would read comic books and play with cigar boxes .
At night he would do his books , watch Mexican boxing , play with the latest baby .
In the next forty years , he also experienced most of the ineffectual psychiatric remedies available for what was likely post - traumatic stress disorder , compounded by a family history of depression and anxiety .
His symptoms , when acute , were called breakdowns .
He refused psychoanalysis ; he could not afford it and did not have the time .
In the fifties he underwent repeated electroshock treatments ; in the sixties he stopped taking the VAÃ¢â¬â¢s prescribed tranquilizers because the side effects made him dangerously clumsy at the refinery .
In the early seventies another unexplained incident precipitated his retirement and a hasty move to another town .
His daughters were unaware of most of these episodes .
In the nineteen eighties , after four decades of silence and pain , he stopped fighting .
Admitted to the local VA hospital , he lingered in a haze of fear and confusion for months until he died .
His second and third daughters , after fighting to examine his medical records , came to believe that he had hoarded his medication and overdosed when he had enough .
He would have known how much was necessary .

New York , NY â United for Peace and Justice , the country âs largest anti-war coalition with over 1400 member groups , condemns President Bush âs continued arrogant and unconstitutional use of signing statements .
On Monday , Jan. 25 , 2008 , President Bush released a signing statement claiming the right to violate four sections of H.R. 4986 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 , which he had just signed into law .
These four sections : 841 , 846 , 1079 , and 1222 , Bush announced , would be â construed â in a manner â consistent with the constitutional authority of the President . â
Among the measures Bush âs latest signing statement declares the right to violate are : the establishment of a commission to investigate U.S. contractor fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan , the expansion of whistleblower protections , a requirement that U.S. intelligence agencies respond to congressional requests for documents , a ban on funding permanent bases in Iraq , and a ban on funding any actions that exercise U.S. control over Iraq âs oil money .
Over the past seven years , the same language used by Bush on Monday , usually attributed to Vice President Cheney âs Chief of Staff David Addington , has been the precursor to numerous violations of law by his administration , including sections of law banning the use of torture and banning the use of funds to construct permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq .
The president has signed laws blocking funding for the construction of permanent bases in Iraq six times , but never stopped the construction .
In January 2007 , the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on Bush âs use of signing statements at which Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Elwood claimed that the president is free to violate any laws until the Supreme Court rules otherwise .
Following this hearing , the Government Accountability Office studied a small sample of Bush âs signing statements and found that in a significant percentage of cases his administration was , in fact , violating the sections of law he had claimed the right to â interpret . â
The U.S. Constitution requires that the president â take care that the laws be faithfully executed . â
Article I , Section 7 , says that :
â every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it become a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it .
If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a law . â
â The rule of law established by the Constitution has been undermind in an almost unnoticed revolution , â said Leslie Cagan , National Coordinator of United for Peace and Justice ( UFPJ ) .
â The Constitution allows the president to veto bills or sign and enforce them , not to rewrite them or to disobey them .
The same document that gives the Congress the power to make every law , gives it the sole power to raise and spend money , and the sole power to declare war .
The people âs representatives in Congress are losing all of these powers through their failure to act on the remedy provided for precisely this situation : impeachment . â
According to the U.S. State Department , 65 % of Iraqis favor a withdrawal of U.S. troops .
In fact , neither the Iraqi people nor the people of this country have ever supported a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq , and the U.S. Congress has never approved one .
â The sooner all the troops and military contractors are home , â said Cagan , â the sooner rebuilding can begin for the Iraqi nation and for our democracy . â
UFPJ is urging its members to speak with the media about this matter and to phone the House Judiciary Committee at 202-225-3951 to request that it begin impeachment hearings .

Â· 25 % now strongly against their use , says ICM survey Â· Majority concerned about sharing of personal details
The number of people strongly opposed to the introduction of a national identity card scheme has risen sharply , according to the results of an ICM poll to be published today .
Those campaigning against ID cards said last night that the poll , with results showing that 25 % of the public are deeply opposed to the idea , raises the prospect that the potential number of those likely to refuse to register for the card has risen .
If the poll 's findings were reflected in the wider population , as many as 10 million people may be expected to refuse to comply .
The ICM survey also shows that a majority of the British people say they are " uncomfortable " with the idea that personal data provided to the government for one purpose should be shared between all Whitehall - run public services .
The poll , commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust , shows that British public opinion is deeply split over the introduction of identity cards , with 50 % against the idea and 47 % in favour .
Recent disputes over the further delays to have hit the project have strengthened opposition to the scheme , with those who think it is " a very bad " idea rising from 17 % last September to 25 % now .
This compares with only 12 % who think that pressing ahead with ID cards , which will cost around Â£ 93 per person when combined with a passport , is a " very good idea " .
In the aftermath of the government 's recent embarrassing losses of confidential personal data , public opinion appears to have turned sharply against the idea of sharing information within Whitehall and the creeping introduction of the " Big Brother " state .
A majority - 52 % - say they feel uncomfortable with allowing " personal information that is provided to one government department to be shared between all government departments that provide public services " .
However , the poll does show that clear support exists among the public for setting up a central identity register and collecting personal travel details on everyone coming in and out of Britain .
It also reveals some support for the creation of a separate database about every child , including details about their parents and carers .
Phil Booth , of the No2id campaign , said : " With a quarter of the country deeply opposed to ID cards , and a clear majority reluctant to have their personal information shared even for public services , the government needs to fundamentally rethink its database state .
" These figures suggest that millions will simply refuse to comply . "
He said the results showed that between 10 million and 15 million could refuse to register for the card .
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said that public opinion was moving sharply away from the government 's ID card scheme as more people understood how intrusive it was going to be , and the more they saw that officials were unable to keep confidential and personal data secure .
Huhne said : " These polling figures are a body - blow to the government 's hopes of introducing ID cards and the associated personal database , as they suggest a large pool of people who may refuse to cooperate . "
Leaked Home
Office documents suggested last month that the planned large - scale voluntary rollout of national identity cards for British nationals had been delayed by two years until beyond the next general election .
The first ID cards will be introduced in December this year for foreign nationals resident in the country .
It will follow a pilot scheme to be run in London from April to test the technology .
The prime minister , Gordon Brown , has confirmed that legislation will have to be introduced before it becomes compulsory for British nationals to register for the ID cards scheme .

Because CNN Asked
CNN.com âs lead story at the moment is demanding to know how I would talk to my child about Jamie Lynn Spears â pregnancy .
This is how : I raced down the stairs , confronted my child as she was consuming a bagel dog , and uttered the following words :
â Youngân !
That there Jamie Lynn Spears from Zoey 101 done got herself all pregnified ! â
To which Athena responded with the following look :
And then went back to having her dinner .
Because you know what ?
She does nât care .
And you know why ?
It âs not her business .
Funny that my eight - year - old is so clear on this when CNN , presumably jam - packed with adults , is not .
If you really feel the need to talk to your children about Jamie Lynn Spears â pregnancy , here âs a simple test :
Are you or they a member of Miss Spears â immediate family ?
If the answer is no , please talk to your children about something else .
Possibly something actually pertaining to them .
I âm sure they would nât mind that refreshing change .
It âs just a thought .
The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Unstoppable Bathroom Reader book .
We all have fantasies of getting even with people who annoy us ... but we seldom actually go through with them .
Here are some examples of what could happen if we did .
REVENGE OF THE PHONE CLERK Background :
In early 2002 , New Zealander James Storrie called New Zealand Telecom Corporation to complain that his cell phone had been disconnected .
When the representative informed him that the phone had been reported stolen , Storrie insisted that he still had the phone and that he had not reported its theft .
The mistake was cleared up , but the representative ( identity unknown ) was apparently offended by Storrie 's attitude .
Revenge Gone Wild !
When Storrie received his next phone bill , he found that he'd been charged an extra $ 140 .
What for ?
The explanation was printed right on the bill : " penalty for being an arrogant bastard . "
N.Z. Telecom apologized profusely , offered Storrie some undisclosed financial compensation , and promised to investigate the vengeful billing .
REVENGE OF THE BAD WAITER Background : One evening in June 2003 , Wayne and Darlene Keller of Corona , California , took their two children to a Sizzler 's restaurant .
Mrs. Keller requested vegetables with her dinner , instead of potatoes .
According to the family , the waiter , Jonathan Voeltner , rudely told her that she had to choose between French fries or baked potato .
" When I told him my wife can't eat potatoes , " Said Mr. Keller , " he brought back a really small salad , practically threw it at her , and told her to go get the dressing herself . "
After the meal , the Kellers left - and they did n't leave a tip .
Revenge Gone Wild !
Voeltner had his girlfriend follow the Kellers home to get their address .
When he got off work , he , his girlfriend , and his brother went to the Keller home , waited until 1 a.m. , and then doused their house , yard , and mailbox with a gallon of maple syrup , smashed eggs , toilet paper , duct tape , and plastic wrap .
They might have gotten away with it , but in a state of heightened stupidity , Voeltner rang the doorbell .
Then he hid in the bushes and waited to see their reaction .
Their reaction :
They called the police .
Officers found Voeltner in the bushes and his co-conspirators in a nearby car .
When they presented the suspects to the Kellers , Mrs. Keller said , " Oh my God !
It 's the waiter from the restaurant ! "
They were all charged with vandalism , with Voeltner receiving an extra charge of child endangerment because his girlfriend was a minor .
He was also fired by Sizzler's .
" The company does n't allow this sort of thing , " the manager said .

Revenge Gone Wild !
The next day , Beal showed up at the post office carrying two five - gallon buckets full of worms , grubs , and porcupine poop .
He proceeded to splatter several of his former co-workers with the putrid concoction , completely saturating two of them .
He was on his way to his car for another bucket when police arrived .
For his bizarre act of revenge , he was charged with four counts of assaulting a federal worker .
" I let my anger sort of overrule my judgments , " Beal told the court .
He was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison .

White was upset that Jehovah 's Witness had come to her house once a month , every month , for 12 years .
At first , she politely told them that she was n't interested .
Finally , after a visit on a Saturday in January 2002 , she had had enough .
Revenge Gone Wild !
White went to the group 's local Kingdom Hall in Peacehaven , England , the following morning , carefully timing her visit for the middle of the Sunday service .
She banged on the door loudly , again and again , until someone answered , and then proceeded to offer members of the congregation religious literature that she had brought along .
" I tried to hand out free magazines just like the Jehovah 's Witness hand out , " she said .
" Nobody seemed to want them though . "
She continued her " mission " for 30 minutes until the police showed up and asked her to leave .
( Photo : creepysleepy [ Flickr ] ) REVENGE OF THE SPAM HATERS Background : In November 2002 , Detroit Free Press columnist Mike Wendland wrote a story about a man named Alan Ralsky .
Ralsky had become a multimillionaire through marketing spam on the Internet .
How much spam ?
His company sent up to 250 million e-mails a day .
The story told readers about Ralsky 's new 8,000 - square - foot , $ 740,000 home .
The spammer bragged that one entire wing of the house was paid for by a single weight - loss e-mail .
Revenge Gone Wild !
A group of spam haters decided to give Ralsky a dose of his own medicine .
They posted his home address on hundreds of websites , and Ralsky started getting tons - literally - of junk mail .
Then they posted his e-mail address and his phone number , and the mega - junkmailer got inundated with the very thing he had made his millions from - spam .
And , no surprise :
He was annoyed !
Ralsky later complained , " They 've signed me up for every advertising campaign and mailing list there is .
These people are out of their minds !
They 're harassing me ! " ( Photo : The Detroit News )
Harvard Divinity School has long prided itself on the diversity of its curriculum - it currently features classes in American Buddhism , Jewish Apocalypticism , and Classical Sufism - but it took until this semester for the venerable school to offer a course on one of the fastest - growing faiths in the world : Mormonism .
The decision by Harvard to add " Mormonism and the American Experience " reflects what appears to be an uptick of interest in Mormonism in higher education nationally .
Two non-Mormon universities , Claremont Graduate University in California and Utah State University , have established the first endowed chairs in Mormon studies , and the University of Wyoming is considering taking a similar step .
The American Academy of Religion , which is the largest association of religion scholars worldwide , has established a new group for specialists in Mormon studies .
There are more presses publishing academic works about Mormonism , more academic conferences on the religion , and more non-Mormon scholars studying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , as Mormonism is formally known .
" The interest is growing in Mormon studies generally , and it 's becoming something that other religious studies scholars have to take account of and pay greater attention to , " said Melissa Proctor , a visiting lecturer teaching the new class at Harvard .
" Some people believe we have entered a golden age of sorts in Mormon studies , " said Proctor , who grew up in the church and is working on a book about contemporary Mormon women .
Proctor noted that the future of Mormon studies at Harvard is unclear , and the dean of Harvard 's divinity school , William A. Graham , said Proctor 's willingness to teach about Mormonism was a plus , but that she was primarily invited to teach this year because of her expertise in other areas .
She also teaches courses on ethics and gender .
" Mormonism does pop up occasionally in the Harvard curriculum , but usually as a part of American religious history courses rather than as a special topic for an entire course , " Graham said by e-mail .
" With so many major traditions of human religious history and life to try to cover , higher priorities usually come ahead of Mormonism , namely traditions such as Shinto or Confucian or Taoist traditions , for which we currently have no specialists on our faculty . "
Whether or not Harvard continues to offer the class , scholars say a rising academic interest in Mormonism at universities nationally parallels the increasing visibility of Mormonism in American popular and political culture .
Most recently , the unsuccessful campaign of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for the presidency brought renewed attention to the prevalence of negative attitudes toward Mormonism held by many Americans , but the faith has also been increasingly depicted , often critically , on stage and screen , ranging from Tony Kushner 's Pulitzer Prize - winning drama " Angels in America " to the HBO series " Big Love " and last year 's PBS documentary " The Mormons .

So you âre going to write an iPhone app â¦
Welcome !
Many people arrive at this page while searching for information about developing iPhone applications .
The ideas from this article are expanded upon in my book , iPhone App Development : The Missing Manual .
As we âre all waiting with bated breath for the release of the iPhone SDK later this month , now would be a good time to pass along some of things I learned while working on MobileTwitterrific .
Read this now and you âll save yourself some headaches when diving into the SDK .
Code reuse
Do nât expect to reuse much of your existing code .
If you âre using a standard MVC design ( which is pretty much inescapable if you âre using Cocoa ) then about 2/3rds of the application will require major rework .
From my experience , your models and the infrastructure that support them can be reused without much effort .
On the other hand , the multi - touch interface obviates the need for your existing views and controllers .
As an example , the code I use in Twitterrific to download the data from Twitter using NSURLConnection , parse the XML into an NSDictionary and store it in a sorted NSArray was largely copied without change from the desktop application .
The controller and view code was all new .
Memory usage
There are some very tight limits on memory usage .
You âre given approximately 64 MB of space to work with ( about half of what âs available . )
If you go beyond that , Springboard shuts you down unceremoniously .
That combined with the fact that there is nât any swap space where unused objects can go to rest , makes for some design decisions that you have nât had to consider in the desktop environment .
For example , let âs explore how I manage the scrolling list of tweets in MobileTwitterrific .
In the desktop version , each tweet in the list is an NSView , while on the phone each tweet is a UIView .
The big difference is when these views are instantiated and freed .
On the desktop app , views are created whenever there âs a new tweet and they occupy space in memory until removed from the list .
The views do nât have a very large footprint and the supporting infrastructure ( NSTableView ) works much more smoothly with real objects ( rather than some sort of proxy . )
The iPhone , on the other hand , uses a UITableView .
This subclass of UIView has delegate methods that ask for a view to display for each row in the table .
Of course , you could instantiate a complete list of views and just use the row index to pull the view out of an NSArray .
But think about this delegate design pattern a bit : it âs there so you have a chance to instantiate views when they are actually needed .
If you have 2,000 names in your contact list , and are only displaying 8 at a time , why do you need to have 1992 views wasting memory ?
Basically , you âll find yourself being as lazy as possible when it comes to object allocation , and being as ruthless as possible when it comes to freeing those same objects .
NIB-less
Try to imagine developing a Cocoa application without Interface Builder .
Try really hard .
Really , really hard .
Seems like a nightmare , huh ?
Guess what ?
This nightmare will become a reality as soon as you start building your iPhone application .
There are no NIBs .
None .
I do nât think this is one of those â let âs skip it for version 1.0 â design decisions .
The process of unarchiving the objects in the NIB takes CPU cycles and memory : both things that are in limited supply on the phone .
And , as I stated above , you âll find yourself creating and destroying views much more frequently than you do in your desktop application .
( And anyone who has tried to deallocate objects from a NIB knows that âs not so easy . )
Creating views , placing controls as subviews using NSRects , and then setting a bunch of properties is nât the most glamorous coding in the world , but it âs the price you pay to run on a mobile device .
Just be very happy you âre working in Objective - C and not some other crappy language , OK ?
Another thing that us Cocoa developers have gotten spoiled with : bindings .
You âll find that all the normal KVC and KVO infrastructure is present , but it saves much less time when you have to establish all the bindings manually with code .
If you âre like me , you âll end up just targeting controls at methods and be done with it .
Complexity
The good news is that the user interface is much less complex .
The bad news is that the user interface is much less complex .
If you have a rich desktop application with hundreds of features , you âll find that it âs hard to pick what you absolutely need .
Culling features is nât easy , but it âs absolutely necessary .
One mental exercise that I âve found useful is to ask myself â Will I need this feature while walking down the street or sitting in traffic ? â
Both are situations where there are significant distractions to the task at hand .
Does the feature make it easier to interact ?
Luckily , not having NIBs and bindings gives you some motivation to get rid of unnecessary complexity .
When it âs not easy to add that view with hundreds of controls , you âll think twice .
Look and feel
Do nât think that your desktop and mobile application will share any look and feel .
There may be slight resemblances with regard to branding , but that âs about it .
Does Safari look like MobileSafari ?
Sure it has the same icon , but â¦
While I was developing the look and feel of the MobileTwitterrific application , there were two areas which were problematic : display contrast and button placement .
Being able to read the display in all kinds of lighting conditions means you âre going to need high contrast .
In your office environment , it may seem a bit garish to have a lot of dark elements on light backgrounds ( or vice versa ) , but once you actually try to use these elements in the â real world â it makes complete sense .
This â real world â usage also makes you think about where to place controls .
In one case , I placed two buttons too close to one another and found that when I used one hand to drive the UI , my thumb would often hit the wrong control by accident .
When I was doing development in my office with the phone on my desk , I used two hands to control the UI and did nât see this problem .
It âs likely that there will be a simulator in the iPhone SDK .
Do nât believe for a second that you âll be able to use this simulated device for all your development and testing .
You have to literally live with the application .
That âs all for now .
Let âs go back to waiting impatiently .

Some say Dennis Kucinich is a little off - kilter ( enter UFO joke here ) , and his most recent idea does seem pretty out there .
But is it really ?
Turns out the campaign âs multimedia director , Chad Ely , is also an inventor and is assisting the camp in rolling out veggie - oil - cooled computers to every office .
The entire processing system is submerged in oil , which keeps it cool and decreases the energy used to run it .
It âs also economical and dead quiet ( you know , because it does nât have all those fans ) .
The prototype pictured above , which has been going strong for eight months , lives in a fish tank , although Ely claims the computers going out to the offices will be surrounded by Plexiglass .
I think it âs pretty wild .
Apparently , other â computer modifiers â are already hip to it .
This according to our tech guy .
But that âs not all .
Kucinich signed an agreement yesterday with SmartPower in which he promises that if elected president , he will make the White House 100 percent energy efficient ( enter veggie - oil - filled WH joke here ) .
Mother Jones has more fun facts about the presidential campaigns â commitment â or lack there of â to decreasing their environmental impact .
Stay tuned .
Correction :
Ok , so technically the Kucinich campaign is not yet rolling out these veggie - oil - filled , wonderfully efficient and quiet computers .
According to the campaign , it is still waiting on funding , but as commenter Croydon Kemp reminded us , it âs more than most are doing for the planet .
NAWA , Afghanistan Â
On the day after he completed a one - year sentence at the Rikers Island jail , Osvaldo Hernandez walked into an Army recruiting office in Elmhurst , Queens .
He was a felon with a plan to change his life .
It was late in 2003 .
Mr. Hernandez had been convicted of possessing an unregistered pistol the year before .
The Army , struggling to meet its recruiting goals , granted him an enlistment waiver for the crime and soon swore him in .
Four years later , Mr. Hernandez , 25 , is Specialist Hernandez , a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan .
His transformation from inmate to productive citizen would seem to be complete .
His Army supervisors say he is reliable , honest and brave .
Barring something unforeseen , he will be honorably discharged at the end of his 15 - month combat tour this year and hopes to become a New York City police officer .
The administrator of eDonkey link site , ShareReactor has been found guilty of ' commercial ' copyright infringement .
Following police raids in 2004 , it 's taken 4 long years for the case to come to a conclusion , and after all that , Christian Riesen , aka Simon Moon , has to pay a token fine of just $ 4200 .
With an estimated 250,000 members and around 7 million page impressions a month , ShareReactor was one of the world âs most popular eD2 K link sites .
Similar in operation to sites that host . torrent files , eD2 K ( eDOnkey ) link sites carry no copyright material and merely point to data hosted elsewhere .
Despite this , the site received multiple legal threats every month .
The fact that the site did nât host any copyrighted material did nât stop the Swiss Anti-Piracy Federation ( SAFE ) â backed up by major movie studios â from complaining to the police .
On March 10th 2004 , the site was shut down by Swiss police , who seized all of the servers and detained the site owner , Christian Riesen , aka Simon Moon .
According to an earlier interview , Riesen was initially tricked into going to Police .
â They sent me a letter requesting my presence â regarding finances in general â from the â fraud division â of the police here , â he said .
â Since I am self employed I thought someone made some accusation .
So nothing bad in mind with my documents all in order , I went there .
It was nât about the finances , it was all about ShareReactor . â
The police detained Riesen for around 9 hours while they quizzed him about the site .
He explains : â [ The police ] Asked about ShareReactor .
Asked me where money came in and where it went to .
The whole thing lost steam pretty fast as they saw how big a loss ShareReactor produced every month , and how little money in total was flowing at all .
SAFE told them something about 15.000 Euros income a month , while they told newspapers that is was 76.000 Euros . â
After the police questioning Riesen recalls : â At the end of the day , the investigation judge said â and now we go and raid your house â and so we drove there . â
Riesen said the police took a lot of stuff from his house : â two ShareReactor servers , my private machine , my girlfriend âs private machine and my folder with all bank files , although i gave them a copy of all my bank activities of the last 4 years already .
Also all my backups went with them .
At the end ShareReactor was down and I had none of my data left , personal and otherwise . â
In June 2004 the ShareReactor forum reappeared ( minus the eD2 K links ) and in September 2006 the site made a full return , albeit under new ownership .
However , the return was short - lived and just a month later the site closed again .
Now , some 4 years later , the District Court of Frauenfeld , Switzerland has decided that as the ShareReactor site was the main source of income for 28 years old Riesen ( through on - site advertising and donations ) , he is guilty of â commercially â assisting others to commit copyright infringement by â simplifying â access to illegal content .
After 4 years of investigations the court decided that for running the world âs biggest eDonkey link site , Riesen â who now lives in Canada â should be fined 4,700 Swiss Francs â roughly $ 4,200 .
Waste of money , anyone ?
We âve all read about the drought in America âs Southeast , and if it does nât let up very quickly , some nuclear power stations may have to either cut back operations or shut down temporarily because of a lack of water .
An Alabama reactor had to shutdown for a brief period in the summer , and officials in the Southeast now say it is becoming a crisis .
Water is essential for the operation of a nuclear facility , primarily to cool used steam generated by the nuclear reactors which run the electricity - generating turbines .
Some plants recycle cooling water in what is known as a closed system , so that process does nât create a real water problem .
How much water does a plant use ?
The Harris reactor near Raleigh , N.C. , draws 33 million gallons of water a day , with 17 million gallons lost to evaporation in the cooling towers .
Duke âs McGuire plant near Charlotte , N.C. sucks up more than 1 billion gallons a day from Lake Norman , but most of that is returned to the source .
The problem there , is that the lakes level is now 93.7 feet , down nearly 5 feet from a year ago .
If it drops another foot , the plant may have to cease operations .
The ratepayer in the Southeast may have to eat some high rates if the trend continues .
An energy analyst says replacement power would cost 10 times the going rate should plants shut down .

Do n't get me wrong , I 'm all for recycling , but it 's the process I 'm not so thrilled about .
For bottles and newspapers things are fairly simple , but there is a whole gray area that makes knowing what is appropriate for recycling more complicated .
The Barcode Trashcan offers a high - tech solution that utilizes the product barcode to help sort and separate items .

Many recyclables feature a number value that denotes whether it can or can not be recycled .
When scanned , these bins read that number and the corresponding can opens for your convenience .
Unfortunately , the only real benefit I see in this concept is that I would spend less time thinking about which bin to throw my beer bottles into .
The real tough recycling questions generally do n't have a barcode slapped on the side .
So , it appears that I will have to continue utilizing the woods and trash dump runs under the cover of darkness to deal with those issues .

OK , this response by MSNBC's VP for Communications Jeremy Gaines does nothing to clear this up and actually raises more doubts about that ghostly whisper .
" We had some audio issues and Gov. Romney 's mike was n't working momentarily .
Simple as that , " MSNBC VP for Communications Jeremy Gaines said in a one - line e-mail response to questions about overheard whisper .
So how did a malfunctioning mic whisper a little help to Romney ?
Wonkette has a theory ...
What exactly was that weird , whispery voice we heard between last night âs question to Mitt about Reagan and Social Security and Romney âs answer ?
Either Ronald Reagan is giving help from beyond the grave or Mitt was wearing a wire .

Generic programming is about generalizing software components so that they can be easily reused in a wide variety of situations .
In C++ , class and function templates are particularly effective mechanisms for generic programming because they make the generalization possible without sacrificing efficiency .
As a simple example of generic programming , we will look at how one might generalize the memcpy ( ) function of the C standard library .
An implementation of memcpy ( ) might look like the following :
void* memcpy ( void* region1 , const void * region2 , size_t n ) { const char * first = ( const char * ) region2 ; const char * last = ( ( const char*) region2 ) + n ; char* result = ( char * ) region1 ; while ( first != last ) * result ++ = * first ++ ; return result ; }
The memcpy ( ) function is already generalized to some extent by the use of void * so that the function can be used to copy arrays of different kinds of data .
But what if the data we would like to copy is not in an array ?
Perhaps it is in a linked list .
Can we generalize the notion of copy to any sequence of elements ?
Looking at the body of memcpy ( ) , the function 's minimal requirements are that it needs to traverse through the sequence using some sort of pointer , access elements pointed to , write the elements to the destination , and compare pointers to know when to stop .
The C++ standard library groups requirements such as these into concepts , in this case the Input Iterator concept ( for region2 ) and the Output Iterator concept ( for region1 ) .
If we rewrite the memcpy ( ) as a function template , and use the Input Iterator and Output Iterator concepts to describe the requirements on the template parameters , we can implement a highly reusable copy ( ) function in the following way :
template < typename InputIterator , typename OutputIterator > OutputIterator copy ( InputIterator first , InputIterator last , OutputIterator result ) { while ( first != last ) * result ++ = * first ++ ; return result ; }
Using the generic copy ( ) function , we can now copy elements from any kind of sequence , including a linked list that exports iterators such as std :: list .
#include < list > # include < vector > # include < iostream > int main ( ) { const int N = 3 ; std::vector<int > region1 ( N ) ; std::list<int > region2 ; region2.push_back ( 1 ) ; region2.push_back(0 ) ; region2.push_back(3 ) ; std::copy( region2.begin( ) , region2.end ( ) , region1.begin ( ) ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) std::cout << region1 [ i ] << " " ; std::cout << std::endl ; }
A concept is a set of requirements consisting of valid expressions , associated types , invariants , and complexity guarantees .
A type that satisfies the requirements is said to model the concept .
A concept can extend the requirements of another concept , which is called refinement .
Valid Expressions are C++ expressions which must compile successfully for the objects involved in the expression to be considered models of the concept .
are C++ expressions which must compile successfully for the objects involved in the expression to be considered of the concept .
Associated Types are types that are related to the modeling type in that they participate in one or more of the valid expressions .
Typically associated types can be accessed either through typedefs nested within a class definition for the modeling type , or they are accessed through a traits class .

Typically associated types can be accessed either through typedefs nested within a class definition for the modeling type , or they are accessed through a traits class .
Invariants are run-time characteristics of the objects that must always be true , that is , the functions involving the objects must preserve these characteristics .
The invariants often take the form of pre-conditions and post - conditions .
are run -time characteristics of the objects that must always be true , that is , the functions involving the objects must preserve these characteristics .
The invariants often take the form of pre-conditions and post - conditions .
Complexity Guarantees are maximum limits on how long the execution of one of the valid expressions will take , or how much of various resources its computation will use .
The concepts used in the C++ Standard Library are documented at the C++ reference website .
A traits class provides a way of associating information with a compile - time entity ( a type , integral constant , or address ) .
For example , the class template std::iterator_traits <T> looks something like this :
template < class Iterator > struct iterator_traits { typedef ... iterator_category ; typedef ... value_type ; typedef ... difference_type ; typedef ... pointer ; typedef ... reference ; } ;
The traits ' value_type gives generic code the type which the iterator is " pointing at " , while the iterator_category can be used to select more efficient algorithms depending on the iterator 's capabilities .
A key feature of traits templates is that they 're non-intrusive : they allow us to associate information with arbitrary types , including built - in types and types defined in third - party libraries , Normally , traits are specified for a particular type by ( partially ) specializing the traits template .
For an in - depth description of std::iterator_traits , see this page .
Another very different expression of the traits idiom in the standard is std::numeric_limits <T> which provides constants describing the range and capabilities of numeric types .
Tag dispatching is a way of using function overloading to dispatch based on properties of a type , and is often used hand in hand with traits classes .
A good example of this synergy is the implementation of the std ::advance ( ) function in the C++ Standard Library , which increments an iterator n times .
Depending on the kind of iterator , there are different optimizations that can be applied in the implementation .
If the iterator is random access ( can jump forward and backward arbitrary distances ) , then the advance ( ) function can simply be implemented with i += n , and is very efficient : constant time .
Other iterators must be advance d in steps , making the operation linear in n .
If the iterator is bidirectional , then it makes sense for n to be negative , so we must decide whether to increment or decrement the iterator .
The relation between tag dispatching and traits classes is that the property used for dispatching ( in this case the iterator_category ) is often accessed through a traits class .
The main advance ( ) function uses the iterator_traits class to get the iterator_category .
It then makes a call the the overloaded advance_dispatch ( ) function .
The appropriate advance_dispatch ( ) is selected by the compiler based on whatever type the iterator_category resolves to , either input_iterator_tag , bidirectional_iterator_tag , or random_access_iterator_tag .
A tag is simply a class whose only purpose is to convey some property for use in tag dispatching and similar techniques .
Refer to this page for a more detailed description of iterator tags .
namespace std { struct input_iterator_tag { } ; struct bidirectional_iterator_tag { } ; struct random_access_iterator_tag { } ; namespace detail { template < class InputIterator , class Distance > void advance_dispatch ( InputIterator& i , Distance n , input_iterator_tag ) { while ( n--) ++i ; } template < class BidirectionalIterator , class Distance > void advance_dispatch ( BidirectionalIterator& i , Distance n , bidirectional_iterator_tag ) { if ( n >= 0 ) while ( n --) ++i ; else while ( n++ ) -- i ; } template < class RandomAccessIterator , class Distance > void advance_dispatch ( RandomAccessIterator& i , Distance n , random_access_iterator_tag ) { i += n ; } } template < class InputIterator , class Distance > void advance ( InputIterator& i , Distance n ) { typename iterator_traits < InputIterator >:: iterator_category category ; detail ::advance_dispatch( i , n , category ) ; } }
An adaptor is a class template which builds on another type or types to provide a new interface or behavioral variant .
Examples of standard adaptors are std:: reverse_iterator , which adapts an iterator type by reversing its motion upon increment / decrement , and std :: stack , which adapts a container to provide a simple stack interface .
A more comprehensive review of the adaptors in the standard can be found here .
Note :
The type generator concept has largely been superseded by the more refined notion of a metafunction .
See C++ Template Metaprogramming for an in - depth discussion of metafunctions .
A type generator is a template whose only purpose is to synthesize a new type or types based on its template argument ( s ) [ 1 ] .
The generated type is usually expressed as a nested typedef named , appropriately type .
A type generator is usually used to consolidate a complicated type expression into a simple one .
This example uses an old version of iterator_adaptor whose design did n't allow derived iterator types .
As a result , every adapted iterator had to be a specialization of iterator_adaptor itself and generators were a convenient way to produce those types .
template < class Predicate , class Iterator , class Value = complicated default , class Reference = complicated default , class Pointer = complicated default , class Category = complicated default , class Distance = complicated default > struct filter_iterator_generator { typedef iterator_adaptor < Iterator , filter_iterator_policies < Predicate , Iterator > , Value , Reference , Pointer , Category , Distance > type ; } ;
Now , that 's complicated , but producing an adapted filter iterator using the generator is much easier .
You can usually just write :
boost::filter_iterator_generator<my_predicate ,my_base_iterator >:: type
An object generator is a function template whose only purpose is to construct a new object out of its arguments .
Think of it as a kind of generic constructor .
An object generator may be more useful than a plain constructor when the exact type to be generated is difficult or impossible to express and the result of the generator can be passed directly to a function rather than stored in a variable .
Most Boost object generators are named with the prefix " make_ " , after std::make_pair ( const T& , const U& ) .
For example , given :
struct widget { void tweak ( int ) ; } ; std::vector < widget *> widget_ptrs ;
By chaining two standard object generators , std::bind2nd ( ) and std::mem_fun( ) , we can easily tweak all widgets :
void tweak_all_widgets1( int arg ) { for_each ( widget_ptrs.begin( ) , widget_ptrs.end ( ) , bind2nd ( std : : mem_fun ( & widget : : tweak ) , arg ) ) ; }
Without using object generators the example above would look like this :
void tweak_all_widgets2( int arg ) { for_each ( struct_ptrs.begin( ) , struct_ptrs.end ( ) , std::binder2nd<std::mem_fun1_t<void , widget , int > >( std::mem_fun1_t<void , widget , int > ( & widget : : tweak ) , arg ) ) ; }
As expressions get more complicated the need to reduce the verbosity of type specification gets more compelling .
A policy class is a template parameter used to transmit behavior .
An example from the standard library is std:: allocator , which supplies memory management behaviors to standard containers .
Policy classes have been explored in detail by Andrei Alexandrescu in this chapter of his book , Modern C++ Design .
He writes :
In brief , policy - based class design fosters assembling a class with complex behavior out of many little classes ( called policies ) , each of which takes care of only one behavioral or structural aspect .
As the name suggests , a policy establishes an interface pertaining to a specific issue .
You can implement policies in various ways as long as you respect the policy interface .
Because you can mix and match policies , you can achieve a combinatorial set of behaviors by using a small core of elementary components .
Andrei's description of policy classes suggests that their power is derived from granularity and orthogonality .
Less - granular policy interfaces have been shown to work well in practice , though .
This paper describes an old version of iterator_adaptor that used non-orthogonal policies .
There is also precedent in the standard library : std:: char_traits , despite its name , acts as a policies class that determines the behaviors of std:: basic_string .
Notes
Type generators are sometimes viewed as a workaround for the lack of â templated typedefs â in C ++.

You 've probably noticed a lack of posts on this blog compared to my other The Unloading Zone .
It 's not because I do n't have the time ; it 's just that this campaign to date has been so lackluster , so scripted , so ....... boring .
I write about what interests me and so far , very little has interested me in the 2008 Presidential Race .
I anticipated a little heat after the first of the year and , after all , the election is about 11 months away .
There will be plenty to write about later on .
Or so I thought .
One thing I have done is been rather dismissive of Dr. Ron Paul , Republican / Libertarian from Texas .
Not only on this blog , but especially in the comments section on.com which these days seems nothing more than a Gen X platform for Dr. Paul .
I saw him as a latter - day Ross Perot ; a spoiler who would pull enough Republican votes to hand the White House to Hillary .
And I am SOLIDLY against anything or anyone who could hand her the Presidency .
My plan :
Texas has open primaries so I would vote ( for the first time in my life ) as a Democrat , pickor whomever else was the strongest candidate next to Hillary , and then vote for the Republican , whomever THAT is in the general election .
Holding my nose while I vote in the general election wo n't be enough : I planned on wearing a gas mask .
So I 'm surfing the political news looking for something to write about this morning .
Do I REALLY want to get into the whole " whose the best Christian " thing withand Romney ?
Has Rudy gotten into ANOTHER scandal ?
Is Mike " lets isolate AIDS patients " position political suicide , a ticket to the White House , or just a pathetic bid for airtime ?
I 'm interested ...... NOT .
In fact , none of the Republican front - runners excite me in the least or even interest me .
On the Democrat side , , despite his appeal to me as a Hillary - Killer , is really just a clone of her on Universaland Education .
Nothing exciting to talk about there .
And Hillary has n't done anything shocking enough to justify a post the past few days .
And who can even remember who the other Democrats are .
I guess I 'll go back to my other blog where I am having some fun .
And then I noticed someone ( on ) had posted something about a Newsweek interview video with Ron Paul on the Second Amendment .
That caught my eye .
I am a fervent supporter of the Constitution and the Second Amendment has been trampled on more than the other nine .
I also like guns .
I own guns .
I carry a gun when I go out .
( yes , I have a concealed handgun license ) .
So , despite my fatigue with the RonPaul crowd , I decided to watch the video .
Then I watched the other two videos there : one on Israel and it's right to exist ; the other on getting rid of the IRS .
And you know what ?
I found myself LIKING Ron Paul !
It was n't the positions he took , per ..... these were short videos .
I liked how he handled himself .
I liked the confidence in his positions he exhibited .
I liked his honesty .
I particularly liked the way he handled the reporter when he tried to " trap " Dr. Paul .
No blustering , no double - speak .
He just considered for a second and gave an answer .
He could have obfuscated , he could have bobbed and weaved , but he did n't .
And he 's the first politician I 've seen since Ronald Reagan who seemed very comfortable with himself .
" quit " smoking after criticism from his handlers .
If Dr. Paul smoked ( I do n't believe he does ) , he would have lit up a cigarette on camera , acknowledged the health hazards , and basically said " this is who I am " .
I 'll say it again , I found myself LIKING Ron Paul .
But liking him and seeing him elected are too different things .
I originally stopped looking at his positions too closely after I heard he wanted to abolish the IRS and reduce the size of government by 50 % .
This was just another Libertarian in Republican clothes , I thought .
Politicians come and go butare forever .
I went back to Dr. Paul 's website this morning and REALLY read his positions , not just the little teaser paragraphs that end with a hyperlink to " details " .
Do I think he 's going to be able to reduce the size of government by 50 % ?
No , the Congress and the bureaucrats wo n't let that happen .
But I found myself agreeing with him more than I disagreed .
I found his positions more plausible than the soundbites of them would indicate .
And I just liked the guy !
I'm not coming out with an endorsement based on insomnia and web surfing , but I am going to read more about Ron Paul and I am going stop dumping on him as a spoiler .
If he can get enough airtime and enough debate time , ( I ca n't believe I 'm going to say this ) he MAY BE ELECTABLE , even against Hillary !
So as a cynical baby boomer who has had his heart broken too many times by the Republicans , I will say that I now find Dr. Paul " interesting " and plan to do a lot more research on him and his positions .
Before theservers explode , let me say that I am not changing the name of my blog : Defeating Hillary Clinton is critical to the survival of America , I truly believe that .
She is the antithesis of Ron Paul .
Under Hillary , we would just be a client state of the United Nations .
But I like Ron Paul and I 'm going to keep up on him .
And who knows , I have two spaces on my lawn I reserve for political signs .
One is going to , who is running for Mayor of Frisco , TX ( like anyone outside of Frisco cares ) .
But the other spot does n't have a name on it .
Would n't it be something if a Ron Paul for President sign ended up there ........

At the core of that article that began on the front page are two anonymous sources .
These sources , according to the article , say they confronted McCain in 1999 with their concerns that he was risking his career by interacting with Vicki Iseman .
As a columnist , I âm an independent operator , speaking for myself alone .
I have no idea who those sources are .
But they are bound to come from the inner circle of the McCain universe .
The number of people who could credibly claim to have had a meeting like that with McCain in early 1999 is vanishingly small .
I count a small handful of associates with that stature , including Davis and Weaver .
There is nobody in that tight circle unaffected by the hostilities that emanate from the rift .
Thursday , as McCain was fervently and completely denying the allegations of an affair with Iseman , people in all quarters of the McCain universe were vehemently denying it , too .
But even on this embattled day , they broke down into rival camps over the identity of the sources .
Many in the Davis camp argued Thursday that Weaver must be the chief anonymous source , and that he had roped in one other confederate .
He âs had a hard life , they said , and is driven by demons .
Weaver countered by telling reporters that he retains enormous affection for McCain and desperately wants him to become president .
Moreover , Weaver had been trying to get back into the fold .
There is no way he would be an anonymous source against McCain .
Some closer to Weaver theorized that the sources must be former McCain campaign elders from 2000 who worked for rival campaigns in 2008 .
I checked that possibility out , and it does nât hold water .
But while calling around to a dozen senior McCain friends and advisers Thursday , what struck me was the enormous tragedy of the rift .
They all love McCain .
They all say it is absurd to think he abused his power in the way that is alleged .
But the rift is like some primal sore .
It affected every conversation I had Thursday , as it has infected McCain efforts again and again over the past many years .
At his press conference Thursday , McCain went all - in .
He did nât just say he did nât remember a meeting about Iseman .
He said there was no meeting .
If it turns out that there is evidence of an affair and a meeting , then his presidential hopes will be over .
If no evidence surfaces , his campaign will go on and it will be clear that there were members of his old inner circle consumed by viciousness and mendaciousness .
But lingering over everything is the bitterness of the rift , which has caused duplicity and anger to seep into the campaign of this fine man .
The poisons have yet to be drained .
Successful assimilation of immigrants
Esther Duflo
Resentment of immigrants is hard to explain on economic grounds , according to research on US data , and recent work on British data finds no real difference in assimilation rates between Muslim immigrants and other immigrants .
Populist rhetoric may do more to create a rift than any religious or cultural feeling these immigrants have brought with them and transferred to their children .
Immigration stirs up strong enough fears to justify questionable measures of protection against it â from arrests at the doors of French schools to the border wall that separates the USA from Mexico .
Economic research suggests that the intensity of these reactions seems completely disproportionate to immigration âs real economic impact on the local population .
David Card has shown that even massive waves of immigration ( like the arrival of Cuban boat people on the coasts of Florida ) do nât result in lower salaries or fewer jobs for local people in the US.1
In a recent survey article , he concluded that the â new immigration â assimilates just as well as previous waves had , and that the wages and employment prospects of natives are not any lower in cities that received more migrants2 .
Furthermore , Patricia Cortes also showed that an increase in the number of immigrants causes a price - drop in the sectors where they âre concentrated ( i.e. , the service and food industries , and child care ) ; this benefits the local population .
3
Economic reasons do nât seem to provide a sufficient explanation for the persistent distrust of immigrants among the native population .
It seems that in part , this distrust can be attributed to the feeling that each new wave of immigrants is unique and cannot assimilate , and that the very fabric of our societies is threatened by the presence of these strangers .
Just as 19th century Italian immigrants angered the French proletariat with their outward display of religion ( they were disparagingly nicknamed â the christos â by the French working class ) , today many predict that the new wave of Latino - American immigration is essentially unable to assimilate , because it is too distant from â traditional â American values ( i.e. , Anglo - Saxon and Protestant values ) .
According to Samuel Huntington , one of the most prominent political scientists in the US , this fundamental incapacity to adapt exemplifies the â shock of civilizations â : the great conflicts of the twenty first century will take place along religious lines , amongst eight great â religions â of the world .
4
In Europe , Muslim immigration is today âs prime example of this â shock of cultures â .
Every suburban riot and every bus burned is taken as an example that children of Muslim immigrants do nât consider themselves British or French .
If the French played cricket , Muslim youth would certainly fail Tebbit âs â cricket test â ( the British minister infamously asked which side Britain âs Asian immigrants would support in a Pakistani - English match ) .
Even in England , where the attitude towards immigration and assimilation is more relaxed than in France , the terrorist attacks of recent years gave rise to alarming observations that children of Pakistani and Bangladeshi families were nât able to adapt to British society .
This was made particularly salient by the video message of one of the July 7 London bombers ( British - born but whose parents were from Pakistan ) , which said â your democratically elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against my people and your support of them makes you directly responsible , just as I am directly responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and sisters â , clearly contrasting â we â and â you â .
5
But aside from a few anecdotes and these dramatic , but isolated examples , it has never been shown that young Muslims stay foreign to the culture of their adopted country more than any other immigrants .
On the contrary , a recent study from Alan Manning and Sanchari Roy , of the London School of Economics , 6 suggests that there âs no real difference in the pace of assimilation between Muslim immigrants ( essentially Bangladeshis , Pakistanis , Somalians and Indians ) and other immigrants .
Manning and Roy study the response to the question asked in an annual survey which asked about what nationality the respondent associate with .
The specific question is â What do you consider your national identity to be ?
Please choose as many or as few as apply ? â
There were six possible responses : British , English , Scottish , Welsh , Irish and Other .
The author grouped British , English , Scottish and Welsh together under the heading â British â , and take the answer â British â to this question a sign of assimilation .
Among those who were born in England , 94 % of persons asked consider themselves British ; whereas those in Northern Ireland are 24 % less likely to identify as British ( they consider themselves as Irish ) .
Second - generation children of immigrants identify less often as British , but not to a large extent ( from 2 % to 5 % depending on the country ) , and it is similar across countries â in other words , children of Pakistani immigrants identify as British at least as often as the children of Italian or Chinese immigrants .
Religion does nât have any impact on the answer to this question .
Moreover , this variable does nât seem to change over time ; the youngest group of immigrant children are nât less English than other , older immigrant children .
Even events like September 11th , the war in Iraq or July 7th , had no effect on young Muslims â feeling of being English .
Furthermore , from the third generation , the difference ( in response to this question ) between the offspring of immigrants and that of native British people completely disappear , for all nationalities .
These results strongly suggest that there is no erosion of British identity amongst the children of immigrants .
However , they could still feel British , but have different values .
To explore this question , Manning and Roy turned to a survey of â values â , conducted on 15,000 people , 5000 of whom were children of immigrants .
The survey focuses on the â rights and obligations â of those surveyed ( example of rights are freedom of speech , freedom of thoughts , freedom of religion , right to be treated fairly and equally , right to free education etc â¦. ; examples of responsibility include â to help and protect your family ; to educate children properly , to obey and respect law . Etc.. â .
Once again , there is no difference between Muslims and others on the number of rights and responsibility that they think they should have ; and this is born out by looking at specific rights individually .
Manning and Roy rightly conclude that , on the basis of available evidence , Huntington âs pessimism - that Muslim immigrants will prove â indigestible â to non-Muslim societies , seems unjustified indeed .
If anything , the constant reminders of â native â Europeans that there is â us â and â them â , the new , scary , Muslim immigrants and their offspring may do substantially more to create a rift than any religious or cultural feeling these immigrants have brought with them and transferred to their children .

Ok , the cop said I looked bad on the field sobriety tests , but I know I âm not guilty : I only had two drinks and I âve got witnesses .
No matter what the police say , I can tell my side of the story to my fellow citizens and let them decide .
Right ?
Well â¦ Not necessarily .
This right to jury trial , handed down centuries ago from England âs Magna Carta , was considered so fundamental to the framers of our Constitution that they included it in the Bill of Rights â Sixth Amendment ?
It makes no exceptions to this sacred right to trial by a jury of peers .
So why do some states today deny a person accused of drunk driving a jury trial ?
Why , for example , does an American citizen arrested in New Jersey have to accept the decision of a politically - appointed judge ?
After all , the Sixth Amendment is pretty clear on the subject :
In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed â¦
How did the government get around this fundamental right ?
Well , once again they started whitling away by playing around with words .
( As Humpty Dumpty said Lewis Carroll âs Through the Looking Glass , â When I use a word , it means just what I choose it to mean , neither more nor less . â )
It started some years ago when the federal courts decided that the framers of the Constitution did nât really mean â in ALL criminal prosecutions â .
So they changed one little word .
They said what the framers really meant was that there was a right to jury trial in â serious â criminal prosecutions â not in â petty â ones .
Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U.S. 145 ( 1968 ) .
So what is â serious â ?
Well , a couple of years later , the Supreme Court decided that there was no right to a jury trial if the maximum authorized prison sentence did not exceed six months .
Amazingly , going to jail for one - half year was not enough to justify giving a citizen a right to trial by his peers .
The Court added , however , that a defendant could have a right to jury trial â only if he can demonstrate that any additional statutory penalties , viewed in conjunction with the maximum authorized period of incarceration , are so severe that they clearly reflect a legislative determination that the offense in question is a â serious â one â .
Baldwin v. New York 399 U.S. 66 ( 1970 ) .
Well , what about DUI cases ?
They usually involve maximum sentences of six months in jail â AND a bunch of other stuff : fines , license supensions , DUI schools , ignition interlock devices , 3 - 5 years of probation .
And the possibility of even stiffer punishment for a repeat offense .
Does nât that show that lawmakers think drunk driving is pretty serious ?
Inevitably , a citizen accused of DUI and ( inevitably ) convicted by a judge in Nevada took the case up to the U.S. Supreme Court .
With all the additional punishment over and above the six months in jail , his attorney argued , was nât it â serious â enough to have a right to a jury ?
No , the Court held : â Considering the additional statutory penalties as well , we do not believe that the Nevada Legislature has clearly indicated that DUI is a â serious â offense . â
Blanton v City of North Las Vegas 489 U.S. 538 ( 1989 ) .
Hmmm â¦.. Drunk driving seems â serious â enough to justify ever - harsher DUI laws because of the oft - mentioned â carnage on the highways â â but apparently not â serious â enough to give a citizen his constitutional right to a jury trial .
We âve come a long way since those historical words â In all criminal prosecutions â¦ â

Kate Barker warns of borrowing and property prices falling
Kate Barker interview
Kate Barker , a member of the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee , warned that the bank would not be able to stop this in the short term .
Therefore , she said , the MPC would be paying particularly careful attention to the financial and property markets .
But rate cuts would be hard to justify in the face of inflationary pressures .
" The risk I believe to be of most concern is around the interplay between the property market and the financial sector resulting from the credit turmoil , " she said .
" If credit tightening were to prove more severe than in the MPC 's present central projection , leading to a significant fall in lending to households and companies , this could prompt a further decline in property values .
" The consequent adverse impact on growth could prove difficult to turn around quickly , potentially resulting in a protracted period of low output growth and below target inflation , " she told the North Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce .
Mortgage tap
The possibility of the credit squeeze in the financial markets choking off the property market has already been raised by the Council of Mortgage Lenders .
The consequent adverse impact on growth could prove difficult to turn around quickly
Kate Barker
Last year , it warned that the crisis in the financial markets might turn off the " mortgage tap " because banks needed to borrow about a third of the Â£ 90bn or so they expect to lend this coming year .
Speaking in a personal capacity , Ms Barker noted that even if house prices fell by 15 % , only 5 % of mortgage holders - and thus just 2 % of all households - would find they were in negative equity , whereby their homes were worth less than their mortgages .
But the interplay of reduced lending and falling property prices would still be a big drag on the wider economy .
" A prolongation of the present difficulties in accessing wholesale funds could restrict the quantity of mortgage lending during 2008 , " she said .
" In this case , the mortgage market could become less competitive and more expensive , feeding back into a decline in the housing market , somewhat lower consumer spending , and also into lenders ' balance sheets , reducing lending capacity further . "
Slowdown
Ms Barker warned her audience that it would be hard for the MPC to take this into account quickly in its monthly deliberations on interest rates .
" The consequent adverse impact on growth could prove difficult to turn around quickly , potentially resulting in a protracted period of low output growth and below - target inflation , " she said .
She hinted that ideally , interest rates should be cut further to head off this possibility .
But she pointed out that strong upward inflationary pressures in the economy made it more likely than not that the Bank 's inflation target would be breached later this year .
In the short term , she warned , the economy faces " an overall sharp slowdown in output growth " .
The buzz around the launch of the iPhone in the UK seems to be pointing to - well - the lack of buzz .
The Register is calling it a flop :
Journalists and PR minders outnumbered buyers on Friday night as interest in Apple 's iPhone miserably failed to live up to the pre-launch hype in the UK .
When the iPhone launched in the US , on June 29th - a Friday - the blogosphere generated 0.105 % attention ( about 600 posts ) for the query ' iphone + launch " .
On November the 9th - also a Friday - the UK launch produced 0.025 % for the same query ( about 160 posts ) .
Given the difference in the size of the countries , this does n't perhaps seem as stark as people are painting it .
However , one would have to look deeper into the nature of these posts .
Perhaps all the US buzz was full of swooning admiration whereas all the UK buzz is scoffing at the lack of buyers .

Around 3 years ago Far Cry was launched by the same developers behind Crysis : Germany based Crytek .
The Game was an average FPS that did nât bring anything new to the genre , but was still a pleasant game , playable at least one time .
Back then just like now , graphics were at the center of things .
Far Cry had beautiful environments that few computers at the time could handle .
Hardware websites and enthusiasts quickly made Far Cry a benchmark standard for all types of hardware .
A little later however , something happened which became the beginning of this whole story .
AMD launched their 64 - bit processor Athlon 64 and were hunting for sales arguments .
Due to the fact that AMD were the first to create 64 - bit processors in regular home PC âs , there was almost no software that supported this new technology .
This made it difficult for AMD to convince the consumers of the advantages of more â bits in the processor â .
AMD was simply forced to convince developers to use the new technology , and one of the goals of this campaign was a 64 - bit version of Far Cry .
Apparently AMD managed to â convince â Crytek .
About the same time that Microsoft released their 64 - bit version of Windows XP a patch popped up on AMD âs website promising gold to those with the courage to buy a new processor and upgrade their operating system .
The advantages of â more bits in the processor â was demonstrated with snapshots showing more badass explosions and more detailed textures .
Is nât 64 - bit wonderful ?
For those of us with our feet on the ground , these arguments were not as convincing .
64 - bit in fact has nothing to do with bigger textures .
To be able to adress more memory and have access to wider registers can make it easier to handle large sums of data , but at the time no personal computer was even close to breaking the 32 - bit barrier .
Cut short , this PR scam had nothing to do with â more bits in the processor â .
Back to present day and the launch of the Crysis Demo .
Just like last time an enormous amount of hype was built up , largely about the astounding graphics .
By using Microsofts latest graphics standard Directx 10 , which is only available in Windows Vista , the developers have been able to push the boundaries of what is possible with todays hardware .
That is the official version at least .
The truth is the true purpose of Directx 10 is to make developing easier by cleaning up registers and supplying new useful functions .
This however is nothing the consumer notices , and therefore Microsoft must point out Directx 10â²s â graphical improvements â in order to convince gamers to upgrade to Windows Vista .
In reality DX10 does not mean drastically improved visual effects , at least not with todays graphics cards .
There is a certain repetition of history to be seen here , right ?
And then a few days after the Crysis demo launched the bad news was announced .
When using Directx 9 you ca nât run the game at â very high â settings , which drastically improves the visual experience from lower settings .
A member at Crysis - online poked around a bit with the demo files and found a way to get almost exactly the same visual quality with Directx 9 .
This meant that the developers ( Crytek ) had purposefully worsened the Directx 9 setting to make Microsofts new technology appear superior .
Apparently Crytek dose nât mind lying to their customers .
This is not all .
Crytek CEO
Cevat Yerli was interviewed a while back by Shacknews and talked about how beneficial multi-core processors would be for the game .
Finally those who had spent big bucks on quad - cores would earn their increased perfomance .
â Multi - core will be beneficial in the experience , particularly in faster but also smoother framerates . [...]
We recommend quad core over higher clock . â
Quad core was the advice Crytek had to give to hopeful gamers saving money for upgrades .
What was the reality again ?
The reality is that four cores gives zero , I repeat , ZERO perfomance increase in Crysis .
And thats not all , because once again the 64 - bit question has to be adressed .
Cevat Yerli was also interviewed by Gamespot among others praising â more bits in the processor â :
â I would recommend gamers run 64 - bit only under very high configurations . â
Better Performance at higher graphics settings ?
This was not the reality .
The truth is that 64 - bit improves NOTHING in Crysis !
This is of course the demo version we are talking about , but everything points toward the full version of the game functioning the same .
Is this the kind of behaviour us enthusiasts and gamers will have to live with in the future ?
Game developers being a part of the marketing of new technology and hardware , no longer concentrating on delivering the best possible product but convincing consumers to open their wallets and unnecessarily upgrading their systems ?
I assume money has exchanged hands more than once behind the scenes , and who the suspects are need not even be mentioned .
As a true gamer and hardware enthusias i declare that Crysis makes me sick .

NBA analyst and former player Charles Barkley called out â fake Christians â on CNN .
What are fake Christians ?
BARKLEY : Well , I think they â they want to be judge and jury .
Like , I âm for gay marriage .
It âs none of my business if gay people want to get married .
I âm pro-choice .
And I think these Christians â first of all , they âre supposed to be â they âre not supposed to judge other people .
But they âre the most hypocritical judge of people we have in this country .
And it bugs the hell out of me .
They act like their Christians .
And they âre not forgiving at all .
â¦
WOLF BLITZER : But you ca nât lump all these conservatives as being fake .
A lot of them obviously â most of them are very , very sincere in their religious beliefs .
BARKLEY : Well , they should read the part about they âre not supposed to judge other people .
They forget that one when it does nât fit what they want it to say . â
A man fatally punched and kicked his employer in the head after he was told he was too drunk to work , a court has been told .
Darren William Dwyer , 24 , was jailed Tuesday for 10 years and branded a serious violent offender for the attack on Beenleigh Darts Association manager Philip James McMillan .
Mr McMillan , 51 , was attacked at his home in Woodridge , south of Brisbane , in March last year .
Love is the most exalted and sublime of human emotions .
It has inspired breathtaking works of art , journeys through continents and even the tragedies of war .
Given its powerful hold on humanity it âs surprising that it âs been traditionally neglected by the brain sciences .
In spite of this , a new dawn in romance research has begun to bud in recent years , and love has finally blossomed in the lab .
While romantic love has always been an obsession of the psychoanalysts , they were often creating little more than a new poetry of emotion , often beautiful , often bizarre , but rarely explaining more than their own metaphors .
Always a little late to the game , it was nât until the end of the 1990s that neuroscience fell head over heals for love .
The first to become inspired by this new passion was , as if we needed to ask , an Italian .
Psychiatrist Donatella Marazziti and her colleagues measured levels of a protein that transports the neurotransmitter serotonin in the blood of 20 people who had recently fallen madly in love , 20 people with obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and 20 healthy comparison participants .
People with OCD experience intrusive , obsessive thoughts and are often described as having an â over - valued idea â â an almost semi-delusional state where a particular thought becomes the focus of attention .
Marazziti , already an established OCD researcher , knew that serotonin had previously been linked both to obsessional thoughts and to sexual attraction , and wondered whether something similar might be going on in the early stages of romance .
She found that the group of patients with OCD and the recently love - struck were no different in terms of the serotonin transporter protein , suggesting the brain began to function markedly differently as love blossomed .
Although measuring the blood is a fairly crude way of looking at how the brain works , the researchers were struck by the similarities between these two states :
This aspect we believe underlies the obsessive pre-occupation so characteristic of the early stage of love ( which , in rare instances , might persist for a lifetime of abstract idealization that leads to poetry and music dedicated to the love object ) .
As far as we are aware , this is the first report of changes in the 5 - HT [ serotonin ] transporter during a physiological state ; it would suggest that being in love literally induces a state which is not normal â as indeed suggested by a variety of colloquial expressions used throughout the ages in different countries , all of which refer generally to falling â insanely â in love or to being â lovesick â
Since this initial flirtation , love has become a hot topic in the neurosciences , with whole conferences dedicated to it and numerous scientific studies being published every year .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the traditional connection between love and madness has not been dispelled by these recent studies .
In fact , a 2007 study that looked at new love in adolescents found so many striking similarities between the intensity of teenage romance and hypomania , a symptom of manic - depression , that the authors warned researchers to look out for the love - struck when conducting research with young people , so as not to bias their results .

With this post I am starting a series of articles on some of the fundamental concepts that you should have at least a passing familiarity with if you are planning on working with GemStone / S .
These articles are nât intended to replace our most excellent documentation , but to serve as a tantalizing introduction to the wonderful delicacies one can enjoy if he or she decides to crack the shell of a fresh SAG ( pdf ) , open a case of Topaz ( pdf ) and sit by a cheery fire some chilly evening this autumn .
First on the menu is the transaction .
GemStone / S transactions are light on the nose and have a warm , smokey flavor with echoes of strawberries and glazed donuts that reverberates off the palate with the force of a Dandelion archene â¦. ahem â¦one should nât write a blog on an empty stomach .
GemStone / S is a full - fledged database complete with ACID properties .
Not ACID as in Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds , but ACID as in a guarantee that the Smalltalk objects in your transaction have been completely and correctly written to disk : Atomicity , Consistency , Isolation , and Durability .
In GemStone / S transactions are used for persistence , but they are also useful for sharing objects between vms , via the Shared Page Cache ( SPC ) .
I will warn you that I âll get a little geeky during the following discussion and it will probably help if you take a peek at the Glossary to familiarize yourself with some of the terms I âll be using , but I promise to try to avoid dragging you too far down the rabbit hole .
Abort
All transactions in GemStone start with an abort .
When an abort is performed the following steps are performed in a gem :
Invalidate objects Acquire new view
Invalidate objects
All of the dirty objects ( i.e. , persistent objects previously modified ) in the vm are marked as invalid .
The list of dirty objects in a vm is called a writeSet .
All objects that have been changed since the last time the gem updated its view ( called a writeSetUnion ) are also marked as invalid .
A subsequent reference to an invalid object will cause a fresh version of the object to be copied into the vm .
Each persistent object is identified by a unique id called an OOP .
An OOP is a 61 bit value .
The three extra bits in a 64 bit word are used as tag bits .
Tag bits differentiate between regular objects ( which need to be physically stored in the data base ) and special objects .
The value of a special object is encoded in the 61 bits of the OOP itself .
SmallIntegers , SmallDoubles , and Characters are examples of special objects .
â¦. Was that a rabbit ????
One or more objects are stored on a data page .
Objects that are larger than a page are transparently broken up into page - sized chunks .
Because of this chunking it is possible to reference objects in a million element array without having to load the entire million element array into memory .
Objects are read from and written to extents on disk in units of pages .
Not suprisingly pages are cached in memory in the Shared Page Cache .
The Object Table ( OT ) is a Btree that maps OOPs to pages .
The OT is stored in a set of pages , cached in the SPC and written to an extent just like the data pages .
Acquire new view
The gem contacts the stone and gets a new view of the database .
A view is a reference to the latest OT along with some other bookkeeping information .
Transaction Body
As the vm executes code following an abort , it starts keeping track of all of the objects that are modified during the transaction in the writeSet .
Object references are stored in the body of an object as an OOP , so when an instance variable is accessed in a persistent object and the object is not in the vm or the object has been invalidated , the OT is consulted , and the SPC is checked to see if the page containing the object is already present .
If the page is nât in the SPC , then the page is loaded from disk .
Finally , the object is copied from the page into the vm . â¦. A white rabbit ????
Commit
When a commit is performed the following steps are performed in the gem :
Flush dirty objects
Write transaction log entries Acquire commit token Check for conflicts Finalize commit
Flush dirty objects
During this step all of the objects in the writeSet and all of the newly created objects that are reachable from persistent , dirty objects are copied from the vm into new pages in the SPC .
The gem âs copy of the OT is then updated with the new OOP to page mapping .
The OT data structure is designed to do a copy on write , so only the portion of the Btree that is changed needs to be written to new OT pages .
In practice large portions of the OT are shared amongst multiple views . â¦. Nope , it âs a Dormouse .
I âm sure of it .
The new pages in the SPC , containing the latest state of the modified objects are not written directly to disk as part of the transaction .
Doing so would take too much time , as disk writes are notoriously slow .
A separate process ( AIO pageServer ) asynchronously writes the â dirty â data pages to disk .
At periodic intervals a concerted effort is made to ensure that all â dirty â pages written before a certain point in time are flushed to disk .
This is called a checkpoint .
Write transaction log entries
In order to ensure Durability we do have to write something to disk as part of the transaction .
It turns out that we can write a minimum amount of information about the changes to objects much faster than we can write the entire object to disk .
During this step , tranlog records are written by the stone for all of the changed and new objects .
Asynchronous i/o is used ( when available on the host os ) to write transaction logs , so that commit processing can go on while the tranlog records make their way to disk .
In a performance sensitive installation , the transaction logs are located on a raw partition or on optimized disk arrays for the fastest i/o possible .
â¦. Oh Oh , now there âs a wacky , little guy in a top hat .
In the event of a system crash , one can recover the database by replaying all tranlog records written since the last checkpoint .
Acquire commit token
Up to this point commit processing in multiple gems can occur in parallel , but in this final phase of the commit , only one gem can proceed at a time .
The stone manages the queue of gems by handing out a commit token to one gem at a time .
Check for conflicts
When a gem gets the commit token , it begins checking for commit conflicts ( i.e. , a valid transaction ) .
It does this by comparing the gem âs current writeSet with the writeSetUnion ( the union of all writeSets from the transactions that occurred since the gem acquired its original view ) and if any of the OOPs are in both sets a conflict has occurred and the commit fails .
If the commit fails , the gem gives up the commit token and either aborts or attempts to recover from the commit failure . â¦. Little balls of â¦.. hedgehogs ????
Finalize commit
If there are no conflicts , then the gem returns the commit token to the stone along with a copy of its writeSet ( for writeSetUnion processing in other gems ) and a reference to the gem âs updated OT .
The stone is then free to pass along the commit token , but the gem must still wait until the stone informs it that the asynchronous transaction log i/o has completed .
â¦.a toothy smile appears floating in mid-air and the Cheshire Cat slowly materializes , hands you a precious stone and fades away completely â¦.
Oh well , maybe I went farther down the rabbit hole than I originally planned , but I did warn you !
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton on Wednesday cast herself as a candidate who " relies not just on words but on work " as she eyed the upcoming Ohio and Texas primaries in hopes of stopping Sen. Barack Obama .
Clinton 's supporters said she must win those two states March 4 if she is to close the gap with Obama in the delegate race and stop the momentum he has built up with 10 straight wins .
Rhode Island and Vermont also will hold primaries March 4 .
Clinton and Obama will be in Texas to debate each other on CNN at 8 p.m. ET Thursday .
Early voting already began there Tuesday .
See behind - the - scenes debate photos Â»
Obama scored overwhelming victories Tuesday in Wisconsin and Hawaii , his ninth and 10th wins in a row .
In the Wisconsin primary , Obama beat Clinton 58 percent to 41 percent , with 99 percent of the precincts reporting .
The senator from Illinois also won the caucuses in Hawaii , his native state , over Clinton 76 percent to 24 percent , with all precincts reporting .
On the GOP side , Sen. John McCain topped former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 55 percent to 37 percent in the Wisconsin primary , with 99 percent of the precincts reporting .
Rep. Ron Paul of Texas received 5 percent of the vote .
Also in Tuesday 's Washington state primary , McCain beat Huckabee 49 percent to 22 percent , with 57 percent of the precincts reporting .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was third with 20 percent despite dropping out of the race .
CNN estimates McCain has gathered 918 delegates toward the 1,191 needed for the Republican nomination , while Huckabee trails at 217 .
Despite McCain 's big lead in delegates , Huckabee has said he intends to stay in the race .
Huckabee 's campaign chairman on Wednesday said Texas could be the deciding factor .
" Two more weeks until Texas , then we 'll see where we are .
If we win Texas , we keep going , " Ed Rollins said .
For the Democrats , Obama has emerged as the front - runner following a split decision with Clinton in the Super Tuesday contests two weeks ago .
Speaking to supporters Wednesday during an event at Hunter College in New York , Clinton said she would continue to present herself as someone who has the experience to provide solutions and not just give a good speech .
Watch Clinton say ' the campaign goes forward ' Â»
" Americans have a choice to make in this election , and that choice matters , " she said .
" It 's about picking a president who relies not just on words but on work , on hard work , to get America back to work , to get America working again for all of our people .
" We need to make a choice between speeches and solutions , because while words matter greatly , the best words in the world are n't enough unless you match them with action . "
Clinton made similar attacks before the Wisconsin and Hawaii contests , but they did not stop Obama 's groundswell .
View pictures from Tuesday 's primaries Â»
Clinton congratulated her rival Wednesday , saying , " He 's had a good couple of weeks , and he 's run a good race . "
She added , " We 're going to draw the contrasts and make the comparisons and give the people of Ohio and Texas and the other states a real choice . "
Obama leads Clinton in the crucial delegate count -- 1,315 to 1,245 , according to CNN calculations .
The count includes superdelegates who have publicly declared their support for one of the candidates .
Superdelegates are elected and party officials who are allowed to vote at the Democratic National Convention .
They are free to vote for any candidate and are not bound by primary or caucus results .
See whom the superdelegates are supporting Â»
To win the nomination , 2,025 national convention delegates are needed .
Neither candidate is expected to garner enough delegates in the remaining primaries and caucuses to take the nomination outright , and the roughly 800 superdelegates are likely to be the deciding factor in determining the nominee .
In what may be a troubling sign for the Clinton campaign in the weeks ahead , Obama was able to make inroads among Wisconsin voters with groups the former first lady had won in earlier primaries -- women and low - income voters .
Watch how Obama won Wisconsin Â»
According to exit polls , Obama and Clinton split female voters in the state .
In previous victories , Clinton enjoyed an advantage among women .
Check out CNN 's analysis of the results Â»
Among Wisconsin men , Obama benefited from an almost 2 - to - 1 advantage -- 67 percent to 31 percent .
Obama won among all income groups in Wisconsin , including the lower income voters Clinton had targeted , according to exit polls .
Among voters making between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 a year , Obama edged out Clinton 52 percent to 46 percent .
Obama had a 56 percent to 44 percent advantage over Clinton among voters making between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 .
Taking the stage Tuesday night in NASA 's hometown , Obama remarked to supporters about his Wisconsin win : " Houston , I think we 've achieved liftoff here . "
He said , " It is going to require more than rousing speeches .
...
It is going to require something more , because the problem that we face in America today is not the lack of good ideas .
It 's that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die . "
Watch Obama rally supporters Â»
As Obama has edged ahead of Clinton , McCain increasingly has directed criticism toward the senator from Illinois .
" I will fight every moment of every day in this campaign to make sure Americans are not deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change , " McCain told supporters Tuesday night .
" Our purpose is to keep this blessed country free , safe , prosperous and proud . "
Watch McCain thank Wisconsin Â»
McCain was looking for big wins Tuesday to demonstrate he is starting to unify Republicans behind his nomination , including conservatives upset by his positions on immigration , campaign finance and other issues .
Wisconsin gave McCain at least 13 more delegates ; 24 more are to be awarded to the winner of each congressional district .
The remaining three GOP delegates are unpledged Republican National Committee members .
McCain and Huckabee were competing for 19 delegates in Washington state .
Eighteen delegates were awarded earlier in the state 's caucuses .

Org Statement Regarding the HTML5 Draft and the Ogg Codec Set
Ogg provides a baseline of fully unencumbered , fully open , fully documented , fully royalty - free codecs that are lighter - weight than the contemporary encumbered solutions while offering comparable or superior performance .
Ogg is not fantasy or vapourware .
It is widely deployed , tested , and reviewed .
Ogg has already stood the test of time .
Xiph knows of no infringing technology in Ogg .
Tens of millions of copies have been deployed worldwide over the past ten years in a diverse array of software and hardware products from small .orgs like Wikimedia [ 1 ] to giant commercial vendors such as Samsung [ 2 ] and Microsoft [ 3 ] .
Ogg has triggered no litigation to date .
The same cannot be said for MPEG .
Despite the MPEG proponents ' claims that MPEG - licensed codecs protect against liability , patent disputes involving MPEG codecs have occurred as recently as the past few months .
For example , Lucent v. Gateway [ 4 ] and Multimedia Patent Trust v. Microsoft Corp . [ 5 ] .
The MPEG - LA 's own sublicense disclaimer warns that licensees are not protected from patent - related litigation nor are they protected from submarine patents . [ 6 ]
The W3C has expressed a clear intention to officially define video as an integral part of the web by introducing the < video /> tag .
Up to this point , video on the web has been presented primarily using a fragmented array of proprietary extensions powered by encumbered formats .
Those who cannot use them have been made second - class citizens .
Failing to standardize on an unencumbered , reasonably - performing format is a failure to advance beyond this state .
In the interest of interoperability and to prevent large vendor lock - in to proprietary methods , we support the W3 C 's desire to adopt the unencumbered technology as the baseline .

So forget about the billions that have gone missing , even though they were US tax dollars .
( You know , the tax dollars that Bush and the GOP like to tell you is yours . )
It âs just as though it never happened if the contract fraud occurs overseas .
No matter how corrupt or how mismanaged , Bush says it âs all OK in the name of spreading democracy or whatever that âs supposed to be over there .
Clearly we lost billions after Katrina due to mismanagement but Iraq has been a black hole , littered with charges of corruption , fraud , rape , theft , murder , you name it .
This is what Bush and the GOP want to condone , as if none of it ever happened .
And to think people around the world think Bush and his talk of freedom and democracy sounds so fraudulent .
That would be because it is .
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has given VentureBeat an exclusive look at his technology plan , which he plans to unveil officially tomorrow ( Wednesday ) before a visit to Google âs headquarters .
The full plan can be seen below .
It contains several new proposals , including the appointment of technology czar called a Chief Technology Officer .
The CTO âs mandate would be quite different from the Cybersecurity czar appointed under the Bush Administration .
Bush âs czar helped defend against cyberattacks .
Obama âs CTO , by contrast , would ensure government officials hold open meetings , broadcast live webcasts of those meetings , and use blogging software , wikis and open comments to communicate policies with Americans , according to the plan .
The plan extends Obama âs previous advocacy for more open decision making in government .
It âs likely to play well here in Silicon Valley , because much of it relies on technology .
The announcement is significant , too , because Obama comes to California seeking to bolster his standings here , where he currently trails frontrunner Sen.
Hilary Clinton in most opinion polls .
Nationally , Obama has come to a moment of truth in his campaign , a testing of whether he can cross the racial divide .
Here in the valley , though , he âs right at home , where the local tech leaders and VCs have given him strong support ( see our coverage here and here ) .
VentureBeat will be reaching to other campaigns over ensuing weeks , including those of Sen. Hillary Clinton and John Edwards , to discuss their policies on tech .
A copy of Obama âs new technology plans , which covers everything from providing new subsidies for internet broadband access , to increased permanent visas for immigrants , was given to VentureBeat Tuesday morning , and I was offered a chance to discuss it with several of Obama âs campaign managers .
Here âs what I concluded : First , the plan represent the most comprehensive set of policies for open government I âve seen .
I. OPEN GOVERNMENT
He wants Cabinet officials , government executives and rulemaking agencies to hold meeting that are open to the public and transmitted with a live feed .
The CTO âs mandate will be to ensure this happens .
Specifically , Obama wants the public to be able to comment on the White House website for five days before legislation is signed .
II .
BROADBAND ACCESS
Second , Obama makes new stances on several other areas of technology of interest to Silicon Valley âs tech community .
He calls more aggressive government support of broadband access .
Specifically , he calls for subsidies for phone carriers to be given to only those carriers offering both regular phone service and Internet broadband to rural areas .
To date , carriers offering merely phone service have been able to claim subsidies from the so - called Universal Service Fund , giving them little incentive to roll out out broadband .
This is also new , in that he has nât proposed this before .
III .
OPEN WIRELESS SPECTRUM
Obama âs plan also calls for reviewing the decision by the Federal Communications Commission to open the wireless spectrum for competition .
Specifically , Obama feels the FCC may not have gone far enough with its recent ruling .
He is strongly considering advocating that spectrum on the 700 MHz band be opened so that third parties can lease it on a wholesale basis .
This will ensure winners of a pending auction for the spectrum â expected to be large phone carriers like Verizon â do nât just sit on the spectrum and not use it .
They may do that to avoid other entrants from competing with them .
Obama âs campaign also appears ready to support the right of service providers to interconnect with a licensee âs wireless network .
Google is expected to bid on the wireless spectrum .
IV . NETWORK NEUTRALITY
Obama also is supporting network neutrality , a policy that would ensure Google would nât be forced to pay an Internet service provider extra to ensure the speedy transfer of its data over the Internet .
Stanford legal expert , Larry Lessig , called me up this afternoon ( apparently under recommendation from the campaign ) saying Obama has the most nicely balanced policy among the democrats .
Obama âs plan , he says , imposes minimal regulatory burden .
So : Unlike John Edwards who , proposes to â enforce net neutrality ensuring no degradation or blocking of access to websites , â Obama would not ban differential service .
He would simply require that the terms offered one website or company are no better or worse than those offered anyone else .
This is a kind of â most favored nations â network neutrality , much simpler to enforce than one that looks to technical factors to determine whether the regulation is obeyed .
Venture people should be very interested in this , Lessig says , because â if network neutrality regulation is going to be passed ( as it will if a Dem is president ) this imposes a very minimal ( and relatively easy to monitor ) burden on network owner . â
V. IMMIGRATION
Obama âs plan calls for a review of the H1 - B visa program .
First , the plan calls for ways increased training of Americans so that they can fill the technology jobs requiring a Bachelor âs degree â thus minimizing the demand by companies for immigrants to fill those jobs .
At the same time , Obama â plan seeks to address another shortcoming of the H1 - B program , which is that immigrants with short - term visas find it difficult to stay because of country - specific caps on permanent visas .
A large number of short - term visa new arrivals are from China and India , but the country - specific cap on permanent visas means many Chinese and Indians are held in limbo for years .
All the while , they âre unable to move freely between jobs â leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by employers .
VI . PRIVACY
On privacy , Obama will call for the creation of what he calls â Public Media 2.0 . â
While vague on details , campaign managers said Obama hopes to bring Tivo - like technologies so parents can ensure safe TV viewing .
Obama also wants to raise sanctions against companies offering indecent â violent or sexually explicit â content .
VII .
SILICON VALLEY SUPPORT
Also tomorrow , several well - known local players are expected to announce their support for Obama âs plan , including two former FCC Chairmen under President Clinton , Lessig and John Roos , chief executive of Silicon Valley âs respected law firm , Wilson Sonsini .
In fact , Roos also called me earlier today .
Roos said Obama âs proposal a few days ago for a clean technology venture capital fund , to be backed by a whopping $ 50 billion in federal funding for five years , is particularly encouraging .
Finally , Lessig pointed out another issue no one is talking about â though related to the issue of open government I talked about above .
All sorts of amazing innovations like Maplight.org and Sunlightfoundation.com are building new tools to monitor government â to track influence , identify corruption , etc .
They âve all been hampered by the fact that government data ( by design or accident ) is impossibly difficult to get access to .
Obama wants to make the raw data available : â So think about all the value that gets added to the free weather data given away by the government .
This is the same idea in the context of data to make government more transparent , and less corrupt . â
Below is the plan ( RSS readers will have to visit the site , since it is a Flash file ) .

Sen. Joni Ernst and Theresa Greenfield will faceoff in their first debate in one of the most watched U.S. Senate races in the â¦
From AP :
â¢ Called for the elimination of political action committees and campaign contributions from lobbyists .
He also said candidates should not be allowed to receive contributions until one year before an election and said there should be limits on the amount of out - of - state money they could accept .
As Arkansas governor , Huckabee formed a political action committee based in Virginia to raise money for non-federal candidates that allowed him to travel and raise his profile for a potential presidential run .
The Hope for America PAC shut down earlier this year as Huckabee entered the White House race .
â¢ Said he would not support any tax increases if elected to the Senate .
Huckabee âs record of raising some taxes as Arkansas â governor has drawn fire from fiscal conservatives in the presidential race .
â¢ When asked whether the U.S. should take any action to kill Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , Huckabee replied : â The U.S. should not kill Saddam Hussein or anyone else . â
The U.S. military captured Saddam , an Iraqi court convicted him and he was hanged last December .
S.F. Chamber of Commerce supports same - sex marriage SAN FRANCISCO
It endorses argument by Levi Strauss touting benefits to business
A court ruling legalizing same - sex marriage in California would improve the business climate , says the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce .
The organization endorsed arguments filed in the state Supreme Court by Levi Strauss & Co. of San Francisco and a group called Out and Equal Workplace Advocates .
Out of more than 40 briefs submitted in the case by civil rights and religious groups , legislators , law professors , local governments and others , the Levi Strauss brief is the only one from a business .
Support of marriage rights for gays and lesbians is " consistent with our organization 's advocacy of policies that are inclusive and contribute to business ' ability to attract and retain a diverse , talented workforce , " Steve Falk , the chamber 's chief executive , said in a statement this week .
The Supreme Court is reviewing lawsuits by groups of same - sex couples and the city of San Francisco claiming that state law , which defines marriage as a union of a man and a woman , violates the California Constitution .
A San Francisco Superior
Court judge ruled in 2005 that the law violated the fundamental right to marry the partner of one 's choice and also discriminated on the basis of sex .
A state appeals court overturned that ruling in October 2006 , saying the exclusion of same - sex couples from marriage could be justified by tradition and by the fact that domestic partners in California have the same rights as spouses under state law .
The state 's defense of the marriage law before the high court acknowledges that California has a policy of equality for gays and lesbians but contends it is satisfied by laws establishing domestic partner status and banning discrimination in jobs and housing .
Religious conservative groups have mounted a separate defense of the law , saying children are better off with opposite - sex parents .
Leaders of those groups are also gathering signatures on proposed ballot measures that would amend the state Constitution to outlaw same - sex marriage and benefits for same - sex domestic partners .
The court has received the final series of written arguments in the case but has not yet scheduled a hearing .
The Levi Strauss brief endorsed by the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce steers clear of legal precedents on marriage cited in other filings and instead argues that equal rights for employees are good for business .
" Eliminating marriage discrimination in California would send a message that California promotes acceptance and equality , thus enhancing the ability of California businesses to compete nationwide for top talent , " said the brief , submitted in September by attorney Jeffrey Webb .
" Highly sought - after workers in same - sex relationships may now choose to work and live in Massachusetts and Canada where they can legally marry instead of California . "
Webb said businesses made similar arguments against state constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage in Indiana , Ohio and Wisconsin .
The Indiana amendment was blocked in the state Legislature in April .
The Ohio and Wisconsin measures were approved by state voters .
Aid chief says Taliban control a quarter of Afghanistan at night Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane

It has been " a bad year in Afghanistan , " according to CBC News , with thousands killed , including hundreds of Afghan police , and large areas of the country still outside government control .
The NATO forces battling Taliban guerrillas are stretched thin , unable even to guard key roads , and now some are asking , " Is it Mission Impossible ? "
One problem is that NATO has never fought this far from its home bases in Europe .
Another is that Afghanistan is twice the size of Germany , " with a rugged geography that dwarfs military efforts of any size and that seems to mock military planning . "
Political writer Hugh Graham told CBC that there is only one main road in Afghanistan , which runs in a circle around the central mountains and connects the major cities .
Most of the fighting has involved that road and the Taliban supply trails which cross it .
" The road is the Achilles heel , " said Graham , " and they can't really hold it .
...
They do n't have the numbers of troops . "
NATO has only 41,000 troops in Afghanistan , including some from the US , while the US has another 7000 under separate command .
The Afghan army is also considered to have a reliable core of about 20,000 .
Although the Taliban only fields about 15,000 or 20,000 guerrillas and cannot hold territory , it is able to play havoc through roadside bombings .
Kevin McCort , who heads CARE Canada , told CBC that " up to a quarter of the country ... is in this in between context of maybe having government control during the day but , say , Taliban control at night .
...
At the moment , we 're actually starting to contract in some key areas . "
Relief supplies are so routinely ambushed and looted that officials like McCort warn of a humanitarian crisis this winter .
British defense expert Michael Clarke told CBC that NATO 's greatest weakness has been its failure to follow up on its military successes .
NATO politicians play down these complaints , but some of the military leaders have begun to voice them openly .
" NATO miscalculated from the start , " CBC explained , " believing the Taliban were thoroughly beaten for good back in 2002 . "
As a result , many of the 37 nations participating in the NATO mission provided units that were unprepared for a combat role and reluctant to confront the Taliban when it reemerged in the south of the country two years ago .
This has largely left the US , British , Canadian , and Dutch forces to bear the brunt of active combat .
NATO has even resorted to hiring helicopter services from private military contractors because risk - adverse member nations will not commit their own .
Despite having over 2 million soldiers under arms , the NATO nations have failed to come up with any reinforcements for an Iraq - like " surge . "
Defense analyst Anthony Cordesman of CSIS charges that NATO members are " allowing the situation to deteriorate " because they are unwilling to make sacrifices .
Michael Clarke commented that the more strongly the Dutch , Canadians , and British indicate their determination to keep fighting , it easier it will continue to be for the Germans , French , and Spanish to avoid making any greater commitment .
" It is astonishing and scandalous that we have to negotiate in this way with our fellow - allies in NATO , " he said .
" Historically , Afghanistan is the great breaker of armies , " CBC concluded .
" Could it also break NATO ?
That 's no longer idle speculation . "

Rosemary Varley
What is it that makes the human mind so unique and us humans so different from the other species we share this planet with ?
One thing that is universally present throughout human cultures , but absent in all other species , is language .
Over the last few decades evolutionary psychologists have become increasingly interested in the role that language might have in enabling other functions in the human behavioural and cognitive repertoire .
Some have argued that language is in fact a prerequisite for a whole range of other intellectual activities , including mathematics .
Is maths a parasite ?
" Some people have suggested that the human mind possesses some kind of unique competence that is closely tied to language , " says Rosemary Varley , Professor in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Sheffield and author of a number of studies on the connections between language and maths .
" They claim that in cultures that contain maths , the mathematical structures are in a way parasitic on this language faculty : computational procedures and mathematical insights are developed by borrowing tools that are really there to understand and build language . "
There is some evidence supporting this point of view .
In 2004 the psychologist Peter Gordon carried out a study with members of an Amazonian tribe , who have explicit words only for the numbers 1 and 2 and refer to everything else as " many " .
It turned out that the tribe members were unable to perform simple mathematical tasks as soon as numbers greater than three were involved ( see Plus article Speechless maths ) .
While some researchers have read this as evidence for language as a prerequisite for thought , others simply turn the argument on its head .
Rather than lacking maths for a want of words , it may be that tribe members lack number words because they have no need for maths .
" It 's clear that there is a connection between culture and language , " says Varley , " but what is not yet clear is which way the relationship runs .
Is it culture that determines language , or language that determines culture ? "
Further evidence for a language / maths connection comes from neurology .
Functional imaging studies of the brain show increased activation of the language areas as certain mathematical tasks are performed .
" We also know that a considerable number of people with a language disorder called aphasia , also end up with acalculia , a condition that impairs mathematical ability , " says Varley .
" Brain systems show us that there is some kind of correlation between the capacity for language and the capacity for maths .
Correlation , however , does n't prove causation .
It might just be â put simplistically â that the maths and language brain areas are very close together , or that an injury to the brain happened to hit both areas . "
Maths without grammar
To explore whether maths really hinges on language , Varley and her colleagues have conducted studies with people whose capacity for grammar has been severely impaired by strokes or other types of brain damage .
" We were focussing on grammar , rather than vocabulary , because vocabulary is n't unique to humans , " she explains .
" Dogs , for example , are able to comprehend a number of words from the human language , and certain species of monkeys have a vocabulary of calls to communicate with each other .
It therefore seems to be grammar that makes human cognition special . "
" In our first study [ published in 2005 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ] we worked with three individuals with severe grammatical impairment , and checked to see whether their syntactic knowledge in maths was impaired in a parallel way .
The results showed strong differences between the two systems : people were still sensitive to structures in mathematics that they could no longer understand in language . "
Who 's kissing who ?
Varley and her colleagues asked their patients to consider reversible sentences like " The boy kissed the girl " .
" To understand the sentence , you have to work out that the boy is the active person and the girl is the one who receives the action , " Varley explains .
" There are similar structures in maths : the expression 7 - 2 , for example , is completely different from the expression 2 - 7 .
In our study we found that patients who were unable to discriminate between sentences like ' the boy kissed the girl ' and ' the girl kissed the boy ' had no problem spotting the difference between 7 - 2 and 2 - 7 , or 25/5 and 5/25 . "
In another experiment , the patients were tested on their ability to make sense of nested expressions .
Although they were unable to understand embedded clauses like " the dog that is chasing the cat is black " , they could still evaluate expressions like 36 / ( 2 Ã 3 ) , which depend on bracketing .
" These , as well as the other tests we performed , gave clear evidence that language grammar is not what drives mathematical insight , " says Varley .
This evidence has been strengthened by recent studies replicating Varley 's results .
Maths , language and abstraction
But maths is n't just about arithmetic .
Advanced maths involves manipulating symbols rather than numbers ; it 's about abstraction .
And so is language .
In the 1940s a German neurologist called Kurt Goldstein was working with a woman who , when shown an object , was unable to name its colour .
To see whether this was due to an inability to perceive colours , or to an inability to pin them down with words , Goldstein performed a number of tests using coloured chips .
It turned out that his patient was perfectly able to match chips of a certain colour and hue to those of the same colour and hue : she could match dark blue chips to dark blue chips , light blue to light blue and so on .
However , when asked to group together all the blues ( light and dark ) , she failed .
How do we differentiate colours ?
" This is the source of the notion that the language impairment aphasia is really something called asymbolia , a loss of the ability to process symbols , " says Varley .
" At a concrete perceptual level the lady was able to see two things as being the same , but when it came to an abstract term like blue , which encompasses a range of perceptually different things , she failed . "
If aphasia really is a failure to understand symbols , then an individual with aphasia should also suffer severe impairment of algebraic ability .
In a second study , published Neuropsychologia ( see the end of this article for the precise reference ) Varley and her colleague Nicolai Klessinger worked with a single individual who , before acquiring severe aphasia , had been an expert mathematician .
" We found that despite his severe language impairment , he was still pretty competent in algebra .
In many tests his performance matched that controls who had no brain damage and who were also highly mathematically competent .
We also found that the patient was slightly better with algebraic expressions containing only abstract variables than with those containing only numbers .
This is a very strong refutation of the notion of aphasia as a loss of an abstract symbolic faculty . "
Relearning language with maths
Results like these clearly point to an independence of language and maths , at least later on in life .
They may also have interesting therapeutic applications .
In another case study Varley checked to see whether language ability could be regained on the back of mathematical insight .
The study again involved an individual who retained maths , but had difficulty with language grammar .
" We drew the individual 's attention to something he understood very well in maths , for example that 7 - 2 is different from 2 - 7 .
We then linked the 7 and 2 to subject and object of sentences like ' the boy kissed the girl ' pointing out that these are different as well .
" Similarly , people with agrammatic aphasia are believed to have particular difficulty with understanding verbs .
Often they tend to neglect them , looking instead at those nice chunky nouns that have lots of meaning associated to them .
But as soon as you start neglecting verbs , comprehension begins to fall apart , because you need the verb to understand the relationship between nouns . "
The mathematical analogue of a verb in a sentence is an operator like a plus or minus sign .
Varley gave her patient missing operator problems : he was asked , for example , to complete the expression 10 ?
4 = 40 so that it is correct .
" We highlighted the importance of the operator and then pointed out that operators are like verbs .
' The boy hit the girl ' and ' the boy kissed the girl ' are two completely different things .
The verb is the glue of a sentence and you must attend to it . "
Is there a maths gene ?
To Varley 's surprise , this bootstrapping process worked .
The patient showed improved understanding of the sentences he had previously had difficulty with , and this was retained for up to four months after the therapy finished .
" We were surprised , as this was one of our wilder notions .
The analogy between language sentences and mathematical expressions is a big metaphor to grasp for any mind ; for a damaged mind it 's an inferential leap .
It 's a novel but potentially interesting intervention for aphasia , and one that could work with other language disorders also . "
A natural question is whether Varley 's work also has consequences for maths education .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that students who are perfectly able to solve a maths problem when it 's presented as straight maths on paper have difficulty solving it when it 's presented using language .
Just remember those dreaded " A farmer plants three hectares with potatoes and five with maize , how many cows does he have ? " type exam questions .
If maths is independent of language , then does adding language into early maths education just confuse the issue ?
" To answer these questions , we first need to know whether the disassociation of maths and language already exists in early life , or whether it only develops later on , " says Varley .
" There are indications of early disassociation , for example in the savant population : these are people with severe autism , who have advanced mathematical knowledge in the face of severe developmental language problems .
But before we can draw consequences for children 's education , we need more developmental work on early - life questions . "
The maths gene
So what about the initial question : did our capacities for maths and language evolve separately , or is maths a by - product of language ?
Results like Varley 's hint towards the former , but also show up the analogies between maths structures and language structures .
" One possibility is that language and maths co-evolved from some common underlying ability , " says Varley .
" There might be something about our mind or brain that enables us to acquire complex symbolic structures and enables both maths and language .
If we happen to live in a language culture , which all humans do , we acquire language , but if we happen to live in a culture which has maths , then by that same faculty we acquire maths . "
A lot more work needs to be done to test hypotheses like this one , but it 's well worth doing .
Understanding the evolution of our various faculties will provide an important clue to the riddle of human cognition .
Our fascination with this riddle is nothing new .
The ancient Greeks left us the fitting aphorism " Know thyself and thou shall know all the mysteries of the gods and the universe . "
Its origin is unclear , but it 's nice to note that two of the people it has been attributed to , Pythagoras and Thales , were mathematicians .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The United States pledged on Friday to compensate countries if debris lands on their territory from a dying U.S. spy satellite that the Pentagon plans to shoot down .
Ambassador Christina Rocca said that if efforts fail to strike the satellite with a missile while it is still in space , it was expected to make an â uncontrolled re-entry into the earth âs atmosphere on or about March 6 â .
The satellite is carrying more than 1,000 pounds ( 454 kg ) of hydrazine fuel , and could release much of it as a toxic gas , according to Deputy U.S. National Security Adviser James Jeffrey .
â Whether the engagement succeeds or fails , the U.S. is prepared to offer assistance to governments to mitigate the consequences of any satellite debris impacts on their territory , â Rocca told the Conference on Disarmament .
This was in keeping with a 1972 treaty on international liability for damage caused by space objects , which the United States has ratified , she said .
U.S. officials said on Thursday that President George W. Bush had decided to have the Navy shoot the 5,000 - pound ( 2,270 kg ) satellite with a modified tactical missile after security advisers suggested its re-entry could lead to a loss of life .
Rocca told the 65 - member state forum that the timing of the strike would be chosen to â maximize the chance of hitting the fuel tank and to ensure that the resulting debris will re-enter quickly and thus not pose a danger to satellites and peaceful space operations â .
Washington would seek to minimize the chances that any debris re-entering the atmosphere could hit a populated area .
Data encryption software
Nowadays when we communicate through Internet , send and receive files there is always a chance that somebody intercepts your packets .
This can lead to identity theft .
Every time you send your card number somewhere online , it can be caught on its way to the recipient .
Besides hackers can break into your computer and steal your personal data right from your disc .
In order to evade these problems you need to raise your computer security .
You should be smarter than those who make the same mistake repeatedly ; protect your data and it will save you money and nerves .
The other popular story when people loose data on their flash drives , stolen laptops and portable HDDs .
Sensitive data can be read from there and used harming your wealth .
Data encryption software is what we all need in order to secure our data and not let thefts use it .
Data that is encrypted with such computer security software is virtually unreadable if somebody steals it .
It is not only password protected it is also encrypted using special algorithms .
It can take too much time to decrypt data stolen from you .
This is why data encryption software can be the best choice for you .
Computer security software that use encryption
There are programs that do not encrypt data to protect it ; antivirus programs , firewall programs are all useless when your flash drive is lost or stolen because do not actually do anything to your data .
However , it needs to be changed from its original form in order to become unreadable for the thefts .
Programs like Private Disk that are specially designed for this purpose will provide you a needed level of protection .
They do not only encrypt data ; they also protect it in order to prevent data leaks from your computer .
Having a complex protection like this one , you will assure the safety of your data .
However there is different encryption software that gives you a very low level of protection so you might want to check its certificates .
Private Disk is AES â 256 , NIST certified which means that it will truly protect your data .
Private disk features a disk firewall that protects your data from unwanted access will protect your files not only from people but also for malicious programs that try to read it .
Because encrypted data can also be stolen without a disk firewall , this is why this feature is a necessary one for somebody who cares for his data .
Security software like Private Disk features many other tools like compressed backups , automatic key backups etc. to make your data more protected .
Compressed backups will also save your disc space .
Last but not the least : Private Disk protection will not slow your computer down as it does not work like antivirus programs and other firewall programs .
It acts only when somebody or some unknown program is trying to access your data .
When your computer is protected with such computer security software as Private Disk you can freely go online and enjoy web surfing .
It will not let other people to steal your data and your password and other sensitive information will be safe on your computer .
Private Disk sets up a new trend in computer security .
It not only encrypts data on any Windows PC , but also on any storage media ( provides encryption of HDD , CD , DVD , any kind of flash memory cards , iPods , digital cameras , mobile phones ) .
Proactive defense , provided by disk firewall , combined with on - the - fly disk encryption , make a new , strong and clear endpoint environment .
These features make Private Disk different among other computer security software .
Designed to provide strong data protection with minimal efforts , Private Disk has an intuitive user friendly interface .
It comes in a bundle with an automatic deployment tool , Private Disk File Move .
That makes this computer security software
A rocket takes off at from an unidentified location in Iran in this video grab from February 4 , 2008 .
Russia warned Iran on Wednesday that its development of rockets and continued uranium enrichment was creating the impression Tehran was intentionally ignoring the concerns of the international community .
REUTERS /IRIB via Reuters TV
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia warned Iran on Wednesday that its development of rockets and continued uranium enrichment was creating the impression Tehran was intentionally ignoring the concerns of the international community .
â We do not approve of Iran âs actions in constantly demonstrating its intentions to develop its rocket sector and continue enriching uranium , â Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian news agencies .
â From the point of view of international law these actions are not forbidden , but you can also not ignore that in previous years a whole host of problems were uncovered in Iran âs nuclear program , â Lavrov said , Interfax news agency reported .
â Until these problems can be removed I think it is advisable to refrain from steps , and especially from statements , that merely heat up the atmosphere and create the impression that Iran really has made up its mind to ignore the international community , the United Nations Security Council and the IAEA , â he said .
Iran launched a rocket last week it said was designed to carry its first locally made research satellite next year , showing advances in ballistics at a time when Western powers are already wary it may be developing a nuclear weapon .
Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at producing electricity .
1 . My name is Niclas and I am sitting here with John McCarthy at OOPSA .
He is going to do a talk tomorrow about his latest research and for those of you who do n't know John McCarthy , he is the father of LISP , one of the originals of artificial intelligence , creator of time sharing and he won the Turing award the years I was born actually ( 1971 ) .
So what have you been up to , what 's your current research about ?
What I am talking about tomorrow is Elephant and Elephant is based on two slogans , one is that an elephant never forgets and the other is " I meant what I said and I said what I meant " an Elephant 's faithful 100 % .
Elephant programs have two characteristics that are described : one of them is that they can refer directly to the past without in the program itself defining a data structure and second that they can make promises and are correct if they keep their promises .
So those are the basic aspects of Elephants .
My original plan was that Elephant 2000 should be a programming language that would be ready by the year 2005 , but it 's not and it seems to me that there still are n't enough ideas to completely define a new programming language , so it 's occurred to me that the basic ideas of Elephant are things that can be used to extend a variety of present programming languages if their implementers want to do that , so such languages called Fortran , COBOL , Java , etc .
2 . Could you describe these ideas and how they could be implemented in future programming languages ?
First the idea of referring to the past and as I said the example was a passenger has a reservation if he 's made one and it has n't been canceled .
Now we would like to put that into a programming language so that it would be defining a predicate " has passenger reservation " so you might have a statement or some input / output " has John reservation on Air Canada flight 761 from Montreal to San Francisco " .
So now the question is how does this get implemented and there are two ways they can be implemented , one is by compiler and one is by an interpreter and in order to do it with a compiler the compiler would have to invent the data structure for saving current reservations and maybe it would have to be smart enough so that reservations that were canceled did not have to be remembered .
On the other hand an interpreter might simply maintain a journal of the events that occurred and evaluate a predicate of " has John reservation " or a function " John 's reservation " by doing calculations involving this journal of events that have occurred .
So that would be the basic idea of implementation of reference to the past .
Now in principle one can also have reference to the future , namely a statement that the baggage handler should be ready a half hour before the flight arrives .
In principle this is different from the idea that the baggage handler should be ready a half hour before the plane is scheduled to arrive .
What you would like to achieve as much as possible is that they are ready before the plane does arrive and therefore the implementation of such a statement might in its simplest form merely refer to the schedule , in a more elaborate form might refer to other information that becomes available as to when the airplane will actually arrive .
If you allow reference to the future then you can get contradictory programs that have the contradictions like those of time travel , namely you can say : " Well if I am going to do something , then do n't do it " , but that is just a bad program , possible to write bad programs in any programming language .
So these are the main aspects , that I know of , of implementing reference to the past .
I think that anyone who actually decides to add it to his programming language that is for example to make a version of C that has reference to the past , would find further complications .
3 . Are there any specific constraints on these ideas that would make them more suitable for certain type of languages and other languages that would just be impossible to include these ideas in ?
As far as I understand current programming languages it could be added to any of them , maybe some of the ideological constraints in programming languages like Dijkstra 's bad idea of eliminating gotos completely , might offer some interference , but I am not even sure of that .
4 . So how come you want these features within the language and not in a framework that can be used from any language ?
I suppose by that you mean a framework of some structures that are implemented within the language and you could certainly do it that way , but it 's clear if you want to do it in the language .
Now the reason for referring directly to the past is to save the programmer the necessity of himself inventing data structures , compiler will do it for him and this is particularly important for languages that are to be used by children or by generals .
5 . Are there other constructs or things thinking in this area , except for the references in the past that you would like to describe for us ?
The other major thing has to do with the speech acts idea .
Speech acts were invented by some English ordinary philosophers who did n't like logic because they did n't want to learn it , but anyway the logicians discuss the truth value of sentences , so they were interested in sentences whose content was not necessarily a truth value like : " I now pronounce you man and wife " or the very similar thing " I now sentence you to be hanged by the neck until dead " and a key one is promises and a couple of philosophers , J.L. Austin , an English man , and John Searle , a philosopher from UC Berkeley wrote books on these things .
Their formulations do not exactly suit me , for example Searle in his definition of a promise wanted it to be a requirement that the promiser think that the recipient of the promise will get some good out of it and I do n't want to include that so someone promises you a table at the restaurant because it's his job to do so even thought he knows that on that particular the good cook is sick .
So in any case we are interested in promises .
Computer programs will and do increasingly operate in a social context or a business context where they buy and sell , and therefore make commitments on behalf of their owners or the people who have paid to use them so they should make only the promises they are authorized to make and in so far as it involves them they should keep the promises .
So in particular the airline reservations program that has promised to let you on to this flight should make sure that the people at the gate have the information that you indeed have a reservation .
So this has to do with promises .
There are questions and answer to questions and the answer to the question should be truthful and they should also be responsive .
So if you ask me " What 's Vladimirs 's telephone number ? " and I were to give an answer that " Vladimir 's telephone number is Vladimir 's wife 's husband 's telephone number . " that would be an answer that was truthful but not responsive and it's a little problematical to define what a responsive answer is but at least in this case it's that he should in some sense know the telephone number after the question has been answered .
6 . Are there any research going on trying to implement these things in programming languages that you are aware of , or if not what do you think the timeframe will be for these ideas to enter maybe not the mainstream languages , but at least accessible ?
I do n't like to specify a timeframe because I 've done that in the past unsuccessfully , so I thought that if I defined Elephant 2000 then it would be reasonable that it should be ready by 2005 , but here it is 2007 and it's not .
From time to time people have talked to me about implementing it and I encouraged them and they ran away and never came back , so I guess they found either difficulties or in the current situation it was n't very useful to them , but I do think that the two major advantages of Elephant , one of being able to refer to the past conveniently and the other being able to define the correct performance of speech acts will eventually be important and whoever successfully implements them will have an advantage .
7. InfoQ has a lot of readers who are interested in programming languages and many modern programming languages like Ruby are claiming big influences from Lisp
Have you seen those languages or do you have any ideas about the current state of programming languages ?
Lisp seems to be much more influential now then it was couple of decades ago to new programming languages .
Well of course one could just partly related to just natural turnover .
If you want a new programming language then it has to be different in some way and one of the ways is making things different from its immediate predecessors is to go back to more different , distant paths and this happens in lots of fields , not merely programming languages .
I do n't know enough for example about Ruby to know in what way it 's related to Lisp .
Does it use , for example , list structures as data .
So if you want to compute with sums and products , you have to parse every time ?
So , in that respect Ruby still is n't up to where Lisp was in 1960 .
8 . So what do you think of the good choices that the software industry has taken the last few decades ?
I would say the biggest thing that has been done is to make them more interactive to make it more convenient to write programs that interact with people and also programs that interact with other programs , including programs that were not written to interact together .
So the standardization of remote procedure calling for example has been an important thing that needs to be carried further and the speech act idea of programs communicating in speech acts is an extension and of course the object oriented programming was an extension .
9 . So what would you think are the bad routes that software industry has taken the last few decades ?
Of course things becoming more proprietary is a bad business idea .
In particular that fact that the major operating systems , both Windows and the Macintosh operating system are proprietary and even secret because I remember back in the good old days one could make modifications to the operating system freely .
So Linux has been a substantial improvement in that respect , but so far as I know in many respects it 's not up to the level of things like XEmacs in terms of permitting the user to add their own operating features to the system .
Now of course Emacs is merely and editor but nevertheless is does permit significant user modifications and the modern operating systems do not .
Let me give an example : one thing that I have done is to add a feature where you can put in a file , the name of another file and even also a location in that file .
And then with a single key press it will search forward till it finds its file name and go to that filename in place .
And I use it for putting references to email messages in my calendar file .
That 's just one of the uses of it and I asked about the new Google calendar file .
Can you put a reference to email messages in there ?
And the answer is not only can't the user do it , but even the implementers can't do it , but to me anyway it 's very useful .
When I receive email about a meeting or a seminar , or something like that , to be able to put a link to the email itself into the calendar file and Emacs permitted me to do that myself , without my even having to become a real expert in the inners of it , and I think this will be important .
To help research for a talk I âm giving soon I asked the OPEN mailing list :
Please spare a few moments to jot down your thoughts about the Perl language , CPAN , the community .
Even if you do nât use it .
In fact , especially if you do nât use it .
How would you choose a language to develop a new web project ?
How would Perl rate , and why ?
The OPEN mailing list is â is a community - based mailing list for the discussion of general Web , Internet and related technologies â in Ireland .
The participants have an eclectic mix of web related jobs and interests .
There âs certainly no bias towards Perl .
I âve tried to distill the key points and group them into topics .
In the process I âve made some slight edits .
Just in case it âs not completely clear , these are not my views , they are a summary of the assorted views of others .
I offer them here to give some insight into how Perl is viewed outside it âs core community .
General :
Perl is seen as a sys - admin language .
Still used for back - end jobs .
PHP is easier to deploy at front end stuff .
Perl is still more powerful and easier to deploy backend .
Too complex compared to PHP .
Code overly obtuse .
For web development Perl is losing ground to the more mainstream languages such as Java , PHP , .NET etc .
Perl is over complex and out of date , a sort of Cobol of the scripting world .
Perl has aged well .
Its no longer the only choice for tasks but it is still very useful .
Perl 6 is killing Perl ( slowly ) .
But Perl is still popular , see http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm
[ I plan to do a post about apparent significant errors in the TIOBE results â Tim ]
] Perl community has a great reputation .
If scripting language were spanners : PHP would be plastic spanners ( too brittle ) Python would be Gold ( too soft ) Perl is pre 1989 Ironmongery ( not the cheap west german crap )
I know what type of spanners I want in my toolbox .
Skills Availability :
Perl developers are now hard to find and expensive to employ when compared with the general over abundance of say ( let âs face it , mediocre ) VB .
Net developers
Whilst some might say that clients are just jumping on the bandwagon by demanding things be built using .
Net framework etc .
This may be true to an extent , but there is the logic of accessibility , maintainability and affordability being applied here .
There âs no point in having something built by an individual or small team , to find that 2 - 3 years down the line the original team are nowhere to be found and the system requires major re-working / upgrading etc. and there âs only a tiny handful of â experts â available to take over ( at somewhat large expense ) .
CPAN :
Perl has some nice features .
The best is that when you install a piece of Perl software on Linux , it works .
It is very easy to locate and download the modules you need to get it going .
Python , in contrast , tends to have modules all over the place .
CPAN is a bit of a mixed blessing .
Using it tends to fall into sorcerer âs apprentice mode and the associated dependency hell ;
Maintenance and Maturing Coding Styles :
I found that I could nât read scripts six months after writing them .
At that stage I switched over to Python .
My style in Ruby programming is so different it âs hard to be sure it âs the language ( when maintaining or extending Perl and PHP code I now backport the Ruby way of working to those languages where possible ) and not the fact that I got the language and the â Ruby Way â simultaneously .
I trust the code I write in Perl , PHP and Ruby because it âs not opaque ( unlike J2 EE for example , which is an appalling hellhole of a world of hurt ) .
My personal reason for choosing Ruby every time is that It Makes Writing Really Good Code Really Good Fun .
Or as Why so poignantly put it â You âll be writing such beautiful code it âll make you cry â .
Hosting and Delivery :
Many cheap hosting packages do nât work well out of the box with perl .
I âd love to do all my dev in perl ( and still so when other languages let me down ) , but PHP is so much more entrenched in the web hosting arena and totally painless in most ways , that perl takes longer and is harder to support .
I have developed Perl into standalone items using PDK and it runs & runs at clients sites without any hassle .
Frameworks :
Use of development frameworks is leveling the playing field between languages so it âs a personal choice and familiarity rather than any language offering that huge advantage .
I do nât see Perl as being big in the web - framework world .
It is just not on the Radar .
PHP , Python and Ruby is all that I see .
I am familiar with the Zope stack so I would use that for a new project .
It is just too much of a learning curve to switch .
Ruby / PHP / Python and a couple of others have market and mindshare ;
These guys also have really good â frameworks â for the click - and - drool brigade ( eg Rails ) .
Perl is not getting nearly as much attention as Ruby and Rails , despite the rapid development of the excellent Catalyst .
Many thanks to those to responded : Diarmaid Mac Aonghusa , Paul Grant , Dave Wilson , Paul Mc Auley , Kevin Gill , Lee Hosty , Tony Byrne , Brian Greene and Fergal J Byrne .

Bandai Namco Japan announced today 99 no Namida for the DS .
Remember Ninety - Nine Nights ?
Well this game has absolutely nothing to do with that .
The name of the new game translates to " 99 Tears . "
Under the principle that being moved to tears can have a relaxing effect , the game attempts to relieve players of daily stress by making them cry .
The game takes place in a city where people have forgotten how to cry .
One day , on your way home from work , you encounter a store named " Namida no Moto Arimasu " ( Source of Tears ) .
While the premise may seem like that of a Japanese love sim , 99 Tears is more " non-game . "
Bandai Namco has earned the cooperation of a couple of Waseda University professors to analyze a player 's personality and select , from a total of 200 stories , the 99 that are most likely to make the player cry .
Players are encouraged to play through one story at the end of each day , and based off their feedback following each story , the game promises to move players further and further towards tears with each passing tale .
There 's no actual " gameplay " in 99 no Namida .
Your entirely daily play experience consists of reading through a 15 minute graphic novel , then answering a few questions .
And eventually , we presume , crying .
An announcement issued by Trolltech today reveals that the software company is being acquired by Nokia for $ 153 million .
Trolltech is the company behind Qt , a cross- platform application development toolkit that is available under both commercial and open - source licenses .
Trolltech also develops a Linux - based mobile platform called Qtopia that includes a mobile Qt stack .
Nokia describes its acquisition of Trolltech as a way to move its cross-platform software strategy forward and also alludes to the potential for increasing the value of its S60 and Series 40 mobile platforms .
" The technology landscape evolves and , for Nokia , software plays a major role in our growth strategy for devices , PCs and the integration with the Internet ...
Common cross-platform layers on top of our software platforms attract innovation and enable Web 2.0 technologies in the mobile space , " said Nokia executive vice president of devices Kai Oistamo in a statement .
" Trolltech 's deep understanding of open - source software and its strong technology assets will enable both Nokia and others to innovate on our device platforms while reducing time - to - market .
This acquisition will also further increase the competitiveness of S60 and Series 40 . "
Nokia clearly intends to incorporate
Qt support into its mobile software platforms , but the intended scope of such plans remains unclear .
Nokia could potentially reinvent S60 and Series 40 as Linux - based Qtopia platforms and ditch the Symbian underpinnings .
The company could also potentially port
Qt to those platforms and provide it as an additional layer for third - party software development .
Support for
Qt would vastly simplify the process of developing third - party applications for those platforms , encouraging the growth of a richer software ecosystem .
Another significant factor is the inherent portability of Qt , which provides robust support for all three major desktop operating systems and is actively being ported to Windows CE and Windows Mobile by Trolltech developers .
Qt already provides a very clean glide path between desktop and mobile developments .
Developers using
Qt will be able to use a single code base to produce an application that runs on a variety of mobile and desktop platforms , an appealing prospect for third - party software developers who want the broadest possible audience .
Nokia intends to preserve the multilicensing model that Trolltech established for Qt. Developers who wish to create open source software with Qt will be able to use the GPL - licensed version and developers who want to create proprietary software with Qt will obtain a commercial license .
Perpetuating this licensing model allows Nokia to encourage continued growth of an open - source Qt ecosystem while also creating a revenue stream from selling commercial development licenses .
Some have expressed concern that Qt support for desktop development will stagnate or degrade as a result of Nokia 's strong emphasis on mobile technology , but that appears to be an unlikely possibility .
The fundamental value of Qt , and quite likely the reason behind Nokia 's interest in the technology , is that it spans the desktop and mobile space .
Implications for KDE
Nokia 's acquisition of Trolltech could have broad implications for the KDE desktop environment , a user interface and application development platform for Linux that is built on top of Qt. Most KDE users will probably not perceive Nokia 's acquisition of Trolltech as a threat since an elaborate framework is already in place to protect KDE from any potential disruptions to open Qt development .
The KDE Free Qt agreement , which has been in place since 1998 , was originally created to ensure that KDE development would be able to go on in the event that Trolltech ever discontinued support for Qt under open source licenses .
Under the terms of the agreement , the KDE Free Qt Foundation will be permitted to release Qt under a highly permissive BSD - style license in the event that Trolltech ever ceases
Qt development or discontinues its open - source version .
The agreement was constructed so that it would be enforceable after mergers , acquisitions , and even bankruptcy .
The KDE Free Qt agreement provides a last - resort assurance of Qt- openness , but it is unlikely that it will have to be invoked .
Nokia has generally been a positive influence on open - source software development and intends to expand ties with the KDE project .
An open letter to the open - source software community jointly by Nokia and Trolltech affirms intentions to collaborate and requests feedback from community members .
" Trolltech has benefited greatly from the feedback the community has been providing while using Qt to develop free software , " the open letter says .
" We respect the symbiotic relationship Qt has with the community and we wish to continue and enhance this relationship .
Nokia is committed to continue Trolltech 's current open - source engagements , including honoring the KDE Free Qt agreement , and we will seek to strengthen our support of KDE in the future .
As a first step Nokia will apply to become a Patron of KDE . "
Nokia has already invested considerably in GNOME and GTK , vendor - neutral open - source software development components that compete with Qt and KDE on Linux .
According to Nokia , GNOME technologies will continue to be used extensively in its Internet Tablet product line .
Nokia 's work on the GNOME - based Maemo project will continue moving forward unaffected by the acquisition of Trolltech .
This means that Nokia is now one of the biggest and most diverse contributors in the mobile open source space .
Trolltech has a very unusual business model and a very complex symbiotic relationship with the open - source software community , factors that will likely pose some challenges as Nokia attempts to integrate the software company into its own business .
Although there will probably be some bumps in the road , the acquisition has a lot of upside to it .
Nokia has demonstrated a very positive influence on the open - source software community in the past and has the resources and expertise needed to take full advantage of Qt 's potential .
2007 is almost over so it 's time to make a list of the Top 10 " public " BitTorrent sites getting the most traffic this year .
Mininova is out in the lead followed by IsoHunt and The Pirate Bay .
TorrentSpy , the most popular BitTorrent site last year , has dropped down to 6th place .
The list is based on Alexa âs traffic rank , and this data was backed up by reports from quantified sites on quantcast and traffic reports from some of the site admins .
Here is the list , as of December 29 , public BitTorrent sites only .
Without a doubt the most visited BitTorrent site .
In November , Mininova reached a milestone by entering the list of the 50 most visited websites on the Internet .
Alexa rank : 46
IsoHunt continued to grow this year .
In September they were forced to close their trackers to US traffic because of the issues they have with the MPAA , but this had no effect on the visitor count .
Alexa rank : 143
The Pirate Bay has been in the news quite a bit this year and remains not only the most used BitTorrent tracker , but also one of the most visited BitTorrent sites .
At the moment they are fighting with IsoHunt for the second place in this list .
Alexa rank : 147
Torrentz is the only â torrent site â in the top 10 that does nât host . torrent files .
Several improvements and new features have been introduced over the past year such as a comment system , private bookmarks and a cleaner layout .
Alexa rank : 160
BTjunkie was one of the fastest risers last year and continued to grow throughout 2007 .
Last month they were , like many others , forced to leave their ISP ( LeaseWeb ) , but the transition to a new host went smoothly and did nât result in any downtime .
Alexa rank : 445
TorrentSpy was the most popular BitTorrent site of 2006 , but dropped to sixth place due to legal issues with the MPAA .
To ensure the privacy of their users , TorrentSpy decided that it was best to block access to all users from the US , causing their traffic to plunge .
Alexa rank : 461
Not much news about TorrentPortal this year , but that probably is a good thing .
Like most other sites they have grown quite a bit in 2007 .
Alexa rank : 481
It âs quite a surprise to see GamesTorrents in the list of 10 most popular BitTorrent sites of 2007 .
This Spanish BitTorrent site had a huge dip in traffic earlier this year but managed to secure 8th place .
Alexa rank : 583
TorrentReactor.net has been around for quite a while , four years to be exact , and is still growing .
Alexa rank : 604
BTmon was one of the newcomers in 2006 , and it is the youngest BitTorrent site in the top 10 this year .
Alexa rank : 673
Honorable Mention : Demonoid
For being one of the most visited BitTorrent sites until they pulled the plug in November .
Top 5 Newcomers
SumoTorrent launched this April and quickly became one of the more popular BitTorrent sites .
Alexa rank : 1021
SeedPeer launched in September and is formerly known as Meganova .
Alexa rank : 2924
A BitTorrent meta - search engine , launched in January .
Alexa rank : 2987
Launched a year ago , it got a serious traffic boost earlier this year .
Alexa rank : 5304
BitTorrent.am is also indexed by Torrentz.com , and was launched early 2007 .
Alexa rank : 6903
Note : Alexa âs data gathering is not perfect .
The exact figures may be not be completely accurate , but it is a great tool ( especially the traffic rank ) to compare sites within the same niche and to get a global impression of traffic shifts over time .

The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) of Florida has followed the lead of the ACLU of Central Florida , the ACLU of Monroe County Florida , and the ACLU of the Treasure Coast ( Florida ) , all of which followed the lead of the ACLU of Southern California in backing impeachment and calling for the National ACLU to do the same .
The ACLU was a prominent supporter of Richard Nixon âs impeachment .
In 2006 an ACLU panel argued for impeachment .
In recent years , the national ACLU has lobbied against numerous offenses that appear quintessentially impeachable , but refused , despite intense lobbying by its members and others , to back impeachment .
The national ACLU recently announced a new motto that many impeachment advocates view as a wish for the impossible ( a reference to the current presidential administration ) : â One More Year , No More Damage . â

Election call :
It is Obama COMMENTARY
Call me a fool , but I 'm not waiting until a week from Tuesday .
I 'm calling the Texas Democratic primary today .
It 's Barack Obama .
My projection is based on the numbers .
" But the polls have been notoriously off base , " said a colleague .
That 's why I 'm not relying on the polls , although they are showing Obama pulling even .
I 'm basing my prediction on early voting patterns .
The Texas Secretary of State 's Office has posted the totals for the first three days of early voting in the state 's 15 largest counties .
Turnout is up dramatically across the state compared to the first three days of 2004 , especially for Democrats .
But what tells the story is where it is up most dramatically .
Not a bad jump , but . . .
Among the top 15 counties , the ones where Sen.
Hillary Clinton is expected to fare the best with the help of older Hispanic voters are :
â¢ El Paso , where the percentage of registered voters voting in the Democratic Party in the first three days was 2.7 times what it was in 2004 .
â¢ Hidalgo , the border county where McAllen is the largest city , where the Democratic turnout was 1.6 times that of 2004 .
â¢ Nueces County , which includes Corpus Christi , where the turnout was 2.5 times that of 2004 .
â¢ Cameron County , including the border city of Brownsville , where for the first two days ( I was unable to get the third ) , the turnout was 3.1 times that of 2004 .
So in Clinton country turnout is up 50 percent to 200 percent .
Not bad .
Big cities and suburbs
But in the counties that are seen as Obama country the increases ranged from 400 percent all the way up to 870 percent :
â¢ Harris County saw 8.3 times as many people vote in the Democratic primary as in the first three days of 2004 .
â¢ Dallas County went up a stunning 9.7 times .
â¢ Tarrant County , including Fort Worth , voted at 7.6 times the 2004 rate .
â¢ And Travis County , home of the People 's Republic of Austin , turned out at 5 times the 2004 rate , which was already one of the highest in the state .
These numbers are particularly striking in light of the assertion by Clinton officials that they are concentrating their efforts on the early vote .
It appears they need to concentrate harder .
I ran these numbers by Royal Masset , Austin - based Republican strategist and former political director of the state party , and SMU political scientist Cal Jillson , who is knowledgeable about state and Metroplex politics .
They both agreed that the turnout differential described above boded well for Obama .
But both were equally impressed by what is happening in traditionally Republican suburban counties .
In Collin County , which includes the upscale Dallas suburb of Plano , the Democratic turnout was nearly 12 times as much this year as four years ago .
In Williamson County , just north of Austin , the turnout was seven times as much .
And in Tom DeLay 's Fort Bend County , the turnout in the Democratic primary was 15 times what it was four years ago .
In all three suburban counties , significantly more Democrats have already voted this year than Republicans â a striking shift from four years ago .
Something new going on
In 2004 , 4 times as many Republicans voted in Fort Bend 's first three days as Democrats .
This year the Democrats pulled in 5,259 voters to the Republicans ' 4,103 .
" That has to be Obama , " said Masset .
" Hillary would attract the normal Democratic people .
Clearly there is something new going on in these counties . "
One of the things going on is a shift among independents .
As exit polls have shown in other parts of the country , Obama does well among independents .
And some independents may be going where the action is in the primary but have n't yet committed for November .
And some Republicans are voting in the Democratic primary .
Houston Republican campaign consultant Mary Jane Smith says a number of her Republican friends tell her they are voting for Obama in the Democratic primary .
" They 'll come home in the fall , " she said .
Smith said she would prefer they vote for Clinton , because Hillary would help some of her clients by turning out more otherwise dispirited Republican voters in the fall .
But her friends are afraid a Democrat might win the White House , and they want to make sure it is n't Clinton .
But Republican interlopers are likely a small part of these numbers .
One part of the dynamic is a dirty little secret that I 'd ask you to keep to yourselves .
Texans have done an excellent job of perpetrating the myth that we are different than the rest of the nation .
We are .
But not nearly as much as we'd like to think , or we'd like the rest of the nation to think .
The same factors that carried the last 10 states for Obama will carry Texas .

A new strain of " Ransomware " that attempts to coerce victims into paying $ 35 to unlock their Windows PC , is doing the rounds .
The scam uses a variety of premium rate numbers in different countries , and UK regulator PhonePayPlus is investigating the suspected misuse of a type of premium rate line normally used for sex lines in the UK .
The Delf - CTK Trojan poses as a " Browser Security and Anti-adware " security application whose license has expired .
Windows machines infected by the malware are confronted by a full - screen message that poses as a Windows error .
Ironically , but unsurprisingly , the malware typically uses Windows exploits to infect vulnerable machines .
Prospective marks are invited to call a country - specific premium rate number and enter a PIN to obtain a license code .
The US premium rate number belongs to " passwordtwoenter.com " , a payment processing firm used by hardcore porn sites , according to anti-spyware firm Sunbelt Software , which was the first to warn of the ruse .
Passwordtwoenter.com is registered to Global Voice SA , a firm based in the Indian Ocean island state of the Seychelles .
If the US number does n't work , prospective marks are invited to call alternate numbers including a satellite telephone number and another in the West African nation of Cameroon , Computerworld adds .
UK and French premium numbers also feature in the scam .
The 0909 number British marks are invited to call is reserved for adult premium rate lines , premium rate regulator PhonePayPlus told El Reg.
PhonePayPlus agreed to investigate the issue , after we told them about the scam .
A spokesman added that he was n't aware of previous UK cases where malware has been linked to attempts to prompt users into phoning premium rate lines .
Ransomware packages ( which began appearing early in 2006 ) typically use malicious code to gain control of user files , encrypt them , and threaten users that they wo n't see these files again unless they hand over a cash " ransom " to hackers .
The Delf - ctk Trojan is more subtle than this , the demands are less transparently hostile , and a different ( more advanced ) payment method is used .
Users infected by the malware are locked out of their whole system by malware that takes over their desktop - not just preventing them from opening particular files - so in some ways the Delf - CTK Trojan is nastier than earlier ransomware strains such as Gpcode . Â®

But chocoholics can take heart that such sweets are not addictive despite the fact many people consider themselves as having no control over their urges to eat the sweets , said Peter Rogers , a psychologist at the University of Bristol .
â Food behavior can look like addictive behavior in extreme situations but chocolate does not fit these criteria , â Rogers told a meeting sponsored by the British Association for the Advancement of Science .
Many people point to certain compounds found in chocolate -- such as phenylethylamine -- that produce a buzz when they reach the brain as evidence chocolate is addictive , Rogers said .
But many of these compounds also exist in higher concentrations in other foods with less appeal , such as avocados or cheese , and do not cause addiction despite what many chocoholics believe , he said .
Instead , a social attitude that chocolate is â naughty but nice â may actually drive people to see chocolate as a forbidden pleasure and desire it even more , Rogers said .
â In other words , chocolate is a highly desirable food , but which according to social norms should be eaten with restraint , â he said .
â However , attempting to resist the desire to eat chocolate only causes thoughts about chocolate to become more prominent , consequently heightening the desire . â
Other studies have suggested that dark chocolate contains more of the beneficial compounds linked with heart health , though experts note that the high sugar and fat content of most chocolate candy might cancel out some of the benefits .
But even health benefits do not make dark chocolate as popular as milk chocolate and chocolate covered confectionary , Rogers said further research has shown .
And the fact these favored choices contain lower amounts of the so - called psychoactive compounds found in dark chocolate provides more evidence chocolate is not addictive , he said .
â It is therefore far more plausible to suggest that a liking for chocolate , and its effects on mood , are due mainly to its principal constituents , sugar and fat , and their related orosensory and nutritional effects , â he said in a statement .
Word on the street among London music insiders is that the average price paid for the digital version of Radiohead 's
In Rainbows album is between $ 5 - $ 8 .
The earlier average was Â£ 4 ( $ 8 ) , and then the second number , discussed last Friday , was Â£ 2.50 ( $ 5 ) , indicating that the average price per album was higher among those who pre-ordered the album , and that fans who downloaded it later generally paid less .
In addition , one source said that the majority of fans paid nothing in order to download the album .
The average was driven up by a smaller number of fans who paid upwards of $ 5 .
I hope to have full sales numbers soon .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The last political scuffle of the year between the White House and the Democratic - led Congress played out on the floor of the Senate Friday morning -- even though nearly all the senators had left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday earlier in the week .
Democratic senators will hold short " pro forma " sessions over the holiday break to prevent recess appointments .
In a session that lasted under a minute , Sen. Jim Webb , D - Virginia , opened and then immediately gaveled closed the Senate .
His sole reason for doing so was to block President Bush from naming controversial " recess appointments " -- a constitutional mechanism that allows the president , during congressional recesses , to fill top government posts for up to one year and avoid Senate confirmation .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced late Wednesday he would keep the Senate open with a series of " pro forma " sessions through mid-January .
Tense talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official , Steven Bradbury , to be the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department .
Bush declined to accept the Democrats ' offer , and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of Democratic concerns about Bradbury 's involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects .
Similar sessions were conducted for the same reason over the Thanksgiving recess .
Webb wo n't be the only senator tasked with presiding over the shortened sessions .
Other Democrats -- including Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , Byron Dorgan of North Dakota , Jack Reed of Rhode Island , Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , Ben Cardin of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York -- will share the duty .

Mr Pearson had held his position for two years
Roy Pearson 's term as an administrative law judge in Washington DC expired on 2 May and the selection commission voted not to reappoint him .
In 2005 , Mr Pearson sued his cleaners after they refused to pay for a pair of lost trousers .
He said they had failed to honour a pledge of " satisfaction guaranteed " .
' Mental anguish '
Local media , citing sources familiar with the case , reported the commission 's decision last month .
However , the confirmation only came in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the Associated Press news agency .
In his lawsuit , Mr Pearson had demanded repayment for the lost trousers as well as damages for inconvenience , mental anguish and attorney fees for representing himself .
But a Washington judge dismissed the case , which drew international attention , and awarded the cleaners costs .
Mr Pearson did not immediately respond to email requests from AP for a comment .

Technique shows how bats and insects share the secret of slow flight .
F.T. Muijres , Lund University
Flying in a fog : laser light illuminates air flow .
Watch the video .
Bats have a clever aerodynamic trick to make flying easier , researchers have found : the sharp edge at the front of their wings cuts through the air in such a way as to create a vortex on top of the wing , producing up to 40 % of the lift needed to stay aloft .
â It explains how these animals are able to fly at very slow speed , â says Anders HedenstrÃ¶m from Lund University in Sweden , who led the research â published in Science1 â that showed the effect with a live bat .
The phenomenon of a ' leading - edge vortex ' is known to help insects to fly ; this discovery helped to work out how the bumble bee manages to stay airborne .
But it has nât been definitively seen before in a non-insect with live animals .
HedenstrÃ¶m filmed a bat feeding on nectar placed in a wind tunnel .
The wind tunnel was filled with fog and a laser light was pulsed onto the fast - flapping bat as it hovered in front of the nectar .
The light illuminated individual fog particles , which were filmed , allowing the researchers to get a clear picture of what the air on and around the bat âs wings was doing .
Using this method , HedenstrÃ¶m 's team have previously illuminated the swirling vortices in the wake of a flying bat , showing how these complex air patterns are different from those of a flying bird , and are likely to have helped with a bat 's manoeuvrability .
They saw that the bat was clearly getting a lot of lift with its flap too , but could n't work out exactly how ( see Bats fly like a bee ) .
This time they moved the laser to above the bat and shone it directly on the leading edge of the wing , hoping to highlight the technique used to achieve lift .
It worked .
Controlled flappers
HedenstrÃ¶m and his team showed that the down - stroke of a bat 's wing moves forward as well as down , and is tilted at a sharp angle â just like that of an insect in flight .
This produces a powerful lifting vortex .
The swirling air closely follows the surface of the wing during the down - stroke : that 's a good thing , because if the vortex moved away from the wing , a slow - flying bat would stall , dropping out of the sky .
To keep the vortex close to the wing takes some delicate wing movement .
â The bats control their wing curvature in a very subtle way , â says HedenstrÃ¶m .
John Videler , from Leiden University and Groningen University in the Netherlands , had previously suggested that swifts use the same vortices to fly .
He has seen this in model studies , but has n't been able to confirm it with live birds .
He admits to being a little jealous that HedenstrÃ¶m is first to film the effect in a live animal , but is pleased that it has now been proven .
â It âs a very strong effect , â says Videler .
" The leading - edge vortex is much more advantageous than the conventional way of lift gain , " which simply involves flapping faster .
â Slow flight is the most difficult , â he says .
ADVERTISEMENT
HedenstrÃ¶m is now going to extend his work to birds and other bats .
He expects to see similar results , except , perhaps in big animals that ca nât hover .
The phenomenon will be of use for engineers trying to make small autonomous flapping vehicles , says HedenstrÃ¶m .
But to do this , the subtle changes in the wing shape that the bat uses to keep hold of the vortex will need to be understood better .
â This shows us how we need to control the skin membrane of a controlled flapper , â he says .

DENNIS KUCINICH SPEAKS FOR ME
COMMENT #6 [ Permalink ]
... Adam Fulford said on 1/23/2008 @ 11:55 pm PT ...
I happily told my wife about how international hero Dennis Kucinich is introducing Articles of Impeachment against criminally - empowered President Bush , and how the palace eunuchs --- especially the spineless corporation - embedded Democrats -- are throwing a hissy fit over his courageous and moral action .
My wife replied , " He 's probably doing that to impress his new wife .
[ Elizabeth ] "
And , I thought , hmmm , very interesting .
If more Americans showed some " huevos " and spoke out against fascism , they'd not only be doing society a lot of good , the singles ( presumably ) might attract quality mates ( from around the world ) .
I mean , Kucinich 's wife is intelligent , ethical , educated , and , on top of these important qualities , drop - dead gorgeous to boot .
Much like the palaces of ancient China 's emperors were populated by subservient palace eunuchs and the walls were locked to " uncompromised " men ( away from the royal concubines ) , Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul , have been shunned by the media and locked out of the debates sponsored by the Overwhelmingly Fascist War - Profiteering Media .
To attract quality mates , speak out against fascism .
Worked for Dennis .
Might work for other patriotic American citizens .

I have been bashed over the years about maintaining a paper trail over the corrupt diebold voting machines .
If you really believe
George Bush and his 935 LIES , then believe me when they are counting the ballots electrically this too is very easy to alter .
Thank God someone is smelling the BS !
Please let our people vote and be counted .
Also why should the very rich be able to run multi-million dollar campaign ?
We are told that anyone in America could be the leader in this democratic nation ... but this too is a falsehood and very much a caste system where only the rich are the rulers .
Reminisent of the old days where the Monarchy ruled .
Was n't that resolved by a tea bath ?

A private off - the - record meeting was held on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that included House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Subcommittee on the Constitution Chairman Jerrold Nadler , Judiciary Committee Member and advocate for opening Cheney impeachment hearings Robert Wexler ...
Wexler proposed opening impeachment hearings on Cheney .
Conyers committee staffer Perry Appelbaum laid out instead a schedule for non-impeachment hearings over the coming 11 months .
Conyers ' notion is to hold non-impeachment hearings on " the imperial presidency " and run out the clock .
I guess that would be sort of like a dozen police officers paying a non-arresting visit to the home of a mass murderer .
Seriously ?
An " imperial " president , and you do n't impeach him , and you do n't retire or commit suicide ?
This baffles me .
It baffles me too .
But hey , we 're getting a pay off economic incentive .

The only thing that makes this bittersweat in a bush and cheney 2 faced treasonous lying murderous kind of way is the Sibel Edmonds " 25 . " 25 high level officials like Marc Grossman and Dennis Hastert were implicated in selling nuclear weapon secrets behind the backs of all Americans while that the battle cry of bush leadership was we 're fighting terrorism and STOPPING A NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION BY SADAM with a pre-emptive war .
This sale to Pakistan happened during the watch of the corrupted at every turn bush - cheney administration of mass murderers .
Oh yeh and North Korea mysteriously got the bomb .
" WHITE " white house alqueda is still in business and they still only care about themselves , increasing their secret wealth , and of course getting away with high crimes misdemeanors .
AND look the American system of elections is still a bogus lie .
No worries " they " got Russ Holt on it .
Thanks to 7 years of the people who took down building # 7 in 7 seconds without the help of their arab alquasion partners , you can bet your ace that these neo - con snake oil salesmen have armed our enemies to the teeth with the best weapons money big money can bribe .
Impeach and prosecute the bush cheney administration .
Relieve bush and cheney of their Executive duties for endangering the American people with their careless destructive policies and their treasonous criminal activity .
This in addition to waging a criminal assault against our fragile environment in crisis using anti-science to support their claims and selling off the western wild lands after changing the rules of forestry in December of 2004 .
This only 1 month after stealing the 2004 election .
Someone needs to get President Kusinich up to speed about the Sibel Edmonds case and consider introducing the evidence at the next call for impeachment .
See how Mr. bush 's speech contrasts that of President Kusinich .
Bush can take his Iraqii - Afganistani blood bribe and go fck himself .

The declining American high school graduation rate : Evidence , sources , and consequences
James Heckman , Paul LaFontaine
Official statistics for US high school graduation rates mask a growing educational divide .
This column presents research showing that a record number of Americans are going to university â while an increasing number are dropping out of high school .
This poses major social challenges for the United States .
The high school graduation rate is a barometer of the health of American society and the skill level of its future workforce .
Throughout the first half of the 20th century , each new cohort of Americans was more likely to graduate high school than the preceding one .
This upward trend in secondary education increased worker productivity and fueled American economic growth ( Goldin and Katz 2003 ) .
During the past 25 years , growing wage differentials between high school graduates and dropouts increased the economic incentives to graduate high school .
The real wages of high school dropouts have declined since the early 1970s while those of more skilled workers have risen sharply .
1 Heckman , Lochner , and Todd ( 2008 ) show that in recent decades , the internal rate of return to graduating high school compared to dropping out has increased dramatically and is now over 50 percent .
Therefore , it is surprising and disturbing that , at a time when the premium for skills has increased and the return to graduating high school has risen , the high school dropout rate in America is increasing .
America is becoming a polarised society .
Proportionately more American youth are going to college and graduating than ever before .
At the same time , proportionately more are failing to complete high school .
The graduation rate issued by the National Center for Educational Statistics ( NCES ) â widely regarded as the official rate â shows that U.S. students responded to the increasing demand for skill by completing high school at increasingly higher rates .
By this measure , U.S. schools now graduate nearly 88 percent of students and black graduation rates have converged to those of non-Hispanic whites over the past four decades .
Who is graduating ?
A number of recent studies have questioned the validity of the official statistics and attempt to develop more accurate estimators of high school graduation rates .
2
Heated debates about the levels and trends in the true high school graduation rate have appeared in the popular press .
3
Depending on the data sources , definitions , and methods used , the U.S. graduation rate has been estimated to be anywhere from 66 to 88 percent in recent years â an astonishingly wide range for such a basic statistic .
The range of estimated minority rates is even greater â from 50 to 85 percent .
In Heckman and LaFontaine ( 2007 ) , we demonstrate why such different conclusions are reached in previous studies .
We use cleaner data , better methods and a wide variety of data sources to estimate U.S. graduation rates .
When comparable measures are used on comparable samples , a consensus can be reached across all data sources .
After adjusting for multiple sources of bias and differences in sample construction , we establish that ( 1 ) the U.S. high school graduation rate peaked at around 80 percent in the late 1960s and then declined by 4 - 5 percentage points ; ( 2 ) the actual high school graduation rate is substantially lower than the 88 percent official estimate ; ( 3 ) about 65 percent of blacks and Hispanics leave school with a high school diploma and minority graduation rates are still substantially below the rates for non-Hispanic whites .
Contrary to claims based on the official statistics , we find no evidence of convergence in minority - majority graduation rates over the past 35 years .
( 4 ) Exclusion of incarcerated populations from the official statistics greatly biases the reported high school graduation rate for blacks .
These trends are for persons born in the United States and exclude immigrants .
The recent growth in unskilled migration to the U.S. further increases the proportion of unskilled Americans in the workforce apart from the growth due to a rising high school dropout rate .
Troubling statistics
The most significant source of bias in the official statistics comes from including GED ( General Educational Development ) recipients as high school graduates .
GEDs are high school dropouts who certify as the equivalents of ordinary graduates through passing an exam .
Currently 20 percent of all new high school credentials issued each year are to GEDs .
In recent years , inclusion of GEDs as high school graduates has biased graduation rates upwards of 7 - 8 percentage points .
A substantial body of scholarship summarised in Heckman and LaFontaine ( 2008 ) shows that the GED program does not benefit most participants , and that GEDs perform at the level of dropouts in the U.S. labour market .
The GED program conceals major problems in American society .
The decline in high school graduation is of interest in its own right as a measure of the performance of American schools .
It has important implications for interpreting a wide variety of educational statistics .
The slowdown in the high school graduation rate accounts for a substantial portion of the recent slowdown in the growth of college educated workers in the U.S. workforce ( see Card and Lemieux , 2004 , and Ellwood , 2001 ) .
This slowdown is not due to a decline in rates of college attendance among those who graduate high school .
Table I performs standard growth accounting , decomposing the change in college graduation into the change due to high school graduation , the change in college attendance given high school graduation , and the change in college graduation given college attendance .
It shows that the growth in college attendance and graduation for cohorts born before 1950 was fueled by growth in high school graduation .
This contribution diminishes and turns negative for more recent cohorts of Americans .

The decline in high school graduation is greater for males than it is for females .
Men now graduate from high school at significantly lower rates than women .
For recent birth cohorts , the gap in college attendance between males and females is roughly 10 % .
However , the gap in college attendance given high school graduation is only 5 % .
Half of the growing gender gap in college going documented by Goldin , Katz and Kuziemko ( 2006 ) can be explained by declining rates of high school graduation .
Especially striking are the comparisons in graduation rates between minorities and whites .
Our estimated black graduation rate is 15 percentage points higher than the 50 % rate reported in some recent studies , but it is also 15 points lower than the official completion rate .
About 65 % of blacks and Hispanics leave secondary schooling with a diploma .
An additional 5 % eventually receive a regular diploma through a variety of job training and adult education programs .
The official statistics show that white and minority high school completion rates have converged since the early 1970s .
However , the official estimates exclude those who are in prison .
We show that when we count GED recipients as dropouts ( incarcerated or not ) , there is little convergence in high school graduation rates between whites and minorities over the past 35 years .
A significant portion of the racial convergence reported in the official statistics is due to black males obtaining GED credentials in prison .
Research by Tyler and Kling ( 2007 ) and Tyler and Lofstrom ( 2008 ) shows that , when released , prison GEDs earn at the same rate as non-prison GEDs , and the GED does not reduce recidivism .
Confronting educational inequality
In the first half of the 20th century , growth in high school graduation was the driving force behind increased college enrolments .
The decline in high school graduation since 1970 ( for cohorts born after 1950 ) has flattened college attendance and completion rates as well as growth in the skill level of the U.S. workforce .
To increase the skill levels of its future workforce , America needs to confront a large and growing dropout problem .
The origins of this dropout problem have yet to be fully investigated .
Evidence suggests a powerful role of the family in shaping educational and adult outcomes .
A growing proportion of American children are being raised in disadvantaged families .
This trend promises to reduce productivity and promote inequality in the America of tomorrow .

KHAN YOUNIS , GAZA STRIP â Yasser Hiyya did n't know why he was always so weak and tired until this summer , when doctors discovered a small hole in his heart .
Israel gave Hiyya permission to leave the Gaza Strip last month and cross Israeli territory for immediate surgery in the Palestinian - controlled West Bank .
But when he arrived at the Israeli border crossing , he learned that there was a catch .
In a daylong interrogation , Hiyya said , Israeli intelligence offered him a deal :
Tell us about your brother , a wanted militant , and we 'll let you enter Israel for the operation you need .
When Hiyya refused , they turned him away .
Human rights groups charge that Hiyya 's case is one of nearly a dozen they 've documented in which Israelis allegedly have tried to recruit ailing Palestinians as informers in the low - intensity war with the militant Islamic group Hamas .
Looking for collaborators
Since Hamas won control of Gaza in a mid-June military rout of its rival , the secular group Fatah , Israel has worked to isolate the coastal strip and its 1.5 million residents .
About the only people allowed out of Gaza these days are Palestinians who need emergency medical care .
Now , the rights groups charge , Israel is trying to turn them into collaborators .
" To prey on the most vulnerable is not only unlawful , it 's also despicable , " said Fred Abrahams , a researcher at Human Rights Watch who documented some of the Gaza cases .
" It 's a slow tightening of the noose , and people are dying . "
Since June , at least five Palestinians have died after being denied permits to leave Gaza for emergency medical treatment , according to Physicians for Human Rights , an Israeli human - rights group that 's working to help patients in Gaza .
Disputed allegations
Israel 's General Security Service , better known as the Shabak , declined to discuss any of the cases or its strategy for collecting information , but it rejected allegations that it 's refusing to let critically ill Palestinians out of Gaza for treatment unless they became informants .
" The GSS 's policy regarding giving exit permits is not dependent on consent to become a collaborator , " the service said in a prepared statement .
If and when Palestinians are turned away , the agency said , it 's because Israel has concerns about their links to terrorists .
It 's not clear how many people have been allowed out of Gaza .
On average , about 700 sick Palestinians have been given permission to leave Gaza each month since Hamas took control , according to the World Health Organization .
But fewer than 200 people were allowed out of Gaza during the last two weeks of September , when Hiyya was trying to leave , according to WHO figures compiled from Israeli reports .
Hiyya , 37 , ran into problems because one of his younger brothers is a leading Fatah militant in Gaza .
Hiyya said he had never spent time behind bars and had kept clear of his brother 's affairs , something his Israeli interrogator refused to believe .
For 12 hours on Sept. 18 at the Erez border crossing , Hiyya said , he was taken to a below - ground interrogation room , strip - searched and grilled about his brother .
Fight for life
His interrogators called him a liar and accused him of helping his brother hide rockets that were to be launched into Israel .
Hiyya tried three times in September to get to the West Bank for his surgery .
Each time , even though he had written approval , he was turned back .
Doctors in Gaza so far have been unable to help him .
" If I do n't get to Nablus for my treatment , then I will die , " he said .
" I 'm afraid .
My soul is valuable to me . "
Bassam Wahedi got permission for emergency eye surgery in Israel to save his sight .
Wahedi , 28 and a journalist , said he , too , was strip - searched at Erez and taken to an underground interrogation room with a two - way mirror on the wall .
Wahedi said his interrogator offered to send him to a better Israeli hospital if he agreed to collect information on militants firing rockets at Israel .
" You will never leave Gaza unless you support us and help us , " Wahedi said his interrogator warned .
Like Hiyya , Wahedi refused the offer .
" It would be a huge betrayal if I wanted to save my eyes and give information to Israel , " Wahedi said .
If every Internet subscriber pays $ 5 monthly ; then all music downloads should be free and legal .
The Music Association of Canada cannot suck and blow at the same time .
David Boyle , Toronto
Already they over charge huge amount to buy their CDs , if only they could be practical in pricing their product , they would not be in this situation .
Steve Moore , Toronto
If that comes to pass , how and what would corporate and business subscribers pay ?
Now I wonder if Toronto Star would also ask for a $ 5 fee since I came across this on the online edition ?
Mukesh Vashi , Brampton
Ridiculous .
I have never downloaded music , never will , I 'm lucky to have finally accomplished a level of computer savy to do basic tasks .
I still have a collection of tapes for heaven 's sake ... I do n't want to be bothered replacing them all with CD , s .
So why should people like me , and there are plenty of us , pay for a service we will never use ?
Jan Pinney , Elora
I object to paying for a service I would never use .
If I want music I use a CD or listen to the radio .
Why should I pay for some strangers ' habit of pirating music from the internet
Aileen Carter , Toronto
Since we already pay a levy on blank media such as CDs and DVDs , and there is also a proposal to add a similar levy to hard drives and MP3 players , I do n't see why we should have to pay yet another fee to supposedly compensate for downloaded music .
Downloading music is already legal in Canada because of these levies , so why should we be slapped with another fee for doing something that is actually legal ?
Iris Gray , Victoria
The idea is ridiculous .
Should all mortgage payers be surcharged to help those who live beyond their means and default on their payments ?
Should all credit card users have to pay extra to bail out those who abuse credit ?
Should all car drivers have to pay an extra tax to subsidise those who evade payment ?
The truth of the matter is that the music business has brought its ills upon itself by its head - in - the - sand attitude .
Clive Warner , Monterrey , Mexico
What happens to this money that is collected ?
How can the possibly know how much a musician or song writer should receive ?
Randy Drefs , Medicine Hat
Nothing wrong with paying $ 5 a month provided you WANT it .
But I just dont get the thought process behind this ludicrous proposition of making everyone pay even if you never download music .
Are we heading towards a communist / socialist internet usage , having to pay up for someone elses losses .
I , for one , will not fork it .
Vikas Thusoo , Richmond Hill
$ 5 a month for music is the most ridiculous thing I 've ever heard of , even if you are a music downloader .
The only music I 've actually ever downloaded was Radiohead 's newest album , In Rainbows .
Radiohead chose to release the music independently and actaully let you set your own price for the online download - a truly novel idea that the music industry should take note of .
I have no doubts they 've still made plenty of money .
Shawn Vickar , Calgary
How arrogant can these people be ?
First there was a tax on blank CDs , with the working assumption that anyone who burns a CD is ripping off an artist .
How do these funds get disubursed ?
Why should Anne Murray get paid everytime I back up a database on a CD ?
Dave Kingston , Toronto
Most people have said that this fee is unreasonable , rightly so indeed .
However I see some disturbing trends in those responses - first of all it's difficult to believe that almost any broadband internet user has never downloaded any music , but even if that 's true how can you justify your " throw the downloaders under the bus " attitude - this is nothing more than attack on our freedoms and right to privacy by aggressive corporate lobbies in this insane post - 9/11 world .
Fight for your rights or lose them forever !!
Ron Dyck , Edmonton
Considering the lousy music that record companies have been foisting on us for the past decade or two , I would suggest they work on actually cultivating talent and investing in developing artists rather than promoting interchangeable one hit wonders .
People do n't want to buy music that 's disposable ; they want something they 'll still like in five years .
Until there 's better music available these companies do n't deserve a penny from anyone .
Ilana McVeigh , Toronto
As a senior who only uses internet for e-mails and Pogo games I resent having to pay $ 5 for music .
I have never downloaded any music nor will I ever .
Should this charge appear on my bill I will cancel the internet outright .
Claude Leduc , Ottawa
Having been connected to the internet for more than 13 years and have yet to download 1 song I would be horrified to learn I would be contributing to celine dions hundreds of millions of dollar bank account .
Make money the old fashion way and earn it .
Andy Vanklompenburg , Nanaimo
I do not down load or by music CD's .
I should not have to subsidise the music industry .
The Music industry does not subsidise my income tax .
Joe O'Byrne , Amherst , New Brunswick
Of course !
Music stores are practically extinct due to WWW .
When was the last time you saw line ups in the HMV store ?!
Downloading from the web is equivalent to buying from a regular store - thus , pay up !
Yana Doubrovine , Toronto
This is just the tip of the iceberg .
Now that the core internet has become a household necessity , every Tom Dick and Musician wants a surcharge put on for their particular organization .
If people are illegally downloading , then criminally charge and convict them ..
Do n't download the costs on to the normal user of the internet , like myself , who does not download ..
Chris McRae , Ottawa
This is an absolutely moronic idea .
People who have no interest in downloading music will be paying for nothing and also subsidizing the cost for those who do wish to download .
Tom Tadman , Scarborough
I am retired and on fixed income .
I use the internet to keep in contact with friends but have never downloaded any music and have no intention of doing so .
Fees for such would cause me to reevaluate my need for the internet at all .
I simply cannot afford any more expenses eating away at my monthly pension .
Judy Court , Toronto
I stopped purchasing music long ago , not because I 'm downloading it but because it is priced beyond what I perceive its value to be .
I DO NOT download music , and cannot see any valid reason why I should be forced to pay a fee to do so .
Tony Heayn , Brampton
The internet can be used to pirate music , true .
Cars can be used in bank robberies .
Shall we apply a surcharge to car sales too ?
If this $ 5 fee comes into effect I will never pay for music again .
Scott Wiebe , Toronto
So people who do n't download music will still be paying an extra $ 5 / mo ?
That sounds like a terrible idea .
The fees should be the responsibility of those who download the music - not a tax on everyone .
Jeni Ator , Toronto
What a great idea !
Maybe we can save the auto industry with a $ 5 per month Internet Access Fee .
And Toronto's budget problems - solved with an additional $ 5 fee !
And climate change ?
Let 's add another $ 5 on .
Now is n't that easier than actually confronting the real issues at hand ?
Paul Tenk , Toronto
I have always bought CDs : not once have I downloaded or shared music on the internet .
If I am arbitrarily charged $ 5 a month on my internet , what incentive would I have to buy CD copies of music I have " already paid for " ?
Gabriela Byron , Toronto
I use the internet but have never downloaded a piece of music - so why should I pay .
It 's appropriate for music downloaders - for them it 's still a savings over purchasing CD's .
Bea Klug , Toronto
Why should my mom , who has never downloaded anything in her life except email pay $ 5 a month to the recording industry ?
Craig Hall , Toronto
The idea is not bad but music comes from around the world .
What if I only listen to music from an Australian band ?
Paying $ 5 to the Songwriters Association of CANADA wo n't make any sense !
Gavin Mill , Markham
Now now , everyone calm down .
Im sure Rogers will collect the fees fairly and make sure everything is alright , just like it does everything else .
Dan Carter , Hamilton
I do n't want to pay it either , but then , is n't this the same thing as having to pay school taxes when you do n't have kids ?
Robert Guimont , Toronto
Instead of imposing a new tax , stop and think about why piracy exists ...
These entities charge absurd prices then wonder why people do n't want to pay .
If they lowered their prices , people would buy legally .
The same goes for software and games .

SPARTANBURG , South Carolina ( Reuters ) -
The resurgence of the old Bill Clinton , flushing with anger and wagging his finger as he fights for his wife âs presidential bid , has cast a shadow over her campaign and could mar his new image as a global statesman .
Former President Bill Clinton speaks during the Martin Luther King , Jr. Annual Commemorative Service at Ebenezer Baptist Church while campaigning for his wife Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Atlanta , Georgia , January 21 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Tami Chappell
On Friday , Hillary Clinton herself said her husband had told her he may have gone too far .
â He said several times yesterday that maybe he got a little bit carried away , â she told CBS âs â Early Show . â
She was speaking one day before South Carolina votes to select a party candidate for the November election , having seen her early hopes for an easy win in the state - by - state process dashed by mixed results in early state contests .
The former president , who has built on his reputation as a world figure through international charity work since leaving office seven years ago , has done what he said he would not do again -- get back down and dirty on a campaign trail .
This time , of course , he is acting on behalf of Hillary , not himself , but senior Democrats worry that the party itself could be damaged as well as Hillary âs struggle .
In Spartanburg , where he addressed a crowd of Hillary supporters on Friday , the former president exuded good will to Hillary âs opponents , avoiding the kind of sharp comments and eruptions that marked some appearances elsewhere .
â I like this election because I have nât had to be against anybody .
I like these people who are running ...
I like the people who have withdrawn , â he said to chuckles .
But the issue of his role in the campaign was clearly on his mind .
When one man stood and said : â I think Hillary âs got something that I know nobody else got and that âs you , â he responded to laughter : â Some people think that âs hurting her . â
He left the meeting without speaking to reporters .
CLINTONâS EMOTIONS
Clinton , now 61 , was known for emotional political campaigns and sometime volcanic bouts of anger during his eight - year term but has shown a new mellowness out of office .
He has energetically embraced his role as international philanthropist through the Clinton Global Initiative .
But flashes of the old bare - knuckle campaigner erupted during early contests in New Hampshire and Nevada , especially after Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , an African American , won the first contest in Iowa and threatened to thwart Hillary âs ambitions .
He dismissed Obama âs contention of consistently opposing the Iraq war as a â fairy tale . â
On Wednesday he upbraided a CNN reporter who asked him to comment on a suggestion that Clinton campaign tactics had raised the issue of race .
Clinton said reporters were being fed such questions by Obama âs campaign .
â So they just spin you up on this , and you happily go along .
The people do nât care about this .
They never ask about it .
And you are determined to take this election away from them , â he said , waving his finger at the reporter .
Video clips of the exchange have been viewed widely on the Internet .
The Dallas Morning News editorial page felt compelled to comment , writing that â there âs something disconcerting , even diminishing , about watching a former president get down and dirty on the campaign trail . â
For Americans the finger - wagging recalled Clinton âs similar gesture when on television he furiously denied accusations -- later proved true -- of his having had sex with White House intern Monica Lewinsky when he was president .
South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn , a powerful black congressman who has vowed to stay neutral in the race , told the political Web site Huffington Post that Clinton âs outspoken campaign tactics may damage his reputation in the long - term .
Commentator John Gappel of the Financial Times , said Clinton had â adopted tactics that , if he does not curb himself soon , may tarnish his global brand irreparably .
That would be a shame , not only for him but also for the causes that he has placed his weight behind . â
Clinton still remains a hugely popular figure among core Democrats -- especially in small towns in the South .
He was given standing ovations at South Carolina events where he spent hours discussing policy details and shaking hands .
Polls give Obama the lead going into the South Carolina vote , but the result , and the impact of Bill Clinton âs interventions , will only be known when the votes are counted on Saturday night .
Last night , after I claimed Obama was the big winner for the Democrats , many of you dismissed me :
Boy , John when you drink the Koolaid you really drink the KoolAid !
No .
Obama was the big winner :
In a surprise twist after a chaotic Super Tuesday , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) passed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) in network tallies of the number of delegates the candidates racked up last night .
The Obama camp projects topping Clinton by nine delegates , 845 to 836 .
NBC News , which is projecting delegates based on the Democratic Party âs complex formula , figures Obama will wind up with 840 to 849 delegates , versus 829 to 838 for Clinton .
Clinton was portrayed in many news accounts as the night âs big winner , but Obama âs campaign says he wound up with a higher total where it really counts â the delegates who will choose the party âs nominee at this summer âs Democratic convention .
Obama won more states , won more delegates , improved his numbers with key groups , widened his lead among minority voters , and over - all , outperformed Hillary .
Period .
The fact that the Clinton established machine has not been able to pull ahead should be a real clear sign of how much trouble they are in right now .
This race was Hillary âs to lose , and last night she may have started doing just that .
You will hear the Clinton camp talking repeatedly about winning the big prize - California .
Winning California is irrelevant , as a Democrat is going to win Cali in the general regardless who it is .
Obama now has a clear financial lead , momentum , and the delegate lead , and we are heading in to a number of states where he can compete .
I am not drinking the kool - aid , folks , I think I have a pretty clear grasp of where we are right now .
Obama is surging and the Hillary camp is worried .
You will be able to see it in their faces over the next few days .
Yet it is the prospect of Russia reactivating its cold war naval bases in Syria 's Tartus and Latakia ports which could have the most dramatic impact .
By raising Syria 's stock in the region , analysts say such a move could further complicate western attempts to achieve settlements in Lebanon and Palestine .
Defensive missile and surveillance systems around any Russian installations might also shift the military balance to Israel 's disadvantage .
A brief by Stratfor.com , a private US intelligence firm , said : " A Russian naval presence off the Syrian coast could allow Syrian president Bashar al - Assad 's regime to better inoculate itself against a potential attack by the US or Israel ...
The Russians would be offering an attractive insurance policy . "
The Russian Black Sea fleet 's 720th Logistics Support Point at Tartus has been in disuse since 1991 , when the Soviet Union imploded .
Yet it remains the only Russian military base outside the post -Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States territory .
Last year Russia reportedly dredged Tartus and began building a new dock at Latakia .
Kommersant newspaper said the plans were far from implementation .
But as the Kiev Post noted , the Black Sea fleet 's lease on its Sevastopol base is hostage to Ukraine 's volatile relations with Moscow - and will in any case expire in 2017 , necessitating a renegotiation or a move .
Wary of Israel 's possible reaction ( and Russian domination ) , Syria denies any intention to host a new military presence .
But in the double - dealing world of Middle East politics , such statements by a regime with long - standing political and commercial links to Russia are not taken at face value .
Syria could threaten a Russian go - ahead if its recent , limited cooperation with the US over Iraq fails to win concessions on Lebanon or guarantees that Washington will not pursue regime change .
President Vladimir Putin , involved in a bare - chested global game of military and diplomatic one - upmanship with the US , may also be using the Syrian bases as pawns .
They could equally be used to increase Russian leverage over the US - led peace process or to control Syria 's future behaviour , depending on where Moscow 's perceived interests lie .
Dmitri Trenin , of the Carnegie Endowment , says Moscow 's pragmatic - and by implication , unprincipled - foreign policymakers are " looking for opportunities wherever they may be " .
That meant building influence in the Middle East in particular .
For this reason , said Pavel Baev , of Eurasia Daily Monitor , Mr Putin was hedging his bets while he waited to see how the twin crises with Iraq and Iran play out .
One example : now that panicky Arab states are pursuing nuclear programmes to match Iran's , Russia wants its share of the resulting business in the Gulf .
Yet at the same time , Moscow is helping Iran complete its Bushehr nuclear facility .
Mr Baev said Russia was manoeuvring to profit from an irresistible window of opportunity : the power shift that would follow a US defeat in Iraq .
" In the envisaged no - holds - barred power play , Russia would not have any allies but could enjoy perfect freedom of manoeuvre and exploit the advantage of not being afraid of any oil crisis .
" Declaring its adherence to pragmatism , Moscow is increasingly adopting anti-Americanism as its guiding political idea , " he said .
Toying with military bases in Syria was just part of a bigger , bolder bid to challenge US regional and global leadership .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite the housing slump , most middle income workers still do n't earn enough to buy a median - priced home in their hometowns , according to the Center for Housing Policy .
The center , an arm of the affordable housing advocacy group of the National Housing Conference ( NHC ) , compared housing costs in 201 metro areas with the median wages in those areas for 60 major vocations , such as police , firemen and teachers .
Although home prices fell in 161 of those markets in the 12 months ending September 30 , 2007 , according to the study , home costs were still too high for typical working people in most markets .
In Chicago , for example , the median home sold for $ 262,000 .
Assuming that a buyer would put 10 percent down and had a spending ceiling of 28 percent of gross income for housing , they'd have to earn $ 85,589 to buy a home .
But registered nurses earned a median of only $ 63,938 in Chicago .
Customer service representatives grossed a median of $ 39,876 , office clerks $ 42,441 , retail salespeople $ 23,056 and food service workers $ 21,786 .
For these people , home ownership remains far out of reach .
Home ownership in record drop
" We hear a lot about the ' information economy , ' but most working families are still employed in traditional service occupations .
In many metro areas , these families continue to face home prices and rents that are beyond their means , and as a result , employers have a difficult time attracting a quality workforce , " said Jeffrey Lubell , executive director of the Center .
Nurses earning the profession 's median wage could afford to buy a home in only 93 out of the 201 markets , according to the study .
That was an improvement over 2006 when they could afford to buy in only 87 markets .
Customer reps could afford median - priced homes in 16 markets ( up four from 2006 ) and office workers five ( up three ) .
Food prep workers and retail salespeople could not afford to buy in any market .
To be sure , if the NHC study had covered the last three months of 2007 , when prices fell even more , the affordability findings would have improved .
At the same time , mortgage interest rates have declined .
In July , the 30 - year fixed rate averaged 6.7 percent , according to Freddie Mac .
Last week , it hit 5.48 percent , slashing mortgage payments by about $ 160 a month on a $ 200,000 loan .
" All the affordability components are moving in the right direction , " said Walter Molony , spokesman for the National Association of Realtors .
Indeed , NAR 's own affordability index climbed to 122 in December from 103.6 in July .
Richard DeKaser , chief economist for National City Corp ( NCC , Fortune 500 ) . , who compiles his own statistics on home affordability would not dispute the findings that many housing markets remain unaffordable , but he asserted that , outside of 1994 through 2004 , which he called the most affordable period for home prices in decades , housing today is relatively reasonable .
In the late 1970s and early 1980s , for example , when interest rates were sky high , it was a much harder to buy a home , according to DeKaser .
But Maya Brennan , a spokeswoman for the Center , said , " A drop in prices is not going to close the gap for most workers .
Prices are not dropping that much . "
She adds that places where they are cratering , such as California , the drops are coming off very high peaks .
Even when possible , and even when home ownership is possible , Brennan said , it is still often very difficult for workers .
" People are having to stretch their wages from paycheck to paycheck , make sacrifices or move farther out [ from their jobs ] to afford housing . "
Davenport , Iowa saw the the biggest improvement in affordability .
The median home price there plummeted from $ 124,900 to $ 87,000 , according to data provided by the National Association of Home Builders .
House price drop was the biggest ever
Other dramatic swings occurred in Merced , Calif. , where median prices dropped 26.2 percent , nearby Stockton , which dipped 23.5 percent less and , Modesto down 23.1 percent .
The study also looked at rental affordability and the picture here was more positive .
Nurses can afford the rent on a median - priced , two - bedroom apartment in every metro area ; customer service reps could do so in all but 41 markets and office workers could rent in nearly half the areas surveyed .
Unfortunately , neither food service workers nor retail clerks who earned median salaries could afford the median rent for a two - bedroom in any of the 201 markets surveyed .
Acquaintances describe Mr Kerviel as shy and considerate
He will be investigated for breach of trust , falsifying documents and breaching computer security - but not for fraud .
His lawyer , Elisabeth Meyer , called the judges ' decision a " great victory " as Mr Kerviel was released on bail .
Societe Generale says his actions cost it 4.9bn euros ( $ 7bn ; Â£ 3.7bn ) .
Under French law , a formal investigation does not automatically guarantee that a trial will follow .
Societe General and Paris prosecutors had been pressing for a more serious charge of fraud against Mr Kerviel , but this accusation was thrown out by the judges tasked with investigating this case .
There has been no suggestion that Jerome Kerviel tried to take the money out of Societe General 's coffers and put it into his own pocket
Clive Myrie , BBC's European Correspondent
Mr Kerviel 's other lawyer , Christian Charriere - Bournazel , said his client had committed no fraud , adding that Societe General 's chief executive Daniel Bouton had no evidence to back up his allegations .
" The word fraud was used by Mr Bouton numerous times , " he said .
" Mr Bouton held this unfortunate man up for public vilification , threw him to the dogs ... and there was no substance to it . "
The BBC's European correspondent Clive Myrie says there was reason for the defence to feel very happy about the decision .
Fraud is a very difficult charge to prove and there has been no suggestion since the story broke that Jerome Kerviel had tried to take the money out of Societe General 's coffers and put it into his own pocket , our correspondent says .
Breach of trust carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 370,000 euros ( $ 546,637 ; Â£ 186,562 ) .
' Great pretender '
Earlier , a Paris prosecutor said Mr Kerviel had concealed his trades to make him appear an " exceptional trader " , but he did not mean to damage the bank .
" He did not do it directly for his personal gain .
He acted as a trader , he certainly acted outside the authorisation he'd been given to trade on the market , but he did n't do it expressly to damage the bank through fraudulent operations , " said Jean - Claude Marin .
SOCIETE GENERALE IN FIGURES
Founded in 1864 467bn euros in assets under management ( as of June 2007 ) 22.5 m customers worldwide 120,000 employees in 77 countries
Societe Generale share price
Societe Generale says Mr Kerviel had a position , or a bet , worth about 50bn euros ( $ 73 bn ; Â£ 37bn ) on the future direction of European shares .
That was more than the bank 's value - about 35bn euros - and about the size of France 's entire annual budget deficit .
To avoid that potentially catastrophic loss the bank had to unwind Mr Kerviel 's trades , but that still cost it 4.9bn euros .
Societe Generale said Mr Kerviel 's background in handling the administration of trades enabled him to fool those monitoring traders ' activities .
It says Mr Kerviel invented deals that , on paper , balanced out his bets .
Journalists have yet to get a glimpse of Mr Kerviel
But the bank 's internal controls are being questioned .
Mr Marin says the European derivatives exchange , Eurex , questioned Mr Kerviel 's trading positions in November .
He also said Mr Kerviel told police that other traders had exceeded their trading limits .
The bank insisted it was the victim of a complex deception .
But the French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , said the bank 's " highly paid " top managers would have to shoulder some of the responsibility for the trading scandal , believed to be the world 's biggest to date .
" When there is an event of this nature , it cannot remain without consequences as far as responsibilities are concerned , " he said .
Societe Generale 's shares were down 3.8 % at 70.59 euros on Monday after clawing back steeper losses earlier in the session .
People have been encouraged to turn out and vote
Voters cast ballots
Polls have now closed across Russian regions spanning 11 time zones .
Turnout is said to have been high .
Eleven parties are competing for places in the lower house , the Duma - though it is not clear how many will secure the 7 % needed to qualify for seats .
Opposition parties have accused the government of stifling their campaigns .
President Vladimir Putin's party is predicted to win a landslide victory , boosting his bid to retain power after leaving the Kremlin next year .
Casting his vote at a polling station in Moscow , Mr Putin said that people should " vote for those people that you can trust " .

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) abandoned its plans to send a big team of election observers to Russia after accusing the Russian government of imposing unacceptable restrictions and of deliberately delaying the issuing of visas .
Russia denied the claims .
Only a much smaller group of MPs from the OSCE 's parliamentary assembly were in attendance .
That meant just 330 foreign monitors were covering 95,000 polling stations .
' Misuses '
The British ambassador in Moscow , Tony Brenton , told the BBC it appeared there had been what he called imbalances and misuses of the administration in this election .
MAIN RIVAL PARTIES United Russia Communist Party of Russia Liberal Democratic Party of Russia A Fair Russia ( Mothers / Pensioners / Life ) Yabloko Union of Right Forces
Q&A : Russian election Food , music welcome voters
The largest party in the Duma going into the elections is United Russia , and it was hoping to maintain its dominance against the challenge from the Communist Party , the Liberal Democratic Party , the Yabloko party and others .
Mr Putin is at the top of the United Russia party list - opening the possibility that he could keep a grip on power from parliament even after stepping down as president next year .
Within Russia the media is banned from referring to parties , politicians , policies or opinion polls for the duration of the election .
Eastern start
Voting began at 0800 on Sunday ( 2000 GMT , Saturday ) in Russia 's easterly region of Kamchatka , about 6,000 km ( 3,700 miles ) east of Moscow .
The fact is , they 're not just rigging the vote .
They 're raping the democratic system
Chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov
Voting ended 22 hours later , when polls were closed in the enclave of Kaliningrad , on the Baltic Sea , 11 time zones to the west .
Turnout was reported to be high , and had reached nearly 55 % by 1400 GMT , the Central Elections Commission said .
In central Moscow a 43 - year - old plumber , Muhammad Egemberdiyev , echoed a common sentiment when he said : " I voted for United Russia .
Life 's better under Putin . "
" He 's a good man , " said Polina Amanyeva , 58 , in Moscow .
Earlier , in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk , voters turned out early despite the bitter weather .
The BBC's Richard Galpin said the elderly led the way - no doubt keen to take advantage of an offer of a free medical check up and advice on pensions and benefits .
The opposition has accused the government of offering incentives or intimidating people to vote in order to secure a big mandate .
Teachers , doctors and students have reported being told they would suffer if they failed to vote .
Spoiled ballot
" These are the dirtiest , most irresponsible elections , " complained veteran Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov .
" I think the result was pretty much planned in advance , " said Ivan Kudrashov , a voter in his 20s in Moscow .
In Petropavlovsk - Kamchatsky , in the far east , Alexei Gutkin , a 42 - year - old engineer , voted for the centre - right Union of Right Forces .
" United Russia is like a return to the Communist Party , " he said .
" I remember that time well . "
The former chess grandmaster and Kremlin critic Garry Kasparov spoke out vehemently against the election as he visited a polling station .
" The fact is , they 're not just rigging the vote .
They 're raping the democratic system , " he said , adding that he had spoiled his ballot paper by writing " Other Russia " on it , the name of his opposition organisation .
Opposition rallies have been broken up , parties have complained that their headquarters have been raided , and that state media has been a mouthpiece for the government .
More than 100 million voters are eligible to cast ballots at 95,000 polling stations across the country , with about 450,000 police officers reportedly on duty to ensure order .
The history of computing spans thousands of years - from the primitive notched bones found in Africa , to the invention of abacus in 2400 BC , to Charles Babbage 's Difference Engine in 1883 , to the rise of the popularity of Personal Computers ( PCs ) in the 1970s .
For the most part , this timeline is marked by devices that bear little or no resemblance to present - day machines both in form and capabilities .
We 've had many posts on Neatorama about the newest and greatest in computers and technology .
But for this article , let 's go back - way back - and take a look at the wonderful world of early computing .
Lebombo and Ishango Bones
The Lebombo bone is a 35,000 - year - old baboon fibula discovered in a cave in the Lebombo mountains in Swaziland .
The bone has a series of 29 notches that were deliberately cut to help ancient bushmen calculate numbers and perhaps also measure the passage of time .
It is considered the oldest known mathematical artifact .

The unusual groupings of the notches on the Ishango bone ( see above ) , discovered in what was then the Belgian Congo , suggested that it was some sort of a stone age calculation tool .
The 20,000 - year - old bone revealed that early civilization had mastered arithmetic series and even the concept of prime numbers .
Abacus
Today , abacus is mostly synonymous with the Chinese suanpan version , but in actuality it had been used in Babylon as early as 2400 BC .
The abacus was also found in ancient Egypt , Greece , and Rome .
Even the Aztecs had their own version .
The Roman pocket abacus was the first portable calculating device , presumably invented to help tax collectors do math while on the go !
Antikythera Mechanism
In 1900 , a Greek sponge diver spotted a shipwreck off the coast of the tiny island of Antikythera .
Little did he know that amongst the jewelry and statues recovered from the wreck , the most precious item would be a lump of green rock with gears sticking out of it .
The " rock " turned out to be the earliest example of analog computer : an intricate mechanism with more than 30 gears and writings that scientists thought was used to calculate the motion of the sun and the moon against a background of fixed stars .
The Antikythera Mechanism , as the device was named , was dated from around 100 BC .
It would take about another 1,000 years for the appearance of similar levels of technical sophistication in the West .
Who built the machine and why the technology was lost remained a mystery .
Napier 's Bones
In 1614 , Scottish mathematician John Napier proposed a radical idea called logarithm that made calculations by hand much easier and quicker .
( That was n't his only contribution to math : Napier was a big proponent of the decimal point , which was n't much in use until he came around . )
He also created a device , called Napier 's bones , that let people perform multiplications by doing a series of additions ( which was a lot easier to do ) and divisions as a series of subtraction .
It could even do square and cube roots !
This invention may seem trivial to you and me , but it was a significant advancement in computing at the time .
Wilhelm Schickard 's Calculating Clock
In 1623 , Wilhelm Schickard of the University of TÃ¼bingen , WÃ¼rttemberg ( now part of Germany ) , invented the first mechanical calculator .
Schickard 's contemporaries called the machine the Speeding Clock or the Calculating Clock .
Schickard 's calculator , which was built 20 years before Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Leibniz 's machines , could add and subtract six - digit numbers ( with a bell as an overflow alarm ! ) .
This invention was used by his friend , astronomer Johannes Kepler , to calculate astronomical tables , which was a big leap for astronomy at the time .
For this , Wilhelm Schickard was considered by some to be the " Father of Computer Age . "
Wilhelm Schickard died of the Bubonic Plague in 1635 , thirteen years after inventing the world 's first mechanical calculator .
The prototype and plans for the calculator was lost to history until the 20th century , when the machine 's design was discovered among Kepler 's papers .
In 1960 , mathematician Bruno Von Freytag constructed a working model of Schickard Calculator from the plans .

Blaise Pascal 's Pascaline
The second mechanical calculator , called the Pascaline or the Arithmetique , was invented in 1645 by Blaise Pascal .
Pascal started working on his calculator when he was just 19 years old , out of boredom .
He created a device to help his father , a tax collector , to crunch numbers .
In 1649 , Pascal received a Royal Privilege giving him the exclusive right to make and sell calculating machines in France .
However , because of the complexity of his machine and its limitation ( the Pascaline could only add and subtract , and frequently jammed ) , he managed to sell just a little over a dozen .

The basic mechanism of the Pascaline is a series of gears - when the first gear with ten teeth made one rotation ( one to ten ) , it shifts a second gear until it rotated ten times ( one hundred ) .
The second gear shifted a third one ( thousands ) and so on .
This mechanism is still in use today in car odometers , electricity meters and at the gas pumps .
Leibniz ' Stepped Reckoner
Eleven years after Pascal 's death , German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was inspired by a steps - counting machine ( pedometer ) he saw to build his own calculator .
Leibniz 's design used a special type of gear called the Stepped Drum or Leibniz wheel , a cylinder with nine bar - shaped teeth along its length .
He named his machine the Staffelwalze or the Stepped Reckoner .
The machine was a marked improvement from Pascal 's design and could add , subtract , multiply , divide , and even evaluate square roots by a series of additions .

Despite his genius , Leibniz was so out of favor ( he picked a fight with Sir Isaac Newton on who invented calculus ) that when he died , his grave went unmarked for 50 years !
The Jacquard Loom
In 1801 , straw hat maker and inventor Joseph Marie Jacquard created a punch - card controlled loom that enabled one person to produce fabric in a fraction of the time it would take a traditional silk weaver to make .
The pattern of holes in the card determined which weaving rods could pass through .
This , in turn , made the pattern on the fabric .
When he unveiled his invention at an industrial exposition in Paris , traditional silk weavers took to the street to protest the threat to their livelihood .

Thomas de Colmar 's Arithmometer
Since the invention of Schickard 's calculator , it took nearly 200 years for calculators to become commercially successful .
In 1820 , Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar , a French mathematician , created the first commercially successful mechanical calculator .
The machine , which used stepped cylinder invented by Leibniz , was called the Arithmometer .
It could add , subtract , multiply ( and with some user intervention , divide ) and was the calculator of choice for nearly a hundred years .

Charles Babbage 's Difference Engine
In the early 1800s , numerical tables , such as for polynomial functions , were routinely calculated by humans .
They were actually called " computers " ( meaning " one that computes " ) .
Understandably , this process was filled with human errors .
In 1822 , an eccentric British mathematician and inventor named Charles Babbage proposed a machine called the Difference Engine to calculate a series of mathematical values automatically .
Babbage started to build his first engine , which was composed of around 25,000 parts , weighed 15 tons ( 13,600 kg ) and stood 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) high .
It was never completed , and Babbage left to pursue another idea , a more complex Analytical Engine , which could be programmed using punch cards - an idea far beyond his time .

his death using parts found in his workshop .

Babbage 's Difference Engine was considered one of the first mechanical computers .
Despite of its unwieldy design , his plan called for a basic architecture very similar to that of a modern computer .

The Science Museum who oversaw its construction .

In 1985 , The Science Museum in London started a project to build an actual Difference Engine ( actually an updated version that Babbage designed in 1849 ) and a printer ( also designed by the guy ) .
The calculation section of the Engine alone consisted of 4,000 parts ( this more sophisticated design called for a third of the parts required for the first version of the Engine ) and weighed 2,600 kg ( 5,700 lb ) .
It was completed and working in November 1991 .
Impressively , the machine was accurate to 31 decimal places !
Interesting fact : one of the reasons that Babbage never completed his Difference Engine was that he could n't help but to continuously tinker with and improve the design ( he came up with the idea for the Analytical Engine even before he could build the Difference Engine ) .
This was probably the first recorded instance of feature creep .
George Boole Invented Boolean Algebra
In 1847 , self - taught British mathematician George Boole invented a branch of algebra that dealt with logic .
In Boole 's system , logic operations can be boiled down to three steps : union ( OR ) , intersection ( AND ) , and complementation ( NOT ) .
Boole 's idea was brilliant - but at the time , it was criticized and completely ignored by his contemporaries .
It was not until almost 100 years later that in 1938 , engineer Claude Shannon realized that Boolean algebra could be applied to two - valued electrical switching circuits .
Shannon 's work , and by extension , that of George Boole , became the foundation of modern day digital circuit design and was the basis for all digital electronics .
Konrad Zuse 's Z3 Computer
In 1941 , despite financial hardship and isolation from computer scientists from other Western countries , German computer pioneer Konrad Zuse created the world 's first programmable computer , the Z3 , from spare telephone parts .
The Z3 uses 2,000 relays ( an electric switch ) and was used to design aircrafts .
Zuse 's request to create an electronic successor for the machine was denied by Germany as " strategically unimportant . "
The original Z3 was destroyed in air raid of Berlin , so Zuse built a fully - functioning replica later in the 1960s .

Neat facts :
Zuse also created the world 's first high - level programming language , called PlankalkÃ¼l , and founded the first computer startup company in 1946 .
Bombe and Colossus : Cracking Nazi Codes During World War II
During World War II , Nazi Germany used an electro - mechanical cipher machine called Enigma to encrypt and decrypt coded messages .
It used rotors to substitute letters ( for example , an " E " might be coded as " T " ) .
The genius of the Enigma was that the machine used polyalphabetic cipher , where the rotation of the rotors allowed each subsequent letters to be encoded in a different manner .
( For example , " EEE " might be become " TIF " ) .

Obviously , the Allies were very interested in breaking the Nazi codes .
Before the war , Polish cryptographer Marian Rejewski had devised a machine called the Bomba kryptologiczna ( or simply " Bomba " or " bomb " ) to break Enigma .
The machine was clunky and cumbersome , not to mention loud like a bomb ( hence the name ) , but it worked !
In 1939 , Britain intelligence set up the Government Code and Cypher School under the codename " ULTRA " at Bletchley Park ( then known as Station X ) , 50 miles north of London .
Bletchley Park workers included a motley group of mathematicians , computer scientists , and even crossword experts and chess champions .
Amongst them was Alan Turing , who later became known as the father of modern computer science .
To break enigma codes , Turing , along with mathematician Gordon Welchman , devised the " Bombe , " an electromechanical machine based on Rejewski 's earlier design .
The Bombe allowed the Allies to routinely decode the bulk of enemy 's encrypted communication .
Turing and Welchman 's Bombe ( Photo : La bombe de Turing )
Although Enigma was used by the field units , Nazi high command used a more secure system called the Lorenz SZ 40 / 42 cipher machines .
The Allies nicknamed these machines " Fish " and their cipher traffic as " Tunny . "
A team headed by Tommy Flowers designed and built a special - purpose vacuum tube - based computer called Colossus to decrypt Tunny traffic .
An operator would feed cipher text on a 5 - bit paper tape , which the machine would read at an impressively fast ( imagine a paper tape speeding along ) 5,000 characters per second .
A total of 11 Collosi were built for the war effort .

After the war , Churchill ordered Bletchley Park to be closed and all of the Colossus computers destroyed into " pieces no bigger than a man 's hand " and its blueprints burned .
Indeed , the project was so secret that the contributions of Flowers and his colleagues were n't recognized for many years after the war .
In 1994 , a team led by computer scientist Tony Sale ( L ) began rebuilding the Colossus .

Harvard Mark I
When he was working on his doctoral thesis in physics , Howard H. Aiken ran into a problem - he needed numbers for his theory of space - charge conduction in vacuum tubes , but the problem was too complex for calculators of the day .
The solution was obvious : build a bigger calculator !
In 1943 , Aiken and IBM created what is now considered the first universal calculator : a 51 ft ( 16 m ) long , 8 ft ( 2.4 m ) tall and 2 feet ( 0.6 m ) deep machine weighing about 10,000 pounds ( 4,500 kg ) called the Harvard Mark I .
At the time , the machine was unbelievably fast : it could do 3 calculations per second !

Harvard Mark
I was built out of relays , switches , clutches , and rotating shafts .
It has over 765,000 parts , 3,300 relays , 175,000 connections and over 500 miles ( 800 km ) of wire .
A physicist named Jeremy Bernstein once visited Aiken 's work and remarked that the machine made noise " like a roomful of ladies knitting . "

ENIAC : World 's First Electronic Digital Computer

The birth of the world 's first electronic digital computer was ushered ... by war .
In 1943 , on the eve of World War II , the US military realized that they needed help calculating artillery firing tables , a compilation of ballistic weapon settings .
So , they contacted John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania to develop ENIAC ( Electrical Numerical Integrator and Calculator , nicknamed " Eny " ) .
Completed in 1946 , ENIAC was a behemoth of a computer : it measured 8.5 feet by 3 feet by 80 feet ( 2.6 m x 0.9 m x 26 m ) , covered an area of 680 sq. feet ( 167 m2 ) and weighed 27 tons .
The complex machine contained 17,468 vacuum tubes , 7,200 crystal diodes , 70,000 resistors , 10,000 capacitors , 1,500 relays , 6,000 manual switches , and over 5 million hand - soldered joints .
The machine was so power - hungry - it required 150 kilowatts of electricity - that it was rumored that when ENIAC was turned on , Philadelphia suffered brownouts !
( Well , not really , but it made for a good story . )
When they were building the machine , Mauchly and Eckert knew that mice would be a problem , so they put samples of all the wires that were available at the time inside a cage with a bunch of mice to see which wire insulation the critters did n't like !
They only used wires that passed the " mouse test . "

At the time , the ENIAC was definitely fast : it could calculate 5,000 additions , 357 multiplications or 38 divisions in one second - a thousand time faster than any other calculating machines of the time .
World War II ended before the ENIAC was completed .
Nevertheless , the military continued to support the project ( the first ENIAC calculations were for a hydrogen bomb project ) .
The invention of ENIAC was a watershed moment in computing history .
It was the computer that proved electronic digital computing was possible .
Indeed , many computer scientists regard that there are two epochs in computer history : Before ENIAC and After ENIAC .
We owe the birth of the first modern electronic computer to war spending !
Note : Though Colossus was constructed before ENIAC , it was n't " Turing complete " ( Colossus has a specialized function and could n't be used for general calculations like ENIAC ) .
Also , the existence of Colossus was kept secret until the 1970s , well after the birth of ENIAC .
The Zuse Z3 , on the other hand , was Turing complete but it was n't electronic .
In an ensuing legal battle to break ENIAC 's patent , another machine called the Atanasoff - Berry Computer ( or ABC ) was deemed by the courts as the first computer .
Most computer scientists , however , did n't consider this legal decision as scientifically correct : ABC was n't programmable and was n't Turing complete , so they still considered ENIAC to be the first true computer .
World 's First Computer " Bug "
On September 9 , 1945 , U.S. Navy officer Grace Hopper found the first computer " bug " : a moth stuck between the relays on the Harvard Mark II ( successor to the Mark I above )
She noted it on her log as the " first actual case of bug being found . "
Though the term " bug " had meant a computer error beforehand , it became a popular term after this incident .
Hopper went on to create the first compiler for a computer programming language ( the A - 0 System for the UNIVAC in 1952 ) and worked on the development of COBOL , one of the earliest high - level programming languages that allowed programmers to use words instead of machine codes .
To acknowledge her contributions , the U.S. Navy named a ship after her ( it 's a guided missile destroyer , by the way ) .
Even if you 've never heard of Grace Hopper before reading this article , chances are you 've heard one of her famous quotes : " It 's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission . "
I 'll be the first to admit that this post - long as it is - does n't give a complete picture of the development of early computers .
We have n't talked about the contributions of Nikola Tesla ( he invented the electromechanical AND gate ) , Vannevar Bush ( who brought analog computing to new heights with his differential analyzer and who pioneered the concept of memex , a theoretical idea similar to the World Wide Web ) the invention of vacuum tubes , and so on .
After ENIAC , there was an explosive growth in computer science .
In 1947 , three Bell Lab engineers - William Shockley , John Bardeen and Walter Brattain , sparked a revolution in computing by inventing the transistor .
Computers went commercial as mainframes , and later , became " personal " as they become smaller and faster .
One thing is for sure : we 're living in the golden age of computer .
Computing power continually becomes faster and faster , and we 're finding new ways to use computers in our daily lives .

In the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan , three Nigerian men were admitted to an emergency room with abdominal pain and constipation .
Seventeen hours later , one of them died of an extreme methamphetamine overdose .
A lab test found so much of the illicit drug in his urine that an average person could get high from drinking a single sip .
One week prior , during a trip to China , he had wrapped half a kilogram of the white powder in thirty - five separate packages made from shrink wrap and clear plastic tape .
Apparently , the parcels were too large to pass through his intestine , so they remained stuck in his stomach .
By the time that the smuggler reached the emergency room , six of the bags had ruptured .
One of them was completely empty .
A report of the incident , which appeared in the September issue [ subscription ] of the Journal of Forensic Sciences , includes graphic pictures of the stomach , which was stuffed to capacity with the deadly cargo .
Kenichi Takekawa , a scientist at the Yamanashi Prefectural Forensic Science Laboratory , took advantage of the dark situation to learn several valuable lessons in toxicology .
First and foremost , it answered the question :
How much meth does it take to kill someone ?
The oldest of the three men died when about twenty grams of the drug leaked into his digestive tract .
His younger friend survived an eighteen gram dose of the same poison .
The levels of methamphetamine in their blood serum were quite similar ( around 8.6 ?g / mL if you are curious ) .
When the three men were admitted to the hospital , the staff took samples of their blood .
After the sickest of the three died , the levels of meth in his body fluids had increased sevenfold .
Other scientists have made the same observation â levels of the drug shoot up dramatically after death .
This could be very important in forensic investigations .
If a coroner does not take that into account , they could mistake an accidental overdose for a suicide .

In the U.S. presidential race , Hillary Clinton is claiming more experience than Obama .
I wonder how useful experience is when you are president , given that every situation is completely different from the last .
I can see how experience would be useful for just about any other sort of job .
If you âre getting a heart bypass , you definitely want the doctor who has done it before .
But does experience really help a president ?
First , there is no job that is roughly similar to being president .
So no one except a president or ex-president has experience that directly fits .
In that regard , Hillary does have relevant experience , in the sense that she can consult her husband more often than Obama could if he were elected .
But how often does a political issue come up for which experience helps ?
If it is the same issue that has come up for years â say the conflict between the Israel and the Palestinians â then the only experience anyone has is in failing to fix it .
Experience in failure can be useful , but it âs not a good indicator of future success .
If an issue is something new , such as the recent mortgage problems , the president has no more experience with it than anyone else .
Every war and every economic problem is completely new .
If you fight a new war the way you fought the last one , you lose .
The one sort of experience I can see being useful for a presidential candidate involves public appearances , including speeches and answering questions in debates .
Anyone who comes through the nomination and election process will have plenty of that experience .
The ability to influence groups is a highly relevant skill for which experience is certainly useful .
If on - the - job experience helped a president , we would expect past presidents to have far more successful second terms than first .
I do nât know how you factor in the lame duck effect , but is there historic evidence that presidents get more effective the longer they are on the job ?
If you look at the great achievements in history , they are usually accomplished by younger people .
Those people continue to acquire relevant experience throughout their careers but their successes do not continue at the same rate .
For anything important , experience probably has a strong negative correlation with success .
If that were nât true , all the hit songs , hot startups , and new inventions would be coming from geezers .
Obama is often minimized by his opponents as being little but a smart guy who is a great talker .
Realistically , is there any other type of experience that is more important for the job of president than learning how to be a great talker ?
George Monbiot has gone too far .
Whatever sympathy one has with his campaign against some present - day biofuels , it is absurd to say none are sustainable ( Apart from used chip fat , there is no such thing as a sustainable biofuel , February 12 ) .
A month ago the Royal Society published a thoughtful paper , Sustainable Biofuel : Prospects and Challenges , which concluded that , done carefully , biofuels could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport .
There certainly are sustainable biofuels , and producing some of them can help alleviate poverty in developing countries .
Monbiot seems to assume that biofuels can be produced only from crops that are planted for the purpose .
This is far from the truth .
We shall be increasingly dependent on what we grow not only for food but also for fuel , and for raw materials for industrial processes .
This will mean that the whole plant is used , with different parts meeting different needs , and the term " agricultural waste " will disappear from our vocabulary - in effect a return to the more integrated agricultural production of earlier centuries .
In so far as he might argue that we are not there yet , Monbiot would be right .
He states : " When land clearance ... is taken into account , all the major biofuels cause a massive increase in emissions . "
If a crop is grown solely as a fuel and on agricultural land displacing food production , or is cultivated in such a way that the emissions from producing it are greater than those of the fossil fuel , it is clearly a nonsense .
Perverse US agricultural subsidies promote this today .
But this is not the only route .
Biofuels can be made from anything that grows or was produced from something that grew .
Some " agri- wastes " ( eg straw ) can be converted to the petrol substitute ethanol .
Probably the largest untapped source of bioenergy is the organic content of urban and industrial refuse and sewage .
Obviously as much as possible should be recycled , but - although it is not easy , as Monbiot points out - the remainder can be gasified either to generate electricity directly or to make fuel liquids .
To state that " there is no such thing as a sustainable biofuel " is nonsense .
The company that I recently joined reforests degraded and marginal tropical land with a drought - resistant tree , jatropha curcas .
After planting in small hand - dug holes it then takes five years before full fruiting .
The fruit contains seed that can be crushed to give non-edible oil for use directly in heavy diesels or to be refined into high - specification fuel .
The protein - rich seed cake left after oil extraction is useful too .
Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour - intensive and needs around one person per hectare .
In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much - needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha .
Moreover , villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees .
Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too .
Mr Monbiot , there are biofuels and biofuels .
Some make good sense .

' Change ' For Our Children
WASHINGTON --
The big lie of campaign 2008 -- so far -- is that the presidential candidates , Democratic and Republican , will take care of our children .
Listening to these politicians , you might think they will .
Doing well by children has now passed Motherhood and Apple Pie as an idol that all candidates must worship .
" We will do whatever it takes to make America a better country , to give our kids a better future , " says Mike Huckabee , winner of the Republican Iowa caucuses .
" We will deliver for our children , our grandchildren and our great - grandchildren , " claims Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic winner .
" We 're going to reclaim the future for our children , " says Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Actually , these are throwaway lines , completely disconnected from reality .
Our children face a future of rising taxes , squeezed -- and perhaps falling -- public services , and aging -- perhaps deteriorating -- public infrastructure ( roads , sewers , transit systems ) .
Today 's young workers and children are about to be engulfed by a massive income transfer from young to old that will perversely make it harder for them to afford their own children .
No major candidate of either party proposes to do much about this , even though the facts are well - known .
Spending for Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid -- three programs that go overwhelmingly to older Americans -- already represents more than 40 percent of federal spending .
A new report from the Congressional Budget Office projects these programs could equal about 70 percent of the present budget by 2030 .
Without implausibly large budget deficits , the only way to preserve most other government programs would be huge tax increases ( about 40 percent from today 's levels ) .
Avoiding the tax increases would require draconian cuts in other programs ( about 60 percent ) .
Workers and young families , not retirees , would bear the brunt of either higher taxes or degraded public services .
Similar pressures , though less ferocious , exist at the state and local levels .
Schools , police , libraries and parks will be squeezed by the need to pay benefits for retired government workers .
A study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that states have promised retired workers $ 2.7 trillion in pension , health care and other benefits during the next three decades .
Only about $ 2 trillion has been set aside ; the rest would come from annual budgets .
Medicaid , a joint federal - state program with states paying about 40 percent of the costs , represents another drain ; about two - thirds of its spending stems from the aged and disabled .
Roads , water and mass transit might also be shortchanged .
States and localities pay about three - quarters of their costs .
But facing these facts would expose candidates to three daunting problems .
First : Lightening the burden on the young requires cutting retirement benefits for the old -- raising eligibility ages , being less generous to richer retirees and making beneficiaries pay more for Medicare .
Simply increasing taxes or cutting other programs wo n't work .
The problem is not just closing the budget deficit .
Second :
We can't wait .
Ideally , prospective retirees would have received several decades ' warning ; but we 've delayed too long .
We need to cut benefits for baby boomers and even some existing retirees .
They are the source of mounting costs .
Third :
Even if retirement benefits were cut , pressures for higher taxes and lower public services would not disappear .
Social Security and Medicare are part of the nation 's social fabric .
Although individuals ' benefits can be responsibly trimmed , the growth in the elderly population ( a doubling by 2030 ) and rapidly rising health costs would still expand total spending .
The increases would simply be smaller .
A moral cloud hangs over our candidates .
Just how much today 's federal policies , favoring the old over the young and the past over the future , should be altered ought to be a central issue of the campaign .
But knowing the unpopular political implications , our candidates have lapsed into calculated quiet .
They pay lip service to children but ignore the actual programs that will shape their future .
The hypocrisy is especially striking in Obama .
He courts the young , promises " straight talk , " and offers himself as the agent of " change . "
But his conspicuous omissions constitute " crooked talk " and silently endorse the status quo .
The insidious nature of this problem is that because the spending increases for the elderly occur gradually , the pressures on taxes and other government programs will also intensify gradually .
A crucial moment to clarify the stakes and compel politicians to make choices probably wo n't occur until it 's too late .
The longer we delay -- and we 've done so now for several decades , because the strains created by an aging society have been obvious that long -- the more likely that eventual " solutions " will be unfair to both young and old .
To acknowledge that and to come to grips with it would constitute genuine " change . "
ANYBODY who dabbles in transatlantic affairs has come across one giant stereotype : Americans admire risk - takers , whereas Europeans ( at least in the rich , stable parts of the continent ) are instinctively risk - averse , expecting the state to shield them from all sorts of dangers , including their own folly .
Move a bit farther east to the ex-communist world , especially Russia , and you enter a place where things seem to have gone from one extreme to another : from an all - demanding , all - protective state to a free - for - all where life is full of deadly dangers , about which even the prudent can't do very much .
Like most windy generalisations , this transatlantic contrast has a grain of truth .
Americans have embraced the fruits of biotechnology â in the form of foods based on genetically modified organisms â but Europeans see them as too dangerous for consumers and the environment .
Even in the quietest American suburb , the rhetoric of the frontier is never entirely absent : people are expected to take responsibility for the security of their own homes ( by shooting burglars ) , for their health and their financial future , in the knowledge that catastrophe looms if they make the wrong calls .
A high rate of bankruptcy is seen in America as a sign of a healthy economy â and not , as Europeans often feel , as a threat to social peace .
Americans are willing to invest in start - up companies or new financial products ; the proverbial Belgian dentist prefers government bonds .
It all flows , says Charles Kupchan , a Europe - watcher at America 's Georgetown University , from the fact that American culture is more libertarian , whereas that of Europe is more communitarian .
This contrast may have more to do with rhetoric and self - image than with real life .
In the regulation of car engines , for example , America took the virtuous step of mandating catalytic converters long before the European Union did .
But in the ( western ) European climate , officious regulators have an easier time : people are more receptive to the idea that government should care for them .
In America , demands for more regulation ( of the internet , or air quality , say ) have often been presented as calls to protect children ; it 's assumed that adults can fend for themselves .
On either side of the Atlantic , of course , the regulator 's zeal can suddenly increase after an unforeseen event .
The licensing of medicine by America 's Food and Drug Administration has become slower since 2004 when a pain - killer , Vioxx , was withdrawn by its maker , Merck , because it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
But in America 's regulation wars , there will always be lots of people who point out that caution can also cost lives .
Psychologically at least , Europe is an easier place to make the case for being careful .
In any case , by comparison with most other parts of the world , and with any other era of human history , the United States and western Europe are converging in their attitudes to danger .
Most kinds of risk have been successfully removed from everyday life .
Women hardly ever die in childbirth ; miners generally make it back above ground ; fishermen usually return to shore ; and having a drink of water no longer means dicing with cholera .
Of course , some people â bungee - jumpers and rock - climbers â take risks freely ; but the unwanted perils that once haunted people 's lives are mostly a thing of the past .
What Americans and Europeans alike are now attempting to do is squeeze out the last few drops of risk , with results that are often counter - productive , because risk is simply transferred from one place to another .
That is true in an obvious sense when , for example , companies dump toxic waste or use risky technologies in countries whose regulation is relatively lax .
But there are also more subtle ways in which efforts to eliminate risk can simply move the danger along .
Some good instances come from behaviour on the roads , where people may act more recklessly as safety measures ( their own and other people 's ) make them bolder .
In one experiment , a British psychologist , Ian Walker of Bath University , simply got on his bicycle and monitored the behaviour of 2,300 vehicles that overtook him .
When he wore a helmet , drivers were much more likely to zoom past him with little room to spare ; when he was bare - headed ( and indeed when he wore a female wig ) the amount of space that motorists left would increase .
An experiment in Munich found that the drivers of taxicabs fitted with anti-lock braking systems were involved in no fewer accidents than those without .
That is because the former used those superior brakes not to practise prudence but to drive more aggressively .
Such unintended effects are not confined to Europe .
John Adams , a transport expert at University College London , has compiled data from all over the world to show that laws making drivers wear seatbelts do not make roads safer ; they move deaths from inside cars to outside them because they encourage bad driving .
The number of young children killed on the roads has fallen in recent years , he notes â but mainly because they are rarely allowed out alone , so today 's teenagers have less skill at navigating hazardous roads ; and as a result , the number of teenagers killed in car accidents has jumped .
He lauds the Dutch experiment in â naked streets â where most road signs and markings were removed to force travellers to keep their wits about them .
Where America and Europe may differ is in the main cause of their risk - reducing zeal .
America 's proverbially litigious culture makes all players in the public arena , be they government agencies , companies or schools , intensely keen to delimit their responsibilities , and within those limits to minimise the risk of liability .
To many Europeans , an â ambulance - chasing â legal environment , which sees every mishap as an opportunity for a lawsuit , is an unwelcome pathology that has spread in their direction from the United States .
But Europe has pathologies of its own , especially that of the over - ambitious bureaucracy , such as the European Union agencies that regulate food and the environment .
In the wilder fringes of the EU there are citizens who understandably trust the Brussels mandarins to monitor their beaches and air more fairly than their own country 's bureaucrats ever would .
So regulatory zeal becomes a source of legitimacy for EU institutions that badly need it .
Mission creep is not peculiar to Brussels .
All bureaucracies are keen to survive and , if possible , grow .
For survival , it is useful to estimate the level of the risks they are supposed to manage at close to , but not quite , zero .
Higher and the institution may be regarded as failing ; lower and it may be regarded as unnecessary .
And growth can be achieved by bringing more risks within their remit .
Britain 's Food Standards
Agency , for example , has decided to target not only the traditional problems of contamination by microbes or poisons , but what it calls the â downstream risks â of food : what people choose to eat .
The agency is now introducing a food - labelling scheme with what its chairman , Dame Deirdre Hutton , says is the â absolutely intended consequence of getting manufacturers to change their products â .
This reflects a mentality that refuses to see the overweight as fallible gluttons : now they are victims facing a risk which the government has a solemn duty to abate .
On both sides of the Atlantic , the net result is the same : a huge risk - avoidance endeavour which reflects the illusion that everyday life can be made almost perfectly safe .
Whenever something bad happens â a child has an accident on a school trip ; a window - cleaner falls off a ladder â the immediate call is for something to be done , and if the state does n't oblige , lawyers will .
Discontent with this state of affairs is no monopoly of the rugged American : some Europeans are worried too .
Nils Brunsson , a professor of management at the Stockholm School of Economics , says muddled ideas about risk and regulation need correction by a third R : responsibility .
â If you want responsibility , you take decisions , â he says .
â If you do n't , you get others to make decisions , and then say you had no choice . â
Some people , of course , find cruder and less rational ways of protesting against the search for a risk - free life .
All over the rich world , there are parents who leave the child - proof lids off medicines because they find them so fiddly , and office workers so irritated by self - closing fire doors that they prop them open .
But those cultural differences persist .
Americans who move to western Europe are often dismayed by a mentality that seems wary of technological or social innovation : they sense a resistance to â rocking the boat â by any actions whose effects are unpredictable .
Europeans who settle in the United States are at once frightened and exhilarated by a place where people may yearn for a life free of risk ( inside gated communities , for example ) but know in their hearts they can never get it .
At the same time , both those shocks are mild compared to the one experienced by Westerners who move to Russia â and find themselves in a place where life is so full of lethal danger that some people see little point in reducing risk at the margins : a world of gaping pot-holes , tipsy ambulance - drivers and melting icicles which hang from ledges like daggers .
The idea of regulators caring for the public in an accountable way , or of courts where a humble citizen can seek redress , would sound naive to many Russians .
In a land where life expectancy ( at 59 for males , lower than in Guatemala or Bangladesh ) is lamentably short , people apparently see little value in driving slowly , or in cutting down on alcohol or tobacco .
Raw political power and / or hard cash are assumed to trump every other kind of authority , including the courts .
But that does not mean that Russians are totally irrational in their choices .
Individuals or firms that openly flout the law may do so in the well - founded belief that they are too powerful for the law to touch them .
If people are prudent enough to settle their debts , it is not through fear of prosecution , but because much more unpleasant forms of private revenge may be in store .
And as Mark Kirsh , a British lawyer in Moscow , points out , Russians are making a logical calculation when they rely more on friends than on state agencies or courts .
Few Americans or west Europeans would trade their relatively risk - free existence for the tingling dice with death that can go with daily life in Russia .
But many would endorse the insistence of the Russian writer , Fyodor Dostoyevsky , on the sanctity of the right to incur danger : â What man wants is simply independent choice , whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead . â
Being reckless from time to time preserves what is â most precious and most important â that is , our personality , our individuality . â

Affectionate Writing Can Reduce Cholesterol
[ Photo by phil h ]
According to new research , writing down affectionate thoughts about close friends and family can reduce your cholesterol levels .
Floyd et al. ( 2007 ) randomly assigned participants to one of two groups : one experimental and one control .
The experimental group wrote with affection about one person in their lives for 20 minutes on three occasions over a five - week period .
The control group wrote mundane descriptions of their activities over the week , jobs they had done and places they had lived .
The results from two separate studies demonstrated that after only 25 days , the experimental group who had written affectionate notes , showed a significant reduction in cholesterol .
These reductions were seen independently from the effects of general health factors like age , drinking , smoking and so on .
Mean cholesterol levels reduced from 170 mg / dL to 159 mg / dL ( figures are from the second study which was methodologically more secure ) .
The researchers also examined whether linguistic features of the experimental group âs writing affected cholesterol reduction .
They found that those who wrote directly to someone showed greater reductions in cholesterol than those who wrote in the third person about someone .
One of the strengths of this study was that it specifically examined the benefits of expressing affection .
Other studies have found evidence for the benefits of expressing affection but have had difficulties separating the expressing from the receiving .
This is because when you express affection towards someone else , they are likely to reciprocate .
Expressing is , therefore , tightly bound up with receiving .
In an age where human nature is often considered profoundly selfish , here âs a selfish reason to be nice to people .
Of course compared with all the money - spinning methods of reducing cholesterol levels around nowadays , you âll never see this one advertised ( except on PsyBlog ! ) because it âs essentially free .
So , pass it on â¦
Caution
These are preliminary results .
The research was carried out in a small sample ( Study 1 , N=34 ; Study 2 , N=30 ) of healthy US college students all in the normal range for cholesterol .
More research will be required to see if this generalises across cultures , overall health status and so on .
On the other hand , the possible side - effects of writing affectionate letters are not that worrying , unless you count paper cuts .

Like every single woman , I walk through life asking : what do men want ?
Why are my beautiful , clever female friends living alone , watching DVDs and eating cupcakes , like a gaggle of rancid Bridget Joneses ?
Why does the loneliness never end ( Â© Charlotte Bronte 1855 ) ?
A month ago , as moonlight splashed across my pillow , I devised an experiment to find the definitive answer .
I decided to attend a speed - dating night as a fabulously successful , dazzlingly literate human rights lawyer , and then another as a gibbering idiot who works as a florist .
Who would the men fall for ?
As a lawyer , I walked into a Soho bar .
My first date appeared .
I smiled at him , and said : " I am a human rights lawyer ( grin ) . "
" I work 60 hours a week ( grin ) . "
And watched him shrivel up .
" I 'm an engineer , " he said ( no grin ) .
And then he was silent , so I told him I was reading Heidegger .
He stared at me as if I had told him that I boil men's heads .
Then came Eric , and I invented a PhD in economics from Cambridge .
" It was incredibly rewarding .
Are you interested in economics , Eric ? "
He was n't ; he slunk off , and was replaced by Tony .
I told him I have two cats and he looked hopeful .
" What are they called ? " " Roe and Wade , after the United States supreme court case that resulted in the legalisation of abortion . "
No smile after that , just a chair where a man had been .
I fought about the Arab - Israeli conflict with No 11 , and about shoes with No 13 .
" My shoes are leather , " he said , " but they have holes in them . "
" Do n't buy leather shoes , " I replied , refusing to pout , while he looked at me as if I 'd shot him .
And this , from No 18 : " You really scare me . "
Word had spread about the monster on Table 17 - my final date did n't show .
The florist , who I modelled on Melinda Messenger spliced with a teasmaid , went to a " lock and key " party .
Alan approached .
" Hello , " he smiled .
" I 'm confused by the game , " I told him .
" Please explain it . "
And he did .
Happily .
" What do you do , " I asked ( giggle ) .
" I am a geneticist , " he said .
" What is that , " I asked ( giggle ) .
He told me , and I looked impressed and uncomprehending .
I raised my voice an octave , until it was a squeak .
I stared at the floor , twisted my hands , and gibbered at him .
" I cut the thorns off roses , " I said .
" I tie bows .
I sweep floors . "
He replied : " I 'll email you . "
I bagged one with my florist net !
Then came Robert .
" I 'm a florist , " I smiled .
The reaction was instantaneous , passionate and almost molecular : " Can I buy you a drink ? "
Then came Harry .
" Let 's not talk about me , " I said .
Bang - he asked me out .
Just like that .
On the spot .
I never knew it could be like this .
Tom suggested we sit down .
" Where do you want to sit , " I asked .
" In a chair ?
Is that a chair ( giggle ) ? "
By the end of our conversation I was opening my own florist's .
And he was in love .
I went on and on , loving the strange , new attention , saying the sort of things a fish would say if it could talk : " Why is water wet ? "
I could have been engaged by 11.17 pm .
But instead I went home and sifted through the evidence .
Only one in 20 of the men I met on the Soho love coalface wanted to date a woman who had heard of Proust ( 19 of out 20 cats do n't prefer it ) .
Yet eight out of the florist 's 12 men wanted to be gibbered at again and again and again .
Everything my mother has ever told me about men is true .
They did n't care that the florist could n't recognise a chair .
They liked it .
The feminist revolution did n't pierce their hearts ; it only made it into human resources .
If you want to be loved , just scoop out your brain and act like a child .
After 40 years of feminism we should n't really burn our bras .
We should burn our men .
Love may be dissembled but statistics never lie .
Reader , let me tell you : men want me - and you - to be lobotomised .

We have now reached the confines of the Scottish Diet and enter Deep - Frying Hell .
Yea who enter here , abandon all hope and come to behold this new wonder - the deep - fried cheeseburger .
We have now reached the confines of the Scottish Diet and enter Deep - Frying Hell .
Yea who enter here , abandon all hope and come to behold this new wonder - the deep - fried cheeseburger .
The Scottish Diet is an ingenious nutritional system invented by the Scots to keep their pension funds in balance by reducing the number of people who make it beyond the age of 60 .
like many of the world 's smartest inventions ( most of them invented by the Scots ) , it is devilishly simple .
It increases the premature death rate through a well - balanced diet :
The Scottish Diet
Â« Any and all thing you can eat
But this proportion always heed :
A third from fat
A third from sugar
A third from alcohol
From time to time , you can eat a small amount of fruits , in the form of jams or preserves , or even better , distilled . Â»
Before we start the holiday season , let us have a glimpse in the next life and see what awaits us gluttoons in the Third Circle of Hell , the place no liver ever returned form .
These two discs of frozen meat contain processed cheese .
This is the core of a Scottish deep - fried cheeseburger .
The meat has small alveoles so the batter will stick better .
The Scots have given up using buns because of their low nutritional value .
Instead , the cheeseburger is dipped into a batter specially designed to soak up as much fat as possible , in accordance with the principles of the Scottish Diet .
A real artisan food , the cheesburger is then dipped by hand into a vat of boiling oil smartly flavored by the ton of fish who ended their life in it .

This is n't the first time BillO has attacked Arianna and obviously it wo n't be his last .
You see , the conservative media is a bit unnerved right now and are acting like fools as is evident by this latest Factor smear .
He 's upset because some idiots left vile comments about Nancy Reagan which is unfortunate on the Huff Po , but happens on the internet , as all of us know .
It 's very difficult to get them all .

O'Reilly : I have no respect for the woman .
I think that she is hurting the country ...
O'Reilly : What 's the difference between the KKK and Arianna Huffington ?
What 's the difference ?
Ham : I think there is a difference , .
O'Reilly : I do n't see any difference between Huffington and the Nazis .
It 's her , It 's her , It 's her ... I did n't say she 's a Nazi .
Ham : Alright .
O'Reilly :
There 's no difference between what the two do .
Say , what ?
OMG .
What the heck is he talking about ?
Yea , Bill , if Arianna actually had a hand in genocide , you poor ignorant fool --- you might try to say they took similar actions , but let 's look at you .
O'Reilly says Americans should start holding people accountable for what they say , so I think Billo should be fired for saying this about Michelle Obama :
OâReilly : â I do nât want to go on a lynching party against Michelle Obama unless there âs evidence , hard facts , that say this is how the woman really feels ...
And he still has a job ?
He has the audacity to compare Arianna to the KKK and then want to lynch Michelle Obama if he feels she was n't jingoistic enough .
Jesse Jackson brought up BillO 's rant on MSNBC after Tuesday 's debate and said that this type of rhetoric can lead to violent episodes in our country .
I spoke with Arianna about it last night and she feels he really crossed the line .
He 's been crossing the line for years now , but nobody ever called him on it before the blogs showed up .
Hey Bill , we 're not going anywhere .
I wonder if he 'll go to Sylvia 's and discuss lynching Michelle Obama with FOX's Juan Williams .
At least Mary Katharine Ham pulls back from this one .
You may not agree with all of Arianna 's politics , but where she 's full of grace and elegance --- O'Reilly is an angry , pathetic , right wing media parasite .
Print that , Howard Kurtz .
We did an excellent job helping Jane with the letter writing campaign about the AP in conjunction with FDL .
It works .
( Hint , hint . )
He will continually go after the left in this sick , sick fashion .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) I do n't think Billo knows who he 's dealing with :
For years the message drummed into Bud Harris , 78 , and his grandson David Moreira , 27 , was conserve , conserve .
And conserve they did , along with thousands of others across the GTA , watering their lawn less , replacing old toilets and installing water - efficient showerheads .
" We are trying to be economical and trying to do it to preserve the Earth as well , " said Moreira , a locksmith who lives with his retired grandfather in a 1950s - era subdivision in Mississauga .
They 've done all the right things , he says , 70 per cent for economic reasons and 30 per cent for environmental reasons .
But that win -win sentiment belies an inconvenient truth â one that came out in a recent unguarded comment from Durham Region 's works czar , Cliff Curtis .
Asked about declining water consumption , he told the Star :
" Conservation is killing us . "
Realizing what he'd just said , Curtis smiled broadly and quickly added that there were , of course , a thousand reasons to conserve .
But one thing is certain : Conservation is putting cash - strapped municipalities in a bit of a pickle .
Tougher post - Walkerton regulations , growing communities and a rising backlog of crumbling pipes needing to be fixed are driving up costs even while diligent consumers are lowering their consumption and the size of their bills .
Toronto alone is facing about $ 800 million worth of repair and replacement work , since half of the city 's water mains and 30 per cent of its sewer pipes are more than 50 years old .
But last year , total revenue was only $ 604 million .
Other regions are hurting , too .
Peel Region treasurer Dan Labrecque estimates his region has lost $ 7 million to so - called " revenue or billable flows shortfall . "
The need to make up for that lost money accounts for nearly half of Peel 's proposed 16 per cent water rate hike ( expected to be phased in at 12.5 per cent ) .
" A number of factors are contributing to this , including the success of our water consumption ( reduction ) efforts , " said Labrecque .
" We 've pointed it out to council saying , here 's the trend , we do n't know if it 's a sustainable trend , or whether it's an adjustment because of changes , the Al Gore movie and all that kind of stuff . "
Individual efforts are an obvious part of the change in consumption .
For example , Peel 's water use did n't increase last summer even though it was one of the driest on record ; people took the message to heart and watered their lawns less .
That 's been augmented by changes in the building code requiring more efficient equipment in new homes , and by programs that subsidize replacements in older homes .
Last year , homeowners in Mississauga , Brampton and Caledon installed some 7,103 subsidized low - flush toilets , compared with just 204 two years earlier .
The trend is the same everywhere .
Last year , Torontonians consumed 374 cubic million metres of water , a huge drop from the 424 million cubic metres that poured from the city 's taps in 1988 .
A staff report attributes the decline to " an underlying systematic trend towards lower consumption , partly due to greater promotion and awareness of water efficiency initiatives , " plus the loss of some major industrial consumers and price sensitivity .
Toronto's 9.4 per cent hike in the water rate â expected to be repeated annually for some years to come â reflects a trend across the GTA .
Blended water and wastewater rates are rising everywhere as consumption continues to drop : 6.5 per cent in Halton , 9.5 per cent in Durham , 11.6 per cent in Markham and 9 per cent in Peel .
On the plus side for conservation is the possibility that municipalities could save significantly if existing infrastructure , including the water plants , last longer â or if building new ones can be postponed .
Also , less water use means less energy is needed to treat and pump water and wastewater â meaning savings on the power bill and fewer greenhouse emissions .
But in the short term , municipalities are forced to look for other solutions , including revising the water rate structure to reflect that , while conservation is good , there 's a price to be paid for it .

" If we want to promote conservation , should our billing practices reflect that ? " wonders Labrecque , reflecting the direction he 's getting from politicians .
" Fixed levies might be part of the new structure , " Labrecque said , adding that there would have to be clear direction from the political side to go that route .
Other ideas floated by politicians and water staff include charging bottled - water producers more for using municipal water ; creating block rates ; and â taking a leaf from the hydro sector â charging higher rates for people who use more water at peak times .
" It 's ironic , " chuckled Mississauga Councillor George Carlson , chair of the city 's environment committee , speaking of the success of the water - conservation message .
The payoff for cleaning up our act may be that we end up paying more .
Canadians , according to the Canadian Environmental Law Association , are among the most wasteful water users in the world , at more than 300 litres per person per day â second only to the United States .
The fact that our water comes so cheap has a lot to with that .
And it 's a message that 's starting to get through .
" It seems to me we have n't been paying what we should be paying for water over the years , " Mississauga Councillor Pat Mullin mused at a recent regional council meeting .
Locally , when conservation promotion is done as vigorously as it has been in Peel , retrofitting homes can have a dramatic effect .
Johann Manente , Peel 's point person in the effort , pointed out that in the region 's 30 public housing apartment buildings , almost 4,000 units have been retrofitted for water conservation .
The savings per unit were about 360 litres per day â the equivalent of running the tap on full for 25 minutes .
Depending on your point of view , that project alone saved â or cost â the regional treasury almost $ 550,900 .
Manente said the region 's ultimate goal is to reduce water consumption by up to 10 per cent in the next seven years .
Labrecque said what 's needed next is a more detailed engineering analysis of how Peel Region 's million - plus residents and 70,000 businesses are using water , to get a better handle on the trend .
" I 've identified it as a positive â people are using less , " he said .
" How much less is very complicated .
" The alternative is to tell them to use more water so we can get more money , " he said with a big smile .
" But that 's not our goal . "
Damage to an undersea cable has cut millions of Chinese off from the internet , and the problem could take weeks to fix .
China Telecom has said that a major cable was cut at about 0800 local time ( 0000 GMT ) .
We are sparing no effort to redirect traffic through other channels
China Telecom spokeswoman Wang Yang
The company is trying to reroute internet traffic through satellites and other cables , but users who can access overseas sites are reporting slow connections .
The cause of the damage is not yet known .
Neighbours affected Taiwanese officials said users on the island were also unable to access international sites .
Volvo's not kidding about safety .
Apparently out to set some sort of record , the Swedish automaker has announced three new experimental vehicle safety systems at the same time :
Automatic braking to avoid pedestrians ; Automatic steering to stop head - on collisions ; and Communication between cars to reduce traffic pile - ups
The first system ( above left ) , which builds on Volvo 's existing Collision Warning with Auto Brake system ( designed to mitigate vehicle - to - vehicle collisions ) , uses wide - angle radar to detect objects in front of and around the car , helping the driver " see " pedestrians .
When it spots one , a red warning light flashes on the windshield to alert the driver .
If the driver still does n't react to avoid our hapless pedestrian , the car will take matters into its own hands and apply the brakes automatically .
The second system ( center ) , Collision Avoidance by Auto Steering , builds on Volvo's Lane Departure Warning system .
It uses a camera to monitor the car 's position between stripes on the highway .
If the car strays over the line , an audible signal sounds .
If the system detects an oncoming vehicle on a collision course , it will automatically steer the car back to a safe position in the original lane .
Finally , Volvo is working on Vehicle - to - Vehicle Communication ( right ) .
Similar to GM 's V2V system , Volvo 's setup has test cars giving each other heads - ups about obstacles around the bend .
For example , one car can receive information about , say , a rock - slide or a traffic jam , from another car further the road .

With his Mister Softee ice cream truck parked in a familiar spot , its presence announced by a sprightly metallic jingle , Costas Vamvakas was having a good day on Wednesday , the holiday business brisk despite the drab weather .
But then two men pulled up in an unmarked car from the Department of Environmental Protection .
It was Mr. Vamvakas âs first encounter with the city âs noise police , a contingent that includes 45 environmental agents and thousands of regular police officers who are enforcing a sweeping new noise code that took effect on Sunday .
Mr. Vamvakas , 24 , who is part owner of a Mister Softee franchise in Queens with 11 trucks , had failed to turn off his truck âs jingle when he parked at the curb , as is now required of all ice cream trucks .
The fine is $ 350 .
Mr. Vamvakas , who is known as Gus , recalled the encounter , which took place in a parking lot at Fort Totten Park in Queens , in an interview yesterday during a break from his Flushing rounds .
He said he told the two agents that he would lose business if he turned off the jingle .
â I am aware of the law , but I need to play â the jingle , he recalled telling the agents .
He said he pleaded with them : â Ca nât I play it for 10 seconds while I âm stopped ? â
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Two suspects arrested last week confessed to a Pakistani judge Wednesday that they helped arm the suicide bomber blamed for assassinating Benazir Bhutto , an Interior Ministry spokesman told CNN .
Benazir Bhutto was killed shortly after this photo was taken on December 27 .
The two men -- identified as Hasnain Gul and Rafaqat -- were part of a five - man team behind the former prime minister 's assassination , including the suicide bomber , a senior police investigator told CNN .
Both were at the Rawalpindi park where Bhutto was assassinated on December 27 as she left a political campaign rally , said investigator Chaudhry Abdul Majeed .
The other two suspects -- one of them named Karamullah -- are still at large , he said .
The two suspects told the judge in Wednesday 's court appearance that they provided the suicide bomber with a house , transportation , a pistol , and the suicide jacket he allegedly used in the attack that killed the opposition leader and nearly two dozen others , Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said .
They identified the bomber by two aliases , Saeed and Bilal , according to Majeed .
He said the two suspects told police they picked up the bomber a day before the attack at a bus depot in Rawalpindi , and the bomber stayed overnight with Rafaqat before they took him to the Rawalpindi park hours before the attack to do reconnaissance .
Then they went to Hasnain Gul 's house , where the bomber was fitted with the suicide vest .
Cheema said the bomber apparently was unable to get through security to attend Bhutto 's rally , so he carried out the attack as she left the Rawalpindi park .
Pakistani authorities have said Bilal fired a gun on Bhutto before detonating his suicide jacket as she left a political rally in Rawalpindi .
Pakistani and British investigators concluded that Bhutto died when the force of the suicide blast caused her to slam her head onto an escape hatch on her SUV .
Bhutto's family has dismissed the government 's assertion that she was not shot by an assassin 's bullet , but the family has refused to allow an autopsy on the slain opposition leader .
The two suspects were arrested last Thursday in Rawalpindi , the headquarters of Pakistan 's military leadership outside Islamabad , where Bhutto was killed , Cheema said .
Police are still holding Aitzaz Shah , 15 , and Sher Zaman , who were detained last month in Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan 's North - West Frontier Province .
Pakistani officials have been vague on Shah and Zaman 's links to Bhutto 's killing , and have said they have not been named as official suspects .
Pakistan 's government has concluded Bhutto's assassination was orchestrated by Baitullah Mesud , the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who has ties to al Qaeda -- a conclusion the CIA supports .
Two recent nationwide polls in Pakistan found a majority of Pakistanis believe President Pervez Musharraf 's government had a role in her killing .
At a news conference Tuesday , Cheema pointed out that the government does not deny someone fired a shot toward Bhutto before detonating his explosives , but added that person did not act alone .
" You will get to know there were other people in the area , " Cheema said .
" It was not just a single person . "
He said Pakistani investigators " have made very good progress " in determining who planned the assassination .
" We are going to break the whole chain and we are confident we 're going to reach the perpetrators , " Cheema said .
" We will exactly tell you who are the people behind this unfortunate incident . "

Not all Christians are supercilious , of course .
Many are content to live and let live , and some even grant that science ( despite its lack of supernatural entities ) does some good .
But Christianity as an organized , evangelizing movement has been on the offensive lately .
Witness the new wave of evangelicals and their leaders such as Rick Warren , Lee Strobel , and William Lane Craig with their aggressive stance against scientific materialism and their bestselling books attempting to refute science .
So , assuming you 're an atheist , what do you say to the theist who asks , " You do n't ( chuckle ) believe in a god ( snicker ) ? "
Anybody familiar with the original article will see that the preceding paragraph is the same paragraph as the opening to " How to Respond to a Supercilious Atheist " by Alan Roebuck .
By changing a few words , the same attack can be launched right back at him , and the rest of the article is n't much better .
It appears to be a primer in projection .
After all , when in doubt , just accuse them of being just like you .
Roebuck advises his fellow theists to take a different approach to defending the faith - instead of coming up with actual evidence , you should just tell atheists how our worldview is the one that is based on assumptions and presuppositions .
He eschews using the First Cause argument and the defense of miracles because , " No matter what evidence you give , the supercilious atheist finds a way to dismiss it . "
I wonder if he has ever considered that it may be dismissed because it is not valid evidence .
The First Cause argument does n't work because , at best , it can only be used to show that something created the universe , and that something is not necessarily Yahweh .
It could be another god or a multitude of gods .
Even that is questionable , though , due to the fact that they have yet to show that the universe itself is contingent upon some necessary being and not the necessary " being " itself .
I would also advise theists to drop this argument from their arsenal , but not in favor of Roebuck 's plan .
Roebuck states that , " it is not the case that your evidence for God is valid but nevertheless is cancelled out by his superior evidence against God . "
Gee , Sherlock , where can I find this " evidence against God ? "
How about the absolute penury of evidence for god ?
Theists have not yet grasped the concept of the burden of proof , apparently .
It 's really simple , so I find it astounding that it is so easily dismissed - the one who makes the positive claim ( ie - god exists ) is the one who has to prove that claim , not the person who is in the default position of suspension of belief due to lack of evidence ( ie - as far as we know , god does not exist ) .
As much as I hate to be the bearer of bad news , if you believe something without sufficient evidence , you are irrational .
Roebuck claims that atheism 's vulnerability lies in the " false worldview " that we hold that only material , objectively verifiable things exist .
First of all , this is not true .
Not all atheists are scientific materialists .
There are many who believe lots of different wacky theories that do n't involve a god and there are others with other notions of how the universe operates .
This argument is only applicable to a portion of atheists who also hold a materialistic worldview .
Roebuck then claims that scientific materialists assume this and have come to their conclusion before examining the evidence .
( Is the projection evident yet ? )
The only evidence that exists is physical , material , verifiable , and falsifiable .
The existence of god is none of the above .
Any religious statement can be considered factually meaningless by virtue of the fact that it does n't meet the falsifiability criterion .
The only assumptions being made here are that god exists and it's up to atheists to disprove that .
Obviously , Roebuck does n't understand that this is impossible , and that is the very reason why we can say that no evidence for such an entity exists .
He uses an example of a blind man dismissing the existence of color because he cannot sense it , and likens that to the atheist who can't sense god .
First of all , the blind man knows he is blind .
He recognizes this sensory deficiency and does n't believe that everybody on earth is also blind .
Furthermore , Roebuck is demonstrating his lack of understanding of the functioning of the brain by asserting that color exists in some more than abstract sense .
Color appears as it does to us in the small portion of the light spectrum that we are able to perceive .
For other creatures , the world around them is entirely different , and we can study how this process operates , what causes disorders such as blindness or the inability to perceive color and from where it stems .
Is Roebuck suggesting here that atheists suffer from a sensory deficiency as well ?
Does he believe that theists have been endowed with a " sixth sense " that enables them to make contact with the supernatural ?
If so , I 'd like him to demonstrate what part of our anatomy is causing this problem so that it can be rectified .
Blindness stems from either the brain or the eye itself not operating properly .
Where does " spiritual blindness " originate ?
Seen as how all of our senses are processed in the brain , and also have an external organ by which the information is received , he should be able to show where our malfunction is occurring .
Roebuck claims that the theist must challenge our " assumptions " to properly expose the atheist as a pedant , and says that first we have to define our criteria for making the determination that there is no valid reason to believe in god and how we know they are correct .
He must be talking to different atheists than I , as most people that I know would respond with the criteria being objectively verifiable evidence , and that we know this method of validation to be the most accurate due to hundreds of years of making advancements as a society thanks to the scientific method .
He moves on to what kind of evidence would be needed to verify the occurrence of an actual miracle .
This would be a difficult question because most people with a scientific mindset would not know what it would take because even unexplained phenomena could potentially be explained in the future .
Not knowing the answer right now does n't imply that the answer is unknowable .
Besides , an omniscient , omnipotent being would know exactly what was necessary and could provide it if he chose .
Unless , of course , we are his " vessels of wrath " created only to go to hell and demonstrate god 's wonderful mercy .
He again misconstrues the position of atheists who allow for the possibility of the supernatural , although I personally feel that any knowledge of such a plane of existence is impossible to ascertain , by positing , " How do you know that a super - naturalistic explanation , involving a God who intervenes from time to time , cannot be the correct explanation ?
Would n't one have to be , for all intents and purposes , omniscient in order to know that God could not have been involved ? "
We do n't know for sure that it could n't be the correct explanation , and he is shifting the goalpost from his particular god to " a super - naturalistic explanation . "
This is a common tactic in apologetics , and it should be pointed out that he does n't know that the supernatural being that started it all was n't Zeus .
As far as the omniscience goes , we can answer that we do not have to be omniscient to say that at this time , there is no evidence for such a being and no need to appeal to one .
Making up an answer when there is none is called argumentum ad ignorantium .
He attempts to take on the issue of the logical contradictions inherent in the attributes that his god is given but misses most of the salient points .
He deals momentarily with omnipotence and claims that god can do " anything that can be done . "
Did n't god make the rules to begin with ?
Could he not have made them different than they are ?
What 's the point of having an omnipotent creator of the universe who was beholden to some other rules , and from where or whom did those mandates come ?
He dedicates a measly three sentences to theodicy , and just says that a god who allows evil for some unknown reason could exist , but never ties it back into the real contradiction , which is how could that god be considered omnibenevolent ?
Again , god either created atheists specifically to be tortured for all eternity by no fault of their own , having been given the gift of faith or not , or he just chooses not to intervene for some mysterious reason .
Either way , how can one argue that this being loves me ?
He will send me to hell purposely , either because it's my destiny , or because he just does n't intervene because we need faith , which is a gift from him that we are supposed to somehow give ourselves .
That 's not circular or anything .
He moves on to what he calls " arguing presuppositionally " , and gives an inadequate explanation of an axiom , which he then changes slightly to allow for the existence of god to be a non-axiomatic axiom .
He claims that all knowledge is based upon one foundational principle that cannot be proven , but is intuited .
He is muddying the waters here by the use of the word " intuit " , as an axiom is just something that is self - evident .
I feel he chose that word for the specific purpose of misleading the reader and priming them for the upcoming shift in definition .
He claims that axioms can be tested by deducing whether or not the system is " logically , morally , and existentially consistent . "
He asserts that the atheist worldview fails because the " nature of knowledge cannot be validated empirically . "
People have many different epistemological views , and the use of scientific methodology to determine the validity of anything is necessarily going to have some starting point and then system of experimentation .
That is all we have with which to work , and he is attempting to negate the materialist worldview by using a point that he himself believes regarding his own - that not everything can be empirically validated .
He claims that one cannot live a purely naturalistic life as that implies that you define your own meaning , and that makes everybody 's meaning invalid .
We could n't " stick to it when the going gets rough . "
I have no idea what kind of data he is using to determine this , but the search for meaning is an individual endeavor - even for the religious .
People may claim that they " live for god " , but in reality , nobody does .
If all they are living for is the promise of an afterlife in paradise , then they logically would all just commit suicide to get there faster .
Instead , what we observe is christians not following the dictates of their own belief system and living their daily lives in much the same way that we heathens do .
They also use their families , their responsibilities , their hopes , dreams , and future endeavors as " meaning . "
Being handed a blanket " meaning " for your existence only serves to cheapen the very concept .
He claims the existence of god is axiomatic , but can not be " intuited " like other axioms .
These are , after all , " subtle and cosmic questions . "
If it is not self - evident , it is not an axiom .
Period .
He says that any proposition " must be judged true or false in light of what we already know to be true . "
I 'm with him there , but how on earth does that prove the existence of god as axiomatic ?
His writing goes from merely ignorant to absurd at this point .
Perhaps the most amusing quote is this one : " ... some people are content to believe without having any proof of their beliefs , and you can't argue with someone like that . "
You 're telling me .
Again , this is an example of projection at its finest .
He claims that theism excels at " accounting for the facts of reality " , but I 'm not sure exactly what type of reality to which he refers .
Reality is that which can be observed and generally agreed upon .
Imaginary sky - daddys do n't fall into that category .
His final snafu is that he comes around full - circle to admit that the foundation of religious belief is faith - that which is believed but can not be proven .
Did he not just spend 5 pages attempting to prove that his god belief is logically superior to a naturalistic worldview ?
I feel as if I missed the middle ten pages of this argument and walked into the conclusion of a completely different one .
He claims that by pointing out our assumptions , theists can claim victory over atheists , but all he is really saying here is that he has the opinion that we do the same thing that they do .
If that 's true , why is it acceptable for them and not for us ?
It seems to be a very odd contradiction to say that atheists are wrong because we work from our presuppositions , but then to base your own worldview on presuppositions .
How exactly can you determine whose presuppositions are correct ?
If they can not be proven , how can anybody know ?
Given his own argumentation , how does he know that our supposed presuppositions , while I do n't believe that a naturalistic worldview implies presuppositions , are n't the correct ones ?
Can we not take every argument here and turn it around on religion with no difficulty ?
To put the nail in the coffin , his endnotes declare that the true impediment to our belief is that we hate god .
This laughable notion is constantly used against us and is by far the most ridiculous assertion in their repertoire .
It is nothing short of an attack that attempts to discredit our use of rationality by claiming that it is an emotional issue at its core .
If anybody is rationalizing their emotions , it is the theist whose fear of death overwhelms him to the point that he makes up fairy tales to assuage the constant anxiety that life in an unknown , unpredictable universe can induce .
This article was a pathetic attempt to discredit atheism , or more accurately , scientific materialism , by ascribing to it all of the properties of religion .
That alone is enough to demonstrate the intellectual vacuity of their belief .
Original Article
Love writing but hate being poor ?
There is no reason why you should not be able to make some extra money by writing .
Just look outside traditional venues , like writing a novel or becoming a local reporter .
Here are some ideas for you .
1. Come up with cool domain names .
Some web services , like PickyDomains.com , will pay you to come up with domain names for them ( I believe the current rate is $ 25 per name ) .
However , this is one niche where you can work for yourself as well .
There is a big demand for â Web 2.0 names â , like Yahoo or Google , so if you can easily think of meaningless but cool names , register domains in your own name and then resell them on Sedo .
Com , BuyDomains .
Com or any other â second - hand â domain marketplaces for huge profit .
The average domain price on Sedo is mid $ XXX to low $ XXXX , so you only need a few sales each month .
And it costs only $ 8 - $ 9 to register a domain name , so you do nât need to much money .
2. Become AdWords copywriter .
It may look like writing a short AdWords ad is easy , but trust me , it âs not .
Especially since the limits are pretty strict .
That âs the bad part .
The good part is that text of the ad has a HUGE impact on its performance .
The best thing about Google AdWords is that it lets you test different ads side by side in order to determine which ad performs better .
Why is this important ?
Because it âs the key to getting a client .
All you have to say â hey , test my ad (s ) side by side with yours and hire me only if mine get higher CTR .
Make it risk free .
And finding clients is brainlessly simple â just click any ad that you think sucks and contact a website owner directly .
3. Write descriptions on eBay for foreigners .
This is a nobrainer either .
Go to eBay and look through descriptions .
Some of them are horrid .
And bad descriptions kill sales .
This is what you should tell foreign - based eBay sellers .
Important â target only PowerSellers â these are folks who make a living selling stuff on eBay and have money to pay for your services .
Do nât bother with a single item sellers .
And make sure you check their reputation to make sure you are not aiding Romanian scammers , who sell notebooks for fifty bucks .
The great thing about this idea is that eBay sellers all have PayPal accounts , so international payments wo nât be an issue .
4. Shareware Localization .
Most shareware sold online today is not developed in US .
And you can often tell that by looking at interface or reading a manual .
When you come across such a program , contact developers directly , pointing out mistakes and offering your services .
Where to look for shareware ?
Go to Download .
Com and browse through listings .
5. Writing Personal Ads And Profiles Of People On Dating Sites
This is not an original idea , I read about in The New York Times .
The article profiled two websites that charge 50 bucks to write profiles for others on dating sites that would attract attention .
Unfortunately , I do nât recall URLs , but if you look into it , you âll probably find them sooner or later .
Personally , I think it âs a great idea , since the market is there .
Just become a member of several dating sites and build a portfolio .

Sermon Prompts Tips That Leads to Arrest
An official at Free Press , a nonprofit advocacy group that has criticized Comcast for limiting the amount of data some of its customers send over its network , accused the cable company of " stacking the deck " at the hearing with the 30 to 40 " seat - warmers . "
An official at Harvard said dozens of real participants were left standing outside the auditorium with placards .
Okay , enough with the bombarding me with messages pleading for my unique take on the Macworld product announcements ( Mom ) .
I needed a second to process , but now I âm ready .
Disclaimer : I âm not sure if any of this is unique - during the past few days where I was never outside of a 1.5 mile radius of Macworld , I âd never been more off - the - grid since the dawn of the Internet .
For some reason both of my hotels had trouble with wifi and as for MobileSafari , wherever you were , the 9 assholes to your right were always soaking up the valuable EDGE bandwidth that you desperately needed to Twitter something time - sensitive and critically nerdy .
That said , much of what you see below may have already been said in one of the 4000 unread news feed items I dare not open .
Air .
This thing , like any Apple product , is best appreciated by actual touch .
What your mind may conceive of in an irregularly - shaped laptop may manifest more like the awkward Amazon Kindle rather the magnificent slight wedge of aluminum that the Air becomes on first grasp .
You hold it for a second - its heft is no more than that of a well - built metal clipboard , its thin end , when closed could be used to slice cheese - and it immediately becomes something other than , something beyond a laptop .
Akin to the introduction of the flat panel TV , in approximating planar flatness it subtracts the dimension of depth from the whole traditional two - part laptop form ( thick bottom where you put your junk , slightly less thick top where you see your junk ) which has nât really been challenged since its debut .
But hold up , where âs the ports ?
Oh , there they are , snugly hidden by a creamy little trapdoor .
And besides the Magsafe power port on the opposite side , there are but two of them - one USB , one for external display .
And I âve heard that people have problems with this .
In fact , I initially had problems with this .
Where âs the firewire ?
70 % of my life is in two Lacie Rugged drives I have on hand at all times .
The unfirewired life is not worth living , or has nât been in this hard drive - paradigmed world .
But then you realize that this hard drive - paradigmed world is not the world for which the Air is intended .
And this is its crucial distinction : the Air is not just a lighter laptop , it is a conceptual shift in personal computing .
People have been comparing the Air to the Cube .
Full wedgie - deserving disclosure : when Jobs announced the Cube at the Keynote in 2000 , I watched from home ( remember when we could do that ? ) and when that 8 " block of solid pixiedust came out on its pedestal and the crowd swelled with excitement , I shed a tear .
No , I wept like a baby .
I high - fived my imaginary friends and I fist - pumped in the air .
The Cube won me partly because it was pretty , but mostly because it represented such a shift .
As it happened , the Cube turned out to be more of a proof - of - concept , not intended for mass adoption , but meant to pull our heads out of the notion that the guts of a powerful computer must be stuffed in a large , noisy box so cumbersome and heavy it had to be left on the floor .
We were meant to disassociate mass from power , in preparation for the coming evolution of supercomputing laptops , and in many ways , the Cube did its job and paved the way for its successor , the Mini .
So , too , is the Air a proof - of - concept .
The concepts it sets out to prove are the clearest ones implied by its name : that data is weightless , that storage is wireless ( a concept augmented by the parallel release of Apple âs new hard drive - equipped wireless router dubbed Time Capsule ) , and that connectivity is ubiquitous .
The first two concepts are pretty standard stuff , theoretically , that Apple is now doing the walking of the walk , putting its nose to the grindstone and cracking the whip to train us as users into getting through our thick skulls .
Because we will not go gracefully into this idea of weightless data - it âs been a long time coming , preparing us for the migration of our data offsite .
We use our Gmail , we use our flickr , but we love our cables because our cables tie us to our stuff like a leash to a hyperactive toddler .
But in denying us our cables , the Air is whispering sternly in our ear what must be learned if we ever hope to fly in a world of ubiquitous connectivity .
And one might argue that our world of ubiquitous connectivity is still largely undeveloped because we are too comfortable being tethered ( we are attached to being attached ) .
To throw one more shoddy metaphor in the mix , we are comfortable moving our shit around on trains because we have not yet been forced into airplanes .
The third part of the equation presents more of a problem , as Gruber noted in his Macworld predictions at the beginning of the week .
The absence of built - in 2.5G or 3G data connectivity is glaring in the face of its killer - appiness in the iPhone .
While a built - in connectivity solution will almost certainly come in future iterations , it âs reasonable to expect that Apple has a remedial solution of its own , such as USB modem for accessing the AT&T EDGE network ( the perfect $ 99 accessory to your new Air ) , or software compatibility with iPhone âs connectivity via Bluetooth .
What I like about the dongle modem solution is that its DNA can be found in something like the iSight camera - an obvious need filled by an Apple - branded accessory which eventually was built and packaged standard in the main hardware .
The other notable bullet point of the Air is its adoption of the iPhone âs multitouch functionality in its trackpad .
This a blatant , bell - clear statement of intent on the part of Apple , stamped into its hardware , that has only been hinted at in software so far : that there is a shared UI language being learned and taught between the two parts of its personal computing family .
It may seem a small step to take that allows you to scale and rotate an image on your laptop with the gestures you would use on you iPhone , but the small step represents a huge leap : that the two parts are making overtures towards each other rather than diverging .
This is not revolutionary stuff , but it is a perfect indicator of the coming advancements .
Regardless of whether the Air is adopted en masse and does big sales , this is all good stuff that is implied behind the scenes of its release .
The trojan horse of the Air is that it is light , it is new and it is damn sexy .
But inside is an army of paradigm - shifters , adapting us to the next phase of computing : one in which the world is your hard drive .

Facebook LAHORE , Pakistan ( AP ) Â
Two U.S. human rights activists were arrested after they had been seeking the release of a prominent Pakistani lawyer , who was detained under the country 's state of emergency , officials and a witness said .
Police traveling in two cars picked up Medea Benjamin and Tighe Barry near the Holiday Inn hotel Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore , said Amir Sohail , joint secretary of the Punjab Union of Journalists , who was with the two Americans at the time .
Elizabeth Colton , press attache at the U.S. Embassy in the capital , Islamabad , confirmed the arrests .
She said that the two had contacted the U.S. mission in Lahore by phone , and that it was giving consular assistance .
A police official in Lahore , who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists , said the arrest order came from " higher -ups . "
He said the two U.S. citizens were likely to be deported .
Pakistani newspapers reported during the weekend that the two Americans had been staging a vigil in the city to protest the house arrest of Aitzaz Ahsan , the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association .
Ahsan was among thousands of lawyers and opposition workers detained after President Pervez Musharraf suspended the constitution on Nov. 3 , drawing international condemnation .
Most detainees have been released , but some high - profile critics of the retired general , such as Ahsan , remain under arrest .
Musharraf justified the state of emergency as necessary to curb judicial activism and Islamic extremism , although critics believe it was aimed at keeping the Supreme Court from halting his controversial re-election to a new term as president .

Swiss scientists have tested psilocybin , the active ingredient of magic mushrooms , on twelve people and confirmed that it makes time feel slower .
At University Hospital ZÃ¼rich , each of the volunteers was given a gel capsule with five milligrams of the drug or a lactose placebo .
Later , they were asked to perform simple tasks , which would reveal their ability to tell time .
When they had consumed the hallucinogen , each subject would take action too soon â indicating that time was moving quite slowly from their point of view .
The duration reproduction task ( DRT ) followed the same design in both experiments .
A 500 Hz tone was presented to subjects via headphones for a defined duration s ( presentation phase ) ; after a constant interval of silence , w = 2 s , the same tone was presented again and the subjects had to switch off the tone by pressing a key when the duration of the second tone was subjectively equal to that of the first tone .
In a report to the journal Neuroscience Letters , which became available on Feb.
9 , Jiri Wackermann and her collaborators explained that the hallucinogen acts on proteins called serotonin receptors , but how it affects our perception of time is still not fully understood .

Several states and communities are moving to provide universal health coverage for their residents , but a federal law is blocking their efforts .
Many of the proposals require employers either to offer health coverage themselves or pay into a public fund to help cover the uninsured .
' NIGHTMARE ' : Businesses fight forced payments for universal health care
Some employers say that conflicts with a federal law that bars states from requiring or regulating employer - provided benefits such as health coverage .
The law , which protects private - sector companies from having to meet a patchwork of state and local demands , is supported by businesses .
The dispute has set off a legal battle pitting lawmakers against employers .
Its resolution could determine how far state and local lawmakers can go with their plans to cover the uninsured .
" There are people who believe that but for ( this law ) , we would be much farther along in knowing what works in terms of health reform , " says Phyllis Borzi , a George Washington University health policy professor .
Greg Scandlen , president of Consumers for Health Care Choices , says the law shields businesses from varying rules .
" The idea that the employer is required to provide coverage or pay a fee will be thrown out in a heartbeat " in court , says Scandlen , whose group advocates less government regulation of health care .
An early legal test of these plans is taking place in San Francisco , the first city to offer universal coverage to its residents .
A group of restaurant owners sued the city in 2006 , saying the law violates the federal Employee Retirement Income and Security Act ( ERISA ) .
In December , a lower court judge sided with employers .
But last week , an appeals court allowed San Francisco to proceed temporarily with its program and begin charging employers a fee , ruling that the city has a " strong likelihood of prevailing " in its appeal .
California , Colorado , Michigan and Minnesota have proposals pending that rely on partial funding by employers .
The lower court ruling " raises doubt with regard to all of the state health reform proposals , " says Atlanta attorney John Hickman , an expert on the federal law .
The 1974 law poses the biggest challenge in California , where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has spent more than a year pushing a $ 14 billion health plan .
His proposal includes a payroll tax on employers who do n't offer coverage .
" We believe the ruling ( of the lower court ) is not insurmountable , " says Frank Furtek , chief counsel at the California Health and Human Services Agency .
If the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately rules in the city 's favor , the case may end up before the U.S. Supreme Court , Borzi says .
That 's because last January , the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion over a Maryland law .
That law charged very large employers a fee if they did not spend 8 % of payroll on health care , essentially affecting only Wal - Mart .
The appeals court ruled the measure violated federal law .
If the appeals courts disagree , " it sets up a conflict , which is the classic pathway to having the Supreme Court resolve it , " Borzi says .
A similar law in Suffolk County , N.Y. , was rejected by a lower court in July ; the county decided not to appeal .
Massachusetts , the only state to require all residents to carry insurance , sets a $ 295 per worker annual fee on employers who do n't offer coverage .
The fee 's small size and early support from business are credited with preventing a legal challenge .

David Strom asks the question at Town Hall :
Liberty has always been a tougher sell than many of us assume .
We all want the freedom to do as we like , but few of us are as committed to allowing others to act contrary to our notion of right and wrong .
Majorities have always sought and often found ways to impose their views upon minorities .
The most vocal minorities have often been successful in imposing their will on the majority , at least for a time .
So there is nothing new about threats to Individual liberty being a daily part of our lives .
What is new is that the institutional barriers to regulating our daily lives have effectively broken down .
It took a Constitutional Amendment to pass prohibition of alcohol ( and repeal it ) .
Who today expects a Constitutional fight over smoking , obesity , trans - fats , or any of the myriad personal issues now under the purview of government control ?
America was founded on the belief that government power should be strictly limited , because the alternative to limited power was unlimited power .
The framers of the Constitution were rightly concerned that without strict institutional barriers to the expansion of government powers there would eventually be no barriers at all .
Power , in any form , longs to be absolute .
Unfortunately , the concept of limited government is becoming an anachronism in today âs America .
As Strom points out , the history of America over the past year has been replete with increases in the size and scope of government , but it âs happened in a way that will make dismantling Leviathan difficult :
Americans have made a bargain with the devil .
Dispensing with the idea of limited government in realm of benefits has meant dispensing with the idea of any limits to government power at all .
Once we accept the notion that government should ensure that our pursuit of happiness succeeds , we have accepted the notion that government has the right to define what a happy life should look like .
We can call this trend the encroachment of the â nanny state , â which it is , or the spread of â liberal fascism , â which it also is .
But it is also the inevitable result of Americans â increasing desire to have government guarantee that more and more aspects of our lives turn out all right .
Which is why there âs really only one way to tackle the state :
Limiting government power requires limiting the benefits that government can bestow upon us , and right now that seems a bridge too far for some Americans .
The question is , absent a crisis that brings the whole system crashing down around itself ( and , for many reasons I do nât think waiting for an Atlas Shrugged - type collapse makes sense ) , how do we convince the American people that the state is not their friend ?

Richard Pritches writes in to let us know that MIT errata expert Evangelos Georgiadis has disproved 44 conjectures set by Dr. Stephen Wolfram ( founder of Mathematica ) in A New Kind of Science .
The paper was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Cellular Automata and can be read in PDF form at Prof Edwin Clark 's collection of reviews of Wolfram 's ANKS .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - China âs worst fuel crunch in years has led a crematorium to dump half - burnt corpses to try saving on diesel costs , a Hong Kong newspaper said on Friday .
Villagers in Hengyang county , in the southern province of Hunan , discovered the practice when an â unbearable stench â started coming from the site , and tried to block a road on Wednesday to stop funeral vehicles from delivering more bodies .
The village sent people to investigate the smell and the South China Morning Post said they saw â crematorium workers putting half - burnt human remains and organs in plastic bags and throwing them into a nearby ditch . â
â As the price of diesel rose , we saw more and more bags thrown out from the crematorium , â the paper quoted Xiao Gaoyi , a village representative and one of the witnesses , as saying .
China was hit by its worst fuel supply crisis in four years from October to November , as a widening gap between low , state - regulated domestic prices and market - driven international prices forced Chinese refiners to cut output .
Fuel in many parts of the country was rationed and there were long queues at petrol stations .
An increase of nearly 10 percent in the prices of domestic diesel and gasoline from November 1 , the first in almost a year and a half , failed to lift refining margins back into the black .
The Sadiq Khan affair has killed stone dead the thesis , beloved of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown , that any accretion of power to the state is sustainable because ministers are in control .
Whether this applies to phone tapping , bugging devices , ID cards , NHS records , childcare computer systems , video surveillance or detention without trial , it is simply a lie .
Nobody can control this torrent of intrusion .
Nobody can oversee a burst dam .
Khan , an MP and government whip , was allegedly targeted by the police for having been a " civil rights lawyer " and thus a nuisance , though the recording of his meetings with a constituent in prison was supposedly directed at the inmate .
Either way , the bugging destroyed the " Wilson doctrine " , that MPs can not be bugged .
It appears that they can if ministers , or the police , so decide .
Security machismo claims that in the " age of terrorism " , real men bug everyone and everything .
The former flying squad chief and BBC dial - a- quote , John O'Connor , implied this week that it would be negligent of the police not to bug anyone they - repeat they - thought a threat .
The Blair thesis that " 9/11 changes everything " has been a green light to every security consultant , surveillance salesman and Labour minister wanting to flex his - or her- muscles in the tabloids .
Years ago a lawyer gave me unassailable evidence that a call with a client had been tapped by the police and handed to the prosecution .
Such tapping allegedly required a personal warrant from the home secretary who , when tackled on the subject , flatly denied it could have happened without his approval , which he would never give in such a case .
I checked back with a police chief , who roared with laughter .
" The home secretary is absolutely right .
He must authorise all taps sent to him for authorisation .
But not , of course , the rest . "
Orwell 's cuttlefish were squirting ink .
The grim reality of the past week alone is that it has seen a substantial section of the British establishment allowing itself to believe that private dealings between lawyer and client , and between MP and constituent , should no longer be considered immune from state surveillance .
A cardinal principle of a free democracy is thus coolly abandoned .
It is not a victory for national security .
It is a victory for terrorism .
The monitoring organisation Privacy International now gives Britain the worst record in Europe for such intrusion , indeed the worst among the so - called democratic world and on a par with " endemic surveillance societies " , such as Russia and Singapore .
The Thames Valley policeman , Mark Kearney , who bugged Khan 's conversation in Woodhill prison , claims to have protested that it was " unethical " but was overruled and placed under " significant pressure " from the Metropolitan police .
He has since had to leave the force .
The saga reads like a script from the film about East German espionage , The Lives of Others .
Britain's poor record is the result of government weakness towards the security apparat .
Even among supposed liberals , the response is to demand not less surveillance but more oversight .
David Davis , the Tory spokesman , said yesterday : " It 's got to be controlled ; it 's got to be accountable . "
Civil rights champion Liberty wants " simpler and stronger surveillance laws , with warrants issued by judges , not policemen nor politicians " .
People have been saying this for years .
Britain has a Kafkaesque oversight bureaucracy ranking with the one it purports to oversee .
Some six separate surveillance monitors trip over themselves .
All operate in secret and appear to be one gigantic rubber stamp .
The distinction drawn by the justice secretary , Jack Straw , between " intrusive " and " directed " bugging , illustrates the prevailing mumbo- jumbo .
The chief surveillance monitor , Sir Christopher Rose , has been asked by Straw to investigate the Khan affair , which appears to be a failure by the chief surveillance monitor .
Is this to be taken seriously ?
When the council can bug you for fly - tipping , when prisons can record conversations with defence lawyers , when any potentially criminal act can justify electronic intrusion - and when ministers resort to the dictator 's excuse , " The innocent need not fear " - warning bells should sound .
There is no " balance " to be struck between civil liberty and national security .
Civil liberty is absolute , security its handmaid .
Measures are needed to protect the public , but a firm line needs to be drawn round them .
The line must accept a degree of risk , or a police state is just around the corner .
A quarter of a million surveillances in Britain are beyond all power of politicians or overseers to check .
It is state paranoia , justified only by that catch - all , the " war on terror " .
In truth it is not countering terror , but promoting it .
Mass surveillances one of the poisons that the terrorist seeks to inject into the veins of civil society .
It is clear the overseers have gone native .
Even the " independent " security watchdog , Lord Carlile , has bought 42 - day detention .
More oversight will not cure surveillance but mask its spread .
The extension from terrorism to benefit fraud , fly - tipping and trading standards demonstrates how the official mind flips to Stasi mode at the least excuse .
To claim that Britain is a police state insults those who are victims of real ones .
But I have no doubt that feeble ministers are slithering down just this road , pushed by the security / industrial complex .
It is not oversight that must be increased , but rather the categories and boundaries of surveillance that must be drastically curbed .
Of course there are people who want to explode bombs in Britain .
Taxpayers spend a fortune trying to stop them .
But how often must we remind ourselves that the bomber need not kill to achieve his end when we appease his yearning for the martyrdom of repression ?
The amount of surveillance in Britain is grotesque .
It is a sign of the corruption of power , and nothing else .

Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice co-owned a home and shared a line of credit with another woman , according to Washington Post diplomatic correspondent Glenn Kessler , who reveals the information in his new book , The Confidante : Condoleezza Rice and the Creation of the Bush Legacy .
Kessler discussed the revelations with talk - show host and gay author Michaelangelo Signorile Friday on his Sirius Radio show .
According to the book , Rice owns a home together with Randy Bean , a documentary filmmaker who once worked with Bill Moyers .
Kessler made the discovery by looking through real estate records .
Bean explained the joint ownership and line of credit to Kessler by saying she had medical bills which left her financially drained and Rice helped her by co-purchasing the house along with a third person , Coit Blacker , a Stanford professor who is openly gay .
Blacker later sold his line of credit to Rice and Bean .
Kessler mentions rumors about Rice 's sexuality in the book and notes that many older single heterosexual women have been " unfairly " targeted with regard to their sexual orientation .
He also says Rice has been the focus of " nasty attacks . "
When asked about the revelations on Signorile 's show , Kessler " said he did not know if this meant there was something more to the relationship between the woman beyond a friendship . "
Perhaps the most popular remaining high - profile figure in the Bush Administration , Rice was promoted to succeed Bush by many of her backers .
She repeatedly declined offers to run for president in 2008 and will return to Stanford upon her departure from the White House .
Rice faced attacks from liberals in the gay community over the State Department 's reluctance to rebuke Iran for the hanging of gay teenagers .
The gay rights lobby Human Rights Campaign called on Rice in 2005 to condemn Iran 's human rights abuses after the hanging of two gay teenagers , and to express indignation over " other horrific human rights abuses against gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people across the globe . "
Rice did not .
The Secretary has remained silent on whether gays should be allowed to serve in the military and has not commented on the permanent partners immigration act .
Andy Humm , a New York gay journalist who discussed the Iran hangings on his TV show Gay USA , says Rice 's silence gives " consent . "
" Condi Rice works for an administration that uses attacks on gay rights to win votes , " Humm told RAW STORY .
" She has stood by silently while the President has proposed writing anti-gay discrimination into the Constitution of the United States .
Whenever she is given the opportunity to distance herself from their anti-gay polices she punts . "
" Silence , " he added , " gives consent . "
Signorile excerpted a brief quote from Kessler 's book on his blog .
" After she became secretary of state , she came to a party at Blacker 's house , kicked off her shoes , and began dancing through the night to rock and and roll , " Kessler wrote .
" Blacker , who is gay , wanted to show his partner how tight her behind is ; he postulated that if he aimed a quarter at her butt , it would bounce off like a rocket .
He was right .
Rice , who was dancing , did n't realize what he had done until everyone began laughing hysterically .
She was flattered -- and proud . "
The blogger who first posted emails about former Rep. Mark Foley 's ( R - FL ) solicitation of male Congressional pages , Lane Hudson , also questions Rice 's silence .
" Secretary Rice has typified the juxtaposition that many Republicans have between their public and private lives , " Hudson said .
" Privately , she is very supportive of gays .
However , she heads a State Department that has done little to move foreign governments around the world in the direction of equal rights for their citizens . "
Steve Clemons , who blogs at The Washington Note -- and who travels in high - level foreign policy circles -- told RAW STORY that " Condoleeza Rice may or may not be gay but she is in a relationship which legitimately raises these kinds of questions .
Before he took office , the president and first lady had close relationships with a number of gay men , including Charles Francis , whose brother managed Bush 's reelection campaign for Texas governor . "

Too Crazy For Boystown , Too Much Of A Boy For Crazytown
Jim Henley is completely right about this :
You ca nât understand the Obscure Executive , or The Movement or whatever you prefer to call it unless you internalize the bizarre truth :
They really believe this stuff .
It âs tempting to think of the network of contractors and water carriers and foundations as cynical operators , just a particularly bloody - minded effort in rent - seeking using Rovian attack politics to manipulate dupes into further fattening already bulging wallets .
No .
The jabber about GOP schisms among â theocons â and â moneycons â and â security hawks â ignores the overlap of all three tendencies at the core of the contemporary Republican Party and â conservative â movement .
Democrats are the party of treason is nât just something bloggers and barflies believe .
It âs the firm conviction of very wealthy and powerful stalwarts of the American Right ...
We look at the Democratic Party and see co-opted , managerialist shills .
They look at the same group and see the Manson Family .
It 's hard for our type to comprehend this , but it 's true .
Much of real right - wing power in the United States , right up to senior White House staff , sees the world like this .
They simply cannot understand why anyone to their left behaves as they do , and the only answer that makes sense to them is " TREASON !!! "
They honestly believe that " secular progressives " ( as Bill O'Reilly likes to call us ) are pining to turn America into the New Caliphate .
And this is nothing new .
Here 's Robert Parry in Secrecy and Privilege , describing the incoming Reaganite perspective after the 1980 elections :
In a scalding assessment of the CIA âs Soviet analysis , the transition team accused the DI of â an abject failure â to foresee a supposedly massive Soviet buildup of strategic weapons and â the wholesale failure â to comprehend the sophistication of Soviet propaganda .
The transition report even questioned the patriotism of the career analysts who supposedly had underestimated the Soviet commitment to world domination .
" These failures are of such enormity , " the transition report said , " that they cannot help but suggest to any objective observer that the agency itself is compromised to an unprecedented extent and that its paralysis is attributable to causes more sinister than incompetence . "
Of course , this seems utterly bonkers to us , but remember : from their perspective , simply telling the truth is treason .

An American scientist has created a cloned embryo from his own skin cells , becoming the first person to create an exact copy of their genetic make - up .
Samuel Wood , a researcher at Stemagen Corporation in La Jolla , California , plucked cells from his skin and injected them into donated eggs that had been treated to remove their own genetic material .
The eggs developed into very early stage embryos that were genetically identical to the scientist 's own DNA .
The research is a step towards scientists ' goal of creating supplies of embryonic stem cells genetically matched to patients , which could potentially be used to regenerate diseased or damaged tissues without the risk of immune rejection .
It is not the first time human cloned embryos have been created .
In 2005 , scientists led by Miodrag Stojkovic at Newcastle University used embryonic stem cells to produce a cloned embryo .
It survived for only a few days and no stem cells were extracted from it .
The Stemagen team did not retrieve stem cells from their clones either , leading some scientists to question the importance of the work .
Eggs were taken from women aged 20 to 24 and used within two hours , according to a report in the journal Stem Cells .
Dr Stojkovic , a co-editor of the journal , said : " This is a key advance in the development of patient - specific stem cell lines for therapeutic purposes . "
Dr Stephen Minger , a stem cell researcher at King 's College London , said : " Disappointingly , the researchers did not go on to do the next step : to create embryonic stem cell lines from cloned embryos .
The community is waiting with bated breath to see if anyone can do both steps .
Having access to specific stem cell lines would allow us to research major diseases such as Parkinson 's and spinal muscular atrophy . "
Interesting :
The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Texas to print presidential primary ballots without Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich âs name .
The court refused to step into a dispute between Kucinich and the Texas Democratic Party over a loyalty oath all candidates must sign to make the ballot .
Kucinich and singer - supporter Willie Nelson objected to the party oath that a presidential candidate must â fully support â the party âs eventual nominee .
Kucinich crossed out the oath when he filed for a spot on the primary ballot .
Because it âs just a messaging platform , Twitter is far less complex than Facebook .
Nevertheless , misuse and abuse seem at least as common on the former as on the latter .
Some of our favorite Twitter etiquette rules follow .
Reconsider the running commentary
Live - tweeting sporting events or conference speeches may seem like a public service , but who âs listening ?
If you normally use Twitter to post once - a - week status updates but then abruptly let fly with 80 tweets in a day , you âll aggravate followers who are nât expecting their account to be inundated by your sudden outpouring .
Consider composing a blog post instead , or offer a single succinct observation each hour .
Understand @ replies
Twitter âs biggest failing is its inability to organize conversations ; and in this regard , overuse of @ replies can be extremely confusing to your followers .
The proper time for an @ reply is when you âre adding to a conversation publicly , preferably with a tweet that can stand ( more or less ) on its own .
â @bob - Yeah I know â is a waste of everyone âs time .
For simple responses , use a D message ( direct message ) instead .
Go easy on the acronyms
Twitter was designed for cell phones , but your iPhone has a full QWERTY keyboard , so there âs no need for the abbrevo - speak unless you are severely crunched for space or really are a kid .
( It is true that fitting tweets into a single message is a polite and admirable practice . )
Also , no matter how many people fail to take it seriously , spelling still counts on Twitter .
Think about the venue
As one reporter learned , it âs not okay to Twitter a funeral .
Twittering during a solemn ceremony ( wedding , briss , court proceeding ) is generally a no - no .
If you âre unsure whether a tweet or two is permissible , check with the event âs host .
Be prepared to receive a funny look in response , though .
Expect up - to - the - minute spoilers
Since Twitter concentrates on the current moment , it is unreasonable to expect tweeters to suppress or censor their comments for fear of spoiling a surprise .
Users should simply avoid the medium if they do nât want to know the outcome of a sporting event or the ending to a movie .
Do nât worry about following followers
In Twitter âs early days , it was commonplace for all users to follow anyone who followed them , regardless of whether they had anything interesting or relevant to say .
But Twitter has gotten too large for this , and Twitter long ago disabled the account option that let tweeters automatically reciprocate when someone chose to follow them .
Today reciprocating a Twitter follow is strictly voluntary , and there is no discourtesy in choosing not to ; still , it âs a good idea to look at the follower âs profile before you decide .
Retweet properly
When you want to rebroadcast ( or retweet ) someone âs post , the proper thing to do is add â RT @username â as a prefix to the message .
Occasionally , though , you âll find you exceed Twitter âs 140 character limit when you do .
The recommended course is to meet the character limit by truncating the end of the message .
It is also acceptable to edit the tweet as needed to fit , while retaining as much of the language of the original as possible .
Mind the plugs
If your feed consists of nothing but plugs for yourself and your work , most of your followers will unsubscribe .
Exceptions exist for automated news - feed services ( like @cnnbrk ) , which function more as the voice of a site than as a means for a person to share thoughts .
Never forget that Twitter is public
Do nât forget : Unlike a Facebook update , a Twitter post can be read by anyone .
If you do nât like the implications of this situation , either do nât use the service or set your updates as protected ( though some might argue this largely defeats the purpose of Twitter ) .

We âre in the middle of the U.S. Copyright Office âs triennial DMCA exemption rulemaking .
As you might expect , most of the filings are dry as dust , but buried in the latest submission by a coalition of big copyright owners ( publishers , Authors â Guild , BSA , MPAA , RIAA , etc. ) is an utterly astonishing argument .
Some background :
In light of the Sony - BMG CD incident , Alex and I asked the Copyright Office for an exemption allowing users to remove from their computers certain DRM software that causes security and privacy harm .
The CCIA and Open Source and Industry Association made an even simpler request for an exemption for DRM systems that â employ access control measures which threaten critical infrastructure and potentially endanger lives . â
Who could oppose that ?
The BSA , RIAA , MPAA , and friends â that âs who .
Their objections to these two requests ( and others ) consist mostly of lawyerly parsing , but at the end of their argument about our request comes this ( from pp. 22 - 23 of the document , if you âre reading along at home ) :
Furthermore , the claimed beneficial impact of recognition of the exemption â that it would â provide an incentive for the creation of protection measures that respect the security of consumers â computers while protecting the interests of the record labels â ( [ citation to our request ] ) â would be fundamentally undermined if copyright owners â and everyone else â were left in such serious doubt about which measures were or were not subject to circumvention under the exemption .
Hanging from the end of the above - quoted excerpt is a footnote :
This uncertainty would be even more severe under the formulations proposed in submissions 2 ( in which the terms â privacy or security â are left completely undefined ) or 8 [ i.e. , the CCIA request ] ( in which the boundaries of the proposed exemption would turn on whether access controls â threaten critical infrastructure and potentially endanger lives â ) .
You read that right .
They âre worried that there might be â serious doubt â about whether their future DRM access control systems are covered by these exemptions , and they think the doubt â would be even more severe â if the â exemption would turn on whether access controls â threaten critical infrastructure and potentially endanger lives â . â
Yikes .
One would have thought they âd make awfully sure that a DRM measure did nât threaten critical infrastructure or endanger lives , before they deployed that measure .
But apparently they want to keep open the option of deploying DRM even when there are severe doubts about whether it threatens critical infrastructure and potentially endangers lives .
And here âs the really amazing part .
In order to protect their ability to deploy this dangerous DRM , they want the Copyright Office to withhold from users permission to uninstall DRM software that actually does threaten critical infrastructure and endanger lives .
If past rulemakings are a good predictor , it âs more likely than not that the Copyright Office will rule in their favor .
This is part one of the text of a talk delivered to the Yale Computer Science department on November 28 .
The rest of the talk will be published tomorrow and Wednesday .
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 1991 .
Sixteen years ago .
What I âm going to try to do today is relate my undergraduate years in the CS department to my career , which consists of developing software , writing about software , and starting a software company .
And of course that âs a little bit absurd ; there âs a famous part at the beginning of MIT âs Introduction to Computer Science where Hal Abelson gets up and explains that Computer Science is nât about computers and it is nât a science , so it âs a little bit presumptuous of me to imply that CS is supposed to be training for a career in software development , any more than , say , Media Studies or Cultural Anthropology would be .
I âll press ahead anyway .
One of the most useful classes I took was a course that I dropped after the first lecture .
Another one was a class given by Roger Schank that was so disdained by the CS faculty that it was not allowed to count towards a degree in computer science .
But I âll get to that in a minute .
The third was this little gut called CS 322 , which you know of as CS 323 .
Back in my day , CS 322 took so much work that it was a 1Â½ credit class .
And Yale âs rule is , that extra half credit could only be combined with other half credits from the same department .
Apparently there were two other 1Â½ credit courses , but they could only be taken together .
So through that clever trickery , the half credit was therefore completely useless , but it did justify those weekly problem sets that took 40 hours to complete .
After years of students â complaining , the course was adjusted to be a 1 credit class , it was renumbered CS 323 , and still had weekly 40 hour problem sets .
Other than that , it âs pretty much the same thing .
I loved it , because I love programming .
The best thing about CS323 is it teaches a lot of people that they just ai nât never gonna be programmers .
This is a good thing .
People that do nât have the benefit of Stan teaching them that they ca nât be programmers have miserable careers cutting and pasting a lot of Java .
By the way , if you took CS 323 and got an A , we have great summer internships at Fog Creek .
See me afterwards .
As far as I can tell , the core curriculum has nât changed at all .
201 , 223 , 240 , 323 , 365 , 421 , 422 , 424 , 429 appear to be almost the same courses we took 16 years ago .
The number of CS majors is actually up since I went to Yale , although a temporary peak during the dotcom days makes it look like it âs down .
And there are a lot more interesting electives now than there were in my time .
So : progress .
For a moment there , I actually thought I âd get a PhD .
Both my parents are professors .
So many of their friends were academics that I grew up assuming that all adults eventually got PhDs .
In any case , I was thinking pretty seriously of going on to graduate school in Computer Science .
Until I tried to take a class in Dynamic Logic right here in this very department .
It was taught by Lenore Zuck , who is now at UIC .
I did nât last very long , nor did I understand much of anything that was going on .
From what I gather , Dynamic Logic is just like formal logic : Socrates is a man , all men are mortal , therefore Socrates is mortal .
The difference is that in Dynamic Logic truth values can change over time .
Socrates was a man , now he âs a cat , etc .
In theory this should be an interesting way to prove things about computer programs , in which state , i.e. , truth values , change over time .
In the first lecture Dr. Zuck presented a few axioms and some transformation rules and set about trying to prove a very simple thing .
She had a computer program â f := not f , â f is a Boolean , that simply flipped a bit , and the goal was to prove that if you ran this program an even number of times , f would finish with the same value as it started out with .
The proof went on and on .
It was in this very room , if I remember correctly , it looks like the carpet has nât been changed since then , and all of these blackboards were completely covered in the steps of the proof .
Dr. Zuck used proof by induction , proof by reductio ad absurdum , proof by exhaustion â the class was late in the day and we were already running forty minutes over â and , in desperation , proof by graduate student , whereby , she says , â I ca nât really remember how to prove this step , â and a graduate student in the front row says , â yes , yes , professor , that âs right . â
And when all was said and done , she got to the end of the proof , and somehow was getting exactly the opposite result of the one that made sense , until that same graduate student pointed out where , 63 steps earlier , some bit had been accidentally flipped due to a little bit of dirt on the board , and all was well .
For our homework , she told us to prove the converse : that if you run the program â f := not f â n times , and the bit is in the same state as it started , that n must be even .
I worked on that problem for hours and hours .
I had her original proof in front of me , going in one direction , which , upon closer examination , turned out to have all kinds of missing steps that were â trivial , â but not to me .
I read every word about Dynamic Logic that I could find in Becton , and I struggled with the problem late into the night .
I was getting absolutely nowhere , and increasingly despairing of theoretical computer science .
It occurred to me that when you have a proof that goes on for pages and pages , it âs far more likely to contain errors in the proof as our own intuition about the trivial statements that it âs trying to prove , and I decided that this Dynamic Logic stuff was really not a fruitful way of proving things about actual , interesting computer programs , because you âre more likely to make a mistake in the proof than you are to make a mistake in your own intuition about what the program â f := not f â is going to do .
So I dropped the course , thank God for shopping period , but not only that , I decided on the spot that graduate school in Computer Science was just not for me , which made this the single most useful course I ever took .
Now this brings me to one of the important themes that I âve learned in my career .
Time and time again , you âll see programmers redefining problems so that they can be solved algorithmically .
By redefining the problem , it often happens that they âre left with something that can be solved , but which is actually a trivial problem .
They do nât solve the real problem , because that âs intractable .
I âll give you an example .
You will frequently hear the claim that software engineering is facing a quality crisis of some sort .
I do nât happen to agree with that claim â the computer software most people use most of the time is of ridiculously high quality compared to everything else in their lives â but that âs beside the point .
This claim about the â quality crisis â leads to a lot of proposals and research about making higher quality software .
And at this point , the world divides into the geeks and the suits .
The geeks want to solve the problem automatically , using software .
They propose things like unit tests , test driven development , automated testing , dynamic logic and other ways to â prove â that a program is bug - free .
The suits are nât really aware of the problem .
They could nât care less if the software is buggy , as long as people are buying it .
Currently , in the battle between the geeks and the suits , the suits are winning , because they control the budget , and honestly , I do nât know if that âs such a bad thing .
The suits recognize that there are diminishing returns to fixing bugs .
Once the software hits a certain level of quality that allows it to solve someone âs problem , that person will pay for it and derive benefit out of it .
The suits also have a broader definition of â quality . â
Their definition is about as mercenary as you can imagine : the quality of software is defined by how much it increases my bonus this year .
Accidentally , this definition of quality incorporates a lot more than just making the software bug - free .
For example , it places a lot of value on adding more features to solve more problems for more people , which the geeks tend to deride by calling it â bloatware . â
It places value on aesthetics : a cool - looking program sells more copies than an ugly program .
It places value on how happy a program makes its users feel .
Fundamentally , it lets the users define their own concept of quality , and decide on their own if a given program meets their needs .
Now , the geeks are interested in the narrowly technical aspects of quality .
They focus on things they can see in the code , rather than waiting for the users to judge .
They âre programmers , so they try to automate everything in their life , and of course they try to automate the QA process .
This is how you get unit testing , which is not a bad thing , do nât get me wrong , and it âs how you get all these attempts to mechanically â prove â that a program is â correct . â
The trouble is that anything that ca nât be automated has to be thrown out of the definition of quality .
Even though we know that users prefer software that looks cooler , there âs no automated way to measure how cool looking a program is , so that gets left out of the automated QA process .
In fact what you âll see is that the hard - core geeks tend to give up on all kinds of useful measures of quality , and basically they get left with the only one they can prove mechanically , which is , does the program behave according to specification .
And so we get a very narrow , geeky definition of quality : how closely does the program correspond to the spec .
Does it produce the defined outputs given the defined inputs .
The problem , here , is very fundamental .
In order to mechanically prove that a program corresponds to some spec , the spec itself needs to be extremely detailed .
In fact the spec has to define everything about the program , otherwise , nothing can be proven automatically and mechanically .
Now , if the spec does define everything about how the program is going to behave , then , lo and behold , it contains all the information necessary to generate the program !
And now certain geeks go off to a very dark place where they start thinking about automatically compiling specs into programs , and they start to think that they âve just invented a way to program computers without programming .
Now , this is the software engineering equivalent of a perpetual motion machine .
It âs one of those things that crackpots keep trying to do , no matter how much you tell them it could never work .
If the spec defines precisely what a program will do , with enough detail that it can be used to generate the program itself , this just begs the question : how do you write the spec ?
Such a complete spec is just as hard to write as the underlying computer program , because just as many details have to be answered by spec writer as the programmer .
To use terminology from information theory : the spec needs just as many bits of Shannon entropy as the computer program itself would have .
Each bit of entropy is a decision taken by the spec- writer or the programmer .
So , the bottom line is that if there really were a mechanical way to prove things about the correctness of a program , all you âd be able to prove is whether that program is identical to some other program that must contain the same amount of entropy as the first program , otherwise some of the behaviors are going to be undefined , and thus unproven .
So now the spec writing is just as hard as writing a program , and all you âve done is moved one problem from over here to over there , and accomplished nothing whatsoever .
This seems like a kind of brutal example , but nonetheless , this search for the holy grail of program quality is leading a lot of people to a lot of dead ends .
The Windows Vista team at Microsoft is a case in point .
Apparently â and this is all based on blog rumors and innuendo â Microsoft has had a long term policy of eliminating all software testers who do nât know how to write code , replacing them with what they call SDETs , Software Development Engineers in Test , programmers who write automated testing scripts .
The old testers at Microsoft checked lots of things : they checked if fonts were consistent and legible , they checked that the location of controls on dialog boxes was reasonable and neatly aligned , they checked whether the screen flickered when you did things , they looked at how the UI flowed , they considered how easy the software was to use , how consistent the wording was , they worried about performance , they checked the spelling and grammar of all the error messages , and they spent a lot of time making sure that the user interface was consistent from one part of the product to another , because a consistent user interface is easier to use than an inconsistent one .
None of those things could be checked by automated scripts .
And so one result of the new emphasis on automated testing was that the Vista release of Windows was extremely inconsistent and unpolished .
Lots of obvious problems got through in the final product â¦ none of which was a â bug â by the definition of the automated scripts , but every one of which contributed to the general feeling that Vista was a downgrade from XP .
The geeky definition of quality won out over the suit âs definition ; I âm sure the automated scripts for Windows Vista are running at 100 % success right now at Microsoft , but it does nât help when just about every tech reviewer is advising people to stick with XP for as long as humanly possible .
It turns out that nobody wrote the automated test to check if Vista provided users with a compelling reason to upgrade from XP .
I do nât hate Microsoft , really I do nât .
In fact , my first job out of school was actually at Microsoft .
In those days it was not really a respectable place to work .
Sort of like taking a job in the circus .
People looked at you funny .
Really ?
Microsoft ?
On campus , in particular , it was perceived as corporate , boring , buttoned - down , making inferior software so that accountants can do , oh I do nât know , spreadsheets or whatever it is that accountants do .
Perfectly miserable .
And it all ran on a pathetic single - tasking operating system called MS - DOS full of arbitrary stupid limitations like 8 - character file names and no email and no telnet and no Usenet .
Well , MS - DOS is long gone , but the cultural gap between the Unixheads and the Windows users has never been wider .
This is a culture war .
The disagreements are very byzantine but very fundamental .
To Yale , Microsoft was this place that made toy business operating systems using three - decades - old computer science .
To Microsoft , â computer sciency â was a bad word used to make fun of new hires with their bizarre hypotheses about how Haskell is the next major programming language .
Just to give you one tiny example of the Unix - Windows cultural war .
Unix has this cultural value of separating user interface from functionality .
A righteous Unix program starts out with a command - line interface , and if you âre lucky , someone else will come along and write a pretty front end for it , with shading and transparency and 3D effects , and this pretty front end just launches the command - line interface in the background , which then fails in mysterious ways , which are then not reflected properly in the pretty front end which is now hung waiting for some input that it âs never going to get .
But the good news is that you can use the command line interface from a script .
Whereas the Windows culture would be to write a GUI app in the first place , and all the core functionality would be tangled up hopelessly with the user interface code , so you could have this gigantic application like Photoshop that âs absolutely brilliant for editing photos , but if you âre a programmer , and you want to use Photoshop to resize a folder of 1000 pictures so that each one fits in a 200 pixel box , you just ca nât write that code , because it âs all very tightly bound to a particular user interface .
Anyway , the two cultures roughly correspond to highbrow vs. lowbrow , and in fact , it âs reflected accurately in the curriculum of computer science departments throughout the country .
At Ivy League institutions , everything is Unix , functional programming , and theoretical stuff about state machines .
As you move down the chain to less and less selective schools Java starts to appear .
Move even lower and you literally start to see classes in topics like Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 101 , three credits .
By the time you get to the 2 year institutions , you see the same kind of SQL - Server - in - 21 - days â certification â courses you see advertised on the weekends on cable TV .
Is nât it time to start your career in ( different voice ) Java Enterprise Beans !

Cheney Impeachment
By BDN Staff
Wednesday , January 09 , 2008 â Bangor Daily News
Over the past 18 months , a core group of Democrats and others from the left has steadfastly maintained that President Bush and Vice President Cheney should be impeached .
Mainstream Democrats in Congress are sympathetic to their arguments , but most have bowed to the political reality that impeachment proceedings would gridlock the federal government in the last year of the Bush administration , distract lawmakers from resolving problems that affect the daily lives of Americans , and possibly trigger an endless cycle of reprisal impeachment attempts for future administrations .
There is another angle on this difficult question , raised by Rep. Michael Michaud in a Dec. 21 letter to Rep. John Conyers , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
â There is no doubt that at the very least this Administration has dangerously expanded the scope of executive authority and flaunted the constitutionally defined separation of powers , â Rep. Michaud wrote .
The letter urges Rep. Conyers to schedule impeachment hearings on Mr. Cheney , though not on the president âs conduct .
Those supporting impeachment argue Cheney in his role in the administration has repeatedly violated the Constitution on matters such as warrantless telephone eavesdropping , deliberately misled Congress and the American people about the threat posed by Iraq and Iran , revealed the name of a CIA agent , and ordered the abuse of prisoners in violation of international treaties .
The specific alleged abuses of power will , for the most part , fade away when the Bush - Cheney administration leaves Washington .
But the â dangerously expanded â powers of the executive branch cited by Rep.
Michaud could remain in place .
Those powers will be inherited regardless of which party takes the White House , and while Democrats may relish the opportunities that come with an expanded presidency , ultimately , such an imbalance in the government is unhealthy and will increase the chance of future abuses .
Mr. Bush âs interpretation of executive powers has led critics to dub his tenure the â imperial presidency . â
Rep. Michaud correctly notes in his call for hearings on impeachment of Mr. Cheney that : â Expansions and potential abuses of power by this administration become precedents for future ones , which lead to further erosions of our constitutional rights . â
Rep .
Michaud had given the impeachment matter long and careful thought , his press secretary Monica Castellanos reported , before calling for the hearings .
The congressman has not prejudged the outcome of the hearings and possible investigation , she said , but he strongly believes those steps are essential in restoring Americans â trust in their government .
It is a big step for Congress to take , especially in a politically charged presidential election year .
But if it is possible , a dispassionate examination of the manner in which Mr. Cheney and this administration have stretched the executive branch to the point of distorting its constitutional definition would be enlightening , and could help rebalance the powers of the federal government .
The " X Improves My Design Anyway " Myth
It âs amazing how often the bandwagon impulse overrides clear thinking .
Perfectly intelligent people will idiotically claim that global warming is nât happening , because the political party that represented their views on abortion happens to say so .
Compassionate and considerate children often turn into bullies in junior high school because they need to belong to a group .
And in software development , advocates of programming techniques will adopt a masochistic kind of â I deserved it anyway â attitude toward the things that it makes hard .
An example of the last variety popped up recently in Tim Ottinger âs blog on TDD .
The way it manifests itself here is in the â X improves my design anyway â myth .
This myth says that even though I have to do things a harder way now , it âs really good for me anyway and I should have been doing it all along .
Much like castor oil is good for children , I suppose .
Tim Ottinger now advocates changing style and convention guidelines in companies to say that you should be doing things the hard way anyhow , so that the problems caused by TDD just sort of magically go away .
To be clear , I âm not saying TDD is a bad idea .
I âm saying that competent software developers ought to make rational choices , by considering the advantages and disadvantages of things for a particular purpose .
This is directly opposed to the idea that we ought to stack the deck by defining away the disadvantages and pretending they are good design that we just did nât recognize until now .
Among the things
Tim thinks are now good design :
Making member variables non-private , so that tests can get to them .
Also , weakening the distinction between public and private interface ( apparently , in order to help people understand the code â¦ huh ? )
Wrapping basically every new object allocation in a factory method with some kind of abstraction for changing the implementation on the fly ( in other words , the thing that makes J2 EE hell ) .
Tim says â Calling a concrete class constructor inside the body of a method now makes you cringe . â
That does nât look like a good way to do things to me .
And after all this , the conclusion is : â For the most part , TDD forces you to start doing the things you always should have done â¦ â Bingo !
The myth in action .
Of course , Tim is nât just stupid .
There is no one who does nât do this .
Other examples include :
Declaring all your variables in a block at the top of a Pascal procedure is a little inconvenient , but choosing your local variables carefully in advance of writing the code improves your design .
It âs hard to map arbitrary data structures in your application language to the relational database , but designing your data in a relational way first improves your design .
Monads can be verbose and difficult to use in Haskell , but that makes people wary about using monads , which improves design .
Multiple inheritance is impossible in Java , but untangling your multiple inheritance hierarchies improves your design .
This myth happens when we adopt a philosophy or approach to building software .
Invariably there are certain tasks that are made more difficult by the new approach , and there are somewhat painful workarounds to these scenarios .
However , because the word â workaround â is a bit of an ugly one , we want to sweep this under a rug .
The easiest way to do this is to take the painful workaround , and claim that it was the right way to go about things anyway .
Then we get â X improves my design anyway â â where X is some procedure used to work around a limitation of the approach .
Of course , X very well may improve your design .
If that âs the case , it âs worth the time to step back from the context ( programming language , TDD , relational databases , etc. ) that motivated you to do X in the first place , and see whether X makes sense without that context .
If so , great !
Tell people about it , and maybe it âll catch on as a design technique in its own right .
But if it only makes sense in the context of your technique , then it âs time to start calling it what it is : a workaround for a shortcoming of the technique .
( Hint : if you just ca nât imagine writing good code without your technique and so think this exercise is futile , then you are too far on the bandwagon already ; let somebody else decide . )
In Tim âs case , a lot of his recommendations simply do nât stand the test of scrutiny .
The debate over public member variables happened , and was lost .
If TDD requires more public member variables , that âs a workaround for a limitation of TDD ; it âs not good design .
J2EE ( sorry , JavaEE ! ) is needlessly complex and difficult to use , and people are moving to other languages and frameworks because of it .
If TDD requires recycling the same endless factories and â okay , how the hell do I get an instance of this interface now ? â that plagued JavaEE , then that âs also a limitation of TDD as well .
Some other recommendations do stand the test of time .
Ultimately , though , the problem is the attempt to take these decisions out of the hands of competent developers , and put them in the hands of dead convention and style guidelines .
This is denial â pretending that there is no decision to be made , when there clearly is a decision .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Older people who have significant trouble staying awake during the day have more than four times the normal risk of having a stroke , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .

They also found a higher risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems in seniors who regularly nod off during the day without planning to .
â Even when we controlled for things like hypertension , diabetes , physical activity , obesity and socioeconomic status , we found that people who had significant daytime dozing were much more likely to end up with stroke , â said Bernadette Boden - Albala of Columbia University in New York .
Her study of 2,153 adults with an average age of 73 found the risk of stroke was 2.6 times greater for those classified as doing â some dozing â during the day compared to those with â no dozing . â
Those in the â significant dozing â group had a 4.5 times greater risk .
The study , presented at an American Stroke Association conference in New Orleans , is one of the first to look at the relationship between unplanned napping and â vascular events â such as stroke .
Other studies have found that people with sleep apnea who briefly stop breathing throughout the night are at high risk of stroke .
This can cause daytime sleepiness .
Boden - Albala âs study involved mostly Hispanic men and women over 40 living in the same community in New York City .
None had suffered a stroke .
The researchers asked people to rate how often they dozed in specific situations , such as watching TV , sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol and stopping briefly in traffic while driving .
Some 44 percent reported no dozing , 47 percent had some dozing and 9 percent reported significant dozing .
After 2 1/2 years , they checked to see how many had strokes or other vascular problems , such as a heart attack .
They detected 40 strokes and 127 other vascular events .
UNCERTAIN CAUSE
They found those who had the most trouble staying awake had the highest stroke risk , but the biggest surprise was in the moderate dozing group .
â We found that group was also significantly associated with about a 2.5 - fold increased risk of stroke and about a 60 percent increased risk of having any kind of vascular event , â Boden - Albala said in a telephone interview .
She said it is not clear what is causing the daytime sleepiness or if there is a link with sleep apnea .
â Whether it is sleep deprivation or sleep apnea , physiological changes are occurring that may be related to this increased risk .
I think we may need to investigate that further , â she said .
A separate study at the conference found moderate aerobic fitness helped protect people from stroke , even if they had other risk factors such as heart disease or diabetes .
The study , which involved more than 60,000 people , is the first to single out the benefits of aerobic fitness on stroke prevention .
â We found that a low - to - moderate amount of aerobic fitness for men and women across the whole adult age spectrum would be enough to substantially reduce stroke risk , â said Steven Hooker of the University of South Carolina .
About 780,000 U.S. adults suffer a stroke each year , and about 150,000 of those will die .

Is Living Under the Influence ( of religion ) less dangerous than Driving Under the Influence ?
In the news this week , we have the case of Eunice Spry , a British woman who systematically tortured her adopted and foster children because of her religious convictions .
She did pleasant things like forcing the children to eat their own vomit for being greedy , and making a child with nighttime enuresis ( bed- wetting ) at the age of 4 wear a sign reminding everybody that she was an evil attention - seeker .
It does n't stop there , either .
She also prevented a teenaged girl who was injured in a car accident and temporarily confined to a wheelchair from walking in order to collect more compensation money , despite the fact that the prognosis was she would regain ability to walk within 6 months .
After moving out , they children submitted to medical examinations which showed evidence of internal scarring due to Eunice 's punishment of choice - forcing the children to vomit and then eat it .
If you are n't sick by now , you should be .
Obviously , this woman 's problems extended beyond her religious beliefs , but her absolutely inhumane treatment of those children was done under the guise of punishing them for what would seem to be the seven deadly sins .
All she would need to do is chop somebody 's pregnant wife 's head off and send it to them and we could make a movie .
Oh , wait , somebody already did .
In my opinion , crimes like these should be a more serious offense than murder .
Going Andrea Yates on them would have been merciful .
I almost wish that a hell existed so she could go there .
Do n't go away yet , there 's more .
A Washington , D.C. woman , Banita Jacks , sat in her home for over two weeks with the decomposing bodies of her 4 daughters who were apparently " possessed . "
Now tell me :
Where would she get this idea of demon possession if it had n't been planted in her mind by religion ?
I realize that before mental illnesses were understood , demon possession was a common diagnosis , but we 're living in the 21st century here , people .
That concept would not have survived the Enlightenment if it was n't for the eternally ubiquitous presence of that festering boil we refer to as religion .
I know the next argument that you 're going to make , too .
" Well , she was insane , so she would have done something horrible anyway . "
How do you know that ?
How do you know that she would have had any concept of a " demon " if it was n't placed there ?
The bible clearly states that this is a war not of flesh and bones , but of spirits and the forces of good and evil .
One is to arm themselves for battle and prepare to deflect the attacks of satan and his minions .
People still believe in this stuff !
Does anybody get this ?
The Pope is calling for mass exorcisms , and some evangelical christians believe that sicknesses are caused by satan and that you can " cast them out in Jesus ' name . "
It is a travesty that the more obsequious among us have bought the propaganda hook , line , and sinker .
Anybody who cannot see the correlation here is either blind or indifferent and will allow these things to continue to happen .
All because we can't talk about religion like that - it 's just not nice .
Obviously , the vast majority of religious people do not commit these kinds of crimes , but there is an overwhelming amount of violence perpetrated upon people that is religiously motivated .
I 've already pointed out the child abuse that occurs in the name of religion , and some christian parenting sites teach you how to " switch " your children with PVC tubing from the age of 9 months .
Incidentally , a devotee of theirs was charged with first - degree murder when she wrapped her 4 year old son tightly in blankets because he kept getting out of bed and he suffocated to death .
All because god is a god of order , not chaos , and you must maintain order in your home .
Talk about fragile egos on these people who wo n't be manipulated by the cries of a hungry newborn baby .
I said this in my first post on this topic , and obviously I need to repeat myself for the either dense or dishonest critics , but even if religion only exploits existing mental illnesses , should we not give people one less reason to kill or harm others ?
Imagine a scenario in which small groups of racist people are still terrorizing anybody with darker skin than them , but since the vast majority of white people do n't act that way , we just should n't address it .
In all honesty , the reason that most religious people do not act like the Phelps family is because they are nominal ( insert religion here ) only .
A study done by the Barna Group , a christian research firm , showed that many young Americans see christians as hypocritical , and that they really are hypocrites .
They surveyed 1003 adults on 20 " lifestyle elements , " including things such as altruism , sexual behavior , and substance abuse .
The results : on 15 of the 20 behaviors , evangelical christians were indistinguishable from us heathens , and the areas in which they do differ ( porn consumption , cursing in public , playing the lottery , and music piracy ) , the difference is minor ( One - third of heathens vs. one - quarter of christians ) except for the music piracy , in which there is a 7 % difference .
That is not likely because of the commandment to not steal , but rather that resisting the urge to download music is much easier than resisting the urge to have sex .
If that 's not causing cognitive dissonance , I do n't know what will .
On a larger scale , we have three studies on the impact of religion on society , and neither of them is going to vindicate religion .
The first was published in the Journal of Religion and Society and authored by Gregory Paul , a social scientist .
He concluded that :
" In general , higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide , juvenile and early adult mortality , STD infection rates , teen pregnancy and abortion in the prosperous democracies .
" The United States is almost always the most dysfunctional of the developing democracies , sometimes spectacularly so . "
" The non-religious , proevolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator .
" The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted . "
( TimesOnline.co.uk )
The next was a Pew global survey that graphed the correlation between religiosity and wealth .
Although the U.S. was an outlier , there was still an inverse statistical correlation between rates of religious belief and wealth .
Attached to that article was a site you can use to determine rates of religiosity in different areas of the US and the corresponding population data .
( It is slightly dated with 2000 as the year the data was collected . )
There is a similar correlation in the US among different areas as there is among countries worldwide .
Below are the two graphs plotting the data .
The third and final study is perhaps the most comprehensive .
Phil Zuckerman analyzed levels of organic ( not coercive ) atheism and how the countries scored on the " Human Development Index , " which rates countries on various indicators of societal health such as homicide rates , gender equality , poverty , literacy , and infant mortality .
Not surprisingly , higher levels of atheism have a positive correlation to better levels of societal health as measured by these statistics .
The top 25 countries all have very high levels of non-believers with the exception of Ireland .
There was an increase in suicide rates among some of the atheistic countries , but the author notes that all of those countries were formerly parts of the USSR and are still suffering from the effects of that .
( nb : The link to the study itself is gone , but it is available in the Cambridge Companion to Atheism )
So , due to the insistence of numerous people , I have been working on a more official thesis on theism as a mind disorder , but getting the actual studies often requires expensive memberships or trips to the library .
Do n't worry - it 's coming .
Even if you disagree on that point , I think that there 's enough data here to support the claim that religion has deleterious effects on society .
One should use caution while using religion until one is certain of its effects .
Forget sports doping .
The next frontier is brain doping .
As Major League Baseball struggles to rid itself of performance - enhancing drugs , people in a range of other fields are reaching for a variety of prescription pills to enhance what counts most in modern life .
Despite the potential side effects , academics , classical musicians , corporate executives , students and even professional poker players have embraced the drugs to clarify their minds , improve their concentration or control their emotions .
â There is nât any question about it -- they made me a much better player , â said Paul Phillips , 35 , who credited the attention deficit drug Adderall and the narcolepsy pill Provigil with helping him earn more than $ 2.3 million as a poker player .

The medicine cabinet of so - called cognitive enhancers also includes Ritalin , commonly given to schoolchildren for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and beta blockers , such as the heart drug Inderal .
Researchers have been investigating the drug Aricept , which is normally used to slow the decline of Alzheimer âs patients .
The drugs have nât been tested extensively in healthy people , but their physiological effects in the brain are well understood .
They are all just precursors to the blockbuster drug that labs are racing to develop .
â Whatever company comes out with the first memory pill is going to put Viagra to shame , â said University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Paul Root Wolpe .

Unlike the anabolic steroids , human growth hormone and blood - oxygen boosters that plague athletic competitions , the brain drugs have nât provoked similar outrage .
People who take them say the drugs are nât giving them an unfair advantage but merely allow them to make the most of their hard - earned skills .
In the real world , there are no rules to prevent overachievers from using legally prescribed drugs to operate at peak mental performance .
What patient would nât want their surgeon to be completely focused during a life - or - death procedure ?
â If there were drugs for investment bankers , journalists , teachers and scientists that made them more successful , they would use them too , â said Charles E. Yesalis , a doping researcher and emeritus professor at Pennsylvania State University .
â Why does anyone think this would be limited to an athlete ? â
The growth of the brain drugs bears a striking resemblance to the post - World War I evolution of plastic surgery -- developed to rehabilitate badly disfigured soldiers but later embraced by healthy people who wanted larger breasts and fewer wrinkles .

The use of cognitive - enhancing drugs has been well documented among high school and college students .
A 2005 survey of more than 10,000 college students found 4 % to 7 % of them tried ADHD drugs at least once to remain focused on exams or pull all - nighters .
At some colleges , more than one - quarter of students surveyed said they had sampled the pills .
The ubiquitous mental stimulant is coffee , and a morning jolt is sufficient for many .
But as scientists were developing drugs to treat serious brain disorders , they found more potent substances .
Sharon Morein - Zamir , a psychologist at Cambridge University who writes about the ethics of brain enhancement , said her interest in the medications was largely academic .
But when someone she knew who had been taking Provigil for a neurological condition offered her some pills , Morein - Zamir âs curiosity was piqued .
â I knew the literature and wondered what it felt like , â she said .

The drug helped her focus as she worked at her computer for hours straight .
But she wondered if it was a placebo effect .
â Maybe I would have gotten it done anyway , â said Morein - Zamir , who launched an Internet poll Wednesday to ask scientists about their use of brain - enhancing drugs .
Philips , the poker player , started using Adderall after he was diagnosed with ADHD five years ago and later got a prescription for Provigil to further improve his focus .
ADHD drugs work by increasing the level of the brain chemical dopamine , which is thought to improve attention .
Provigil âs mechanism of action is not well understood , but boosting the effect of dopamine is thought to be part of it .
The drugs improved his concentration during high - stakes tournaments , he said , allowing him to better track all the action at his table .

â Poker is the sort of game that a lot of people can play well sporadically , but tournaments are mostly won by people who can play close to their best at all times , â he said .
â It requires significant mental effort to play in top form for 12 hours a day , five days in a row . â
In the world of classical music , beta blockers such as Inderal have become nearly as commonplace as metronomes .
The drugs block adrenaline receptors in the heart and blood vessels , helping to control arrhythmias and high blood pressure .
They also block adrenaline receptors in the brain .
â You still have adrenaline flowing in your body , but you do nât feel that adrenaline rush so you âre not distracted by your own nervousness , â said Dr. Bernd F. Remler , a neurologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee .

That âs why Sarah Tuck , a veteran flutist with the San Diego Symphony , takes them to stave off the jitters that musicians refer to as â rubber fingers . â
â When your heart is racing and your hands are shaking and you have difficulty breathing , it is difficult to perform , â said Tuck , 41 , who discovered them when she began performing professionally 15 years ago .
A survey she conducted a decade ago revealed one - quarter of flutists used the pills before some or all of their performances or in high - pressure situations like auditions .
She believes use is now more widespread and estimates that three - quarters of musicians she knows use the drugs at least occasionally .
Prescriptions for Inderal and other beta blockers can be readily obtained from physicians .
Tuck said some doctors had told her they used the drugs themselves to calm their own nerves before making presentations at medical meetings .
Musicians say their drug use is all aboveboard .

â It âs not like we âre sending our clubhouse attendants to BALCO to get us our Inderal , â said double bassist Bruce Ridge , 44 , referring to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative that allegedly provided slugger Barry Bonds and other athletes with performance - enhancing drugs .
But cosmetic neurology , as some call it , has risks .
Ritalin , Adderall and other ADHD drugs can cause headaches , insomnia and loss of appetite .
Provigil can make users nervous or anxious and bring on headaches , while beta blockers can cause drowsiness , fatigue and wheezing .
One Stanford University study found that low doses of Aricept improved the performance of healthy pilots as they tried to master new skills in a flight stimulator , but the side effects -- dizziness and vomiting -- were less than desirable in a pilot .
No one has conducted thorough studies about how brain - boosting drugs would affect healthy people after weeks or months of use , said Dr. Anjan Chatterjee , a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania .

Negative consequences may not be limited to people who popped the pills .
Martha J. Farah , a bioethicist who teaches undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania , said she was beginning to detect resentment toward students who used the drugs from classmates who did not .
She has wondered whether improving productivity through artificial means also might undermine the value of hard work .
In an article published today in the journal Nature , Morein - Zamir and University of Cambridge neuroscientist Barbara J. Sahakian say that clear guidelines are needed to decide what âs fair .
It may be reasonable to ban the drugs in competitive situations , such as taking the SAT .
But in other cases , they wrote , people such as airport screeners , air - traffic controllers or combat soldiers might be encouraged to take them .
With a slew of memory enhancers in development , the issues are not academic .

Memory Pharmaceuticals of Montvale , N.J. , for example , is eyeing drugs to combat those pesky â senior moments â that are considered a normal part of aging .
â If there were drugs that actually made you smarter , good Lord , I have no doubt that their use would become epidemic , â Yesalis said .
â Just think what it would do to anybody âs career in about any area .
There are not too many occupations where it âs really good to be dumb . â

Noe Valley resident Evan Graner , 31 , is n't going out on the town as often as he used to , using the money he saves to pay down debt .
Regnaldo Woods , 20 , better known as YQ , has stopped buying fast food so he can help his mother with mortgage payments on their Daly City home .
Bella Comelo of San Leandro was never a big spender , but she used to fork out about $ 400 to $ 500 each year for clothes .
Now she 's stopped buying apparel altogether , fearful of what a weakening economy might do to family finances .
" I know the recession is coming .
I 'm more cautious than before , " said Comelo , 69 .
From Morgan Hill to Moraga , from Santa Rosa to Santa Cruz , Bay Area residents are tightening their belts .
You might say it 's a move from shop till you drop to dropping the shopping .
Dire reports of an economy on a downward spiral are prompting people from many walks of life to rethink spending plans , cut back on extravagances and set aside what they can in anticipation of harder times .
It 's all part of a nationwide consumer retrenchment that 's not only an effect of a listless economy , but also a major contributor to that weakness .
The gathering pullback by consumers threatens to knock out the most important prop holding up the economy , across the region and across the nation .
Purchases of goods and services by ordinary Americans - everything from haircuts and soda to SUVs and HDTVs - represent roughly two - thirds of the nation 's economic activity .
The question now is how far consumers will pare their spending and how much damage that might do to an economy already on its knees .
Forecasters tell us to keep an eye on the job market and watch how much people are earning .
The evidence there is disquieting .
Rising unemployment and scant wage gains are cutting into the disposable cash of ordinary Americans .
" That bodes poorly for consumers , " said John Lonski , chief economist with the credit rating firm Moody 's Investors Service .
Combine a cash squeeze with the fear factor and you have a recipe for a consumer slowdown .
The latest numbers show consumer spending growth near a standstill .
Nationwide , outlays for personal consumption rose just 0.2 percent in December from the month before , the Commerce Department reported recently .
Retail sales this holiday season posted their weakest gains since the beginning of the decade .
And chain store sales last month were up only 0.5 percent from the comparable period the year before , the weakest January since records were first kept in 1970 , according to the International Council of Shopping Centers .
The newfound hesitation to spend represents an economic sea change .
Until recently , Americans showed themselves to be redoubtable shoppers , reaching for their credit cards through thick or thin - even after the trauma of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
" Consumers have historically surprised us with their willingness to spend no matter what , " said Scott Hoyt , an analyst with the research firm Moody 's Economy.com .
" Every time we try to write them off , they find some way to finance their spending and keep going . "
This time seems to be different .
The toxic combination of a housing market crash , falling stock prices , rising costs for goods and services , a feeble dollar and climbing unemployment might just be knocking the American consumer for a loop .
The Bay Area , where housing prices and other living costs are in the stratosphere , has long been tough on the wallet .
Now , with the jobless rate up , home prices in free fall and business activity slowing , more and more people find themselves on the edge .
" The price of milk has gone up tremendously ... the price of milk , the price of gasoline , " complained Larry West , 58 , an out - of - work technology contractor from Walnut Creek .
" That 's what 's killing me .
I look at my nest egg and think I can't survive . "
To be sure , plenty of people in the affluent Bay Area have the means and the will to keep spending .
Norman Collier , 60 , an engineer for a military contractor , lives with his wife in South San Jose .
He describes himself as cost conscious , buying groceries and gas at Costco or Wal - Mart .
He does n't have expensive hobbies .
For him and his wife , gardening is their biggest indulgence .
" We 're very big into tomatoes , " he said .
But they did n't scrimp this holiday season .
They bought clothes and a computer screen for their 24 - year - old son and a phone for their 26 - year - old daughter .
" We probably spent as much or more than we usually do , " he reported .
To get a sense of the mood at the mall , The Chronicle interviewed a range of area residents about their views on the economy and their shopping habits .
We found widespread worry .
People are feeling the pinch directly as the values of their homes and investments fall , and the cost of living goes up .
Some have lost jobs or seen their incomes fall .
Many say they are cutting back , especially on little luxuries such as restaurant meals .
During a recent weekday afternoon at Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo , of four consumers stopped at random only one was actually buying something - and that was a photograph of his daughter .
Others were returning merchandise or , in one case , picking up a paycheck .
But not everyone is in retreat .
For every Larry West , we found a Norman Collier .
Even in a downturn , the bottom is n't likely to fall out of the regional economy .
Consumers are simply too diverse for neat generalizations .
Perhaps the best thing is just to listen to what a few of them have to say .
Larry West , 58 , Walnut Creek
If there 's anything that will throw spending into reverse , it 's losing your job .
That 's what happened to Larry West .
For most of the last decade , West has worked steadily as a contract information technology manager , overseeing large projects .
But in November , his job with a major telecommunications company ended .
He 's not been able to line up anything since , despite sending out an average of five inquiries a week .
" I have some money in the bank , " he explained .
" As a contractor , you always try to keep a reserve .
My reserve is not as big as it should have been . "
West , who lives by himself in a condo , said he 's slashed dramatically what he spends on dining and entertainment .
He and his girlfriend no longer take weekend trips to places like the Wine Country .
He said he 's shocked by how expensive everyday items such as food and gasoline have become .
" I 've cut down a lot on the quality of the groceries I buy , " he noted .
" I 'm a cheese lover , but I skip cheese now when I go to the grocery store . "
Except during the tech crash at the beginning of the decade , when one project ended , West almost always was able to find something else quickly .
He 's surprised at how little response his applications have gotten .
Now he 's considering looking in other places , such as Los Angeles and Florida .
" I'm a people person and I like working with groups , " he said .
" What I 'm really good at is talking on the phone . "
Bella Comelo , 69 , San Leandro
By all rights , Bella Comelo should n't be worrying about money .
She and husband Ernest have paid off their ranch - style house .
Social Security , her husband 's pension from his job with Alameda County and Comelo 's sick leave pay from her job with the Oakland Unified School District provide an adequate income .
They have plenty of money set aside .
All the same , she 's nervous .
One friend lost a job at a bank , another at a mortgage company .
Falling stock prices spooked her .
Both she and her husband have health problems , which each month cost hundreds of dollars above what they get from Medicare and insurance .
The price of their staple diet of fish and vegetables has gone up .
So have bus fares .
What 's more , she said , " In my neighborhood , houses were not selling .
That was an indication that hard times were coming . "
Always frugal , Comelo has trimmed spending even further .
She did n't give holiday presents to friends this year and she 's stopped shopping for clothes .
" I'm in a good situation , " Comelo said .
" But I do n't know how long this recession will last .
We do n't want to take chances , dip into savings . "
Comelo says her attitude reflects her upbringing .
She migrated to the United States from India about 25 years ago .
" We are naturally the saving type , " she explained .
" We come from a place where there was no Social Security .
We have to take care of ourselves . "
Bill Hillebrand , 51 , Sunnyvale
Bill Hillebrand had a grand vision when he planned the remodeling job on his house .
Then the economy started softening and Hillebrand began to worry about how his landscaping business might be affected .
Now " grand " is no longer the operative word for the project .
He and wife Sharon , a Pilates instructor , plan to add 600 square feet to their tract home , which they share with their 9 - year - old twins .
They 're putting in a family room , two bathrooms and a master closet , while renovating the kitchen .
Originally they budgeted about $ 60,000 , a price Hillebrand thought was realistic because of his contractor connections .
They 've since scaled back to about $ 35,000 , and will suspend work when money runs out .
" We 've decided to be extremely careful , " Hillebrand said .
" We will do a lot of the work ourselves .
Instead of buying designer fixtures , we 'll go to Home Depot . "
Hillebrand had planned to take out a loan to finance the project .
But he 's decided to stick with savings , cash flow and a tax refund .
" As you go into what looks like a recession - or at least a downturn - the last thing you want to do is take on more debt , " he said .
So far , Hillebrand 's business has n't felt much effect from a slowing economy .
But some of his vendors tell him they 're getting fewer calls .
One of them , looking for a little extra cash , even asked if he wanted to rent a truck the vendor could n't use .
As for his customers , Hillebrand is concerned about recession psychology .
" So many of these decisions are emotional , " he said .
" They definitely have the money .
But if they 're not feeling right about the world , why should they spend it ? "
Evan Graner , 31 , San Francisco
There are plenty of people like Evan Graner in the Bay Area - young , single , with good - paying jobs and no mortgages to carry .
It 's easy to get sucked into a lifestyle filled with restaurant meals , weekend trips , nice vacations , concerts , movies and plays , all paid for with plastic .
But as the economy stalled , Graner got religion .
Instead of spending so much , he started working hard to pay off his $ 25,000 in credit card debt .
And when he gets his anti-recession tax rebate , it 's going to his student loan .
Graner used to lay out $ 7 to $ 12 every workday for lunch .
Now he brings his own meals .
He 's going to movies and the theater about half as often as he once did .
He told his friends no on a Hawaii trip this year .
And he 's boosted the amount budgeted to pay his card debt to $ 1,100 from $ 700 .
" Whipping out the credit card is something I 'm doing a lot less , " said Graner , who works as a brand manager for a large financial services company .
" I 'm not doing as many things with my friends on weekends because there is n't cash on hand . "
The catalyst for this latter - day thrift was the plunge of the housing and stock markets .
" Part of it is that I 'm getting older and I 'm getting more responsible , " Graner explained .
" But the other thing is that when things like this happen in the marketplace , you 're forced to look at your own situation .
I do n't think I would have changed if things had n't taken the downturn they did . "
Still , Graner stresses , he has not taken a vow of poverty .
" I 'm still going skiing at Tahoe on the weekends , " he said .
" I 've not given up the skiing because I paid for it already . "
Art and Lindsay Okamoto , 40 and 35 , Redwood Shores
For Art and Lindsay Okamoto , it 's business as usual .
But then the two are n't high rollers anyway .
" I do n't think that the downturn has affected our spending , " Art Okamoto said .
" But we 're typically cautious . "
He is a product manager for a software company .
His wife works for a children 's health foundation .
Their daughter Elin celebrated her first birthday at the end of January .
The Okamotos took the day off to spend time with her and get her portrait taken .
" We definitely spend within our means .
We 've never been very extravagant , " Lindsay Okamoto said .
The couple say they set aside as much as they can to fund retirement accounts .
Major outlays include payments on the condo they bought four years ago and a car .
Other than that , " it 's just day - to - day items , " Art Okamoto said .
" We keep an eye on things . "
He is philosophical about what 's happening with housing and stocks .
" We bought our place .
If it goes down , that 's what 's happened , " Art Okamoto said .
As for his investments , he added , " I 'm diversified enough .
I 'm not worried . "
' YQ ' Woods , 20 , Daly City
For Regnaldo Lequan " YQ " Woods , it all came into focus when a woman his mother knows lost her home a month or so ago .
" She got kicked out , " he said .
" It just opened our eyes .
It 's really happening .
People can lose their house . "
His mother , who works for AT&T , now buys less expensive groceries and has turned down the heat in the Daly City house where they live with Woods ' 13 - year - old sister .
" My mother laid down the law , " he said .
" She 's very nervous . "
Woods has a budding hip - hop career , including a performance scheduled at Cogswell College in Sunnyvale next month .
He 's a student at College of San Mateo and works at the Disney Store in Hillsdale Shopping Center .
Lately , he 's been economizing so he can help his mother with the mortgage bill .
A few hundred dollars usually go each month to house payments .
" I help out as much as possible , " he said .
" Whenever something is needed , I come through . "
The losers in all this are Quiznos and Burger King , where Woods used to drop his lunch money .
" Those two killed me , " he said .
" Now I 'm usually packing a lunch from home . "
Many people have contributed to developing and promoting the use of regular expressions since they were invented about half a century ago .
Here 's a short list of some of the most influential people behind the technology .
I 've written this up for two reasons :
For people who 've only gotten into the technology recently but are interested in some of the history and pioneers behind it .
Since I fit the above description , I 'm hoping readers will help fill me in on other people I 've forgotten about or otherwise left out .
Alfred Aho
Aho is the " A " in AWK , and co-author of the Dragon Book â a classic reference covering such topics as building regular expression compilers .
He created the initial version of egrep , which provided a big jump in expressiveness from the primitive beginnings of early Unix grep .

Jeffrey Friedl
Friedl began using regular expressions with Unix in 1980 .
He has since written the definitive work on the subject : Mastering Regular Expressions , published by O'Reilly Media .
Now in its third edition , it is widely considered a classic programming book ( see e.g. this Slashdot review ) .
The longevity of his experience with regexes helps to make him a shrewd opponent in regex debates â¦ odds are he 's already succinctly countered your quackery ten or more years ago on Usenet , and has the links to prove it .
Friedl lives in Kyoto , Japan with his family of three .

Jan Goyvaerts
Goyvaerts â a Belgian who 's been living in Thailand for several years â is not as widely known as the others on this list , but his contributions towards helping thousands of people learn and use regular expressions are significant .
Goyvaerts creates the best - in - class tools RegexBuddy and PowerGREP , which use his own JGsoft regex engine ( notable for its support of most syntax from popular regex flavors including Perl , . NET , and Java ) .
His website regular - expressions .info â based on the PowerGREP / RegexBuddy help files â is the best and most popular multi- flavor regex tutorial or reference online .

Philip Hazel
Hazel grew up in South Africa and has a PhD in applied mathematics .
He 's best known for writing Exim ( a popular open source mail transfer agent ) and the PCRE regex library .
PCRE is one of the best regex libraries in the world and is used by many projects including Apache , PHP , and even Apple 's Safari ( although in Safari 's case there are core differences that result , e.g. , from incompatibilities between the PCRE and ECMAScript regex flavors ) .
Hazel worked for the University of Cambridge 's Computing Service for over 30 years until he retired at the end of September 2007 .

Stephen Kleene
In the 1950s , distinguished American mathematician Stephen Kleene invented regular expressions , which is what he called his notation for expressing the algebra of regular sets .
The regex * metacharacter ( called the Kleene star ) is named after him .
Kleene helped lay the foundations for theoretical computer science through his work on recursion theory , which resulted in him being awarded the National Medal of Science in 1990 .

Henry Spencer
Spencer is a Canadian programmer and space enthusiast who created three widely used , adapted , and influential regular expression libraries .
In 1986 , he was the first to release a regex library which could be freely included in other programs .
Perl 2's regex package was based on and enhanced from Spencer 's library , but his technological tour de force was creating the regex package used by Tcl .
This implementation , Jeffrey Friedl writes , " is a hybrid [ NFA / DFA engine ] with the best of both worlds " . [ 1 ]

Ken Thompson
Thompson is a hacker demigod and the principal inventor of Unix .
He received the Turing Award in 1983 , the National Medal of Technology in 1998 , and the IEEE 's Tsutomu Kanai Award in 1999 .
Thompson introduced regular expressions to the computing world with his version of the QED text editor , and later ed and other tools .
Thompson 's original regular expression search implementation is still considered by some to be superior to modern , backtracking algorithms .

Larry Wall
Wall created and continues to oversee development of Perl , which has done more than any other programming language to popularize and extend the power of regular expressions .
Many programming languages including ColdFusion , Java , JavaScript , the .NET Framework , PHP , Python , and Ruby have since adopted regex syntax and features similar to Perl's .
The recently released Perl 5.10 continues to push the state of the art in regex power , and upcoming changes outlined by Wall for Perl 6 ( called Perl 6 rules ; described in Apocalypse , Synopsis , and Exegesis 5 ) fearlessly redesign Perl 's regular expression language .

I 'm still a newcomer to the field , so please let me know if you think there are others who should be on this list .
Smoking lowers Parkinson 's disease risk - More evidence that smoking fights Parkinson - " A new study adds to the previously reported evidence that cigarette smoking protects against Parkinson 's disease .
Specifically , the new research shows a temporal relationship between smoking and reduced risk of Parkinson 's disease .
That is , the protective effect wanes after smokers quit . "
Impact of Smoking on Clinical and Angiographic Restenosis After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Â
This large study shows yet another benefit of smoking .
This time the benefit concerns restenosis , that is , the occlusion of coronary arteries .
Smokers have much better chances to survive , heal and do well .
Where is the press ?
Nowhere to be found , of course ; we are talking about a significant positive about tobacco and smoking , which affects the health of people , donÂt we ?
Well , come on !
We are also talking about responsible media , here people better increase their chances of death from cardiovascular disease then getting the idea that smoking may be good for them Â a totally unacceptable paradox .
The Oxford English Dictionary defines paradox in these terms : " A statement or tenet contrary to received opinion or belief as being discordant with what is held to be established truth , and hence absurd or fantastic " .
Since the benefits of smoking are too numerous and consistent to be attributable to error or random chance , it follows that the established truth asserting that smoking is the cause of ( almost ) all disease cannot be true Â a reality that dramatically clashes with the gigantic corruption of public health , its pharmaceutical and insurance mentors , institutions and media .
Therefore , it is constantly suppressed in the interest of public health , but not of the people .
Severe Gum Recession , Less Of A Risk For Smokers -
In the strange world that anti-tobacco has wrought , any research that deviates from the tobacco - is - the - root - of - all - evil template is noteworthy .
Here is a study that shows that smokers are actually at lower risk from gum disease .
In this page ( scroll down ) there is more scientific evidence from other sources about oral health and smoking .
Honest scientists have always known that smoking has some benefit .
From the apparent shielding effect against Parkinson's and Alzheimer 's diseases to the more intangible benefits associated with well - being and tranquility , smoking tobacco in many ways is definitely good for your health .
One of the " Health Warnings " on cigarette pack in Canada .
There is no solid proof for any of the diseases attributed to tobacco - just statistics and speculative associations , but the ministries of health continue to lie to the public , in a dazzling display of intellectual , professional , moral and political corruption .
Twin Study Supports Protective Effect of Smoking For Parkinson's Disease Â " Dr. Tanner 's group continued to see significant differences when dose was calculated until 10 years or 20 years prior to diagnosis .
They conclude that this finding refutes the suggestion that individuals who smoke more are less likely to have PD because those who develop symptoms quit smoking . "
" Â The inverse association of smoking dose and PD can be attributed to environmental , and not genetic , causes with near certainty , " the authors write . Â
Total silence from the antismoking mass media droids , of course , on this pivotal , long - range study that shows yet another benefit of smoking .
The reasons are obvious , and they need no further comments .
If the intention of " public health " is to inform the public about the consequences of smoking on health as it proclaims , why donÂt we see " warnings " such as : " Smoking Protects against ParkinsonÂs Disease , " or " Smoking protects against AlzheimerÂs Disease , " or " Smoking protects against Ulcerative Colitis " and so on , alongside with the other speculations on " tobacco - related " disease ?
Is nÂt the function of public health to tell the citizens about ALL the effects on health of a substance ?
Obviously not .
" Public health , " today , is nothing more than a deceiving propaganda machine paid by pharmaceutical and public money to promote frauds , fears , and puritanical rhetoric dressed up in white coats .
Does tobacco smoke prevent atopic disorders ?
A study of two generations of Swedish residents - " In a multivariate analysis , children of mothers who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day tended to have lower odds for suffering from allergic rhino - conjunctivitis , allergic asthma , atopic eczema and food allergy , compared to children of mothers who had never smoked ( ORs 0.6-0.7 ) .
Children of fathers who had smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day had a similar tendency ( ORs 0.7-0.9 ) . "
Kids of smokers have LOWER asthma !
You certainly wo n't see this one on the health news of BBC or ABC , as they are too busy trying to convince us that smokers " cause " asthma in their kids - and in the kids of others .
That , of course , is not true , as smoking does not " cause " asthma .
Shocker : ' Villain ' nicotine slays TB - " Nicotine might be a surprising alternative someday for treating stubborn forms of tuberculosis , a University of Central Florida researcher said Monday .
The compound stopped the growth of tuberculosis in laboratory tests , even when used in small quantities , said Saleh Naser , an associate professor of microbiology and molecular biology at UCF .
...
Most scientists agree that nicotine is the substance that causes people to become addicted to cigarettes and other tobacco products . "
" But no one is suggesting that people with TB take up the potentially deadly habit of smoking . "
Of course not .
It is much better to develop medication - resistant superbugs than to start smoking ... It should be said that the " most scientists " in question are paid off by the pharmaceutical industry for their research ; and that most of the aforementioned " scientists " promote the nicotine - based " cessation " products manufactured by their masters -- mysteriously without explaining why such an addictive substance becomes " un-addictive " when used to quit smoking !
Carbon Monoxide May Alleviate Heart Attacks
And Stroke - Carbon monoxide is a by - product of tobacco smoke .
A report indicates very low levels of carbon monoxide may help victims of heart attacks and strokes .
Carbon monoxide inhibits blood clotting , thereby dissolving harmful clots in the arteries .
The researchers focused on carbon monoxide 's close resemblance to nitric oxide which keeps blood vessels from dilating and prevents the buildup of white blood cells .
" Recently nitric oxide has been elevated from a common air pollutant . . . to an [ internal ] second messenger of utmost physiological importance .
Therefore , many of us may not be entirely surprised to learn that carbon monoxide can paradoxically rescue the lung from [ cardiovascular blockage ] injury . "
The pharmacological benefits of tobacco are nothing new .
Smoking Prevents Rare Skin Cancer -
A researcher at the National Cancer Institute is treading treacherous waters by suggesting that smoking may act as a preventative for developing a skin cancer that primarily afflicts elderly men in Mediterranean regions of Southern Italy , Greece and Israel .
Not that smoking should be recommended for that population , Dr. James Goedert is quick to assure his peers .
What is important is not that smoking tobacco may help to prevent a rare form of cancer but that there is an admission by a researcher at the National Cancer Institute that there are ANY benefits to smoking .
Smoking Reduces The Risk Of Breast Cancer - A new study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute ( May 20 , 1998 ) reports that carriers of a particular gene mutation ( which predisposes the carrier to breast cancer ) who smoked cigarettes for more than 4 pack years ( i.e. , number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years of smoking ) were found to have a statistically significant 54 percent decrease in breast cancer incidence when compared with carriers who never smoked .
One strength of the study is that the reduction in incidence exceeds the 50 percent threshold .
However , we think it important to point out that this was a small , case control study ( only 300 cases ) based on self - reported data .
Nitric oxide mediates a therapeutic effect of nicotine in ulcerative colitis - " CONCLUSIONS : Nicotine reduces circular muscle activity , predominantly through the release of nitric oxide - this appears to be ' up - regulated ' in active ulcerative colitis .
These findings may explain some of the therapeutic benefit from nicotine ( and smoking ) in ulcerative colitis and may account for the colonic motor dysfunction in active disease . "
Effects of Transdermal Nicotine on Cognitive Performance in Down's Syndrome - " We investigated the effect of nicotine - agonistic stimulation with 5 mg transdermal patches , compared with placebo , on cognitive performance in five adults with the disorder .
Improvements possibly related to attention and information processing were seen for Down 's syndrome patients compared with healthy controls .
Our preliminary findings are encouraging "
More benefits of nicotine .
Of course , it is politically incorrect to say that this is a benefit of smoking - only of the pharmaceutically - produced transdermal nicotine , the one that is terribly addictive if delivered through cigarettes , but not addictive at all , and even beneficial , when delivered through patches ....
Antismoking nonsense aside , nicotine gets into the body regardless of the means of delivery .
And more evidence about the benefis seems to emerge quite often , though the small size of this study cannot certainly be taken as conclusive .
Nicotine Benefits -
The benefits of nicotine -- and smoking -- are described in this bibliography .
This information is an example of what the anti-tobacco groups do not want publicized because it fails to support their agenda .
Some of the studies report benefits not just from nicotine , but from smoking itself .
But of course , according to the anti-smokers , all these scientists have been " paid by the tobacco industry " ... even though this is not true .
Sadly , personal slander and misinformation are the price a scientist has to pay for honest work on tobacco .
Parkinson 's Disease Is Associated With Non-smoking - Bibliography of references from studies associating Parkinson 's disease with non-smoking .
Certain benefits of smoking are well - documented , but the anti smoking groups , backed by several medical journals ( more interested in advertising revenue than in informing the population ) , are silent .
By the way , what about the cost of non-smokers to society due to their prevailing tencency to contract Parkinson 's disease ?
Alzheimer 's Disease Is Associated With Non-Smoking -
" A statistically significant inverse relation between smoking and Alzheimer 's disease was observed at all levels of analysis , with a trend towards decreasing risk with increasing consumption " .
R esearch indicating that nicotine holds potential for non-surgical heart by - pass procedures honored by the american college of cardiology - Dr. Christopher Heeschen of Stanford University was honored by the American College of Cardiology for his research on the effect of nicotine on angiogenesis ( new blood vessel growth ) .
His work took third place in the 2,000 entry Young Investigators Competition in the category of Physiology , Pharmacology and Pathology .
Dr. Heeschen presented compelling data from research done at Stanford revealing that the simple plant protein , nicotine , applied in small harmless doses , produced new blood vessel growth around blocked arteries to oxygen - starved tissue .
Smoking Your Way to Good Health -
The benefits of smoking tobacco have been common knowledge for centuries .
From sharpening mental acuity to maintaining optimal weight , the relatively small risks of smoking have always been outweighed by the substantial improvement to mental and physical health .
Hysterical attacks on tobacco notwithstanding , smokers always weigh the good against the bad and puff away or quit according to their personal preferences .
Now the same anti-tobacco enterprise that has spent billions demonizing the pleasure of smoking is providing additional reasons to smoke .
Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , Tourette 's Syndrome , even schizophrenia and cocaine addiction are disorders that are alleviated by tobacco .
Add in the still inconclusive indication that tobacco helps to prevent colon and prostate cancer and the endorsement for smoking tobacco by the medical establishment is good news for smokers and non-smokers alike .
Of course the revelation that tobacco is good for you is ruined by the pharmaceutical industry 's plan to substitute the natural and relatively inexpensive tobacco plant with their overpriced and ineffective nicotine substitutions .
Still , when all is said and done , the positive revelations regarding tobacco are very good reasons indeed to keep lighting those cigarettes .
Does maternal smoking hinder mother - child transmission of Helicobacter pylori infection ? -
" Evidence for early childhood as the critical period of Helicobacter pylori infection and for clustering of the infection within families suggests a major role of intrafamilial transmission .
In a previous study , we found a strong inverse relation between maternal smoking and H. pylori infection among preschool children , suggesting the possibility that mother - child transmission of the infection may be less efficient if the mother smokes .
To evaluate this hypothesis further , we carried out a subsequent population - based study in which H. pylori infection was measured by 13C - urea breath test in 947 preschool children and their mothers .
We obtained detailed information on potential risk factors for infection , including maternal smoking , by standardized questionnaires .
Overall , 9.8 % ( 93 of 947 ) of the children and 34.7 % ( 329 of 947 ) of the mothers were infected .
Prevalence of infection was much lower among children of uninfected mothers ( 1.9 % ) than among children of infected mothers ( 24.7 % ) .
There was a strong inverse relation of children 's infection with maternal smoking ( adjusted odds ratio = 0.24 ; 95 % confidence interval = 0.12-0.49 ) among children of infected mothers , but not among children of uninfected mothers .
These results support the hypothesis of a predominant role for mother - child transmission of H. pylori infection , which may be less efficient if the mother smokes . " .

Risk of papillary thyroid cancer in women in relation to smoking and alcohol consumption .
- " Both smoking and alcohol consumption may influence thyroid function , although the nature of these relations is not well understood .
We examined the influence of tobacco and alcohol use on risk of papillary thyroid cancer in a population - based case - control study .
Of 558 women with thyroid cancer diagnosed during 1988 - 1994 identified as eligible , 468 ( 83.9 % ) were interviewed ; this analysis was restricted to women with papillary histology ( N = 410 ) .
Controls ( N = 574 ) were identified by random digit dialing , with a response proportion of 73.6 % .
We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios ( OR ) and associated confidence intervals ( CI ) estimating the relative risk of papillary thyroid cancer associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption .
A history of ever having smoked more than 100 cigarettes was associated with a reduced risk of disease ( OR = 0.7 , 95 % CI = 0.5 - 0.9 ) .
This reduction in risk was most evident in current smokers ( OR = 0.5 , 95 % CI = 0.4-0.7 ) .
Women who reported that they had ever consumed 12 or more alcohol - containing drinks within a year were also at reduced risk ( OR 0.7 , 95 % CI = 0.5 - 1.0 ) .
Similar to the association noted with smoking , the reduction in risk was primarily present among current alcohol consumers .
The associations we observed , if not due to chance , may be related to actions of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption that reduce thyroid cell proliferation through effects on thyroid stimulating hormone , estrogen , or other mechanisms . "
Urinary Cotinine Concentration Confirms the Reduced Risk of Preeclampsia with Tobacco Exposure -
This study , though small , shows one of the benefits of smoking during pregnancy .
" These findings , obtained by using laboratory assay , confirm the reduced risk of developing preeclampsia with tobacco exposure .

Fact Sheet on Smoking and Alzheimer 's - From Forest UK .
Smokers have reduced risks of Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease - Of the 19 studies , 15 found a reduce risk in smokers , and none found an increased risk .
And smoking is clearly associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson 's disease , another disease in which nicotine receptors are reduced .
The fact that acute administration of nicotine improves attention and information processing in AD patients adds further plausibility to the hypothesis .
The Puzzling Association between Smoking and Hypertension during Pregnancy -
This large study has examined nearly 10,000 pregnant women .
Conclusion : " Smoking is associated with a reduced risk of hypertension during pregnancy .
The protective effect appears to continue even after cessation of smoking .
Further basic research on this issue is warranted .

Democrats wo n't commit to ending use of signing statements John Byrne
Published : Monday February 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Only McCain would stop practice of ' interpreting ' laws Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Barack Obama ( D - IL ) will not commit to ending President George W. Bush 's practice of signing statements -- a tactic whereby the president adds his interpretation to laws passed by Congress , possibly allowing his office to circumvent the law -- according to a little - noticed article Monday .
Sen. John McCain R - AZ ) , however , asserts he would .
Asked by a Washington Post reporter , he said he'd never consider it .
" Never , never , never , never , " McCain said .
" If I disagree with a law that passed , I 'll veto it . "
Signing statements are a long - time presidential practice , dating to the fifth US president , James Monroe .
No constitutional provision or federal law prohibits their usage .
They did n't become popular , however , until President Ronald Reagan -- before Reagan , just 75 such statements had been issued .
It was under President Bush that the practice soared .
He has challenged hundreds during his tenure .
RAW STORY 's Jennifer Van Bergen first revealed the extensive use of signing statements in 2005 .
The Boston Globe 's Charlie Savage received a Pulitzer prize for a piece detailing hundreds more .
Despite Democratic criticism of Bush 's use , neither Sens. Obama or Clinton will rule out using them .
" The problem with this administration is that it has attached signing statements to legislation in an effort to change the meaning of the legislation , to avoid enforcing certain provisions of the legislation that the President does not like , and to raise implausible or dubious constitutional objections to the legislation , " Obama told the Boston Globe in 2007 .
But , he noted : " No one doubts that it is appropriate to use signing statements to protect a president 's constitutional prerogatives . "
" I would only use signing statements in very rare instances to note and clarify confusing or contradictory provisions , including provisions that contradict the Constitution , " Clinton told the Globe .
" My approach would be to work with Congress to eliminate or correct unconstitutional provisions before legislation is sent to my desk . "
" What 's striking is that McCain appears perhaps even more radical than his Democratic rivals in adopting a seemingly ironclad refusal to issue signing statements , " the Post says .
" If he truly were to follow that approach , it would represent a sharp break in presidential practice , according to lawyers on both sides of the ideological divide . "
Ironically , a McCain amendment intended to prohibit the US from torturing detainees was itself the focus of a Bush signing statement .
McCain 's provision sought to prohibit " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody . "
Bush 's signing statement reserved the right of the president to ignore the law .
" The executive branch shall construe ... the Act , relating to detainees , in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power , " it said .
Poe on Programming
One of the strongest influences on my programming has always been an essay I read in my sophomore year of high school , around about the same time I began to feel the magic of programming .
Mr. Carino was a young man just out of college , a Slayer fan and ardent Twain admirer , and a man who would disappear mysteriously a year later .
That year , though , he gave the most electric class I 've ever taken , and one of the works we read in American Literature was Edgar Allan Poe 's The Philosophy of Composition .
Code As Poetry
In The Philosophy of Composition , Poe attempts to describe exactly how he composed The Raven , simply because he 's never seen such an attempt before .
While we might be wise to doubt his motives ( as did TS Eliot ) , it nevertheless may be interpreted to provide solid principles for the construction of a program .
Before we do so , I must first convince you that code should be read as poetry instead of prose .
Since this will always be a matter of opinion , and I know that many people will disagree , my argument will be short and simple .
When you read prose , you read it as if it is being narrated to you ; whether by a narrator , a character in the story , or many characters , the distinguishing characteristic of prose is its similarity to speech .
We find that it is allowed a much greater freedom of verbosity , so long as it accomplishes its goal of conveying a plot to its reader .
Poetry , on the other hand , is an abstract block of words in which every one must carry meaning if the poem is to be any good .
We value the poem for the beauty not only of the story or image given , but of the way in which it is constructed as well .
It tends to be much denser and more compact than prose .
When you read it , you must proceed carefully and consider the meaning of each word , and each group of words , and pay attention for double meanings and allusions if you are to grasp it fully .
To help us decide how we read code , let 's go to a particularly nice bit of it , and meditate on it for a moment .
Did you read it as if it were speech , or poetry ?
Did it have a narrative " flow " for you , or was it something of an abstract block of " words " ?
Of course , code is really neither prose nor poetry ; it is a distinct art form of which Poe could not have been aware .
I like to think that it may be read much more closely to poetry than to prose , and we will proceed from here as if this were true .
Unity of Impression
If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting , we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression - for , if two sittings be required , the affairs of the world interfere , and everything like totality is at once destroyed .
But since , ceteris paribus , no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may advance his design , it but remains to be seen whether there is , in extent , any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends it .
Here I say no , at once .
What we term a long poem is , in fact , merely a succession of brief ones - that is to say , of brief poetical effects .
It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites , by elevating the soul ; and all intense excitements are , through a psychal necessity , brief .
For this reason , at least , one - half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose - a succession of poetical excitements interspersed , inevitably , with corresponding depressions - the whole being deprived , through the extremeness of its length , of the vastly important artistic element , totality , or unity of effect .
In the first sentence of this paragraph , Poe provides an alternate metric to Yegge 's metric of " code size " - that of " unity of impression " .
Beautiful code is that which is not composed of " a succession of brief .. poetical effects " , but of just the poem .
It is code without filler , bureaucracy , or artifice , regardless of how long it is .
As a practical matter , not all programs may be written in this manner .
In an operating system kernel , a great deal of " corresponding depressions " â documentation , error handling , and interrupt handling â must be interspersed in between the " poetical effects " , making it " essentially prose " .
This does not change the fact that the Linux kernel or a BSD kernel is a thing of beauty , just as Paradise Lost is great despite " the extremeness of its length " .
Instead , it should give us motivation for our programs , to write them with as few depressions as possible so as not to drag down their unity of impression .
A great example of code as poetry is OpenBSD 's tail1 , which I referenced in a previous post .
After I sat down with it for an hour , it was extremely clear to me what it did .
In the beginning , it set out the patterns of code which would continue throughout , enabling me to quickly find my way to the part that mattered , despite my relative unfamiliarity with C .
It is a great strength of the Unix philosophy that each bit of code may be kept as brief , self - contained , unified , and therefore beautiful .
It is a pleasure to work with tools which have been pared down to their bare bits instead of expanded to encompass ever more functionality .
Design for a Purpose
My next thought concerned the choice of an impression , or effect , to be conveyed : and here I may as well observe that throughout the construction , I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally appreciable .
I should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted , and which , with the poetical , stands not in the slightest need of demonstration - the point , I mean , that Beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem .
If beauty is the sole province of poetry , I propose that data transformation is the sole province of the computer program .
( I am not the first to do , although I cannot recall where I read it first ) .
Therefore , when designing a program , we should at all times keep in mind the transformation which we wish to achieve , and discard all those parts which do not assist in that goal .
While this seems at first straightforward , it is important to consider that programs are designed for humans and by humans .
Unlike poetry , most code is not generated by its author for the appreciation of the masses .
Instead , it is designed to fulfill a purpose , specifically to achieve a certain data transformation .
Just as very few great poems were authored by multiple people , very few great programs have been authored by multiple people .
If we consider long programs to be composed of many poems separated by dull bits , their great parts are almost exclusively those parts over which their maintainers have slaved to bring to a state of terse beauty .
If you must have many people working on a program , it is of the utmost importance that they all know and share an understanding of what exactly it is that the program is intended to accomplish .
Without this deep shared knowledge of intent , the program will lack a single impression , or effect , to be conveyed , and likely fail to impress .
All The Rest
The length , the province , and the tone , being thus determined , I betook myself to ordinary induction
Once you have determined the length , purpose , and tone of your program , the rest is , as they say , trivial .
Poe dedicates the rest of his essay to applying the principles discussed in this essay , and showing how " The Raven " falls ever so simply out of them .
If you write a program while at all times keeping in mind its unity of purpose and the impression you intend to convey , perhaps you will find some beauty in it .
I hope that you will read the essay in its entirety ; I 'm sure that I have failed to do it justice here .
Although it is of questionable merit as a method of writing the next " The Raven " , perhaps it will help you think about how to write your next program .

Obama to start airing TV ads in Texas , Ohio

COLLEGE PARK , Md. â Democrat Barack Obama , riding a tide of momentum that Hillary Rodham Clinton needs to stem somewhere , somehow , announced today he is launching TV ads in Ohio and Texas , which hold crucial primaries in three weeks .
Having swept all five Democratic presidential contests over the weekend , Obama also was counting on wins in Tuesday 's primaries in Maryland , Virginia and the District of Columbia .
Barring a Clinton upset in one of those states , Obama could have a strong wind at his back heading into the March 4 Ohio and Texas primaries .
Clinton generally has done well in larger states , and she badly needs victories there .
But Obama will get the jump on TV ads in the two states .
He begins airing one on Tuesday that features him discussing the death of his mother at age 53 from cancer and the cost of health care .
The ad will air on English language broadcast stations in Texas , and plans are under way for Spanish - language ads .
Clinton 's aides have not said when and where she will advertise in the March 4 contests .
Texas organizer Garry Mauro said Clinton would campaign in all media markets there , though he would n't say if she would pay for advertising everywhere .
Obama , a first - term senator from Illinois , told 17,000 people at the University of Maryland that he is the candidate who can lead the country out of a long period of divisive and ineffective government .
It 's a theme he increasingly uses against Clinton , who was first lady for eight years .
Citing the Iraq war , global warming and economic worries , Obama said he decided to run for president soon after entering the Senate because " I was convinced that the size of these challenges had outstripped the capacity of a broken and divided politics to solve . "
" We need something new , " he said , dismissing Clinton 's suggestions that he is not tough enough to handle the White House 's rigors .
" I may be skinny , but I 'm tough , " he said , drawing loud cheers .
He recognized the university 's highly rated women 's basketball team , and said he regretted not bringing his sneakers to the Comcast Center arena .
" I still got game , " said Obama , 46 , who enjoys shooting baskets in his free time .
In recent days , he said Clinton finds it difficult to escape a divisive past because she became a polarizing figure during her husband 's presidency and her time in the Senate representing New York .
Obama seemed to be coasting into Tuesday 's three primaries as Clinton struggled .
She changed campaign managers one day after Obama won the Saturday contests in Louisiana , Nebraska , Washington state and the Virgin Islands .
He also won the Maine caucus Sunday .
An Associated Press - Ipsos poll released today found Obama with a narrow lead over John McCain in a potential presidential matchup , while Clinton was about even with the Republican front - runner .
It showed Obama leading Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination , 46 percent to 41 percent .
Giving Obama a lift in Virginia is Gov. Tim Kaine , who campaigned for him throughout the weekend .
Today , Obama told WRVA radio in Richmond that Kaine was " somebody who is on my short list to have a role in my administration . "
He did not specify what slot Kaine might fill .
Meanwhile today , Democratic activists speculated about whether former presidential contender John Edwards would endorse Clinton or Obama .
Clinton quietly visited Edwards last week .
Obama aides said the Illinois senator would meet with Edwards , but did not say when .
A person close to Edwards said those familiar with his thinking do not believe he wants a big role in a Democratic administration , such as vice president or attorney general .
Rather , this person said , Edwards is pressing Clinton and Obama on his main issue of fighting poverty .
â ââ
Associated Press writer Kelley Shannon in Austin , Texas , contributed to this report .
When I first read this report , I admit that I got angry .
Then I got smart .
Look carefully at the names named in this report .
Is n't it interesting that the WaPo reporters made sure to point out the Democrats in attendance when Congress was still operating under a Republican majority ?
Hmmm .... who do you suppose could have leaked this story to the press to perhaps deflect from their own negative stories ?
No matter how you slice it , there 's some serious ' splaining that needs to be done , but the lopsidedness of this article makes me more than a little leery of its accuracy .

After receiving threats of Physical Violence , Boulder City Council drops the impeachment issue .
Ryan Morgan , DailyCamera â
Boulder wo nât debate a measure calling for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Backers of the measure could nât muster support from five members of the Boulder City Council to draft an impeachment resolution , even though many members said they were sympathetic to its goals .
The council reached that decision late Tuesday night after hearing from dozens of activists who pleaded with them to draft such a resolution .
Two Boulder police officers were stationed in the room after elected officials received threatening e-mails from impeachment opponents , City Clerk Alisa Lewis said .
Deputy Mayor Crystal Gray said she received one e-mail that said the portrait of the City Council â would make a fine target for a firing squad . â
City Councilman Macon
Cowles last week told his colleagues that he âd ask for a vote on whether to move forward with an impeachment resolution , even though he opposed taking up the measure .
Impeachment supporters have been speaking at City Council meetings and handing out â Impeach â pins for the past several weeks .
Many of those who gathered Tuesday night wore large , white signs pinned to their shirts that were printed with â IMPEACH â in red letters .
Cowles said he âs sympathetic to activists â outrage about the administration âs actions .
But , he said , members of the City Council were elected to deal with local issues and matters on which they can actually have an impact .
â To me , this action , if we were to take it , would be purely symbolic , â Cowles said .
Three council members â Gray , Susan Osborne and Lisa Morzel â said they âd like to see an impeachment measure drafted and debated .
Morzel said she wants to be able to tell her grandchildren one day she fought what she called an unjust administration .
â I will have to answer to them one of these days when they ask me , what did I do ? â she said .
Boulder resident Ellen Stark said officials who opposed debating impeachment on the grounds that the city government does nât have any say in the matter miss the point .
â I do nât think it really is symbolic , because every voice that âs raised in the spirit of resistance really counts , â she said .
Stark said it âs especially important for cities to take up the issue since members of Congress wo nât .
Dozens of cities across the country have passed similar resolutions .
â What recourse do the people have but to turn to their local municipalities ? â she said .
Impeachment supporter Nancy Sullo said this year â the last of Bush âs administration â still is nât too late to hold impeachment hearings .
â Addressing the crimes of the president and vice president is necessary even at this late date to re-establish the rule of law in this country , â she said .
â It will send a message to current and future administrations that they are not above the law . â
Mayor Shaun McGrath said elected officials have to consider their â political capital â when weighing in on controversial foreign policy .
Boulder âs leaders have to work with members of Congress , for example , and they need to consider whether it makes sense to alienate other elected officials before proceeding , he said .
â It makes a difference when we do these things , because there are people who will be very strongly opposed to it who also get to vote on things like our appropriations , â he said .
If you âve ever browsed through Task Manager , you may have wondered why there are so many Service Host processes running .
You ca nât kill them , and you sure did nât start them .
So , what are they ?
The Service Host process serves as a shell for loading services from DLL files .
Services are organized into related groups and each group is run inside a different instance of the Service Host Process .
That way , a problem in one instance does nât affect other instances .
This process is a vital part of Windows that you cannot prevent from running .
This article is part of our ongoing series explaining various processes found in Task Manager , like dwm.exe , ctfmon.exe , mDNSResponder.exe , conhost.exe , rundll32.exe , Adobe_Updater.exe , and many others .
Do nât know what those services are ?
Better start reading !
So What Is the Service Host Process ?
Here âs the answer , according to Microsoft :
Svchost.exe is a generic host process name for services that run from dynamic - link libraries .
But that does nât really help us much .
Some time ago , Microsoft started changing much of the Windows functionality from relying on internal Windows services ( which ran from EXE files ) to using DLL files instead .
From a programming perspective , this makes code more reusable and arguably easier to keep up to date .
The problem is that you ca nât launch a DLL file directly from Windows the same way you can an executable file .
Instead , a shell that is loaded from a executable file is used to host these DLL services .
And so the Service Host process ( svchost.exe ) was born .
Why Are There So Many Service Host Processes Running ?
RELATED : What Is This Process and Why Is It Running on My PC ?
If you âve ever taken a look at the Services section in Control Panel , you âve probably noticed that Windows requires a lot of services .
If every single service ran under a one Service Host process , a failure in one service could potentially bring down all of Windows .
Instead , they are separated out .
Services are organized into logical groups that are all somewhat related , and then a single Service Host instance is created to host each group .
For example , one Service Host process runs the three services related to the firewall .
Another Service Host process might run all the services related to the user interface , and so on .
In the image below , for example , you can see that one Service Host process runs several related network services , while another runs services related to remote procedure calls .
Is There Anything For Me To Do With All This Information ?
RELATED : Should You Disable Windows Services to Speed Up Your PC ?
Honestly , not a lot .
In the days of Windows XP ( and previous versions ) , when PCs had much more limited resources and operating systems were nât quite as fine - tuned , stopping Windows from running unnecessary services was often recommended .
These days , we do nât recommend disabling services anymore .
Modern PCs tend to be loaded with memory and high - powered processors .
Add that to the fact that the way Windows services are handled in modern versions ( and what services run ) has been streamlined , and eliminating services you think you do nât need really does nât have much of an impact any more .
That said , if you notice that a particular instance of Service Host â or a related service â is causing trouble , like continual excessive CPU or RAM usage , you could check into the specific services that are involved .
That might at least give you an idea of where to start troubleshooting .
There are a few ways to go about seeing exactly what services are being hosted by a particular instance of Service Host .
You can check up on things within Task Manager or using a great third - party app named Process Explorer .
Check Related Services in Task Manager
If you âre using Windows 8 or 10 , processes are shown on the â Processes â tab of Task Manager by their full names .
If a process serves as a host for multiple services , you can see those services by simply expanding the process .
This makes it very easy to identify which services belong to each instance of the Service Host process .
You can right - click any individual service to stop the service , view it in the â Services â Control Panel app , or even search online for information about the service .
If you âre using Windows 7 , things are a bit different .
The Windows 7 Task Manager did not group processes the same way , nor did it show regular process names â it only showed all the instances of â svchost.exe â running .
You had to explore a bit to determine the services related to any particular instance of â svchost.exe . â
On the â Processes â tab of Task Manager in Windows 7 , right - click on a particular â svchost.exe â process , and then choose the â Go to Service â option .
This will flip you over to the â Services â tab , where the services running under that â svchost.exe â process are all selected .
You can then see the full name of each service in the â Description â column , so you can choose to disable the service if you do nât want it running or troubleshoot why it âs giving you problems .
Check Related Services Using Process Explorer
Microsoft also provides an excellent advanced tool for working with processes as part of its Sysinternals lineup .

This is a blog post I hoped I would never have to write .
As you probably know , in July of 2007 we had to block usage of Pandora outside the U.S. because of the lack of a viable license structure for internet radio streaming in other countries .
It was a terrible day .
We did however hold out some hope that a solution might exist for the UK , so we left it unblocked as we worked diligently with the rights organizations to negotiate an economically workable license fee .
After over a year of trying , this has proved impossible .
Both the PPL ( which represents the major record labels and some independent record labels ) and the MCPS / PRS Alliance ( which represents music publishers ) have demanded per track performance minima rates which are far too high to allow ad supported radio to operate and so , hugely disappointing and depressing to us as it is , we have to block the last territory outside of the US .
It continues to astound us that the industry is not working more constructively to support the growth of services that introduce listeners to new music , and that are totally supportive of paying fair royalties to the creators of music .
I do nât often say such things , but the course being charted by the labels and publishers and their representative organizations is nothing short of disastrous for artists whom they purport to represent â¦
The only consequence of failing to support companies like Pandora that are attempting to build a sustainable radio business for the future will be the continued explosion of piracy , the continued constriction of opportunities for working musicians , and a worsening drought of new music for fans .
As a former working musician myself , I find it very troubling .
We have been told to sign these totally unworkable license rates or switch off , non-negotiable â¦so that is what we are doing .
Streaming illegally is just not in our DNA , and we have to take the threats of legal action seriously .
We know what an epicenter of musical creativity and fan support the UK has always been , which makes the prospect of not being able to launch there and having to block our first listeners all the more upsetting for us .
If you would like to be kept abreast of the situation , please drop us your email so we can stay in touch â there âs a simple way to do that on the home webpage you âre now presented with if you try to access Pandora from the UK .
There may well come a day when we need to make a direct appeal for your support to move for governmental intervention as we have in the US .
In the meantime we have no choice but to turn off service to the UK .
Since we emailed UK listeners last week to inform them of this impending change , we have been inundated with public and industry support .
There have also been many questions â we âll be very proactive in responding to any comments / questions that pop up on the blog here .
There is a lot of confusion around this topic .
Pandora will stop streaming to the UK as of January 15th , 2008 .
Again , on behalf of myself and everyone at Pandora , to any resident of Wales , Ireland , England and Scotland that reads this post , I âm very , very sorry .

The government 's announcement today charging six defendants at GuantÃ¡namo Bay for crimes stemming from the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , are the Bush administration 's boldest attempt to prove it can bring justice to the detainees .
Yet the charges â 169 overt acts for " planning and execution " of the terrorist attacks â are unlikely to quell criticism anytime soon over the stalled pace of the judicial process for the detainees .
The military commission system has always been controversial , but these new cases are expected to reignite the long - simmering debate over the government 's interrogation techniques , hampering any quick resolution .
What 's more , the prosecutors ' stated desire to seek the death penalty , a punishment seen as a human rights violation in many Europeans nations , will no doubt renew criticism abroad about the special military system that was created to handle detainee cases .
Already , lawyers and human rights organizations have condemned the military 's choice .
" These cases are going to end up being a total public - relations disaster , " says David Glazier , a former Navy officer and now a professor at Loyola Law School .
Until now , the government has had little success bringing charges in the military commission .
Its first procedural system , which severely limited the detainees ' access to information , was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2006 .
Though Congress passed a law creating a new system later that year in the Military Commissions
Act , prosecutors have charged just a handful of men , only one of whom â the Australian former kangaroo skinner David Hicks â has pled guilty .
The new cases , the most detailed brought so far by the military commission , outline how these six individuals â including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed â allegedly directed the actions of the 19 men who killed nearly 3,000 individuals when they flew planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon .
The charging document , which lists the names of every individual killed in the 2001 attacks , includes allegations that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed conceived the attack , got approval and funding from Osama bin Laden , and oversaw the training of the hijackers .
It details allegations that Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin ' Attash administered a training camp where two of the hijackers went , as well as visited Malaysia to observe and test airport security .
It accuses Ramzi Binalshibh of helping hijackers get into flight school and sending them money in the United States .
And it charges Ali Abdul Aziz Ali , Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi , and Mohamed al Kahtani with helping finance the hijackers , among other allegations .
" If they have competent evidence to prove all this â and I assume they did â it's going to be a very , very extraordinary and educational piece , " says John Bickers , a law professor at Northern Kentucky University .
During a press briefing this morning , Thomas Hartmann , legal adviser for the Defense Office of Military Commission , said prosecutors hoped to make the trials as open as possible .
He noted that all men will receive appointed military lawyers and be allowed to obtain outside civilian counsel as well .
They will also have the right to remain silent without prejudice and to hear and cross -examine all evidence presented against them .
" There will be no secret trials , " Hartmann said .
But just how much evidence the government will be able to introduce remains in question .
Five of the six men were held in secret CIA - run prisons .
CIA Director Michael Hayden has publicly confirmed that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was subjected to water boarding , a technique that simulates drowning and is considered torture by many legal experts .
And al Kahtani's lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights say they have evidence he was subjected to torture by U.S. officials .
Defense lawyers have already criticized the system as rigged against the defendants and will continue to challenge the use of any evidence obtained by these and other so - called enhanced interrogation techniques in trial .
Says Vincent Warren , executive director of CCR , " No one will have faith in the results of these commissions because they are so tainted . "
The world âs most notorious jailed terrorist calmly stroked a foot - long gray beard as he sat comfortably in a military courtroom and peppered the Marine colonel who serves as his judge with questions .
What , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed demanded to know , were Col. Ralph H. Kohlmann âs religious affiliations ?
His views on torture ?
For a while Tuesday , Mohammed turned the tables on his captors and made the military judge justify his competency to preside over the trial of five accused Sept. 11 plotters .
Mohammed , the self - described mastermind of the suicide hijackings , spent more than an hour putting Kohlmann through his paces in the high - tech , high - security courtroom that the Pentagon built on the naval base here for the controversial war tribunals .

Glaring and poking an occasional finger in the air , Mohammed demanded that the judge explain his views on such hot - button issues as religion and torture .
He was frequently unsatisfied , and hit Kohlmann with a barrage of follow - up questions and sarcastic political commentary before the judge threatened to revoke Mohammed âs court authorization to act as his own lawyer in the case .
But before that , the former Al Qaeda operations chief , now paunchy , bespectacled and wearing flowing robes and a black turban , had the run of the courtroom .
He was conducting the voir dire process that is designed to allow the defense to examine a judge âs competence and impartiality .
Lawyers for the other defendants quizzed the judge too .
But even if they were to determine that the judge should be replaced , Kohlmann could overrule them .
In that event , the defendants could appeal to a higher military court .
Throughout Mohammed âs questioning , and during the rest of the day âs marathon legal proceedings , he sat behind the first of five massive tables , one for each of the accused men âs legal teams , his position befitting his status as the de facto courtroom leader and spokesman for the group .
At one point he demanded that the judge explain how he could ensure a fair trial , both as a Christian and a member of a U.S. military that has declared war on Al Qaeda .
â The government considers all of us fanatical extremists , â Mohammed said .
â How can you , as an officer of the U.S. Marine Corps , stand over me in judgment ? â

Mohammed , 43 , also asked Kohlmann whether he was part of an American â extremist sect â such as those led by Christian evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson .
And he wanted to know the details of Kohlmann âs Marine training and his knowledge of waterboarding and other coercive interrogation tactics that the CIA has admitted using on him after capturing Mohammed in Pakistan in 2003 .
At first , Kohlmann gamely answered the questions .
He said he is not particularly religious despite attending some Lutheran and Episcopal services in the past .
And he explained that the line between acceptable interrogation and torture is impossible to quantify without seeing the details .
Interspersed among Mohammed âs questions were increasingly rambling political statements about U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , the prejudice of Christians and Jews against Islam , and even the writings of Richard Nixon .
Some comments prompted a government censor to cut off his microphone , citing national security concerns .
The judge eventually lost patience .
â I will not allow you to act in a manner that is disrespectful to this court .
. . .
Do you understand me clearly ? â Kohlmann said .
Advertisement
Mohammed âs comments , combined with other courtroom developments Tuesday , suggested that the highly anticipated case will only get more contentious , complicated and drawn out now that pretrial motions are underway .
Kohlmann disclosed that he has submitted his retirement papers for next spring , prompting one defense lawyer , Maj .
Jon Jackson , to say that the judge will throw the trial into disarray by leaving before it starts .
Another defendant , Ramzi Binalshibh , appeared in court a day after refusing to do so .
He told Kohlmann that he wants to act as his own lawyer , like Mohammed and two other defendants , despite his lawyers â suggestions that he is mentally incompetent .
And a parade of defense lawyers and the defendants themselves told the judge about another long list of problems that they said will make it impossible to get a fair trial .
Advertisement
Lawyer - client conversations may not be confidential , they said , and the court translators are incompetent , a severe hindrance for defendants who do nât speak English .
Perhaps most dire , they told Kohlmann , were indications that the lawyers cannot talk to friends and family of the accused as part of their defense preparation without prosecutors finding out about it , which has scared off potential witnesses on their behalf .
â Today was more evidence of chaos , â said Jackson , a lawyer for Mohammed âs alleged moneyman , Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi .
â It shows that despite hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars , the system is not functioning . â

An Israeli air strike in Gaza killed three Palestinian civilians on Wednesday , including a 13 - year - old boy , according to witnesses and medics , in what a spokeswoman for the Israeli military acknowledged was an attack on the wrong car .
Palestinians inspect a car destroyed in an Israeli air strike on Wednesday in the Gaza Strip .
Witnesses said the victims , including a 13 - year - old boy , were all members of the same family .
( ( Abid Katib / Getty Images ) )
The boy 's father and uncle were also killed in the missile strike near Gaza City , according to witnesses .
The military spokeswoman said the vehicle was hit " in error " and an investigation has been launched into the incident .
Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported sources within the Israeli military saying the missile was intended to strike a car carrying militants who were targeting Israel with rockets .
Meanwhile Wednesday , Israeli forces shot dead a leader of the militant Islamic Jihad group in the West Bank .
The deaths came as Palestinians held a general strike in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to protest almost daily Israeli incursions and air strikes into Gaza .
Such Israeli operations are aimed at halting militant rocket attacks launched from the territory into southern Israel .
On Wednesday , at least 28 Qassam rockets were fired into southern Israel , Haaretz said , but no injuries were reported .
On Tuesday , at least 19 Palestinians , including three civilians , were killed in air strikes and gun battles between militants and Israeli troops , according to Palestinian medical officials , in some of the worst violence to hit the region since Hamas seized control of Gaza in June .
No truce or prisoner exchange : Hamas leader
The bloodshed has threatened to derail peace negotiations between Israeli officials and a Palestinian negotiating team comprised of Fatah members .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has condemned Tuesday 's violence as " a massacre . "
Hamas , which has been shunned by the international community since its victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections for its refusal to renounce attacks against Israel , has condemned Abbas for taking part in negotiations while the violence continues .
The militant movement took control of Gaza following intense fighting with forces loyal to Abbas 's Fatah faction , to which Abbas responded by dissolving the fractured Fatah - Hamas coalition government .
Speaking Wednesday from Damascus , Syria , exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal told reporters that Israel 's military operations in the coastal strip made Hamas less likely to negotiate any truce with the Jewish state or release Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier the group has held captive since 2006 .
" Palestinians ' blood wo n't save Israel 's leaders , but will drown them , " Mashaal said .
" What you are doing will deny you of any plan you could be betting on : No exchange for Gilad Shalit and no truce . "
GIVEN a mandate for price stability , as well as low unemployment , one would think that bubbly inflation statistics would make the Federal Reserve nervous .
For the most part , I 'm sure they have .
But Calculated Risk
suggests
In nominal terms , the [ Case - Shiller ] index is off 8.9 % over the last year , and 10.2 % from the peak .
However , in real terms , the index has declined 12.9 % during the last year , and is off 14.6 % from the peak .
Inflation is helping significantly in lowering real house prices .
If prices will eventually fall 30 % in nominal terms , then we are only about 1/3 of the way there .
But if the eventual decline is 30 % in real terms , then we are about half way there .
that Ben Bernanke might not be as upset by inflation as he normally would be .
You see , this downturn is housing led , and :
Seems like a painless route to price adjustment ( except for the lenders who 're being repaid in dollars worth much less than the ones they originally lent out ) .
Can market clearing really be as easy as all that ?
Perhaps not .
As Free Exchange noted yesterday , inflation is also having a rather nasty effect on real incomes , because nominal incomes are n't moving much while prices are increasing .
What 's more , while inflation may help upside - down homeowners get out from under their debt , the real value of their homes is still declining .
Money is only as good as the goods you can buy with it .
Say you bought a home for $ 1 million only to watch its value fall to $ 750,000 .
If inflation pushes the price of that home back up to $ 1 million , then that will get you ahead of any fixed interest rate debt you took on to buy the house .
If you sell your home for $ 1 million , however , the basket of goods you can buy with your million will be much smaller than the basket you could have purchased with the million from a few years back .
Inflation or no , the value of a home relative to other consumption goods is still falling .
And we should n't expect declining interest rates to help potential homebuyers all that much , either .
As Calculated Risk also reported , the spread between fixed mortgage rates and adjustable mortgage rates is increasing , suggesting that lenders are taking higher inflation expectations into account .
As such , borrowing at fixed rates is expensive now .
Borrowing at adjustable rates is cheap now , but it will become expensive later as the economy recovers and the Fed begins to attack inflation .
So yes , inflation can have some helpful side - effects for homeowners .
Given the extent to which rising prices are squeezing consumers and contributing to reduced spending , Ben Bernanke probably feels that , on balance , less inflation is better than more .
In what seems to be a sign of the United States â waning influence in the region , China , India and Myanmar âs Southeast Asian neighbors have brushed aside Washington âs calls for an economic embargo and the diplomatic isolation of the junta .
As the attention of the world shifts elsewhere , the generals have made it clear that they intend to follow their own course , as they have through a half - century of self - imposed isolation .
On Monday , they signaled their defiance by announcing that a constitutional drafting committee had begun its work and was not going to listen to outside voices .
The constitution is one step on what the junta calls a â road map to democracy . â
Many analysts call it a dodge to evade genuine reform .
â The road map will , of course , lead to a military - dominated , civilianized government , which will perpetuate themselves in power , â said David I. Steinberg , a leading expert on Myanmar at Georgetown University in Washington .
As it has in the past when it faced international pressure , the junta has offered small gestures of compliance .
But analysts say that whatever happens , the generals are not about to give real ground to the demands of the United Nations .
In one of these concessions , a United Nations envoy , Ibrahim Gambari , is scheduled to visit Myanmar this month for the third time in an attempt to nudge the government toward a dialogue with its opposition .
He follows a half - dozen other United Nations envoys over the past 17 years who have failed to moderate the behavior of the junta .
In another concession , a government official has held three meetings with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , the pro-democracy leader who has spent 12 of the last 18 years under house arrest .
The official , Minister of Labor Aung Kyi , said Monday that more meetings were planned , though he was vague about the time frame .
â We need to consider what to discuss and why , â he said .
â We are choosing what and why .
So we will take where , how and when into consideration in the future . â

Ayaan Hirsi Ali , the Somali - born Dutch activist facing death threats for her outspoken criticism of Islam , is to come under national police protection anywhere in the European Union , the top justice official in Brussels said tonight .
Franco Frattini , the European commissioner for justice and home affairs , told the Guardian that Hirsi Ali and any other persons facing threats to their lives because of their opinions or writings , would be guaranteed protection wherever they went in Europe and that the host country would bear the expense .
The issue was discussed at a lunch of all 27 interior ministers of the EU in Brussels today after being raised by the Dutch .
Frattini said the ministers agreed and that the pact would be effective immediately based on " unanimous consensus " .
Other European sources doubted whether such an agreement could be implemented so promptly .
British sources said a pan-European deal could not be " that simple " since there were cost and legal implications to authorising such special police measures .
" There can't possibly be political agreement on it , " said an official .
Hirsi Ali went to the European Parliament two weeks ago to demand that the EU pay for her protection when living in the US .
Her colleague , Theo Van Gogh , was murdered on an Amsterdam street in 2004 after he and Hirsi Ali made a film , Submission , attacking Islamic treatment of women .
From then until last autumn , at a cost of around two million euros a year , she enjoyed special 24 - hour Dutch police protection , even after she went to live in the US .
Last autumn the Dutch government withdrew the funding for the US operation and she returned to Europe .
Dozens of MEPs have signed a document of support calling on Brussels for pay for her protection round - the - clock wherever she may be .
" This is a new decision , " Frattini said , declaring that no new laws were necessary to try to guarantee the safety of Hirsi Ali and others in similar situations .
" If we need a law to guarantee the right to life , we 're in a difficult position .
We have the decision based on mutual trust . "
Committee delays consideration of telecom immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday November 8 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Senate Judiciary Committee is delaying consideration of a controversial proposal to grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated a warrantless wiretapping program .
A committee aide tells RAW STORY it is " likely " the panel will produce legislation that differs from an Intelligence Committee bill .
The Intel bill includes telecom immunity , but it remains unclear whether immunity will be struck by the Judiciary committee .
The delay comes as civil liberties groups and grassroots activists have urged the Democratic Congress not to cede to President Bush 's demands that the well - connected industry be spared from lawsuits alleging the illegally violated customers privacy rights .
The Judiciary Committee is meeting Thursday to consider an update to a foreign intelligence law that President Bush has said needs to include a retroactive grant of immunity from ongoing civil lawsuits brought by customers who say they were illegally spied on .
Senators on the panel will only consider one - third of the bill today , delaying consideration of the retroactive immunity provision for at least a week , a Judiciary Committee spokeswoman said .
" To make the legislation easier to manage , the Chairman has decided the Committee today will mark up ONLY Title I , " the spokeswoman told RAW STORY via e-mail .
" They will turn to Title II and Title III next week .
Immunity is in Title II . "
Several senators -- including most of the committee 's Democrats and its ranking Republican -- have expressed reservations about the proposal to invalidate the court cases , which privacy advocates say are the only way to determine the Constitutionality of Bush 's warrantless surveillance of Americans .
National Journal 's CongressDaily , a subscription - only newsletter , reports that a key Democrat on the committee may now be wavering in her support for immunity .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees , said she is re-evaluating her support for retroactive legal immunity .
She voted to approve it as part of the Intelligence Committee bill .
" I did support [ immunity ] in the intel bill and I 'm giving it further thought , " she said .
( Republican Sen. Arlen ) Specter said he does not know if there will be enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to strip the immunity provision .
Specter also has raised concerns about granting immunity to the telephone and internet companies that are alleged to have let the government tap into their networks .
On Wednesday , he proposed a compromise in which the government would become the defendant in lawsuits aimed at the telecoms .
Â I think itÂs very important that the courthouse not be closed so there can be a judicial determination to see if there have been any violations of privacy rights , Â Specter told The Hill .
Â I think the telephone companies were good citizens , and should not suffer from what they did .
And my idea is to have the government substituted as the party .Â
The committee will resume marking - up the FISA update Nov. 15 , but once it does the bill could have several paths to the Senate floor .
" If the Senate Judiciary Committee passes out a bill that is different from the Intel bill ( which , of course , is likely ) , there would be a ... ' intra -Senate ' conference ... between the Intel and Judiciary Committees " an aide says via e-mail .
The committees -- or the top Democrat and Republican on each panel -- would reconcile the differences between their bills and send a single compromise to the full Senate .
Alternately , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could invoke Senate rules that would allow him to pull the Judiciary bill straight to the floor .
The Intelligence Committee bill faces substantial roadblocks because of its immunity provision .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) has placed a customary " hold " on the bill , and he says he would filibuster if a bill that grants immunity comes up for a vote .
Dodd , a dark - horse presidential candidates , has been joined by the Senate 's more prominent White House contenders like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
Activists credit pressure aimed a lawmakers from whistleblowers and others alleging abuse from telecom companies .
" That makes me feel like maybe we 've had a teeny bit of impact , " said Mark Klein , a former AT&T employee who has alleged the company has allowed the National Security Agency to monitor all Web traffic on the company 's network .
Klein 's allegations and internal documents he obtained form the basis of a key lawsuit against AT&T brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation on behalf of AT&T customers .
Klein is in Washington this week lobbying Senators to block telecom immunity .
He took questions from viewer 's of C - SPAN 's Washington Journal Thursday .
" Since we got here , now I hear they 're postponing it to next week , " he said .
" So maybe the media coverage has spurred them to at least look a little closer and move more slowly . "
The following video is from C - SPAN 's Washington Journal , broadcast on November 8 , 2007 .

The latest version of Apple 's QuickTime media player has video production people venting their spleens after discovering that new digital rights management features have crippled the use editing software from Adobe .
Shortly after updating to QuickTime 7.4 , legions of people charged chat groups to report they were unable to access files created with Premier and After Effects , two pricey Adobe programs used for editing video .
A product manager for After Effects is suggesting users hold off installing the QuickTime update until Adobe and Apple get things straightened out .
Those After Effects users unfortunate enough to have installed the update get a DRM - related error when trying to access their video files .
It reads : " After Effects error : opening movie - you do not have permission to open this file ( - 54 ) . "
The error is the result of periodic checks QuickTime carries out on video files for piracy violations .
Videos created using Adobe products do n't supply the needed headers until the movies are rendered , prompting the overly protective QuickTime to conclude they are contraband that should be barred .
Apple does n't make it easy for users to revert back to an earlier version of QuickTime , so the update has plagued many video production users on tight deadlines .
Work - arounds include rolling back the entire system using Time Machine , if you 've got it , or turning to a special - purpose program like Pacifist to roll back QuickTime to an earlier version . Â®
Anybody can become angry â that is easy , but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose , and in the right way â that is not within everybody âs power and is not easy .
â Aristotle
Let âs get one thing very straight :
The vast majority of people you meet at work are nice , caring and considerate .
They go out of their way to be polite , they help if they can and they truly care about the well - being of people around them .
Yes , there are inconsiderate , annoying jerks out there sure , but they are a minority .
They may seem like they âre everywhere ( just read Bob Sutton âs excellent book The No Asshole Rule for some great examples ) , but that âs only because we tend to let annoying people take up more mindspace , making them more visible than their numbers warrant .
So how do you deal with annoying people at work ?
Outside of work , you can walk away .
If your cab driver is a jerk , you can get off and take another cab â odds are you âll never see him again .
If the person sitting next to you in a bar is annoying , you can get up and leave .
At work though , you âre not free to leave that easily .
In most cases you âre more likely to want to stay and resolve the issue .
The very best strategy is to become less angry .
If you can fix it so that it takes more to trigger your anger reflex , you will enjoy greater peace of mind and be more free to act decisively and constructively when you are treated badly at work .
You will also be less affected by any petty annoyances .
With that in mind , here are some strategies that can help you become less annoyed on the job .
Try some of these thoughts , the next time someone or something really gets your goat at work .
1 : Staying calm means you do nât do something you regret later
Sometimes when you get really mad , you may end up doing something rash .
If you can stay calm , you âre more likely to choose constructive actions .
2 : Getting mad often means staying mad
If you get annoyed here and now , that bad mood may last for a long time .
3 : When you stay calm , you really annoy those who want to annoy others
If that person is truly out to annoy you , the very best way to annoy them back is to stay cool .
Deny them the satisfaction of getting you riled .
They hate that .
4 : You only harm yourself
Getting annoyed really harms no one but you .
5 : Getting annoyed makes it easier to get mad the next time
You start a cycle of anger â which means it takes less and less to set you off .
6 : Dreaming of revenge is bad for you
This is certain , that a man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green , which otherwise would heal and do well .
â Francis Bacon
7 : Getting annoyed makes the memory stronger
Anything you experience while having a strong emotion , will be etched permanently in your mind .
This is why some people can remember every little detail of that incident 8 years ago where some jerk cut them off on the highway .
The problem is that the memory becomes so strong that it keeps coming back to you and keeps annoying you for years .
8 : Instead of getting mad at annoying people â feel sorry for them
Jerks are very often jerks because they feel bad themselves .
Hating them is really a waste of time â feel sorry for them instead .
9 : Sometimes you âre at fault and blowing up just makes it worse
Sometimes it turns out , that the whole thing is actually your own fault .
If you previously blew up at someone , then you look really silly â¦
10 : It âs not about you
Most jerks you will meet are not really out to get you , personally â this is how they treat everyone .
11 : It may not be intentional at all
Maybe they have absolutely no idea that they âre annoying you .
12 : Losing your temper makes you look bad
Even if you âre in the right in the situation , if you lose your temper you can end up looking silly , petty or unreasonable .
13 : Laugh about it
Most workplace jerk behavior is annoying sure , but when you really look at it , it âs mostly pathetic and ridiculous .
Laugh at it , rather than get annoyed .
14 : Is it a case of projection ?
Few things annoy us more than other people displaying the same weaknesses and faults as we fear we have ourselves .
If a person really , really ticks you off , maybe that person is just making you think about some weak sides you âd rather not admit you have .
15 : Maybe it âs an honest mistake
And most of all : People make mistakes .
Do nât read too much into it when people do inconsiderate things .
It may simply be an honest mistake .
The upshot
I want to make one thing very clear : I âm not saying that you should put up with behavior that annoys you .
This is not about being meek and humble and never complaining about the mistakes that others make .
This is about not getting angry over annoying people , because getting angry is rarely good for you .
Once in a while , getting angry may be just the ticket .
It can be exactly what âs needed to unlock a tight situation .
I wrote about one such case here â the time I learned to say â no ! â at work .
But as Aristotle said â it âs not about getting angry , it âs about getting angry in the right way .
And in most situations , keeping your cool is better for you , and produces better results .

CLG Founder and Chair is Michael Rectenwald , Ph.D.UPDATE : My video on this matter :
The Belgravia Dispatch this morning highlighted this FT piece :
President George W. Bush âs campaign to stay the course in Iraq is taking a new and constitutionally dangerous turn .
When Senator John Warner recently called for a troop withdrawal by Christmas , the White House did not mount its usual counterattack .
It allowed a surprising champion to take its place .
Major General Rick Lynch , a field commander in Iraq , summoned reporters to condemn Mr Warner âs proposal as â a giant step backwards â .
It was Maj Gen Lynch who was making the giant step into forbidden territory .
He had no business engaging in a public debate with a US senator .
His remarks represent an assault on the principle of civilian control â the most blatant so far during the Iraq war .
Nobody remarked on the breach .
But this only makes it more troubling and should serve as prologue for the next large event in civilian - military relations : the president âs effort to manipulate General David Petraeus âs report to Congress .
Mr Bush has pushed Gen Petraeus into the foreground to shore up his badly damaged credibility .
But in doing so , he has made himself a hostage .
He needs the general more than the general needs him .
Despite the president âs grandiose pretensions as commander - in - chief , the future of the Iraq war is up to Gen Petraeus .
The general âs impact on Congress will be equally profound .
If he brings in a negative report , Republicans will abandon the sinking ship in droves ; if he accentuates the positive , it is the Democrats who will be spinning .
In fact , if not in name , it will be an army general who is calling the shots â not the duly elected representatives of the American people .
And according to the NY Times , at least we do nât have to wait until the 11th :
Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top American commander in Iraq , has told President Bush that he wants to maintain heightened troop levels in Iraq well into next year to reduce the risk of military setbacks , but could accept the pullback of roughly 4,000 troops beginning in January , in part to assuage critics in Congress , according to senior administration and military officials .
General Petraeus âs view is considered overly cautious by some other senior military officials and some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , officials said .
But they said it reflected his concern that the security gains made so far in Baghdad , Anbar Province and other areas were fragile and easily reversed .
Notice the language - â Could accept . â
It is a good thing we have Generals out there to set our policies .
Civilian control of the military would suck .
If there is anyone out there who honestly thought Petraeus would come to Congress on the 11th and tell us it was time for a substantial drawdown or anything other than that â the surge is working , â please surrender your car keys to someone sane .
I do nât want you on the road .
Bush made it clear in his interview with Draper that we are here for the long haul , and that is what is going to happen .
We are going to be there , in large numbers , until the military breaks .
Or longer .
Just get used to it .
There is nothing you can do , because the Decider has decided .
The dog and pony show that comes next week is just to make things easier politically for continuing the course of action that has been chosen - the reports we may withdraw some troops were just something thrown out there to mollify the opposition before getting back to Operation â DO WHATEVER THE FUCK WE WANT . â
All of the reports of problems by independent and respected group and backed up by hard data do nât matter .
Their recommendations do nât matter .
All the administration needs to do is count on the Weekly Standard and Michael OâHanlon and the rest of the crowd to go out and do what they have been doing for years , and this administration has the cover they need .
And if you argue otherwise , Bush and his supporters will claim you are nât giving our troops what they need to win .
Or that it is just the liberal media reporting only bad news .
Or that the Democrats want to screw the country again , just like they did in Vietnam .
The fact that the GAO is now caught in the crossfire and they can smear it is just an extra bonus - they do nât like accountability in ANY form .
If the GAO is collateral damage , that is just a lucky break - those guys have been a pain in the ass for Republicans the last six years .
And if you honestly thought anything different would happen , you are a complete and total idiot and have not paid one bit of attention the last few years .
Welcome to permanent war , bitches .

It âs incredible but true : 90 percent of the population missed out on the income gains during that long period .

Mr. Johnston does not mince words : â The pattern here is clear .
The rich are getting fabulously richer , the vast majority are somewhat worse off , and the bottom half Â for all practical purposes , the poor Â are being savaged by our current economic policies . â
His words are echoed in a proposed stimulus plan currently offered by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
( The plan is available on its Web site , epi.org . )
Stressing that any stimulus package should be â fair , â the authors of the institute âs proposal wrote :
â The distribution of wages , income and wealth in the United States has become vastly more unequal over the last 30 years .
In fact , this country has a more unequal distribution of income than any other advanced country . â
Economic alarm bells have been ringing in the U.S. for some time .
There was no sense of urgency as long as those in the lower ranks were sinking in the mortgage muck and the middle class was raiding the piggy bank otherwise known as home equity .
But now that the privileged few are threatened ( Merrill Lynch took a $ 9.8 billion fourth - quarter hit , and the stock market has spent the first part of the year behaving like an Olympic diving champion ) , it âs suddenly time to take action .
There is no question that some kind of stimulus package geared to the needs of ordinary Americans is in order .
But that wo nât begin to solve the fundamental problem .
Good jobs at good wages Â lots of them , growing like spring flowers in an endlessly fertile field Â is the absolutely essential basis for a thriving American economy and a broad - based rise in standards of living .

Images that appeared on the Internet in early 2005 were photographs of a 10 - month - old Egyptian girl named Manar Maged who was born with craniopagus parasiticus , a very rare birth defect that develops when an embryo starts to split into identical twins but does not complete the process .
Often the second , undeveloped twin forms as an extra limb or trunk , but in Magar âs extremely unusual case it formed as a second head attached to her skull .
The twin could blink and smile but was not capable of independent life :
On 19 February 2005 , Manar underwent a 13 - hour operation performed by a 13 - member surgical team to remove her conjoined twin .
As of mid-April 2005 , Reuters reported that Manar had been transferred out of intensive care and was eating normally :
â She has been transferred to ordinary care two weeks ago and she is showing good signs of improvement as she can eat normally without the aid of a tube , â said Abla el - Alfy , a consultant in the paediatric intensive care at Benha Children âs Hospital , north of Cairo .
She said Manar âs mother was allowed to have direct contact with her baby after being separated for almost two months after the operation on Feb. 19 .
â Manar is bonding well with her mother , â Alfy said .
Doctors have said Manar âs case was extremely rare and just surviving the operation was a big achievement .
â I think she will be able to leave hospital as soon as we feel that her mother is capable of taking care of her , â said Alfy , adding that Maged âs medication was being reduced .
Manar had five subsequent surgeries to insert valves to drain excess fluid from her brain .
Unfortunately , on 25 March 2006 , a little over a year after her original surgery , and just days shy of what would have been her 2nd birthday , Manar Maged died .
During the few hours she was in the hospital prior to her death , she was found to be suffering from a brain infection , pneumonia , and heart trouble .
Her condition deteriorated rapidly after she failed to respond to medication .

The Scientologists are an enterprising bunch , are nât they ?
The latest :
The state of Utah is paying $ 50,000 to the Bio Cleansing Centers of America to treat eight current and retired police officers allegedly sickened from busting up meth labs .
The center âs detoxification treatment , which seems to consist mostly of sending the overweight cops to the sauna for hours on end , is based on the teachings of Scientology .
It âs similar to a controversial clinic in New York , set up with a huge donation from the nation âs most famous Scientologist Tom Cruise , to treat 9/11 rescue workers .
Scientology âs late founder L. Ron Hubbard claimed that toxins could be flushed from the body through sweating and taking megadoses of vitamins , among other things , hence the sauna treatments .
Normally state attorneys general get called in to scrutinize such programs for peddling unproven therapies to gullible customers , but in Utah , it âs actually the state AG who got the whole thing going .
Not only that , but Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff wants the state to throw another $ 140,000 at the program to expand the treatment to more officers , despite a dearth of evidence showing that it actually works .
Utah residents seem to have an affinity for dubious health care practitioners .
The state is home to â celluloid valley , â the dietary supplement industry , which has made billions selling bogus natural therapies to unsuspecting consumers .
The Scientologists and their sauna should feel right at home there .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has now cut the gap with Hillary Clinton to 6 percentage points among Democrats nationally in the Gallup Poll Daily tracking three - day average , and interviewing conducted Tuesday night shows the gap between the two candidates is within a few points .
Obama 's position has been strengthening on a day - by - day basis .
As recently as Jan. 18 - 20 , Clinton led Obama by 20 points .
Today 's Gallup Poll Daily tracking is based on interviews conducted Jan. 27 - 29 , all after Obama 's overwhelming victory in South Carolina on Saturday .
Two out of the three nights interviewing were conducted after the high - visibility endorsement of Obama by Sen.
Edward Kennedy and his niece Caroline Kennedy .
Clinton 's lead in the three - day average is now 42 % to Obama 's 36 % .
John Edwards , who dropped out of the race Wednesday after Gallup conducted these interviews , ended his quest for the presidency with 12 % support .
Wednesday night 's interviewing will reflect the distribution of the vote choice of former Edwards ' supporters as well as the impact , if any , of Hillary Clinton 's popular vote win in Florida on Tuesday .
These national numbers are a critically important indicator of the political environment when voters in more than 20 states go to the polls next Tuesday .
At the moment , Obama has the momentum among Democrats nationally .
On the Republican side , the three - day average shows McCain with an 11 - point lead over Mitt Romney , 32 % to 21 % .
Rudy Giuliani , who will be dropping out of the race and possibly endorsing McCain , received 11 % , well behind the third place Mike Huckabee .
These GOP figures do not reflect the impact of McCain 's victory in Florida on Tuesday night , and that , coupled with the departure of Giuliani , will have the potential to change the dynamics of the national pattern of Republican support significantly in interviewing Wednesday night .

Methodology : Gallup is interviewing 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The results reported here are based on combined data from Jan. 27 - 29 , 2008 , including interviews with 1,017 Republican and Republican - leaning voters and 1,271 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
For results based on these samples , the maximum margin of sampling error is Â±3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
A civil liberties group is opposed to the use of high - pitched devices to deter youths from loitering at Ceduna in South Australia 's far west .
The device , known as ' mosquito ' , emits an irritating high - pitched sound that is said to be only audible to young people .
The local council wants to use the devices at night as part of a wider strategy to stop teenagers loitering .
But chief executive of Civil Liberties Australia , Bill Rowlings , says it a disturbing ' big brother ' idea .
" We 're concerned that it 's taking technology and turning the children into guinea pigs , " he said .
" People say that no - one 's ears can be hurt by this , but surely children 's ears can be hurt if it 's offensive to them and we do n't know what damage it 's doing to the children .
" Most times if children are loitering there are other measures that councils could and perhaps should try to take . "

Testing begins :
Feds start air quality tests FEMA flunks :
Tests find high levels of formaldehyde fumes Idle trailers : Tornado victims may get extras Opinion : Toxic trailers for hurricane victims ?
Heckuva job , FEMA Blog : Democrats claim FEMA downplayed formaldehyde risks in Katrina trailers NEW ORLEANS Â Paul Stewart knew as soon as he moved into his government - issued trailer in December 2005 that something was wrong .
He said it was n't long before he started waking up with a scratchy throat .
His wife , Melody , woke up with bloody noses .
The couple , who had lost their home in Bay St. Louis , Miss. , during the Gulf Coast hurricanes , said they asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) for a new trailer .
But they were refused .
On Thursday , FEMA admitted what the Stewarts and thousands of other displaced Gulf Coast residents have feared all along : their government - issued trailers were toxic .
The revelation came after months of congressional hearings and allegations by whistle - blowers that FEMA suppressed evidence of formaldehyde fumes .
David Paulison , FEMA 's director , said the agency will act immediately to move out more than 38,000 families still living in trailers because of Gulf Coast hurricanes .
Tests show dangerous levels of formaldehyde in hundreds of the trailers , according to FEMA .
At a New Orleans news conference , Paulison said officials were " moving as fast as we can " to move the most vulnerable trailer residents to alternative housing , including hotels and motels .
Tests of 519 trailer and mobile homes in Louisiana and Mississippi revealed that a third had unacceptably high levels of formaldehyde for children , the elderly and people with respiratory problems , said Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
She said 5 % of trailers registered fumes so toxic that even healthy adults would suffer respiratory symptoms if exposed for long periods of time .
The revelations come nearly two years after early tests showed high levels of the toxic gas in trailers and a month after a congressional committee accused FEMA of pressuring the CDC to downplay health risks attached to the trailers due to liability concerns .
FEMA and CDC officials have denied the allegations .
" FEMA has acted throughout this not out of concern for the health of the people who lived in the trailers but out of concern for public embarrassment and legal liability , " said Rep. Brad Miller , D - N.C. , of the House Committee on Science and Technology , which launched an investigation .
Gerberding said it was CDC 's recommendation that " all be relocated as quickly as possible and certainly before the warm summer months arrive . "
Paulison said a joint federal - state task force has been formed to handle the relocations .
Residents have complained of respiratory and sinus problems from their FEMA trailers almost immediately after the agency began distributing them in late 2005 .
FEMA provided about 120,000 travel trailers to Gulf Coast victims of the hurricanes .
Stewart , the Bay St. Louis native who lost his house , said he got rid of his FEMA - issued trailer just three months after acquiring it in December 2005 .
" It 's like you always have a cold , " he said .
" You have a scratchy throat , your eyes are always burning , your nose is always running .
You just do n't feel good . "
Two months after moving into the trailer , the Stewarts pet cockatiel CiCi got sick and later died .
" When your bird starts to get sick , then you know you have a problem , " said Stewart .
Paulison on Thursday rejected allegations that FEMA was slow to react to the unsafe trailers .
He said FEMA had " been very aggressively moving people out of travel trailers " and noted that 15,000 families had been moved since November and that 800 to 1,000 are moved out each week .
" We do care about the people .
We are moving as fast as we can , " he said .
He said FEMA would never again use trailers to house hurricane and other disaster victims .
Mobile homes , which are designed for long - term use , would be used instead , he said .
Andrea Stone reported from McLean , Va. Enlarge By Alex Brandon , AP Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Paulison and CDC Director Julie Gerberding discuss the trailers issued to hurricane victims .

Dolly Parton will kick off the European leg of her tour in June
The tour , set up to promote her Backwoods Barbie album , was due to start in Minneapolis later this month .
" You try wagging these puppies around a while and see if you do n't have back problems , " the famously buxom performer said in a statement .
Dates will be rescheduled .
She has been advised to take eight weeks off work .
" I know I have been breaking my neck and bending over backwards trying to get my new Backwoods Barbie CD and world tour together , but I did n't mean to hurt myself doing it , " she said .
" Seriously though , the doctors said I will be good as new in a few weeks , and I can't wait to get back out there , " she added .
She will take to the stage in Sweden in June , where she will perform four more dates before taking her tour to the UK .
Throughout the world , teachers , sociologists , policymakers and parents are discovering that empathy may be the single most important quality that must be nurtured to give peace a fighting chance .
â Arundhati Ray
The official directives need nât be explicit to be well understood :
Do not let too much empathy move in unauthorized directions .
â Norman Solomon
The nonprofit Edge Foundation recently asked some of the world âs most eminent scientists , â What are you optimistic about ?
Why ? â
In response , the prominent neuroscientist Marco Iacoboni cites the proliferating experimental work into the neural mechanisms that reveal how humans are â wired for empathy . â
Iacoboni âs optimism is grounded in his belief that , with the popularization of scientific insights , these recent findings in neuroscience will seep into public awareness and â . . . this explicit level of understanding our empathic nature will at some point dissolve the massive belief systems that dominate our societies and that threaten to destroy us . â
( Iacoboni , 2007 , p. 14 )
While there are reasons to remain skeptical ( see below ) about the progressive political implications flowing from this work , a body of impressive empirical evidence reveals that the roots of prosocial behavior , including moral sentiments such as empathy , precede the evolution of culture .
This work sustains Noam Chomsky âs visionary writing about a human moral instinct , and his assertion that , while the principles of our moral nature have been poorly understood , â we can hardly doubt their existence or their central role in our intellectual and moral lives . â
( Chomsky , 1971 , n.p. , 1988 ; 2005 , p. 263 )
In his influential book Mutual Aid ( 1972 , p. 57 ; 1902 ) , the Russian revolutionary anarchist , geographer , and naturalist Petr Kropotkin , maintained that â . . . under any circumstances sociability is the greatest advantage in the struggle for life .
Those species which willingly abandon it are doomed to decay . â
Species cooperation provided an evolutionary advantage , a â natural â strategy for survival .
While Kropotkin readily acknowledged the role of competition , he asserted that mutual aid was a â moral instinct â and â natural law . â
Based on his extensive studies of the animal world , he believed that this predisposition toward helping one another â human sociality â was of â prehuman origin . â
Killen and Cords , in a fittingly titled piece â Prince Kropotkin âs Ghost , â suggest that recent research in developmental psychology and primatology seems to vindicate Kropotkin âs century - old assertions ( 2002 ) .
The emerging field of the neuroscience of empathy parallels investigations being undertaken in cognate fields .
Some forty years ago the celebrated primatologist Jane Goodall observed and wrote about chimpanzee emotions , social relationships , and â chimp culture , â but experts remained skeptical .
A decade ago , the famed primate scientist Frans B.M. de Waal ( 1996 ) wrote about the antecedents to morality in Good Natured : The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals , but scientific consensus remained elusive .
All that âs changed .
As a recent editorial in the journal Nature ( 2007 ) put it , it âs now â unassailable fact â that human minds , including aspects of moral thought , are the product of evolution from earlier primates .
According to de Waal , â You do nât hear any debate now . â
In his more recent work , de Waal plausibly argues that human morality â including our capacity to empathize â is a natural outgrowth or inheritance of behavior from our closest evolutionary relatives .
Following Darwin , highly sophisticated studies by biologists Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson posit that large - scale cooperation within the human species â including with genetically unrelated individuals within a group â was favored by selection .
( Hauser , 2006 ,
p. 416 ) Evolution selected for the trait of empathy because there were survival benefits in coming to grips with others .
In his book , People of the Lake ( 1978 ) the world - renowned paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey unequivocally declares , â We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation . â
Studies have shown that empathy is present in very young children , even at eighteen months of age and possibly younger .
In the primate world , Warneken and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute at Leipzig , Germany , recently found that chimps extend help to unrelated chimps and unfamiliar humans , even when inconvenienced and regardless of any expectation of reward .
This suggests that empathy may lie behind this natural tendency to help and that it was a factor in the social life of the common ancestor to chimpanzees and humans at the split some six million years ago ( New Scientist , 2007 ; Warneken and Tomasello , 2006 ) .
It âs now indisputable that we share moral faculties with other species ( de Waal , 2006 ; Trivers , 1971 ; Katz , 2000 ; Gintis , 2005 ; Hauser , 2006 ; Bekoff , 2007 ; Pierce , 2007 ) .
Pierce notes that there are â countless anecdotal accounts of elephants showing empathy toward sick and dying animals , both kin and non-kin â ( 2007 , p. 6 ) .
And recent research in Kenya has conclusively documented elephant âs open grieving / empathy for other dead elephants .
Mogil and his team at McGill University recently demonstrated that mice feel distress when they observe other mice experiencing pain .
They tentatively concluded that the mice engaged visual cues to bring about this empathic response ( Mogil , 2006 ; Ganguli , 2006 ) .
De Waal âs response to this study : â This is a highly significant finding and should open the eyes of people who think empathy is limited to our species . â ( Carey , 2006 )
Further , Grufman and other scientists at the National Institutes of Health have offered persuasive evidence that altruistic acts activate a primitive part of the brain , producing a pleasurable response ( 2007 ) .
And recent research by Koenigs and colleagues ( 2007 ) indicates that within the brain âs prefrontal cortex , the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or VMPC is required for emotions and moral judgment .
Damage to the VMPC has been linked to psychopathic behavior .
This led to the belief that as a rule , psychopaths do not experience empathy or remorse .
A study by Miller ( 2001 ) and colleagues of the brain disorder frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) is also instructive .
FTD attacks the frontal lobes and anterior temporal lobes , the site of one âs sense of self .
One early symptom of FTD is the loss of empathy .
We know from neuroscientific empathy experiments that the same affective brain circuits are automatically mobilized upon feeling one âs own pain and the pain of others .
Through brain imaging , we also know that separate neural processing regions then free up the capacity to take action .
As Decety notes , empathy then allows us to â forge connections with people whose lives seem utterly alien from us â ( Decety , 2006 , p. 2 ) .
Where comparable experience is lacking , this â cognitive empathy â builds on the neural basis and allows one to â actively project oneself into the shoes of another person â by trying to imagine the other person âs situation ( Preston , in press ) , Preston and de Waal ( 2002 ) .
Empathy is â other directed , â the recognition of the other âs humanity .

So where does this leave us ?
If morality is rooted in biology , in the raw material or building blocks for the evolution of its expression , we now have a pending fortuitous marriage of hard science and secular morality in the most profound sense .
The technical details of the social neuroscientific analysis supporting these assertions lie outside this paper , but suffice it to say that progress is proceeding at an exponential pace and the new discoveries are persuasive ( Decety and Lamm , 2006 ; Lamm , 2007 ; Jackson , 2004 and 2006 ) .
That said , one of the most vexing problems that remains to be explained is why so little progress has been made in extending this empathic orientation to distant lives , to those outside certain in - group moral circles .
Given a world rife with overt and structural violence , one is forced to explain why our deep - seated moral intuition does nât produce a more ameliorating effect , a more peaceful world .
Iacoboni suggests this disjuncture is explained by massive belief systems , including political and religious ones , operating on the reflective and deliberate level .
These tend to override the automatic , pre-reflective , neurobiological traits that should bring people together .
Here a few cautionary notes are warranted .
The first is that social context and triggering conditions are critical because , where there is conscious and massive elite manipulation , it becomes exceedingly difficult to get in touch with our moral faculties .
Ervin Staub , a pioneering investigator in the field , acknowledges that even if empathy is rooted in nature , people will not act on it â . . . unless they have certain kinds of life experiences that shape their orientation toward other human beings and toward themselves ( Staub , 2002 , p. 222 ) .
As Jensen puts it , â The way we are educated and entertained keep us from knowing about or understanding the pain of others â ( 2002 ) .
Circumstances may preclude and overwhelm our perceptions , rendering us incapable of recognizing and giving expression to moral sentiments ( Albert , n.d. ; and also , Pinker , 2002 ) .
For example , the fear - mongering of artificially created scarcity may attenuate the empathic response .
The limitation placed on exposure is another .
As reported recently in The New York Times , the Pentagon imposes tight embedding restrictions on journalist âs ability to run photographs and other images of casualties in Iraq .
Photographs of coffins returning to Dover Air Base in Delaware are simply forbidden .
Memorial services for the fallen are also now prohibited even if the unit gives its approval .
The second cautionary note is Hauser âs ( 2006 ) observation that proximity was undoubtedly a factor in the expression of empathy .
In our evolutionary past an attachment to the larger human family was virtually incomprehensible and , therefore , the emotional connection was lacking .
Joshua Greene , a philosopher and neuroscientist , adds that â We evolved in a world where people in trouble right in front of you existed , so our emotions were tuned to them , whereas we did nât face the other kind of situation . â
He suggests that to extend this immediate emotion - linked morality â one based on fundamental brain circuits â to unseen victims requires paying less attention to intuition and more to the cognitive dimension .
If this boundary is nât contrived , it would seem , at a minimum , circumstantial and thus worthy of reassessing morality ( Greene , 2007 , n.p. ) .
Given some of the positive dimensions of globalization , the potential for identifying with the â stranger â has never been more robust .
Finally , as Preston ( 2006 - 2007 ; and also , in press ) suggests , risk and stress tend to suppress empathy whereas familiarity and similarity encourage the experience of natural , reflexive empathy .
This formidable but not insurmountable challenge warrants further research into how this â out - group â identity is created and reinforced .
It may be helpful , as Halpern ( 1993 , p. 169 ) suggests , to think of empathy as a sort of spark of natural curiosity , prompting a need for further understanding and deeper questioning .
However , our understanding of how or whether political engagement follows remains in its infancy and demands further investigation .
***
Almost a century ago , Stein ( 1917 ) wrote about empathy as â the experience of foreign consciousness in general . â
Salles â film The Motorcycle Diaries addresses empathy , albeit indirectly .
The film follows Ernesto Guevara de la Serna and his friend Alberto Granada on an eight - month trek across Argentina , Peru , Columbia , Chile and Venezuela .
When leaving his leafy , upper middle - class suburb ( his father is an architect ) in Buenos Aires in 1952 , Guevara is 23 and a semester away from earning his medical degree .
The young men embark on an adventure , a last fling before settling down to careers and lives of privilege .
They are preoccupied with women , fun and adventure and certainly not seeking or expecting a life - transforming odyssey .
The film âs power is in its depiction of Guevara âs emerging political awareness that occurs as a consequence of unfiltered cumulative experiences .
During their 8,000 - mile journey , they encounter massive poverty , exploitation , and brutal working conditions , all consequences of an unjust international economic order .
By the end , Guevara has turned away from being a doctor because medicine is limited to treating the symptoms of poverty .
For him , revolution becomes the expression of empathy , the only effective way to address suffering âs root causes .
This requires melding the cognitive component of empathy with engagement , with resistance against asymmetrical power , always an inherently political act .
Otherwise , empathy has no meaning .
( This roughly parallels the political practice of brahma- viharas by engaged Buddhists . )
In his own oft - quoted words ( not included in the film ) , Guevara stated that , â The true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love . â
Paul Farmer , the contemporary medical anthropologist , infectious - disease specialist and international public health activist , has adopted different tactics , but his diagnosis of the â pathologies of power â is remarkably similar to Guevara .
He also writes approvingly of Cuba âs health programs , comparing them with his long work experience in Haiti .
Both individuals were motivated early on by the belief that artificial epidemics have their origin in unjust socioeconomic structures , hence the need for social medicine , a â politics as medicine on a grand scale . â
Both exemplify exceptional social outliers of engaged empathy and the interplay of affective , cognitive and moral components .
For Farmer âs radical critique of structural violence and the connections between disease and social inequality , see ( Farmer , 2003 ; Kidder , 2003 ) .
Again , it remains to be explained why there is such a paucity of real world examples of empathic behavior ?
Why is U.S. culture characterized by a massive empathy deficit of almost pathological proportions ?
And what might be reasonably expected from a wider public understanding of the nature of empathy ?
Hauser posits a â universal moral grammar , â hard - wired into our neural circuits via evolution .
This neural machinery precedes conscious decisions in life - and - death situations , however , we observe â nurture entering the picture to set the parameters and guide us toward the acquisition of particular moral systems . â
At other points , he suggests that environmental factors can push individuals toward defective moral reasoning , and the various outcomes for a given local culture are seemingly limitless .
( Hauser , 2006 ) For me , this discussion of cultural variation fails to give sufficient attention to the socioeconomic variables responsible for shaping the culture .
â It all has to do with the quality of justice and the availability of opportunity . â ( 2006 , p. 151 ) .
Earlier , Goldschmidt ( 1999 , n.p. ) argued that , â Culturally derived motives may replace , supplement or override genetically programmed behavior . â
Cultures are rarely neutral , innocent phenomena but are consciously set up to reward some people and penalize others .
As Parenti ( 2006 ) forcefully asserts , certain aspects of culture can function as instruments of social power and social domination through ideological indoctrination .
Culture is part and parcel of political struggle , and studying culture can reveal how power is exercised and on whose behalf .
Cohen and Rogers , in parsing Chomsky âs critique of elites , note that â Once an unjust order exists , those benefiting from it have both an interest in maintaining it and , by virtue of their social advantages , the power to do so . â
( Cohen , 1991 , p. 17 ) ( For a concise but not uncritical treatment of Chomsky âs social and ethical views , see Cohen , 1991 . )
Clearly , the vaunted human capacity for verbal communication cuts both ways .
In the wrong hands , this capacity is often abused by consciously quelling the empathic response .
When de Waal writes , â Animals are no moral philosophers , â I âm left to wonder if he is nât favoring the former in this comparison .
( de Waal , 1996 b , n.p. )
One of the methods employed within capitalist democracies is Chomsky âs and Herman âs â manufacture of consent , â a form of highly sophisticated thought control .
Potentially active citizens must be â distracted from their real interests and deliberately confused about the way the world works . â
( Cohen , 1991 , p. 7 ; Chomsky , 1988 )
For this essay , and following Chomsky , I âm arguing that the human mind is the primary target of this perverse â nurture â or propaganda , in part because exposure to certain new truths about empathy â hard evidence about our innate moral nature â poses a direct threat to elite interests .
There âs no ghost in the machine , but the capitalist machine attempts to keep people in line with an ideological ghost , the notion of a self constructed on market values .
But â. . . if no one saw himself or herself as capitalism needs them to do , their own self - respect would bar the system from exploiting and manipulating them . â
( Kelleher , 2007 ) That is , given the apparent universality of this biological predisposition toward empathy , we have a potent scientific baseline upon which to launch further critiques of elite manipulation , this cultivation of callousness .
First , the evolutionary and biological origins of empathy contribute hard empirical evidence â not wishful thinking or even logical inference â on behalf of a case for organizing vastly better societies .
In that vein , this new research is entirely consistent with work on the nature of authentic love and the concrete expression of that love in the form of care , effort , responsibility , courage and respect .
As Eagleton reminds us , if others are also engaging in this behavior , â . . . the result is a form of reciprocal service which provides the context for each self to flourish .
The traditional name for this reciprocity is love . â
Because reciprocity mandates equality and an end to exploitation and oppression , it follows that â a just , compassionate treatment of other people is on the grand scale of things one of the conditions for one âs own thriving . â
And as social animals , when we act in this way we are realizing our natures â at their finest . â ( 2007 , pp. 170 , 159 - 160 , and 173 ) Again , the political question remains that of realizing a form of global environment that enhances the opportunity for our nature to flourish .
I âve noted elsewhere , Fromm âs classic book The Art of Loving is a blistering indictment of the social and economic forces that deny us life âs most rewarding experience and â the only satisfying answer to the problem of human existence . â
For Fromm , grasping how society shapes our human instincts , hence our behavior , is in turn the key to understanding why â love thy neighbor , â the love of the stranger , is so elusive in modern society .
The global capitalist culture with its premium on accumulation and profits not only devalues an empathic disposition but produces a stunted character in which everything is transformed into a commodity , not only things , but individuals themselves .
The very capacity to practice empathy ( love ) is subordinated to our state religion of the market in which each person seeks advantage in an alienating and endless commodity - greedy competition .
Over five decades ago , Fromm persuasively argued that â The principles of capitalist society and the principles of love are incompatible . â ( Fromm , 1956 , p. 110 ) .
Any honest person knows that the dominant features of capitalist society tend to produce individuals who are estranged from themselves , crippled personalities robbed of their humanity and in a constant struggle to express empathic love .
Little wonder that Fromm believed radical changes in our social structure and economic institutions were needed if empathy / love is to be anything more than a rare individual achievement and a socially marginal phenomenon .
He understood that only when the economic system serves women and men , rather than the opposite , will this be possible ( Olson , 2006 ) .
***
The dominant cultural narrative of hyper - individualism is challenged and the insidiously effective scapegoating of human nature that claims we are motivated by greedy , dog - eat - dog â individual self - interest is all â is undermined .
From original sin to today âs â selfish gene , â certain interpretations of human nature have invariably functioned to retard class consciousness .
These new research findings help to refute the allegation that people are naturally uncooperative , an argument frequently employed to intimidate and convince people that it âs futile to seek a better society for everyone .
Stripped of yet another rationalization for empire , predatory behavior on behalf of the capitalist mode of production becomes ever more transparent .
And learning about the conscious suppression of this essential core of our nature should beg additional troubling questions about the motives behind other elite - generated ideologies , from neo-liberalism to the â war on terror . â
Second , there are implications for students .
Cultivating empathic engagement through education remains a poorly understood enterprise .
College students , for example , may hear the â cry of the people â but the moral sound waves are muted as they pass through a series of powerful cultural baffles .
Williams ( 1986 , p. 143 ) notes that â While they may be models of compassion and generosity to those in their immediate circles , many of our students today have a blind spot for their responsibilities in the socio-political order .
In the traditional vocabulary they are strong on charity but weak on justice . â
Nussbaum ( 1997 ) defends American liberal education âs record at cultivating an empathic imagination .
She claims that understanding the lives of strangers and achieving cosmopolitan global citizenship can be realized through the arts and literary humanities .
There is little solid evidence to substantiate this optimism .
My own take on empathy - enhancing practices within U.S. colleges and universities is considerably less sanguine .
Nussbaum âs episodic examples of stepping into the mental shoes of other people are rarely accompanied by plausible answers as why these people may be lacking shoes â or decent jobs , minimum healthcare , and long - life expectancy .
The space within educational settings has been egregiously underutilized , in part , because we do nât know enough about propitious interstices where critical pedagogy could make a difference .
Arguably the most serious barrier is the cynical , even despairing doubt about the existence of a moral instinct for empathy .
The new research puts this doubt to rest and rightly shifts the emphasis to strategies for cultivating empathy and identifying with â the other . â
Joining the affective and cognitive dimensions of empathy may require risky forms of radical pedagogy ( Olson , 2006 , 2007 ; Gallo , 1989 ) .
Evidence produced from a game situation with medical students strongly hints that empathic responses can be significantly enhanced by increased knowledge about the specific needs of others â in this case , the elderly ( Varkey , 2006 ) .
Presumably , limited prior experiences would affect one âs emotional response .
Again , this is a political culture / information acquisition issue that demands further study .
Third , for many people the basic incompatibility between global capitalism and the lived expression of moral sentiments may become obvious for the first time .
( Olson , 2006 , 2005 ) For example , the failure to engage this moral sentiment has radical implications , not the least being consequences for the planet .
Within the next 100 years , one - half of all species now living will be extinct .
Great apes , polar bears , tigers and elephants are all on the road to extinction due to rapacious growth , habitat destruction , and poaching .
These human activities , not random extinction , will be the undoing of millions of years of evolution ( Purvis , 2000 ) .
As Leakey puts it , â Whatever way you look at it , we âre destroying the Earth at a rate comparable with the impact of a giant asteroid slamming into the planet .
. . â
And researchers at McGill University have shown that economic inequality is linked to high rates of biodiversity loss .
The authors suggest that economic reforms may be the prerequisite to saving the richness of the ecosystem and urge that â . . . if we can learn to share the economic resources more fairly with fellow members of our own species , it may help to share ecological resources with our fellow species . â
( Mikkelson , 2007 , p. 5 )
While one hesitates imputing too much transformative potential to this emotional capacity , there is nothing inconsistent about drawing more attention to inter-species empathy and eco-empathy .
The latter may be essential for the protection of biotic communities .
Decety and Lamm ( 2006 , p. 4 ) remind us that â . . . one of the most striking aspects of human empathy is that it can be felt for virtually any target , even targets of a different species . â
This was foreshadowed at least fifty years ago when Paul Mattick , writing about Kropotkin âs notion of mutual aid , noted that â . . .
For a long time , however , survival in the animal world has not depended upon the practice of either mutual aid or competition but has been determined by the decisions of men as to which species should live and thrive and which should be exterminated .
. . .
[ W ] herever man rules , the â laws of nature â with regard to animal life cease to exist . â
This applies no less to humans and Mattick rightly observed that the demands of capital accumulation and capitalist social relations override and preclude mutual aid .
As such , neuroscience findings are welcome and necessary but insufficient in themselves .
For empathy to flourish requires the elimination of class relations ( Mattick , 1956 , pp. 2 - 3 ) .
Fourth , equally alarming for elites , awareness of this reality contains the potential to encourage â destabilizing â but humanity - affirming cosmopolitan attitudes toward the faceless â other , â both here and abroad .
In de Waal âs apt words , â Empathy can override every rule about how to treat others . â ( de Waal , 2005 , p. 9 ) Amin ( 2003 ) , for example , proposes that the new Europe be reframed by an ethos of empathy and engagement with the stranger as its core value .
The diminution of empathy within the culture reduces pro-social behavior and social cohesiveness .
Given the dangerous centrifugal forces of ethno- nationalism and xenophobia , nothing less than this unifying motif will suffice , while providing space for a yet undefined Europe , a people to come .
Finally , as de Waal observes , â If we could manage to see people on other continents as part of us , drawing them into our circle of reciprocity and empathy , we would be building upon rather than going against our nature . â ( de Waal , 2005 , p. 9 ) An ethos of empathy is an essential part of what it means to be human and empathically impaired societies , societies that fail to gratify this need should be found wanting .
We âve been systematically denied a deeper and more fulfilling engagement with this moral sentiment .
I would argue that the tremendous amount of deception and fraud expended on behalf of overriding empathy is a cause for hope and cautious optimism .
Paradoxically , the relative absence of widespread empathic behavior is in fact a searing tribute to its potentially subversive power .
Is it too much to hope that we âre on the verge of discovering a scientifically based , Archimedean moral point from which to lever public discourse toward an appreciation of our true nature , which in turn might release powerful emancipatory forces ?

First , the financials : EarthLink lost $ 9.5 million ( 8Â¢ per share ) on revenues of $ 22.6 million .
Both figures were an improvement over the last quarter of 2006 , which saw a loss of $ 17.9 million ( 15 Â¢ per share ) .
Much of the financial pain came from the ISP 's municipal WiFi business , which lost a whopping $ 32.1 million during the last three months of 2007 , compared to a $ 7 million loss a year prior .
After climbing into the driver 's seat last June , EarthLink CEO Rolla Huff called for a strategic review of the company 's operations .
The company quickly laid off 900 employees and decided to scale back its municipal WiFi venture .
In mid-November , Huff announced that the company would no longer make " significant further investments " in the business .
During the conference call , Huff confirmed that the company has slapped a " for sale " sign on its municipal WiFi business .
" We 're actively working to determine if there are viable outside buyers for the assets or if the cities themselves are interested in the assets , " Huff told listeners .
" We are looking to come to a solution with the municipalities that works for them , [ one that ] reduces our future spending obligations . "
One of the problems EarthLink ran into was cities ' insistence on getting a fully - operational network with little or no cash outlay on their part .
" It quickly became evident [ after starting the review of its business ] that we would have a really difficult time changing the perception by some of the cities that we owed them a free network rather than the city stepping up to make the business model viable for both them and for our shareholders , " Huff concluded .
Indeed , most of the news in the municipal WiFi sector during 2007 was bleak .
Philadelphia , which announced plans for a 135 - square - mile WiFi network back in 2004 , has seen costs spiral upwards due to problems getting adequate coverage .
San Francisco has had to alter its expectations for its planned citywide WiFi network due to EarthLink 's reluctance to pour endless amounts of cash into the project , and Chicago 's plans for a municipal network have been effectively cancelled .
Selling its municipal WiFi business may prove very difficult for EarthLink ( maybe the company can swap troubled businesses with Time Warner ) .
Since the glory days of the middle of the decade , municipal WiFi has fallen so far out of favor in some quarters that an ambitious network planned for Silicon Valley is on the ropes â despite the Valley being flush with venture capital cash .
Whether or not EarthLink can find a buyer for its WiFi business depends on a number of factors , industry analyst Craig Settles told Ars .
" Everything depends on the vision of the buyer , " argues Settles .
" There is a lot of interest among governments in making the business case for getting a network that will serve primarily mobile government workers and asset management , plus key constituent groups such as the medical and university communities . "
When it comes to making money off of operating a commercial citywide network , Settles says that 's just not going to happen .
" I think EarthLink 's position that there 's not money to make with muni wireless is true , to a point , if the only thing you want to do is sell a general consumer service , " he told Ars .
" And I think that anyone who buys this business with that in mind is in for trouble . "
The only viable option left for municipal wireless may be networks intended primarily to serve the interests of municipal governments .
Under that model , any commercial revenues are gravy .
Unfortunately for EarthLink and its shareholders , man cannot live by gravy alone .

Thousands of people could regain the use of paralysed limbs thanks to a pioneering technique , scientists claim .
The technique uses the body 's nerves to bypass spinal injuries and US researchers believe the treatment could help thousands of people to regain feeling , and possibly even the use of paralysed limbs .
The researchers have shown that nerves can be used to circumvent spinal damage and reconnect the brain to the body , according to a report in New Scientist .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The procedure , successfully used in experiments with rats , worked on similar principles to heart bypass surgery , where veins from a patient 's leg are used to get around an artery blockage .
It raised the prospect of the first human trials within five years , offering hope to the 40,000 - plus people in the UK with spinal cord injuries .
John Martin , a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York , cut away a nerve in rats , from just above the injury , that normally stretches into the body to control abdominal muscles and reattached it to the spine below the injury .
When the team examined the nerve under a microscope two weeks later , they found it had sprouted new extensions which had begun to form connections , or synapses , with the motor nerves in the isolated lower spine .
Zapping the spinal cord above the injury made the lower limbs of the rats twitch , showing that motor signals had begun once again to pass along the entire length of the spine .
Mr Martin said : " What we want to do is plug in new connections to bypass the damaged region .
" We know the nerves can make new connections to muscle , so we asked whether it 's possible for them to also connect with spinal cord neurons isolated through injury . "
He told the Guardian : " What we 've documented is that we 've reconnected the nervous system above the injury with below the injury in a robust way .

" The hope is to try to overcome some of the paralysis . "
Reconnecting a single nerve would not be sufficient to reactivate all of a patient 's lost functions , and the patient would have to decide with their doctor what was most important to improve their quality of life .
Mr Martin said : " For example , in a quadriplegic with limited upper extremity mobility , increasing the strength of shoulder muscles is very helpful because that could help their transfer from a wheelchair to a bed or toilet - it gives them independence . "
Patrick Anderson , professor of experimental neuroscience at University College London , told the newspaper the findings were exciting , but said there was still much research to be done before the technique could be tried in humans .
Mr Anderson , who was not involved in the research , said : " It 's quite an exciting response , it 's novel and no one 's achieved quite that before . "
Mr Martin said the technique needed much more development , but if all went well trials in humans could start in as little as five years .
Federal agents are investigating whether former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott knowingly played a role in an alleged conspiracy in 2006 to influence a Mississippi judge presiding over a multimillion - dollar lawsuit against famed plaintiff attorney Richard " Dickie " Scruggs , according to people familiar with the situation .
Mr. Scruggs and several associates are scheduled to stand trial March 31 on charges that they offered $ 40,000 in bribes to State Court Judge Henry L. Lackey in return for a favorable ruling in a lawsuit against Mr. Scruggs over $ 26.5 million in legal fees .
Mr. Lott , who is a brother - in - law to Mr. Scruggs , unexpectedly announced his resignation from the Senate two days before Mr. Scruggs was indicted last November .
Since then , Mr. Lott has been interviewed by federal agents at least once , according to a person familiar with the case .
The U.S. attorney 's office in Oxford , Miss. , which is leading the investigation , is also examining whether several associates of Mr. Scruggs induced a different Mississippi jurist , Hinds County Judge Robert Delaughter , to rule in favor of Mr. Scruggs in a separate lawsuit by promising that Mr. Lott would recommend Judge Delaughter for a seat on the federal bench .
The two lawsuits were about whether Mr. Scruggs owed former legal associates tens of millions of dollars in disputes over legal fees .

So , my Roomba started misbehaving : it kept turning to the right and backing up , and generally acting like one of its sensors was gummed up .
I tried the things their web site suggested to no avail , and took the whole wheel assembly apart , and could n't find anything amiss .
It 's out of warranty , but I mailed iRobot anyway to find out if they had a repair program , or if I 'd just need to buy a whole new one .
Their response ?
" The Roomba 's behavior is indicating that the internal wheel sensor has malfunctioned .
We will send you a device called an osmo that will update the Roomba 's software and most likely eliminate the issue . "
So they sent me this stylish little dongle that plugs into the serial port and flashes the firmware , and an envelope to mail it back afterward .
And it works fine now .
So the new firmware apparently detects broken wheel sensors and compensates for them .
Which is awesome .
And , they did this for free , which is also awesome .
But let me rephrase that story :
My personal cleaning robot has malfunctioning hardware .
The manufacturer sent me a piece of hardware to update the software .
That software fixed the hardware .
I just felt a bit like I was living in the future for a minute there .
I got a little chill .
Portugal - June 28 , 2007 --
A new paper published in Journal of the American Ceramic Society proposes a new method of producing hydrogen for portable fuel cells .
This new method negates the need for the complicated and expensive equipment currently used .
With their ability to work steadily for 10 - 20 times the length of equivalently sized Lithium-ion batteries , portable fuel cells are ideal energy suppliers for devices such as computers , cell phones and hybrid vehicles .
Significant amounts of hydrogen are needed to power these long - lived fuel cells , but producing the chemical has , until this point , been costly and difficult .
Zhen - Yan Deng , lead author of the study , found that modified aluminum powder can be used to react with water to produce hydrogen at room temperature and under normal atmospheric pressure .
The result is a cost - efficient method for powering fuel cells that will make their use a more practical and realistic option in many applications .
Efforts to produce large amounts of hydrogen for portable devices have previously focused on other chemicals ; however , compared to other hybrids , aluminum is cheaper and requires no other chemical in order to react with water .
" This makes the modified aluminum powder a more economically viable material to generate hydrogen for the future use of portable fuel cells , " says Deng .

John Kiriakou said he felt water - boarding may be torture
John Kiriakou told US broadcaster ABC that " water - boarding " was used when his CIA team questioned suspected al - Qaeda chief recruiter Abu Zubaydah .
He said it might be torture but that it " broke " the detainee in seconds .
US authorities are investigating the CIA 's destruction of videotapes of al - Qaeda suspects being interrogated .
Mr Kiriakou said the day after water - boarding was used on Abu Zubaydah , the detainee told his interrogator that Allah had visited him in his cell during the night and told him to co-operate .
' Principles compromised '
" From that day on , he answered every question , " the retired agent said .
WATER -BOARDING
Prisoner bound to a board with feet raised , and cellophane wrapped round head .
Water is poured onto face and is said to produce a fear of drowning
CIA boss faces credibility test Water - boarding scrutinised
" The threat information he provided disrupted a number of attacks , maybe dozens of attacks . "
But he added : " Like a lot of Americans , I 'm involved in this internal , intellectual battle with myself weighing the idea that water - boarding may be torture versus the quality of information that we often get after using the water - boarding technique .
And I struggle with it . "
He said he felt water - boarding 's use had " compromised [ American ] principles in the short term " and was unsure the technique would be justified any longer .
" At the time , I felt water - boarding was something we needed to do , " he said .
" And as time has passed , and as September 11th has , you know , has moved farther and farther back into history , I think I 've changed my mind . "
The interview is said by ABC News to be first public comment by any CIA officer involved in handling top al - Qaeda suspects .
Cover - up claims
It comes as an official inquiry is launched into the CIA 's destruction in 2005 of two videotapes showing interrogations of al - Qaeda suspects .
The CIA is being investigated over the deletion of interrogation tapes
One of the detainees in the deleted footage , filmed in 2002 , is understood to be Abu Zubaydah , the man referred to by Mr Kiriakou .
The Palestinian was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and sent to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The CIA says it destroyed the tapes to protect the identity of its agents .
But Democrats have accused the agency of a cover - up to hide evidence of possible detainee torture .
The administration of US President George W Bush has always maintained it does not allow the use of torture .
Gaza has been under sustained bombardment for two days
Four Palestinian boys were killed in an Israeli attack as they played in a field in northern Gaza on Thursday .
The Israelis say their attacks are a response to the firing of Palestinian rockets into southern Israel .
A BBC correspondent says Gazan drivers are staying at home , worried their vehicles could be hit from the air .
Well into the night , Israeli air strikes could still be heard in Gaza , the BBC's Aleem Maqbool reports .
There are no signs of either the Israeli army or the Palestinian militants backing down , and the people in Israeli border towns and across the Gaza Strip are bracing themselves for more violence , he adds .
Children killed
Palestinian rocket fire killed one man in the Israeli town of Sderot on Wednesday , and has since injured others .
Israelis buried rocket attack victim Roni Yechiah on Thursday
Israeli attacks have killed Palestinian militants but also civilians including a six - month - old baby and the four boys , who doctors say had been playing football .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said his country could not make peace with people who were murdering its citizens .
" The only requirement we have from the Palestinians is stop killing innocent Israelis , stop shooting Qassam rockets at the civilian centres of Israel so that we 'll be able to do business together , " he said .
But prominent Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi said Israel was guilty of double standards .
" If you make security for Israel a precondition while Israel has a free hand to kill and destroy and wreak havoc in Palestinian lives , you will never get anywhere , " she said .
" There has to be security for everybody . "
Scientists have invented the Prius of ocean - going submersibles â a new " green " robotic glider that runs on energy absorbed from the heat of the sea , rather than batteries .
The new underwater glider can stay at sea at least twice as long as previous submersibles that used battery power .
It is the first autonomous underwater vehicle to travel great distances for extended periods running on green energy , according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) .
Submersibles gained fame in 1985 when WHOI 's remotely - operated underwater vehicle , " Argo , " discovered the wreck of the RMS Titanic near Newfoundland .
Built by the Webb Research Corporation in Falmouth , Mass. , the new submersible has successfully traveled back and forth between two of the U.S. Virgin Islands , St. Thomas and St. Croix , more than 20 times .
WHOI researchers plan to use the data gathered by the craft to study ocean currents in the area .
To power its propulsion , the submersible gathers thermal energy from the ocean .
When it moves from cooler water to warmer areas , internal tubes of wax are heated up and expand , pushing out the gas in surrounding tanks and increasing its pressure .
The compressed gas stores potential energy , like a squeezed spring , that can be used to power the vehicle .
" This glider allows longer missions than previous [ battery - run ] versions , " said Ben Hodges , a physical oceanographer at WHOI .
" It could be out there for a year or two years .
None of the old ones could go beyond six months .
And producing fewer batteries is good for the environment . "
The torpedo - shaped glider moves through the ocean by changing its buoyancy to dive and surface , unlike motorized , propeller - driven undersea vehicles .
To rise , oil is pushed from inside the vehicle to external bladders , thus increasing the glider 's volume without changing its mass , making it less dense .
The oil can be shifted inside to increase the density and sink the vehicle .
A vertical tail rudder allows the glider to be steered horizontally .
Technically , the new vehicle is a hybrid , like Toyota 's Prius , because it uses a small amount of battery power to run the onboard instruments and to move the rudder .
Gliders of this type are perfect for long - term , long - distance journeys that humans can't make , Hodges said .
" They can be very helpful in getting measurements that would be too expensive to get otherwise â any kind of study that requires long - term measurements from multiple locations , " Hodges told LiveScience .
" If you had to be there in a ship , it would cost millions of dollars . "
The impact of cannabis on the lungs depends on how it is smoked
One study found a higher risk of lung cancer for those who smoked one joint a day compared with those who smoked 20 cigarettes a day over the same period .
Another found bullous disease - a form of emphysema - occurs 20 years earlier in cannabis smokers .
The studies appear in Respirology and the European Respiratory Journal .
Both studies come at a time when the government is considering whether to change the laws on the possession of cannabis .
Deep inhalation
The lung cancer study was conducted on 79 patients in New Zealand .
The risk of the disease rose 8 % for each year of smoking one joint a day , and 7 % for each year of smoking a packet of cigarettes a day .
The situation is complicated in the UK as the two drugs are almost always smoked mixed together
Steve Rolles
Transform Drug Policy Foundation
Researchers at the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand admitted it was a small study , but said nonetheless " it shows clearly that long - term cannabis smoking increases lung cancer risk " .
They speculated the heightened risk may be connected to the fact that the cannabis smoker inhales more deeply and for longer , increasing the amount of carbon monoxide .
This was also thought to be the issue in a second , smaller study of 10 patients who were treated for chronic respiratory problems at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne .
All admitted intense cannabis use for at least a year .
They had developed bullous lung disease , a condition where air becomes trapped in the lungs , at an average age of 41 , compared to 65 for tobacco smoking patients .
The campaign group Transform Drug Policy Foundation said it was very difficult to separate cannabis from tobacco use as the two were so often smoked together .
" Variations on the ' cannabis is more dangerous than tobacco ' have been emerging sporadically for several decades .
Different research using different methodologies has suggested very different conclusions , making such comparisons problematic , " said spokesman Steve Rolles .
He added that inhaling smoke from any burning object was intrinsically harmful , and that policy should focus more on educating people about the risks of taking the drug - which can be taken using other methods - in this way .
The British Lung Foundation said the debate about cannabis 's effect had tended to focus on the mental impact , overlooking the damage to the lungs .
" Many people do n't know that smoking a joint is more harmful to the lungs than smoking a cigarette , as marijuana is often inhaled more deeply and held for longer , " said Dr Noemi Eiser , honorary medical director of the British Lung Foundation .
" The New Zealand study highlights the carcinogenic properties of cannabis smoke and it is a great worry that these exist in similar or even greater proportions to tobacco smoke . "
The UK Government may decide later this year whether it will reclassify cannabis as a class B drug , having downgraded it to a class C substance in 2004 .
There is evidence to suggest that usage has fallen since reclassification occurred .
Scientists at the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology have found a much better way to make biodiesel .
Their new method could lower the cost and increase the energy efficiency of fuel production .
Instead of mixing the ingredients and heating them for hours , the chemical engineers pass sunflower oil and methanol through a bed of pellets made from fungal spores .
An enzyme produced by the fungus does the work â making biodiesel with impressive efficiency .
Last Monday , Ravichandra Potumarthi showed off his work during a poster session at the International Conference on Bioengineering and Nanotechnology .
After returning to his lab in Hyderabad , he was able to send out some pictures of his experimental reactor ( shown on right ) and the fungal pellets .
Typically , biodiesel is made by mixing methanol with lye and vegetable oil and then heating the brew for several hours .
This bonds the methanol to the oils to produce energetic molecules called esters .
Unfortunately , heating the mixture is a huge waste of energy , and a major selling point of alternative fuels is efficiency .
An enzyme called lipase can link link oil to methanol without any extra heating , but the pure protein is expensive .
Potumarthi has a simple solution .
Why bother purifying the lipase ?
It would be easier to just find an organism that produces plenty of the enzyme and squish it into pellets .
In this case , the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae does the trick .
Recently , several huge research centers have sprung up to develop better ways to make biofuels .
Considering that a handful of chemical engineers can accomplish so much on what appears to be a shoestring budget , the future of alternative fuels looks pretty good â but maybe a bit slimy .
