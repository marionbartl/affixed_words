While the Pentagon preps for a new administration , a scandal from an earlier era is rearing its head .
A Defense Department project , supposedly designed to support U.S. troops , was used instead to channel millions of dollars to personal friends and allies of its chief .
The " America Supports You , "
or ASY , program was led in a " questionable and unregulated manner , " according to a Department of Defense Inspector General report , obtained by Danger Room .
At least $ 9.2 million was " inappropriately transferred " by the project 's managers .
Much of that money served only to further promote ASY , instead of assisting servicemembers .
In 2004 , the office of then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld set up ASY as a six - month effort to showcase the U.S. public 's backing for the troops and their families .
" If you 're serving overseas , and you watch the mainstream media coverage , sometimes you can't tell if America knows you 're there , " one official overseeing the program says .
America Supports
You was seen as a way to counteract that sense .
In time , however , the program grew .
Pro-troop rallies were organized .
Special wristband and dog tags were made .
Special - edition comic books were printed up .
Processions were held on the National Mall , on the 9/11 anniversary .
Sesame Street characters were enlisted to make DVDs that encouraged families with young children to talk about overseas deployments .
America Supports
You became a kind of umbrella group for all sorts of charity - related work for service members and military families .
Meanwhile , ASY began to spend millions — not to help the troops , the Inspector General says , but to help itself .
" Instead of focusing on its primary mission of showcasing and communicating support to the troops and their families , the ASY program focus [ turned to ] building or soliciting support from the public , " the Inspector General 's report notes .
In 2006 and 2007 , for instance , more than $ 600,000 was spent ginning up support for America Supports
You among schoolchildren .
Another $ 165,000 went to a pro-ASY concert aboard the USS Intrepid , docked on Manhattan 's west side .
And $ 15,000 went to actor and musician Gary Sinise 's " Lt. Dan Band " to play a separate show .
The report calls all of these " questionable and unregulated actions . "
By mid-2007 , allegations began to surface that the Pentagon official in charge of the program , Armed Forces Information Service chief Alison Barber ( pictured , left ) , was improperly redirecting millions of dollars in public funds .
From fiscal years 2004 to 2007 , the Inspector General 's report notes , Barber funneled $ 8.8 million in contracts to the public relations firm Susan Davis International — to set up the myriad events , and to promote the ASY " brand . "
The work was incredibly lucrative ; Davis ' executives made as much as $ 312,821 to $ 662,691 per year .
" Paying a public relations contractor annual salaries approaching three - quarters of a million dollars does not appear to be a cost - effective means to support the ASY program and the war fighter , " the report observes .
But what made it even harder to stomach was that Davis was a friend of Barber's , and a well - known Republican operative , according to former Defense Department lawyer Diane Beaver .
Another half - million went to media consultant Mitch Semel , for web work .
Worse still , in the eyes of many , was that Barber used the Stars & Stripes newspaper as a kind of money - laundering service , to pay Davis and Semel .
The paper is partially financed by the Pentagon , and was part of Barber 's American Forces Information Service .
But * Stripes *has a decades - long tradition of fierce independence .
Editors were galled to discover that Barber 's office was pouring money into the paper 's coffers — and then paying Davis and Semel out of accounts with less congressional oversight and fewer spending restrictions than typical
Defense Department funds .
" Readers need to know that the newspaper they trust to provide them independent , accurate , credible news is not in any way operating in a compromised position , " managing editor Doug Clawson said .
" If , in fact , Stripes was helping handle public relations work on behalf of a political appointee it does n’t look good , and could taint the editorial department , and thereby the readers ’ perceptions of this newspaper ’s mission . "
The Department of Defense 's Inspector General had already launched investigations into financial wrongdoing and organizational mismanagement at America Supports You , the Armed Forces Information Service , and the
Defense ' Secretary 's public affairs office .
In October 2007 , the
Inspector General widened its review to include Stars & Stripes .
Barber is no longer at the Pentagon .
Two months ago , she abruptly resigned as the heads of both American Supports
You and of Defense Media Activity , the new organization that oversees * Stars & Stripes *.
America Supports
You has been moved under the Defense Department 's community relations office .
" A lot of the big issues have been addressed — how we do contracting , how we use appropriated funds , " one member of that office tells Danger Room .
" We 're back in the comfort zone , running a program in the way that the government is used to running it . "

The parents of Sam Esquibel know him only as a miracle baby .
The Colorado Springs infant survived surgery to remove what was believed to be a tumor when he was just 3 days old .
“ The doctors said to us , ‘ This one is for the books , ’ ” mom Tiffnie Esquibel said .
Inside the microscopic tumor was what looked like the formations of two feet , a hand and thigh .
“ To find a perfectly formed structure ( like this ) is extremely unique , unusual , borderline unheard of , ” said Dr. Paul Grabb , the veteran pediatric neurosurgeon who performed the operation on Sam at Colorado Springs ’ Memorial Hospital for Children .
As for what this could mean to science books , Grabb said he did not pursue it because it was not vital to saving Sam , although he did say it gave insight to stem - cell research .
“ How does the body form complete extremities ?
Who is to say we ca n’t grow a heart , leg or foot ? ” Grabb said .
“ This could show a window of what ’s possible . ”
At 41 weeks into Esquibel ’s pregnancy , an ultrasound showed fluid in Sam ’s brain , and an emergency cesarean section was scheduled .
The infant appeared healthy , but was given an MRI exam to be sure .
“ If they had n’t done the ( testing ) , the hospital said they would have sent Sam home with me , ” Esquibel said .
“ He just seemed as healthy as can be . ”
The MRI ultimately revealed a tumor , and at 3 days old , Sam underwent a two - hour surgery to remove it .
“ I was absolutely devastated , ” Esquibel said .
“ We did n’t know if he ’d make it through the surgery or not , and it was a 50 - 50 percent chance the tumor could be cancerous . ”
Two and half months later , Sam has mostly recovered .
Now that the sutures have healed , the infant is scheduled for 25 sessions of physical therapy to improve use of the right side of his head and neck .
“ You ’d never know if he did n’t have a scar there , ” his mom said .

A fired computer engineer for Fannie Mae has been arrested and charged with planting a malicious software script designed to permanently destroy millions of dollars worth of data from all 4,000 servers operated by the mortgage giant .
Rajendrasinh Babubahai Makwana , 35 , of Virginia , concealed the Unix script on Fannie Mae 's main administrative server on October 24 , the same day the Unix engineer was terminated , according to court documents made public Tuesday .
His script was programmed to remain dormant for three months , when it would greet administrators with a login message that read " Server Graveyard " and systematically replace all data with zeros on every production , administrative , and backup server in the company .
Makwana was arrested on January 7 and released on $ 100,000 bond .
He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday .
Attempts to reach him and his attorney for comment were not successful .
As a contract employee at Fannie 's Urbana , Maryland data center for about three years , Makwana had unfettered root access to the entire company 's system .
The plot laid out in a nine - page criminal complaint can fairly be described as vicious , even in the high - stress world of IT administration , where sabotage by disgruntled employees is common .
Had his malicious script remained undetected , it would have wiped out millions of mortgage records just as the meltdown in the US housing market is reaching the boiling point .
The allegations also lay out a cautionary tale about the risk of lax security practices at highly sensitive enterprises .
Despite his dismissal on October 24 , Makwana 's highly privileged computer access was n't terminated until late into the evening because of bureaucratic procedures in Fannie 's procurement department , according to court documents .
Shortly after Makwana was informed he was being fired , he logged in to Fannie 's main development server and embedded a series of malicious scripts inside a legitimate program .
To conceal the malicious payload , he created a page worth of blank lines between the legitimate code and the malicious code .
" When the program ascertained it was January 31 , 2009 , it would copy the rest of the files from the '. soti ' file from the dsysadm01 server and run the .y.sh script , " a FBI special agent wrote in a sworn statement that referred to Fannie as ABC to protect its identity .
" The .y.sh script would place a blocker on the monitoring system disabling any ABC engineers from receiving a monitoring alert for any problems on any machines in the entire ABC environment for 61 minutes . "
Makwana 's script would then disable logins to Fannie 's administrative and backup production servers ; remove the root password appliance access ; rewrite all data , including backup software , with zeros ; and target any " high availability " software .
It would then replicate itself to each of Fannie 's 4,000 servers .
For thoroughness , the script would then execute all over again on a separate administrative server in case some of the company 's servers could n't be reached from the first one .
" Had this malicious script executed , ABC engineers expect it would have caused millions of dollars of damage and reduced if not shutdown operations at ABC for a least one week , " the FBI agent wrote .
" If this script were executed , the total damage would include cleaning out and restoring all 4,000 ABC servers , restoring and securing the automation of mortgages , and restoring all data that was erased . "
It was only by chance that a senior engineer at Fannie stumbled on to the script five days after Makwana 's dismissal , the agent stated .
The allegations demonstrate the awesome powers vested in a single , well - placed IT administrator , who with a few hundred keystrokes has the ability to wreak substantial damage on an entire economy .
It also shines a light on the evil genius of an alleged disgruntled employee who took great pains to cover his footprints from forensics investigators he almost certainly knew would pore over the case later .
Like so many other saboteurs , though , Makwana also appeared to make careless mistakes .
He allegedly planted his malicious script via a secure shell login from his Fannie - issued laptop using an IP address Fannie had assigned to him .
Shortly before planting the script , Makwana - a native of India who was employed by an unknown IT outsourcing firm - also emailed relatives in that country using a Fannie address and told them not to return to the US . ®
This story was updated to remove erroneous information about the firm Makwana worked for .
Based on inaccurate information included in the criminal complaint , a previous version misstated the name of the firm .
Stockholm , December 4 , 2008
The Gaza Strip is now the largest concentration camp in the world .
The situation grows steadily more insufferable for the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there .
Deliveries of food , medicine and fuel are made difficult or stopped altogether .
Child malnutrition is increasing .
Water supplies and drainage have ceased to function .
Children die for lack of healthcare .
Tunnels to Egypt , dug by hand , are the only breathing space .
Journalists and diplomats are denied entry .
Israel is planning more military efforts .
The Palestinians in Gaza are now to be starved into surrender and become an Egyptian problem .
The UN should use the word apartheid in connection with Israel and consider sanctions with the former South Africa serving as a model .
Miguel d�scoto Brockman , president of the UN General Assembly , conveyed this message at a meeting on November 24th 2008 with the UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon present .
The 1976 Nobel peace prize laureate , Mairead McGuire from Ireland , recently suggested a popular movement demanding that the UN revoke Israel�s membership .
The international community now needs to put tangible pressure on Israel in order to stop its war crimes .
Not once , during the past 60 years , has Israel shown any intention of living up to the requirements stipulated by the UN , in connection with the country�s membership in 1948 , namely that the Palestinians who had been evicted from their homes should be allowed to return at the earliest possible opportunity .
Moreover , Israel holds the hardly flattering world record of ignoring UN resolutions .
It can be questioned from the aspect of human rights legislation whether Israel is a legitimate state .
Established practice between states usually requires borders that are legally maintained and a constitution , neither of which Israel has .
These requirements are also named in the UN resolution ( 181 ) Partition Plan for Palestine , approved by the General Assembly in November 1947 .
The plan was accepted by the Zionists Jews in Palestine but rejected for excellent reasons as unjust by the Arab states .
Only decisions made by the UN Security Council are mandatory .
Later on , Israel unilaterally laid claim to a considerably larger portion of land than that suggested by the UN .
The eviction of eighty per cent of the Palestinians who lived west of the 1947 armistice line , and Israel�s refusal to allow them to return is the human rights argument for expelling Israel from the UN .
Not only has Israel played the Partition Plan false but has , by its actions , thwarted the grounds � fragile from the start � for its UN membership .
Israel makes use of various strategies to achieve its goals , the same goals as for over a hundred years ago :
As few and as well controlled and weakened Palestinians as possible in areas as small as possible between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan .
And to try and get acceptance worldwide for the theft of land that is vital to the " state " that calls itself " Jewish and democratic " .
This obviously bears no similarity to a peace process .
Why does nobody ever comment on the fact that Israel�s prime minister never misses an opportunity to harp on about how important it is that the rest of the world and the Palestinians recognise Israel , not as a democratic country for all its citizens , but as a " Jewish state " ?
What would we have said if South Africa�s Prime Minister , in a similar way , had demanded recognition of South Africa as a " white and democratic state " , thus de facto accepting the racist apartheid system that allowed non-whites to be classified as lesser human beings ?
In the article The end of Zionism , published in the Guardian on September the 15th 2003 the Jewish dissident and former speaker of Knesset , Avraham Burg wrote :
" Diaspora Jews for whom Israel is a central pillar of their identity must pay heed and speak out �
We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East .
There can not be democracy without equal rights for all who live here , Arab as well as Jew ...
The prime minister should present the choices forthrightly : Jewish racism or democracy . "
No support can be found in The UN recommendation concerning a Jewish and a Palestinian state for unequal rights for the citizens of each country .
Neither is there any indication as to how a " Jewish " state could become Jewish .
There is support , however , for the intention that demographic conditions should be held intact at partition .
Interpreting into the text an intention concerning characteristics of a " Jewish state " tailored to the ideology of Zionism is wholly in contradiction with the text of the resolution .
Even the Balfour Declaration , which entirely lacks human rights status , notes that the Jewish national home in Palestine should in no way encroach upon the rights of the Palestinians .
Neither did US President Truman recognise Israel as a Jewish state .
On the contrary , he ruled out precisely that formulation before making his decision to recognise Israel .
Thus , the legitimacy of a " Jewish state " so urgently sought by Israel lacks support in international documents that concern the building of the state .
Israel�s government is , of course , fully aware of this .
Why else would it keep on searching for this recognition ?
The UN should now embark on a boycott of the apartheid state of Israel and , with the threat of expulsion from the UN , demand that Israel allows the evicted Palestinian refugees to return in accordance with the UN resolutions 194 and 3236 .
With this done , meaningful peace talks can proceed and various solutions be reached for co-habitation with equal rights for all people between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan .
No such solution can be compatible with the preservation of a Jewish apartheid state .

" I had certainly hoped they were not coming here because I did n't want to make a stand .
I was in a dilemma but I felt strongly I could n't drive that bus and so I went up to my inspectors and told them there was no way I could drive it .
They said they did n't have another one , so I thought I 'd better go home .
Well well well , it looks like all the doubters are idiots , and I 'm still the biggest winner of all .
That 's right losers , I 've been working on my own show .
For years I 've been getting contacted by producers , directors , and networks from Hollywood , all with one goal in mind : to put my content on video .
The problem is , nobody could figure out how .
Until now .
Mired for years with bad advice and shitty ideas from uncreative people , I finally decided to take things into my own hands and make the show on my own , exactly the way I wanted to , with no compromise to my style or voice .
Now I know what you 're thinking ( because you email me diligently every few minutes of every hour of my life ) : why did it take so long to announce this ?
Because I 'm not stupid .
I do n't like to announce anything I 'm working on unless I 'm 100 % sure it 's going to happen .
I do n't want to be one of those assholes who brags about projects that never see the light of day ( though I love to brag , so this policy may change in the future ) .
For example , I was contacted by my publisher 2 years before my book was released .
So basically you wo n't know anything I 've worked on unless or until it 's going to happen .
Long breaks between updates means I 'm up to something awesome .
As for the video , I 'll be releasing the first episode on YouTube shortly .
I 've chosen to launch it online because it allows me more freedom to experiment , and because in a recent $ 1 billion lawsuit against YouTube , Viacom contended that most of the content people search out on YouTube is Viacom content .
Here 's the sad part : they 're probably right .
Most of the content on YouTube sucks .
It 's full of droning webcam psycho babble , shitty acoustic guitar solos , and stupid teenage girls dancing quasi-syncronously to Daft Punk songs .
By the way , enough with the shitty Daft Punk hand videos .
Every possible gimmick involving Daft Punk songs and a body part / inanimate object has been exploited , put that shit to rest .
Jesus .
Also , I 'm tired of people playing shitty songs over videogame demos ( Call of Duty & Halo losers are notorious for this ) .
If Activision or Microsoft intended for Greenday to be the soundtrack to Call of Duty , they would have used it instead of spending millions of dollars recording custom sound effects and music for these games , you cocks .
I 'm tired of seeing idiots dicking around and running YouTube into the ground , so I decided to produce a web show that 's higher quality than what you 'd normally find on the site ( no incessant buzzing or microphone hiss would be a start ) .
I will save the Internet .
You 're welcome .
Until then , you may subscribe to my channel to see updates as I post them , though they will be posted on my website simultaneously :
By the way , I do n't understand what the obsession is with people trying to get you to subscribe to their videos on YouTube .
I 'm only offering this as a tool and could n't really give less of a shit if you subscribe or not .
It 's a convenience for you , not for me .
If all these YouTube losers spent even half the time they spend making stupid animated gifs and " SUBSCRIBE " overlays for all their videos and spent that time making actual content instead , maybe their videos would n't suck so bad , and YouTube might actually become a place where people go to watch original content , not just the latest SNL and South Park clips .
That 's all for now .

Linux Mint 6.0 Felicia - Minty and sweet
Updated : January 16 , 2009
I have already reviewed Linux Mint about a year ago - and already loved it back then .
With version 6 out for grabs , I decided to see what new changes the latest version of Linux Mint brings .
Linux
Mint is based on Ubuntu , which means you 're in for rock - solid stability , an extremely friendly experience , rich and fast software repositories , and lots of support .
Most Ubuntu solutions work for Mint , too , plus it has a tremendous User Guide , almost as good as my own tutorials .
Linux
Mint also promises support for popular multimedia codecs out of the box , which should definitely appeal to Windows users mulling Linux .
Introduction
Definitely whets the appetite ...
But hey , why not use Ubuntu ?
you might say .
Well , no reason .
You can use anything you want .
Linux Mint is another superb choice for Linux users .
While it shares a lot with Ubuntu , it has its own unique features , which makes it an excellent candidate of becoming your favorite desktop distro .
Join me for a ride with Linux Mint Felicia .
Let 's see what this Irish pixie can offer you .
Ah ...
If you can't hold your horses and really must know , well we 're going to do all of the following : Check Compiz on both Nvidia and ATI cards on two different laptops , Wireless , Skype , Web camera , and multimedia support .
Next , we 'll install Mint .
And then , we 'll review Gnome Do , Giver , APTonCD , and other useful features and applications .
So come on , follow me !
Live CD impressions - Impressive !
Linux Mint 6.0 Felicia loved my hardware .
I tested it on T42 and T61 laptops , the former with an ATI graphic card and the latter with an Nvidia graphic card and an integrated web camera .
The live CD boots rather quickly into the live session .
Felicia has a classic
Gnome desktop , with soft , calm green and blue colors .
It 's not spectacular or eye - catching .
It oozes with serenity and simplicity .
Until you power up the bells and whistles and shamrocks , that is !
T42 results
Linux Mint detected the Wireless networks and connected to both my WPA2 - enabled routers without a hitch .
After that , it was the Compiz test .
After changing the Appearance to Custom , Linux Mint informed me that it has to download restricted drivers .
After a few moments , the drivers were installed and in use , allowing me to play with 3D shenanigans ( sounds Irish , do n't it ) .
And it worked flawlessly !
T61 results
For a strange reason , Linux Mint did not detect my Wireless adapter , although Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex did .
However , Compiz and the web camera worked great .
I downloaded Skype and installed it while still booted in the live session .
This worked well .
If you happen to recall my Web camera support article , three distros did support this camera device in the last round of testing , including Ubuntu 8.10 and gOS 3 , which is another Ubuntu based distro .
The third contestant was Fedora 10 Cambridge .
What made the three stand out was the fact they were all recently released .
And now , we have Linux Mint 6.0 , also recently released and - Voila ! - it has webcam support .
As I 've written then , the Linux is becoming more and more oriented toward multimedia and gadgetry .
Felicia is a testimony to that .
Compiz purred most nicely too .
Multimedia support
Here too , Linux Mint 6.0 performed quite well .
MP3 and Flash worked flawlessly .
However , there was a sound issue with my Windows - made moron video .
You may notice that I did a Youtube search for Wild Cats for Kilkenny , which is an appropriate music score considering the distro origins .
But I had to " settle " for the finest musical piece ever , the Crockett 's Theme .
But since both were used in Miami Vice , it made it the right choice .
The nefarious Windows video :
Overall , the impression was almost perfect .
Except for the sound stutter in the Windows video and no Wireless on T61 , it could have been a total 100 % score .
But even so , Felicia proved to be " go hálainn " - that would be beautiful in Irish ( thanks Meghan ! ) .
The Windows video problems can be solved by using VLC .
And I believe the driver issue can be solved by manually tweaking .
Nevertheless , I will be waiting for the next release to see if this problem gets resolved .
Installation
If you 've seen one Ubuntu - based install , you 've seen them all .
A handful of clicks , 15 minutes and Bob 's your uncle .
The standard partitions layout :
And after a few minutes , you 'll be happily booting Linux Mint :
BTW , if you do feel a need to learn more about how to install Ubuntu - based distros , then you may want to read a few of my other articles :
Installing ( K) ubuntu Linux - Full tutorial
Installing Linux Mint -
Full tutorial - this one also explains how to compile , add programs to the session startup , install VMware Tools , and several more useful tricks .
Useful stuff
Linux
Mint has a few perky items that you wo n't find in other distros .
These are elements that set it apart from other similar distros .
Gnome Do
This handy application is a sophisticated Alt + F2 search you normally find in distros .
But instead of just looking for commands , which , frankly , you need to sort of know to be able to find , you can use generic terms and tool tip strings to try to locate your applications .
Firewall
Linux Mint 6.0 comes with a very friendly frontend ( GUI ) for the iptables firewall , called Gufw .
It allows users to quite easily control and monitor their traffic .
Giver
This program allows you to share files with other users on your network .
It 's kind of an Instant Messaging program , only used for the exchanging of files rather than idle chitchat .
mintUpdate
Felicia has a very friendly update system .
mintUpdate allows you to configure your updates in a rather unique fashion .
For one thing , it displays updates with a severity level , telling you of the potential impact a particular patch might have on your system .
Furthermore , it allows you to specify a proxy specifically for the updater , helping you resolve difficult networking setups .
Here we have updates ready for the installation :
Nautilus Actions
This is another useful function .
It allows you to define what actions you can run from inside the Nautilus file manager .
For Windows users , think of it as an interactive context menu .
APTonCD
This feature allows you to create an installation CD with cached packages and additional downloads .
You can then use the CD on systems with slow Internet or no Internet connection at all to help resolve problems or keep them up to date .
Conclusion
Linux Mint 6.0 Felicia is a fabulous distro .
It 's complete , well - polished , fast , simple , rich in features , and offering solid hardware support .
It worked well with both my Nvidia and ATI cards and even loved my web camera .
There were some small issues with a Wireless drivers and some mundane Windows media formats , but other than that , the performance was spotless .
Compiz , MP3 , Flash , even Skype worked out of the box .
Reading and writing to NTFS drives was a breeze .
The distro was beautiful and stable .
The installation was simple .
Superb .
Felicia is a great choice for everyone , be they Windows users of all persuasions , new Linux users or even veterans .
It has something for everyone .
Combined with the healthy Ubuntu community that sort of shadows Linux Mint as a sort of an unofficial chaperon , a well written User Guide , and the now standard friendliness of Ubuntu - based distros , you 're in for a great , minty treat .
I hope you enjoyed this review .
See you around .
Cheers .
Hyperion´s miniature nuclear modules could be easily transported and buried underground , with the ability to power up to 20,000 homes .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Underground nuclear power plants no bigger than a hot tub may soon provide electricity for communities around the world .
Measuring about 1.5 meters across , the mini reactors can each power about 20,000 homes .
( Please see below for an update )
The small energy modules were originally designed by Otis " Pete " Peterson and other scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
Now , the technology is being commercially developed by Hyperion Power Generation , which recently announced that it has taken its first orders and plans to start mass production within five years .
" Our goal is to generate electricity for 10 cents a watt anywhere in the world , " said John Deal , CEO of Hyperion .
" [ The nuclear plants ] will cost approximately $ 25 million each .
For a community with 10,000 households , that is a very affordable $ 2,500 per home . "
Because of their small size , the mini power plants can be assembled relatively quickly and transported by truck , rail or ship to remote locations , even places that currently do not have electricity .
The power plants provide an alternative to current nuclear plants , which are large , expensive , and take about 10 years to build .
Also , large - scale power plants don´t fit the needs of small populations or areas without available land .
Hyperion´s modules can be connected together to provide energy for larger populations , as well .
In addition , the Hyperion modules have no moving parts to wear down , and never need to be opened on site .
Even if opened , the small amount of enclosed fuel would immediately cool , alleviating safety concerns .
" It is impossible for the module to go supercritical , ´melt down , ´ or create any type of emergency situation , " the company states on its Web site .
Because the Hyperion plants would be buried underground and guarded by a security detail , the company explains that they´ll be out of sight and safe from illegitimate uses .
Further , the material inside wouldn´t be appropriate for proliferation purposes .
" You would need nation - state resources in order to enrich our uranium , " Deal said .
" Temperature - wise it´s too hot to handle .
It would be like stealing a barbecue with your bare hands . "
The reactors need to be refueled about every seven to ten years .
After five years of generating power , Hyperion says that the module produces a total waste of about the size of a softball , which could be a candidate for fuel recycling .
Hyperion now has more than 100 orders for its modules , mostly from the oil and electricity industries .
The first order came from a Czech infrastructure company called TES , which specializes in water plants and power plants .
TES ordered six modules and optioned another 12 , with the first planned to be located in Romania .
Hyperion plans to build three manufacturing plants , with the goal of producing 4,000 mini nuclear modules between 2013 and 2023 .
Next year , the company will submit an application to build the modules to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
While acknowledging that the commercial development of mini nuclear plants is a lofty goal , Hyperion believes that the potential benefits of the technology make the effort well worthwhile .
Along with bringing electricity to remote locations , the Hyperion modules could also be used to provide clean water for the 25 % of the world´s population that currently does not have access to clean water .
The modules can provide power to pump , clean , and process water , which in turn can help decrease disease , poverty , and social unrest .
Update ( November 12 , 2008 ) : The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) contacted PhysOrg.com to state that the NRC has no plans to review the Hyperion design in the near future , although the NRC and Hyperion have had preliminary talks .
Because the Hyperion design is unique , the NRC expects that it will take significant time to ensure safety requirements .
In a response to a letter from October 2008 , the NRC stated :
“ Hyperion Power Generation is in the early stages of development of this design , and very little testing information is available for this design concept .
Hyperion Power Generation has indicated that it will submit technical reports to support a pre-application review in late FY 2009 .
The NRC cannot engage in any meaningful , formal technical interaction with the potential applicant until we receive those reports .
Because of the very limited amount of test data and lack of operating experience available for a uranium hydride reactor , the NRC staff anticipates that a licensing review would involve significant technical , safety , and licensing policy issues . ”

Goodbye , jets : Ford CEO will make trip to D.C. in a car
Forget the corporate jets .
When the Big Three automakers come back to Washington for hearings later this week on the proposed auto bailout , Ford CEO Alan Mulally will be making the more than eight - hour trip from Detroit to the Capitol by car , the company said today .
The company wo n’t say yet , however , what kind of car Mulally will take ( a Ford F - 150 pickup truck or a Ford Focus compact car ? ) , whether he will be behind the wheel , or when he will arrive : “ It depends on traffic , ” says a spokesperson .
The other automakers , General Motors and Chrysler , have n’t yet said what the plans are for their top executives , but Ford ’s announcement will make it nearly impossible for them to fly to Washington without facing blistering criticism .
A General Motors official said GM CEO Rick Wagoner will definitely not be using the company ’s airplane , but did not offer an alternative transportation plan , whether commercial jet , train , or car .
The Big Three face Senate hearings Thursday and House hearings on Friday to discuss the details of their plans for the bailout money , which all three companies are expected to release tomorrow .
When they testified on Capitol Hill last month , the executives were widely ridiculed for flying three separate corporate jets to Washington even as they were begging for a $ 25 billion bailout from taxpayers .

Bryce Fitzpatrick was working at the Cheesecake Factory at Chandler Fashion Center when he was promoted from server to food expeditor , a step toward management .
One day , while he was inside the produce walk - in to hunt down watercress , the door suddenly swung open .
" About 10 - plus cooks and dishwashers shut the lights out , " Fitzpatrick recalls .
" A guy grabbed me from behind and made me put my butt on top of his genitals . "
One cook grabbed Fitzpatrick 's right leg and held it up in the air .
Another held his left leg .
Two other men grabbed Fitzpatrick 's arms .
" A cook would stand in the middle and rub his genitals into my genitals , " Fitzpatrick said .
During his tenure at the restaurant , he suffered the attacks more than 20 times , he said .
In interviews with The Arizona Republic , two other former employees of the restaurant chain described being similarly grabbed and held down by co-workers while men simulated sex with them .
A fourth worker , a manager , told The Republic of seeing firsthand one of the attacks and threatening to fire the offending workers .
Now lawyers are involved .
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit in July against the Cheesecake Factory alleging sexual harassment , a violation of federal law .
After Cheesecake Factory answers the lawsuit in court , depositions will begin .
A trial could be two to three years away , said Katherine Kruse , an EEOC attorney .
Much civil litigation settles before it goes to trial , she noted .
In a statement , the Cheesecake Factory said it is inappropriate to discuss matters in litigation and , to preserve workers ' privacy , the company does not discuss individual employees .
" However , we take all employee harassment claims seriously , " the company said .
It said employees with concerns or complaints have several options , including calling an anonymous hotline .
Fitzpatrick said he was not aware of the hotline .
The former workers say they felt humiliated and intimidated by the " assaults ; " one of them , Michael Wilson , equated the experience to " dry raping . "
" Bryce ( Fitzpatrick ) referred to it as simulating rape .
I refer to it as sexual assault , " said Phoenix lawyer Jonathan Dessaules , whom Fitzpatrick sought out after an October 2006 incident .
Fitzpatrick also filed a report with Chandler police in fall 2006 , but no charges were pursued in part because , the detective in the case noted , the allegations could not be corroborated to " rise to the level of a criminal sexual offense . "
Employees whom police interviewed described the incidents as " dogpile , initiation , joke , kitchen games , hazing , manhandling , horseplay and normal joking activity among Hispanic cooks . "
Hazing of a sexual nature is not uncommon .
Dr. Susan Lipkins , a psychologist from Long Island , N.Y. , and an expert in conflict and violence , describes " sexualized hazing , " including sodomy , as a national phenomenon .
But it 's more commonly found among high school and college athletics or in fraternal organizations such as the military or law enforcement .
In one of the more recent hazing scandals , a Black firefighter with the Los Angeles Fire Department sued the city for discrimination and described a dinner at the firehouse in which dog food was mixed into his meal .
The brouhaha led to the resignation of the fire chief in late 2006 .
( A local radio station later revealed that the firefighter had participated in hazing pranks himself . )
Fitzpatrick , 23 , said the practice of sexually charged hazing at the Cheesecake Factory in Chandler was widespread and that supervisors knew about the group assaults but did nothing to stop them .
One manager walked in on one of the incidents but just laughed and walked out , Fitzpatrick alleges .
When he asked the manager why he did nothing , the manager reportedly replied he did n't want to become a victim himself , Fitzpatrick said .
The fear was not exaggerated , several of the four former workers say .
Wilson , 33 , who worked his way up from a server at Cheesecake Factory to become the front - of - the - house manager , recalls being asked by one of the cooks to go into the walk - in cooler for some herbs .
" All of a sudden the light turned out and it startled me , " Wilson said .
" I turned around , and altogether there were seven or eight men . "
Wilson said several men held him down , and others began pressing and rubbing their genitals against his .
They were screaming obscenities in Spanish that Wilson said he could n't understand , and they were whispering things in his ears .
" They would take turns dry raping me .
I was on my back being held down , " he said .
" Once they were all finished taking turns on me , they threw a bunch of lettuce on me , and a bunch of herbs . "
Wilson said he was scared , intimidated , humiliated and traumatized .
He felt violated .
He quit his job in July 2007 .
Tim McIntosh , who was the executive kitchen manager at Chandler 's Cheesecake Factory , blew the whistle to top management after he caught some of the workers in the act of holding down and " dry humping " Fitzpatrick .
" I said , ' You guys need to stop this , and if I ever catch you doing this , you guys will be terminated on the spot , ' " McIntosh said .
When another restaurant manager alerted McIntosh later on that another hazing incident against Fitzpatrick had occurred , McIntosh said he had had enough .
" I said , ' Those guys are gone . ' "
He said he called the district manager of kitchen operations , who arrived and sent the employees home .
Yet , " On Monday , ( the district manager ) brought them in one by one and talked to them , " McIntosh said .
" Why did he have to bring them back in ?
Bottom line , they did it . "
Fitzpatrick said he got fed up and contacted Dessaules after an incident on Oct. 1 , 2006 , when a group of dishwashers , cooks and food preparers allegedly pinned him in a reclining chair , stuck their fingers in his mouth while calling him sexually derogatory names and left scratch marks across his neck - all of which , he said , was witnessed by the eatery 's general manager , who he said did nothing but chuckled .
Fitzpatrick , who no longer works in the food industry , said he stayed and suffered at the Cheesecake Factory because he was pursuing a job in management .
" I felt it was their responsibility to protect me as an employee , " he said .
" I did n't feel it was my responsibility to leave a job , find another job , not get a paycheck for a couple of weeks . "
Fitzpatrick said he has been in therapy for a year and has been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Albert Miller , 23 , worked as a server at the Cheesecake Factory in Chandler from October 2004 until February 2007 .
He described being grabbed , held and assaulted in the way Fitzpatrick says he was .
" They were laughing and screaming obscenities in Spanish and English , " said Miller , who added that people who hear about the alleged assaults jump to erroneous conclusions .
" I 've been hearing comments that people think we 're homosexual , but we 're not .
All the victims are heterosexual . "
Dessaules said the cooks are heterosexual , as well .
But " this case is not about sexual orientation .
...
This case is about sexual assault , " he said .
It is the first time otter tracks have been found in the Farne Islands
An otter has survived a " perilous " three - mile sea crossing to the Farne Islands for the first time , the National Trust has said .
The animal , more commonly found in rivers , has swum from the coast of Northumberland despite rough seas .
Head warden David Steel said he was stunned to find 60 yards of otter tracks on Brownsman Island , which is famed for its bird colonies .
The mammal has not yet been sighted , but it is thought to be still there .
Agitated behaviour by the island 's gulls and puffins suggest the new predator has settled in .
Force nine gales
While otters in Scotland do live in coastal areas , Mr Steel said it was " a rare event " to see them by the sea in England .
For one to reach an island three miles offshore was , he said , " incredible " .
It might be a lonely animal , but it will hopefully survive
David Steel
Head warden , Farne Islands
" It is staggering that an otter could survive the perilous journey out to the Farne Islands , especially Brownsman , which is a long way from the mainland , " he said .
" We almost had to rub our eyes with disbelief when we discovered the tracks , " he told the BBC .
" We 've recently had force nine gales and it can be tricky to reach the islands even on a relatively calm day , which makes this otter 's journey a little bit special . "
Mr Steel said the otter may be a young animal , fresh from leaving the family fold and seeking its own territory .
" It might be a lonely animal , but it will hopefully survive , " he said .
" There 'll certainly be plenty of food , plenty of crustaceans and fish to feed upon , but unfortunately , unless another animal swims out here , it might have a lonely existence .
Otters numbers suffered a huge decline in the 1950s and 1960s " But there 's no reason why we can't get a second or third animal .
They are obviously exploring this area so , who knows , maybe in the future might have a small breeding population . "
The only worry , Mr Steel said , was about the impact the otter might have on nesting birds next summer .
" Unfortunately , otters are carnivores .
They will feast upon bird eggs and small chicks so at that moment it may be a slight concern . "
In the late 1950s and early 60s , otters underwent a sudden and catastrophic decline throughout much of Britain and Europe , probably due to the combined effects of pollution and habitat destruction .

India and Russia have traditionally enjoyed good relations
Visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has signed a key deal to build four nuclear power plants in India .
President Medvedev signed the accord in the Indian capital , Delhi , with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
The deal follows the landmark civilian nuclear accord between India and United States earlier this year .
In September , the Nuclear Suppliers Group lifted a ban that had stopped India from getting access to the global nuclear market .
The Russian agreement is part of a series of deals , including ones on space and defence sales .
Third country
Russia will now build four nuclear energy reactors at Kudankulam in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu .
Russia is already building two other reactors at the Kudankulam site .
Russia becomes the third country to sign a nuclear deal with India after the signing of the India - US agreement which allows India access to civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
France has also signed a co-operation pact with Delhi .
Moscow and Delhi also signed a deal under which Russia will assist India in its space programme , including sending Indian astronauts into space .
And India will buy 80 military helicopters from Russia , cementing a relationship that dates back to the Cold War .
President Medvedev also pledged to support India 's fight against terrorism following last week 's Mumbai attacks .
The Russian president is on a three - day visit .
On his arrival in Delhi , he was welcomed with a full military salute at the presidential palace .
Later , he visited the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi , the father of the Indian nation .
India and Russia have been traditional allies and around 70 % of India 's military hardware comes from Russia .

Brannon Howse interviewed John Loeffler about his article on ChristianWorldviewNetwork.com on why SWAT police , armed for riot control weapons , packing automatic rifles and armored for a terrorist response stormed a family food cooperative in Ohio .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Agents from the State of Ohio Department of Agriculture with the S.W.A.T. team did not give any explanation to the family other than a warrant , did not provide them a phone call , did not charge the family with anything as they burst into their private home .
But what they did do was make a big mess , taking over ten thousand dollars of merchandise with them , reported the IVN Bureau Chief .
Have we entered a new era of police brutality at the hands of our own government ?
John said , “ They kept guns trained on the parents , the kids , toddlers , from about 11 in the morning until eight in the afternoon . ”
Is this what we expect now from our government ?

Al Franken ’s campaign attorney Marc Elias said today that , based on its latest internal tally , Franken has taken the lead over Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) for the first time in the recount process .
In a conference call , Elias said Franken leads Coleman by 22 votes at the end of last night ’s count .
“ We are ahead by 22 votes at the close of business at the end of last night , ” Elias said .
“ We continue to believe we will gain votes during the challenge and review process , and feel good generally where we stand in the recount . ”
The official secretary of state count shows Coleman leading by Franken by 303 votes , with more than 6,000 ballots disputed by both camps .
The Franken campaign has argued the number is misleading , given that none of the disputed ballots are included in that tally .
The Franken tally assumes the challenges from both camps are invalid .
About 94 percent of the 2.9 million ballots have been recounted so far .
Franken 's camp was greatly aided when Ramsey County officials found 171 ballots that went uncounted Election Night .
That netted Franken 37 votes , and is currently larger than his current lead , according to Franken 's count .
Elias also said the campaign will be withdrawing certain challenges to ballots “ where appropriate ” to expedite the process of sorting the disputed ballots , which will begin Dec. 16 .
Coleman campaign manager Cullen Sheehan disputed the Franken numbers , and accused the Franken campaign of being " prepared to say and do anything to win an election that they lost on Election Night . "
" Today , they ’ve invented a story of a lead in the recount , " said Sheehan .
" We have confidence that on Friday the results of the recount will show Norm Coleman has emerged , again , as the winner of the 2008 United States Senate election . ”

CHICAGO  Defying Senate leaders in Washington and a galaxy of political leaders here , Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois announced Tuesday that he would fill the Senate seat of President - elect Barack Obama , which he has been accused of trying to sell .
Mr. Blagojevich said he would appoint Roland W. Burris , a former state attorney general who was the first African - American elected to statewide office in Illinois .
The decision set off efforts to block the move by state legislators , the secretary of state , and , most significantly , Democratic leaders in the United States Senate who said they would not seat anyone Mr. Blagojevich chose .
Still , even as the selection was clearly destined for battles on many fronts , Mr. Blagojevich sounded breezily confident as he introduced his appointee to reporters as the “ next United States senator from Illinois . ”
Having been charged this month with conspiracy to commit fraud and bribery , he said the accusations against him should not taint Mr. Burris , whom he called “ a good and honest man . ”
Standing beside him , Mr. Burris , who , at 71 , is seen by many here as an elder statesman in Democratic politics , seemed to brush aside gaping questions about how federal criminal charges against Mr. Blagojevich might tarnish his potential Senate tenure  and whether he would really ever make it to the Senate chamber in the first place .

Specification
The POD files of the specification have moved into the Pugs svn repository , which formerly only held the draft specs .
You can now find them all in http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec.
The main reason was the wish to encourage contributions to the specs .
It worked promptly : Daniel Ruoso and Tim Nelson checked in their first draft of Synopsis 7 : Iterators and Laziness .
It 's based on Ruoso 's notes on the lazy map function in SMOP and IRC discussions with Larry and others .
Jerry " particle " Gay recived a grant for working on S19 , the specification of the Perl 6 command line interface , and started working on it .
Implementations
Rakudo
After long struggling , Patrick Michaud re-designed and re-implemented lexical variables in Parrot , fixing lots of bugs that were really annoying in real world application .
( The test suite did n't contain that many instances that triggered lexical bugs - this shows again how important real - world apps are for testing .
There was other progress as well , much of which was geared towards enabling a prelude written in Perl 6 : is also trait on classes ( which allows to extend existing classes ) , inline PIR ( not strictly a Perl 6 feature , but hopefully very useful ) , basic support for protos and countless small fixes that make live easier for Perl 6 developers .
SMOP
SMOP also made progress , which is described here better than I could with my own words .
Elf
Mitchell Charity updated the Elf homepage and continued his work on bootrapping Elf on Common Lisp .

Hinrik Örn Sigurðsson put notable effort in the Perl 6 syntax hilighting file for vim , the world 's best text editor .
During his work he discovered that parsing Perl 6 is non-trivial .
This week 's positive surprise was that Justin Simoni offered to contribute some art work to the Perl community , and I promptly recruited him for creating a Logo for Rakudo .
I 'm really excited , and want to thank him , and also chromatic for calling people to action .

Ed Rollins slaps
Bush pretty hard for the damage he 's already done to our economy .
BLITZER : David Gergen , did President Bush do the right thing by bailing out Chrysler and GM ?
GERGEN : Yes .
He had backed himself into a corner and had to act and I think Dick Cheney put it well when he said had Bush had not done this , he would have been remembered as the Herbert Hoover of his era .
And it was unfortunate they had to come to this thing .
But the real point is here , he 's not only been forced to do that , but he has punted this to Barack Obama .
Obama now faces a ton of huge decisions in the first 90 days of his presidency .
BLITZER : There 's no doubt , James , that he did punt in effect because by March 31st , if it does n't look like it 's working out , it is all going to be up to the president - elect and the new Congress to decide what to do .
CARVILLE : They 're going to run out of money before March 31st .
And right now , auto sales , everybody , does n't matter , not just American carmakers , Japanese or European carmakers also are down 35 , 40 percent .
I do n't think anybody thinks that is going to change between now and March and David is right , they have the ball and they 're going to have to figure out what to do with this and it's going to be quick , very quick .
BLITZER : So Ed Rollins , the $ 14 or $ 17 billion in this initial bridge loan as it's called , that could escalate .
That could go up to a lot more money given the overall state of the economy and the low demand for new cars right now .
ROLLINS : I think there 's no question if you 're going to try to save this industry , which is an industry in real problems , you are going to have a lot more money that is going to be thrown at him .
I think that 's a lot of the objections of the Republicans .
Disclaimer :
The strlen function rarely lies on the critical path of the program , and if it is , you should store the string length in an integer variable ( Pascal - style strings ) .
This article should be viewed as an exercise in code optimization , not as a recommendation for everyday programming .
Vectorized strlen
A usual implementation of strlen function scans the string byte - by - byte looking for terminating zero .
For example :
size_t strlen ( const char * s ) { const char * start = s ; while ( *s ) s++ ; return s - start ; }
It 's small and easy , but not very fast .
That is how we can improve it :
// for x86 only size_t my_strlen ( const char * s ) { size_t len = 0 ; for ( ; ; ) { unsigned x = *( unsigned * ) s ; if ( ( x & 0xFF ) == 0 ) return len ; if ( ( x & 0xFF00 ) == 0 ) return len + 1 ; if ( ( x & 0x FF0000 ) == 0 ) return len + 2 ; if ( ( x & 0xFF000000 ) == 0 ) return len + 3 ; s += 4 , len += 4 ; } }
Four bytes are examined at once .
The program reads a double word from memory , extracts each of its bytes by ANDing with a mask , and compares the bytes with zero .
That is what Agner Fog calls " vector operations in general purpose registers " .
Problems and solutions
Warning : this function will crash if an non-readable memory page is located right after the end of the string .
The simplest way to prevent this is to allocate 3 additional bytes at the end of string .
The dwords may be unaligned , but x86 architecture allows access to unaligned data .
For small strings , the alignment will take more time than the penalty of unaligned reads .
The code is not portable : you will have to add another 4 conditions if you use a 64 - bit processor .
For big-endian architectures , the order of conditions should be reversed .
Agner Fog made another strlen function for his tutorials ( file optimizing_assembly.pdf , chapter 13.5 ) .
The idea is the same , but he uses clever math tricks to avoid branches inside the loop .
Test conditions and results
The functions were tested on several short strings ( words in Gettysburg address ) and on a long string ( Lewis Carroll 's Jabberwocky ) .
The RDTSC instruction was used for measurements .
Function Short strings
The long string strlen by Microsoft 1471 2104 strlen_my 1019 1471 strlen by Agner Fog 1279 1056
Agner Fog 's function is faster for the long string , while strlen_my performs better on the short strings .

Top trends forecaster gives chilling prediction for next year
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , December 2 , 2008
The country ’s top trends forecaster , who accurately predicted the “ panic ” of 2008 nearly a year before it unfolded , is now ominously suggesting that next year will come to be known as “ the collapse of 2009 ” .
Gerald Celente , CEO of Trends Research Institute , sent out a letter to his subscribers announcing that he had purchased a domain name called “ Collapseof09.com ” .
Around this time last year , Celente sent the following message to his subscribers ;
In 2008 , Americans will wake up to the worst economic times that anyone alive has ever seen .
And they wo n’t know what hit them .
Just as they were in a state of shock on 9/11 , they ’ll be frozen in fear when the Economic 9/11 strikes at the heart of Wall Street .
Dismiss this trend forecast at your own peril .
If you believe everything will be all right , and that the ship of state is sailing along just fine , toss this out and go about your business .
Having correctly forecast the “ Economic 9/11 ” , Celente is warning that people should prepare for something much worse in 2009 .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
As we reported last month , Celente recently told Fox News that by 2012 America will become an undeveloped nation , that there will be a revolution marked by food riots , squatter rebellions , tax revolts and job marches , and that holidays will be more about obtaining food , not gifts .
Celente ’s accuracy is widely heralded since he correctly predicted the 1997 Asian Currency Crisis , the subprime mortgage collapse and the massive devaluation of the U.S. dollar .
In 2007 , Celente forewarned that “ giants ( would ) tumble to their deaths , ” which is exactly what we have witnessed with the collapse of Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns and others .
Celente has stated that the current financial downturn will ultimately lead to nothing less than revolution .
“ There will be a revolution in this country , ” he said .
“ It ’s not going to come yet , but it ’s going to come down the line and we ’re going to see a third party and this was the catalyst for it : the takeover of Washington , D. C. , in broad daylight by Wall Street in this bloodless coup .
And it will happen as conditions continue to worsen . ”

In a closely watched move that may be followed across Wall Street , the top executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have decided to forgo their 2008 bonuses .
In doing so , they are giving up potentially tens of millions of dollars in payouts in a year that reshaped the securities industry .
After months of internal debate at Goldman , the seven top executives at the firm , including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein , asked the board 's compensation committee to grant them no bonuses .
The board approved the request on Sunday .

Otto paid big price for football glory
Recommended Video :
As he awakes every morning , Jim Otto looks at his $ 40,000 carbon - fiber leg , decorated with the Raiders ' shield and a tiny version of his famous No. 00 jersey .
It sits near the bed , detached from its owner , waiting for him to have breakfast with his wife , Sally , and do all the little things that help him prepare for the day .
By 11 a.m. , though , they will be joined at the hip , the artificial limb and the former NFL center , and they will stay that way for 12 hours .
Wearing the prosthesis can be exhausting and extremely uncomfortable , as the connecting points grind into his pelvic area , but he made a commitment when the insurance company agreed to pay for this high - tech leg with its microprocessor knee .
He would use it regularly and try to reclaim as much of his old life as possible .
It has n't been easy , though , not even for a man who had endured 15 years of pounding in the NFL and close to 70 surgeries on his knees , shoulders , back , nose , you name it .
This summer , a surgeon pried Otto 's sternum open and worked on his heart , which had been damaged by all the infections that claimed his right leg .
" It 's doing great now , " he said , tapping his chest and smiling .
During an interview at his home in the Sierra foothills , Otto made several whimsical references to his medical nightmares , even savoring the comedy of a story about falling in his office at the Raiders headquarters and lying helplessly on the floor before someone walked in and found him .
The humor appears to be part of his survival instinct .
By all rights , he should be dead several times over .
In nine years , Otto had five life - threatening infections , which set up camp around his artificial right knee and then waged war on the rest of his body .
By July 2007 , he had to choose between his leg and his life .
The amputation , he said , led to the greatest physical pain he had ever felt .
There was no funny spin to put on this , so he did n't try .

Discussing certain elements of his health problems made Otto very somber : the fear Sally has had to cope with , the gloomy emotions that came with losing his leg and a deep concern for younger people going through various stages of what he has already endured .
After his amputation , he inquired about the treatment of soldiers who lost limbs and was relieved to learn that they receive extraordinarily heavy medication .
He does n't know what to make of the apparent increase in infections among this generation of athletes , especially the drug - resistant strains of staph .
As a player and as a businessman after football , Otto could have been a role model for any of them .
Yet he is also the quintessential cautionary tale , a reminder that every second of sports glory carries an enormous risk .
Just by looking at him , no one could imagine the excruciating pain of the last 40 years .
He walks stiffly because of the artificial leg , but he remains a strapping man with a booming voice and posture that should be the envy of other 70 - year - olds .
The infections that took over Otto 's body had the same profile - strong , stubborn , almost bigger than life .
His first encounter with septic shock occurred in 1998 , and almost a decade after he had both knees replaced - for the second time .
Otto could n't name all the types of infection and is n't sure what triggered them - an ingrown toenail , for all he knows .
But he has a pretty good idea why his body could n't fight off the bacteria .
His daughter , Jennifer , had died a year earlier at age 39 , after a blood clot appeared during a hysterectomy , sending her into cardiac arrest .
She left four children behind .
Fever and forgetting
" My doctor told me : ' When Jennifer died , you started to die , too , ' " Otto said .
The grief seemed to shut down his immune system .
His temperature hovered around 105 degrees for eight days that first time .
A lot of what happened during the subsequent infections , he can't remember .
He was too feverish .
After the third episode , the doctors recommended amputation .
Otto refused .
" That 's the easy way out , " he said .
" Let 's fight to keep my leg . "
The fourth infection appeared in 2005 .
One of Jennifer 's children was ill , and Sally flew to Colorado Springs to help .
Alone in the house , Otto could feel a fever coming on one night .
He mentioned it to Sally when she called and went out of his way to say : " I love you with all my heart . "
He had a bad feeling about what was coming .
The next morning , Sally phoned to check in .
Jim did n't answer .
She tried again .
He did n't answer .
She called Ryan Berry , a Placer County sheriff 's deputy who had befriended the family .
Jim could barely hear the phone , and the only thing he could sense vividly was the feeling of his dog Suzy , one of their three bichons frises , gently licking his eyelids , presumably trying to wake him .
Berry said when he finally reached Otto , " he was in sort of an altered state . "
A life and death moment
Berry arrived at the house and found the side door unlocked .
He carried a nearly unconscious Otto to his truck and then rushed him to the medical center at UC Davis .
" He 's a big guy , " Otto said .
" He weighs about 300 . "
In retrospect , the story sounds fascinating , half sweet , half - terrifying .
A little white fluff ball of a dog standing guard over one of the NFL 's legendary tough guys until a burly peace officer can rescue him .
In real time , though , it was terrifying , and Sally had to tend to a sickly husband yet again .
" Sally did n't deserve this , " Otto said .
He worried about what he had put her through , all the hours she had spent administering antibiotics through an IV , and the endless worry .
Last year , when the amputation became inevitable , he had a new concern .
As he was being wheeled off to surgery , he asked her : " Honey , are you going to love a guy without a leg ? "
Sally said she replied without hesitation .
" I do n't love your leg , " she said .
" I love you .
I want you to be healthy . "
He vowed that by Christmas he would walk to her and give her a hug .
Painful rehab
Agony and painkiller - induced delusion followed the surgery .
Otto learned later that when friends would call the hospital , he 'd unwittingly bestow some of his most prized possessions on them .
As far as he can remember , he tried to give away one of his cars and a precious gun .
Once , he called Berry at 4 a.m. and told the deputy that he was being held captive in a cabin .
" It was like having early Alzheimer 's , " he said .
When he finally started feeling like himself , he asked Sally : " Did I ever curse at the nurses ? "
He considered them angels and did n't want to abuse them .
His wife assured him that that had n't happened .
The doctors , though , were in for some invective .
Over the years , Otto had received devoted attention from his surgeon at the University of Utah hospital , but that doctor had retired .
Now , he was being treated by a younger physician , and when he learned that there would have to be a follow - up amputation , to take the stump down a little and relieve some of the pain , Otto let the staff know , in un-sanitized terms , that they had better get it right this time .
They did , and he finally went home to start his rehab .
The prosthetic leg was ready for him in early November , almost exactly a year ago .
He remembered his vow to Sally , and he told his physical therapist about the Christmas goal .
They beat it by a long shot .
" He was very motivated , " said Julie Gross , a physical therapist at UC Davis 's medical center .
" He was very determined to get moving quickly . "
A Thanksgiving gift
In almost no time , he progressed to using a single - point cane .
Shortly before Thanksgiving , Sally was out shopping .
When she returned , her husband was standing , waiting for her .
He walked across the room and hugged her , a whole holiday ahead of time .
The amputation , though , was never the easy way out , as he had assumed .
Even on his bad knees and with his balky back , he used to be able to stride through the hills near his house , covering five miles in less than an hour .
He can still walk , but " walking on a prosthesis consumes 65 percent more energy , " he said .
He can still fish and hunt , but not the way he did before .
The pond outside his house sits below a slope , and he can't risk it .
He has to fish from flat shores or a boat .
Occasionally , he still feels " ghost pain " in the area of his lost leg .
He reminds himself that he has to learn new ways of doing things , because he can't turn back .
He empathizes with all the young soldiers coming back home as amputees .
" Some of them have mental problems , and I can see how that can happen , " Otto said .
" There 's been times when I 've been sitting in a chair , and some of the things I 've been thinking , I probably should n't have been thinking . "
More often , he sticks to pragmatism and gratitude .
He tries to make sure that someone is with him at all times , in case he falls .
He was alone that day in the Raiders ' office when he toppled over .
" As I went down , " said the man of many orthopedic disasters , " I thought : ' Oh , this is going to be a good one . ' "
But once someone showed up and found him , he was fine .
He never really needed the job with the Raiders .
After football , he owned a walnut orchard , five successful Burger King franchises , a piece of a bank and an office building .
For a while after the team moved back to Oakland , even though he appeared to be a fixture in the seat next to owner Al Davis during games , he was n't even officially on the payroll .
But when he and Sally sold their fast - food joints , his job became more formal , which helped them hold onto vital health insurance .
He is grateful for that , and for simply being here .
" I could be under the grass , " Otto said .
" I know that , and I 'm glad I 'm above the grass . "

I am delighted to be able to say that the Wiki for mathematical problem - solving techniques is going to exist very soon , by which I mean that it should be up and running within the next couple of weeks , though possibly without some of the features that it will eventually have .
So in this post I want to say quite a bit about what it will be like and how it will differ from other mathematical websites .
First , however , I want to make very clear that the main reason I am in this happy position is that Olof Sisask and Alex Frolkin have put in a huge amount of work over the last few months developing the software for what has the potential to be a fabulous site .
I ’ll say a bit more about what they have done later , but soon you will be able to see for yourself , which will give a much better idea than any description I could give .
But in this post I want to concentrate more on what material should go on the site and how it should be organized , which is something that Alex , Olof and I have been thinking about together .
Needless to say , any comments will be read with great interest : it is probably too late for a radical rethink of the whole site , but it is definitely not too late to add features to it , and wo n’t be too late even after the launch .
Before I dive into the details , let me make a general remark .
The subject matter of this Wiki is going to be problem - solving techniques , and that leads immediately to a difficulty , namely how to find the material that ’s on the site .
The obvious method is to classify it by subject matter , but it does n’t take long to see why that is not wholly satisfactory .
There are many problem - solving techniques that are applicable in widely differing contexts , and it ’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that the usual subject - matter classification of mathematics is almost orthogonal to any classification that would be genuinely useful for this site .
( I say “ almost ” because the early stages of classification , such as the broad division in to analysis , algebra , geometry , etc. , does have at least some correlation with the area of applicability of a typical problem - solving technique .
The difficulty appears at a finer level of detail . )
Thus , a very important feature of the site is going to be the tools that help one navigate about in it .
In fact , I ’d go further than this .
Let us call the core content of the site the material such as has appeared in sample articles on this blog : that is , descriptions of techniques , examples of their use , and discussions of how to recognise when to use them .
Then the site will consist not just of the core content , but also a superstructure of navigation tools that will help you find techniques related to a mathematical problem you might have , and this superstructure will be at least as important as the core content .
Later I ’ll say more about what the navigation tools will be .
The name of the site
We thought about asking for opinions about this , but in the end we made the decision ourselves and went for “ The Tricki ” .
We thought of “ The Tricks Wiki ” but decided that the work “ trick ” gives slightly the wrong idea of what the site is about : we want articles on all mathematical techniques , regardless of whether they have a magic aspect to them .
Indeed , we want to demonstrate that many mathematical tricks are , on closer inspection , not really tricks at all but very natural things to do .
It might be thought that the name “ Tricki ” suffers from precisely the same defect , but we decided that because it sounded more like a proper name than a description , it was in fact slightly better , and it seemed a pity to give up the word altogether , especially given its fit with “ Wiki ” .
The presentation of the core content
The main content of the Tricki will be a ( large , if all goes according to plan ) body of articles about methods for solving mathematical problems .
Associated with these articles will be many qualities that will vary substantially from article to article .
For example , some will be about very general problem - solving tips such as , “ If you ca n’t solve the problem , then try to invent an easier problem that sheds light on it , ” whereas others will be much more specific tips such as , “ If you want to solve a linear differential equation , you can convert it into a polynomial equation by taking the Fourier transform . ”
Some articles will be written at a very elementary level , and some will be quite advanced ( though , obviously enough , the usefulness of an article will increase dramatically if it can be made widely accessible ) .
Some will concern particular areas of mathematics , such as algebraic geometry or probability , whereas others will concern techniques that are relevant to many different areas .
And so on .
Because clarity and accessibility are so important to the success of the Tricki , we have decided to have a recommended format for the articles .
However , we also want to be as unprescriptive as possible , so this format is very loose .
Originally we had thought of having articles divided into three parts : a brief summary of the technique in question , ideally in a highly memorable sentence or two ; a general discussion of what the technique is and the kinds of situations in which it applies ; and a collection of examples of the technique in action .
However , once we started to write sample articles we came to realize that examples and general discussion were often best mixed .
So instead we merely ask that the beginnings and ends of examples should be clearly labelled , and we recommend that there should not be too much general discussion without illustrative examples .
( In many cases , it may be best to start with examples and then move on to general discussion . )
See some of my recent blog posts for examples of articles written in this format .
See also this article by Terence Tao , and this one by Emmanuel Kowalski .
The navigation problem
As commented above , a major question we face is how to organize the articles in such a way that they can be located easily .
If you have a mathematical difficulty , and the Tricki contains an article that deals with exactly that difficulty , you will not be helped unless there is a convenient way of finding that article .
This problem is much less acute for Wikipedia because a typical Wikipedia article takes a phrase such as “ Abelian variety ” or “ The mean - value theorem ” and gives you its definition or statement .
So if you want to find out about such concepts , you just type them into Google and one of the first two or three entries is usually the most relevant Wikipedia article .
But often when one is trying to solve a mathematical problem , one does n’t know what the relevant definition or theorem is .
So even if all the Wikipedia articles gave beautifully clear and detailed explanations , one would still have the problem of finding the right ones .
A major aim for the Tricki is that it should be possible to search by the problem you face rather than by the answer to that problem .
Until the number of articles is large , it will be feasible to do this by simple means such as key - word searches and tags .
But even these may leave some articles a bit hard to find .
For example , consider my sample article on just - do - it proofs .
If you are unfamiliar with the just - do - it technique and have a problem that you find difficult but that is easy if you use the technique , then what is going to lead you to find the article that explains the technique ?
Similarly , if you are trying to build some structure and Zorn ’s lemma is what you need to make your argument work , what key words or tags are going to help you ?
It is n’t obvious .
Navigation in the Tricki
I said earlier that I do not regard the core content as primary and the navigation in the site as a mere add - on to help people find it .
That would be a bit like saying that proofs are primary and problem - solving techniques are just an add - on to help people discover them .
My own view is that if the Tricki expands as we hope it will , then a well - organized method for searching for articles about certain kinds of proof techniques would constitute a higher - level proof technique of its own .
So I do n’t want to draw too sharp a distinction between core content and navigational content .
More precisely , we envisage at the moment two kinds of navigational aid , one manually created and the other more automatic .
Let me discuss them each in turn .
First , we plan to have a collection of “ navigation pages ” on the Tricki .
These will be guides to the rest of the site , or to parts of the rest of the site , and will be a bit like annotated bibliographies .
They will also have a somewhat hierarchical organization , so near the top of the hierarchy there might be a page that says things like , “ If your problem is in linear algebra then go to the linear algebra main page here for further advice , ” and then when you get to the linear algebra page it might split further into problems about simultaneous equations , vector spaces , inner product spaces , numerical linear algebra ( which might point you to a parallel page on numerical analysis ) , and so on .
But after a couple of steps down this fairly obvious hierarchy one would start to find categorizations that were very different from subject - matter categorizations .
For instance , you might be asked , “ Are you trying to construct an example of something ? ” or “ Are you looking for an exact solution or would an estimate be good enough ? ” or “ Does it seem as though the constraints you face are tight or loose ? ”
Some of these might then lead you to techniques that applied to several different areas .
How will these navigation pages be maintained ?
Another of our priorities is to decentralize the control of the site as much as possible , so we emphatically do not want a team of editors who are constantly updating the navigation pages or deciding in advance how the entirety of mathematics should be organized .
So instead , we intend to allow people to create and edit navigational pages as well , perhaps keeping one super - index page at the very top of the hierarchy that cannot be edited directly ( but that we will change in response to suggestions ) .
This may seem like a recipe for chaos , but there are various reasons to suppose that it could work , and perhaps even work extremely well .
One is that we will have guidelines that we will strongly encourage people to stick to .
For example , if you want to write a navigation page for articles about paracompact topological spaces , then do n’t have a link to it from the main page on branches of mathematics : instead , the user of the site will be expected to follow a path such as analysis –> general topology –> properties of topological spaces –> paracompact topological spaces .
Another guideline would be that one should be much more cautious about deleting a link than about adding one .
Indeed , one should not delete a link to an article unless ( i ) it is clearly in an inappropriate place and ( ii ) you are certain that there are good paths to the article even when the link is deleted .
Another would be that if a navigation page turned into a very long list of links then these links should be categorized and a new level of the hierarchy created .
A second reason for optimism about the navigation pages arises from looking at them in a different way , which I have already discussed to some extent above .
Instead of thinking of them as completely different from the articles on mathematical techniques , one can think of them as techniques in themselves .
For example , a navigation page on constructing interesting subsets of the plane might be regarded as advocating the technique of classifying your problem and thereby finding the appropriate Tricki article .
In order to help you with the classification , the navigation page might have quite a bit of text in it .
Indeed , it might even have examples and general discussion , just like a more specific Tricki article .
It is clear that there will be several different styles of navigational article .
Soon I will have a sample article ready , which will be a navigation page , with quite a lot of text , devoted to a classification of problems in combinatorics .
( It will of course refer to all sorts of articles that do n’t yet exist .
It will also be incomplete , but I hope that others will edit and expand it when it goes up on the site . )
Automatic navigation tools
At the end of each article there will be the chance to give various bits of information about it that will help people to find it in a more conventional way .
For instance , there will be the opportunity to give key words from the article , there will be tags for branches and sub - branches ( and sub - sub - branches etc. ) of mathematics , and , most importantly but also most problematically , there will be tags for types of problems .
I discussed this last matter with Olof today , and we hope to have something along the following lines .
Suppose you write an article on a certain technique .
Then you would describe in very general terms the problem it solves , simplify the language in your description , and finally break up your simplified description into natural chunks that serve as tags .
Let me give an example to try to illustrate the sort of thing I ’m talking about .
Suppose the trick can be summarized by the slogan , “ If you want to prove that a graph exists with certain properties and the properties seem to force the edges of the graph to be very evenly distributed around the graph , then try taking a random graph . ”
What problem does this solve ?
Something like this :
To show : there exists –> a graph –> such that –> certain properties hold ?
The first three elements of this can be thought of as hierarchically organized tags that could appear in many other contexts .
The last one is more of a problem , because it is n’t easy to use a tag to explain what kinds of properties are more likely to be obtainable by the probabilistic method .
But just the tags
To show : there exists –> a graph –> such that –> **********
narrows down the problem significantly .
( However , it is not necessarily the optimal choice : one might be better off replacing “ a graph ” by something more general such as “ a combinatorial structure ” . )
Designing a good system of such tags is clearly a challenging problem , but again we hope that this will be a collective effort .
We may well not have these type - of - problem tags up and running when the site is launched .
When we do introduce them , we hope to have a good and useful collection of them ready , but we will invite suggestions for other tags to add .
Human - computer interaction
Several years ago , I wrote this essay , in the first part of which I explained why I thought that automatic theorem proving was a less distant goal than many others take it to be .
On the way , I talked about how computers might work in an interactive way with human mathematicians , making the point that there were no serious theoretical obstacles to having genuinely useful help from computers ( unlike with fully automatic theorem proving , which is significantly harder ) .
The main obstacle , I claimed then and will rejustify here , was merely the work needed to put together a semi- intelligent database , work that would need to be a collective effort of many people .
What I absolutely did not foresee was the rise of the Wiki , which suddenly makes it feasible to develop a database of almost exactly the kind that I was talking about .
The realization that this was the case arose out of the discussions about the navigation problem .
I now think that the organization of the Tricki has the potential to lead to a resource that will be able to do what such an interactive program would have been able to do , even if the way it does it is not quite the same .
In that article I wrote an imaginary conversation between a human and a computer .
My claim was that such a conversation should be feasible even with present - day technology .
Here is another imaginary conversation of a similar kind .
Computer :
What is your problem ?
Human : I want to know how big a subset of I can choose if no element is allowed to be twice as big as another element .
Computer :
What general kind of problem is that ?
Human : I wish to maximize the size of a set of integers , subject to certain constraints .
Computer :
What general area of mathematics would you say that belongs to ?
Human : Combinatorics .
Computer : And subarea , if appropriate ?
Human : Extremal combinatorics .
Computer :
Do there seem to be many constraints or few ?
Human : I do n’t really know .
Computer :
Well think about it .
If you choose an element to belong to your set , does that have many repercussions for the rest of the set ?
Human : I suppose it does n’t : if belongs to the set , then all that tells you is that does not belong to the set .
Computer :
Have you thought of using a greedy algorithm ?
Human :
What ’s that ?
Computer :
You ’re building up a set and you just keep on adding the first element you can , by some definition of “ first ” .
Human :
Ah , let me have a try .
The obvious definition of “ first ” is “ minimal ” .
Yes , that gives a pretty good example : it works out to be all numbers that can be written as with even .
And it ’s actually not that hard to prove that this is the best possible example .
Here is how an equivalent “ conversation ” could take place if one had a Tricki equipped with a good series of navigation pages .
This time the computer is more passive , because the questions have so to speak been supplied to it in advance .
First one goes to the global navigation page and chooses Combinatorics as the main area , followed by Extremal Combinatorics as the subarea .
( The navigation page for combinatorics would not be just a list of subareas but a list with descriptions of the subareas and what typical problems in those subareas are like .
Or it might have a bare list for the experienced user and an annotated list for the novice . )
Then on the extremal combinatorics page there would be questions like “ Are there many constraints ? ”
“ Do you believe that the extremal example is unique up to simple symmetries ? ” and “ What general kind of object are you trying to construct ? ” ( which might be a graph , or a system of sets , or a set of integers , etc. ) .
If you clicked on “ few constraints ” then you would be led to a general discussion about maximizing sizes of substructures subject to few constraints .
One of the techniques mentioned there would be greedy algorithms , which would have a link to a discussion , with examples , of solving problems using greedy algorithms .
And at that point the Tricki would have done the same job as the one done by the hypothetical conversing computer above .
Alternatively , if there was a good system of tags in place and you did n’t need quite so much help , you could do things more quickly via the tags .
On the one hand you could follow subject - matter tags as far as extremal combinatorics , and on the other you could follow problem - type tags as far as something like
maximize –> cardinality of –> subset of –> –> subject to –> loose constraints .
The Tricki as a collective mathematical brain .
The remarks in this section are thoughts that greatly interest me , but you may want to take them with a pinch of salt : the usefulness of the Tricki will not depend on my being right .
It is an incontestable fact that experience in solving problems in mathematics , or in a branch of mathematics , makes you better at solving other problems .
But what , precisely , is the benefit of this experience ?
Some of the benefit is psychological : if you have successfully solved some problems then you will be less likely to be discouraged if you find a new one difficult , you will be better able to judge when your approaches are getting somewhere , and so on .
But a more direct benefit of experience is that it gives you a bigger repertoire of approaches to try and a better ability to recognise approaches that are unlikely to work : in this way it considerably speeds up the process of doing research , and makes much of that process automatic when for a less experienced mathematician it would require hard thought .
This repertoire of approaches is stored in many different ways .
Some research wisdom comes in the form of tips that have forms such as these : if you find yourself with a problem of type X , then method Y is likely to be useful ; problems of type X ’ are known to be hard ; problems of type X ” can not be solved by method Z because if they could then we would also be able to prove W , which is known to be false .
Some is a little vaguer , but still extremely useful : I ca n’t remember how to prove this , but I know where to look it up ; problems of type X were discussed in a seminar I once went to so I think people know how to solve them .
We would like the Tricki to imitate the brain of a human mathematician in the following ways .
1 . In its core articles it will store problem - solving expertise of the kind just discussed .
This means that as well as articles that deal directly with how to solve mathematical problems of various kinds , there will also be articles that help you discover whether your problem is of a known kind and , if it is , that guide you to appropriate places in the literature .
( If this “ literature ” is available online , then so much the better . )
Another kind of article that could well be useful would be one that explained why certain approaches do not work for certain problems : perhaps because they lead to difficulties that nobody knows how to deal with , or perhaps because there are counterexamples .
2 . It will be very interlinked , and will contain “ triggers ” ( in the form of navigation pages ) that will cause the user to think of trying various methods .
3 . It will be highly modular , with modules organized in a somewhat hierarchical way .
In particular , once there is a lot of core content , there will also start to be a lot of secondary content that helps you find the right part of the core content , tertiary content that leads you to the secondary content , and so on .
4 . The same bit of information may well be repeated in many articles , so there will be a certain amount of robustness and redundancy .
5 . Use of the Tricki will be rather like applying an algorithm that is not fully deterministic .
( A fully deterministic algorithm would tell you exactly which route to take in order to arrive at the right bit of core content .
But there will be many routes and many ways of describing a problem , and the user will have to make decisions along the way . )
6 . The Tricki will learn from experience .
By that I mean that if you use the Tricki and find that it does n’t help you in the way you wanted even though the answer to your problem was in fact known , then you will be strongly encouraged to modify the Tricki ( by writing or improving a core article , or by modifying the navigation pages ) so that the next person with your problem will have better luck .
At a later stage of development , we might consider something more ambitious , such as measuring how often various links are used successfully and reinforcing the good ones , which would be reminiscent of the way that pathways in the brain are reinforced by means of neurons changing their likelihood of firing .
How to arrive at a major mathematical resource , starting from zero .
If the Tricki succeeds in its aims , it will be a time - saving device for research mathematicians of an importance at least as great as that of TeX , or Sloan ’s database of sequences , or MathSciNet , or the ArXiV .
But it will not reach this stage without a huge amount of effort : we hope that enough people will get involved that no one individual has to put in too much of this effort .
In the initial stages , we would like the site to grow as rapidly as possible , even if this is at the expense of quality .
The idea is that we should arrive quite quickly at a sort of skeleton of the site , on to which people could add the flesh and blood later .
Thus , the navigation pages will be important not just for navigation , but also for shaping the site as it grows .
So one thing that you can do that would be very useful indeed is this .
If you feel that you have a complete enough perspective on some class of problems to be able to classify it into a good set of subclasses , then write a navigation page for the class that does just that , even if the links you put in your page are to articles that do not exist .
An example of such a page will be ready soon .
If others are convinced by your organization of the given class of problems , then they may well be inspired to write the articles that you have suggested ought to exist .
An implication of this is that if you have an idea for a core article , then before constructing a navigation path to your article , you should first check whether a good path , or set of paths , already exists .
( In fact , you will probably have done this already in order to find out whether the article itself already exists . )
Another implication is that if you have an idea for a core article but not the time to do it properly , then do it anyway and do n’t be a perfectionist .
You can always explain at the beginning of the article ( there will be a facility for doing this ) the ways in which you feel it could be improved .
Something is better than nothing , and if others do not like everything about what you have written , then they will be free to edit it .
So if you are feeling public spirited , then next time your understanding of a certain part of mathematics takes a jump forward , do n’t let it be just your brain ’s connections that are changed : change those of the Tricki as well , so that in future other mathematicians can get to where you are more quickly .
This advance in understanding could be of an existing piece of mathematics , or it could be a breakthrough that you yourself have made .
Either way , the Tricki wants to know about it .
Other kinds of content .
One can imagine all sorts of other useful articles that might appear on the Tricki , such as references to journal papers together with descriptions of the main ideas contained in those papers .
We are not at all against expanding the concept of the Tricki to include other kinds of content , and even if we were , we would not be able to stop people writing it .
But we also think it is good to have some focus to the site .
The overarching general principle is that it should be all about methods of doing mathematics rather than about mathematical subject matter .
Software features of the Tricki .
As well as a facility for writing articles , which should be self - explanatory , there will be two ways of making comments .
One will be in the usual blog style , at the end of an article .
But another will be inline comments .
These will be comments that can be made just after the text to which they refer .
Such a comment will not normally be visible , but there will be a little symbol next to the relevant piece of text , and if someone else clicks on the symbol then the comment will appear in a box to the side of the article .
In this way the commenter wo n’t have to say things like “ In the second paragraph of section 3.2 ” and the reader wo n’t have to scroll back and forth between comment and text .
( However , the comment will also appear at the bottom in the usual blog way . )
It will also be possible to reply to comments and have the replies indented .
Another gorgeous feature will be something that Doron Zeilberger suggested in this comment , in his point number 5 .
It will be possible to write an article and include a phrase such as “ an easy calculation shows that ” , and to do it in such a way that the reader can click on that phrase and see it replaced by a more detailed argument .
It will therefore also be possible for other people to add optional further details in this way too .
( They could if they wanted use the inline comments system for this , but having expanding and contracting text will be a very nice alternative way of doing it . )
As on Wikipedia , the full editorial history of each article will be available on the site .
The names of the authors of articles will not appear on the articles , but can be found out from this editorial history .
For this it will be necessary to register , though it will be possible to edit and comment anonymously without registering .
And registering will be a very easy process .
I think there is more to say , so I may well add to this post , and particularly to this rather short final section .
But for now let me simply post it .

A sugar molecule linked to the origin of life was discovered in a potentially habitable region of our galaxy .
The molecule , called glycolaldehyde , was spotted in a large star - forming area of space around 26,000 light - years from Earth in the less - chaotic outer regions of the Milky Way .
This suggests the sugar could be common across the universe , which is good news for extraterrestrial - life seekers .
" This is an important discovery as it is the first time glycolaldehyde , a basic sugar , has been detected towards a star - forming region where planets that could potentially harbor life may exist , " Serena Viti of University College London said in a press release .
Previously , glycolaldehyde had only been observed toward the center of the galaxy , where conditions are thought to be too extreme to host habitable planets .
Glycolaldehyde is a key ingredient for life .
It helps to build Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , which is thought to be the central molecule involved in the origin of life on Earth .
Glycolaldehyde is a monosaccharide sugar , the basic unit of carbohydrates .
It can react with the chemical propenal to form ribose , the building block of RNA .
" The discovery of an organic sugar molecule in a star forming region of space is very exciting and will provide incredibly useful information in our search for alien life , ” said Keith Mason , chief executive of the England ’s Science and Technology Facilities Council .
The finding , made with the IRAM radio telescope in France , was announced Tuesday and will be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .

The important event this Dec. 25 is n't celebrating the birthday of Isaac Newton or other historical figures , it 's the release of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , a David Fincher film starring Brad Pitt and based on the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald .
As you all know , it 's a story based on the device of incompatible arrows of time : Benjamin is born old and ages backwards into youth ( physically , not mentally ) , while the rest of the world behaves normally .
Some have pretended that scientific interest in the movie centers on issues of aging and longevity , but of course it 's thermodynamics and entropy that take center stage .
While entropy increases and the Second Law is respected in the rest of the world , Benjamin Button 's body seems to be magically decreasing in entropy .
( Which does not , strictly speaking , violate the Second Law , since his body is n't a closed system , but it sure is weird . )
It 's a great opportunity to address an old chestnut : why do arrows of time have to be compatible ?
Why can't we imagine ever discovering another galaxy in which entropy increased toward ( what we call ) the past instead of the future , as in Greg Egan 's story , " The Hundred Light - Year Diary " ?
Or why can't a body age backwards in time ?
First we need to decide what the hell we mean .
Let 's put aside for the moment sticky questions about collapsing wave functions , and presume that the fundamental laws of physics are perfectly reversible .
In that case , given the precise state of the entire universe ( or any closed system ) at any one moment in time , we can use those laws to determine what the state will be at any future time , or what it was at any past time .
That 's just how awesome the laws of physics are .
( Of course we do n't know the laws , nor the state of the entire universe , nor could we actually carry out the relevant calculation even if we did , but we 're doing thought experiments here . )
We usually take that time to be the " initial " time , but in principle we could choose any time -- and in the present context , when we 're worried about arrows of time pointing in different directions , there is no time that is initial for everything .
So what we mean is :
Why is it difficult / impossible to choose a state of the universe with the property that , as we evolve it forward in time , some parts of it have increasing entropy and some parts have decreasing entropy ?
Notice that we can choose conditions that reverse the arrow of time for some individual isolated system .
Entropy counts the " typicalness " of the system 's microscopic state , from the point of view of macroscopic observers .
And it tends to go up , because there are many more ways to be high - entropy than low entropy .
Consider a box of gas , in which the gas molecules are ( by some means ) all bunched together in the middle of the box , in a low - entropy configuration .
If we just let it evolve , the molecules will move around , colliding with each other and with the walls of the box , and ending up ( with overwhelmingly probability ) in a much higher - entropy configuration .
It 's easy to convince ourselves that there exists some configurations from which the entropy would spontaneously go down .
For example , take the state of the above box of gas at any moment after it has become high - entropy , and consider the state in which all of the molecules have exactly the same positions but precisely reversed velocities .
From there , the motion of the molecules will precisely re-trace the path that they took from the previous low - entropy state .
To an external observer , it will look as if the entropy is spontaneously decreasing .
( Of course we know that it took a lot of work to so precisely reverse all of those velocities , and the process of doing so increased the entropy of the wider world , so the Second Law is safe . )
But a merely reversed arrow of time is not the point ; we want incompatible arrows of time .
That means entropy increasing in some part of the universe while it is decreasing in others .
At first it would seem simple enough .
Take two boxes , and prepare one of them in the low entropy state with gas in the middle , and the other in the delicately constructed state with reversed velocities .
( That is , the two boxes on the left side of the two figures above . )
The entropy will go up in one box , and down in the other , right ?
That 's true , but it 's kind of trivial .
We need to have systems that interact -- one system can somehow communicate with the other .
And that ruins everything , of course .
Imagine we started with these two boxes , one of which had an entropy that was ready to go up and the other ready to go down .
But now we introduced a tiny coupling -- say , a few photons moving between the boxes , bouncing off a molecule in one before returning to the other .
Certainly the interaction of Benjamin Button 's body with the rest of the world is much stronger than that .
( Likewise Egan 's time - reversed galaxy , or Martin Amis 's narrator in Time 's Arrow . )
That extra little interaction will slightly alter the velocities of the molecules with which it interacts .
( Momentum is conserved , so it has no choice . )
That 's no problem for the box that starts with low entropy , as there is no delicate tuning required to make the entropy go up .
But it completely ruins our attempt to set up conditions in the other box so that entropy goes down .
Just a tiny change in velocity will quickly propagate through the gas , as one affected molecule hits another molecule , and then they hit two more , and so on .
It was necessary for all of the velocities to be very precisely aligned to make the gas miraculously conspire to decrease its entropy , and any interaction we might want to introduce will destroy the required conspiracy .
The entropy in the first box will very sensibly go up , while the entropy in the other will just stay high .
You can't have incompatible arrows of time among interacting subsystems of the universe .
Tired of your boring old body ?
Wish you could mutilate it , and stick a bunch of weird shit everywhere ?
You 're in luck , friend !
There is a growing industry dedicated to decorating your body with painful , grotesque trinkets that will frighten every stranger you meet .

8 Tattoo Breast Implants
There are two things guaranteed to make any one single average person awesome .
A tattoo of a skanky chick , or fake boobs .
If you look through history 's most awesome people -- Axl Rose , Genghis Khan , Abraham Lincoln , Susan B . Anthony -- they all had skanky tattoos or fake breasts .
It 's a fact you do n't even need to look up .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
But if you need proof .
Inexplicably , when Lane Jensen decided to get a tattoo of a skanky chick , and then give it breast implants , he did not enter the pantheon of awesome so much as he just made himself into a creepy weirdo with what appeared to be a leg goiter .
The implants were made from silicone , so they looked and even felt like little leg titties , and for a brief period of time his only discomfort was callused nipples on his calf .
However , within a couple of weeks he started producing excess lymphatic fluid and eventually his body rejected them .
Or perhaps the universe's own sense of good taste just forbade this sad experiment from continuing any longer .

7 Corset Piercing Dating all the way back to the 1990s , when cutting and depression became fashionable again , corset piercings are , sadly , exactly what they sound like .
They 're surface piercings meant to emulate the appearance of an actual corset , that delightful piece of lingerie that fetish enthusiasts have kept alive long after most women decided to wear shirts that did n't strangle the breath from their torsos .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The basic idea of a corset piercing is to stab some holes in your back and lace yourself together like a dark and moody shoe .
The downside of looking so perfectly Gothic is that the piercings are usually only temporary and will almost inevitably degrade into swollen , infected , nasty holes .
This is due to the fact that poking holes in your back is not a good idea according to researchers at Harvard 's Institute of Back Holeology .
Permanent piercings are apparently possible , if you 're willing to go the extra distance to ensure you have fully healed back holes through which to hang your keys or whatever when you 're not being dreary at a club or industrial rave .

The article – " The Making ( and Remaking ) of McCain " , by Robert Draper – gives an explanation for McCain ’s idiotic - to - the - point - of - embarrassing stunt last month , at the time when the economic meltdown was initially kicking into hyperdrive .
McCain ’s response – to suggest cancelling the debate , ‘ suspending ’ his campaign , and parachuting into Washington to heroically save the empire from the evil capitalist derivative speculators ( uh , oops – yeah , that ’s right – the same ones he ’s been flacking for his entire career ) – marked the beginning of his slide into historical footmarkery , right down there with the likes of Bob Dole and Lil’ Danny Quayle .
So – lemme guess – you ’re thinking : " Ah , what sweet justice .
There is a god , after all ! "
But it actually gets better .
Here ’s why : according to the article , all this happened because the guy who John McCain picked to run his campaign once got the " smartest bit of political wisdom he ever heard " from – are you ready for this ?
– really ?
– wait for it now ... none other than that renowned national genius , George W. Bush .
And what did Bush teach him , other than the value of " manning up " and " going all in " ( I ’m not making this stuff up ) with stunts like McCain ’s little economic crisis bombing run , a sortie in which he managed to crash the sixth aircraft of his career ?
Now this – this – is the part I really like .
Back in 2004 , Bush , the only complacent guy in the room , calmly told Schmidt that he should n’t worry that the boss ’s campaign appeared at the time to be falling apart .
Why ?
Because , Bush averred , voters have an " accidental genius " by which they can sniff out the true character of a candidate !
Amazing .
Of course , W ( and who knew that was short for Wise One ? ) did n’t mention the part about how swiftboating the sh*t out of your opponent , or disenfranchising droves of African American and student voters can also help to put you over the top when that good old voter intuition occasionally goes AWOL – like in 2000 and 2004 – just as W himself did for a couple of years when he was in the National Guard .
And then of course there ’s always that little Supreme Court trick , too , when things get really difficult .
This is the guru to the guru who is running the McCain campaign ?
Okay .
Well that certainly explains a thing or two .
One thing we ’ve clearly learned from the Cringe Decade ’s nightmare of unmitigated regressive rule is just how incompetent these clowns truly are .
It was clear to most folks – at least those still registering some measurable amount of synaptic activity on the monitors – that the right was , of course , lying absurdly about Iraq , about taxes , about Social Security , about prescription drug benefits , and about much , much more .
And some people have even caught on to the deeper lie of the entire regressive movement – that it is not simply a misguided ideology whose policy prescriptions were disastrous , but rather that it is actually a deeply pernicious kleptocratic treason conspiracy hiding behind a rag - tag improvisation of ideological hodge - podge ( such as , for example , the exquisitely appropriately named Laffer Curve ) , designed for the sole purpose of pretending to link whatever present conditions might exist to whatever predetermined policy outcome was long ago decided upon .
Clearly , for example , the administration made the decision to invade Iraq first , then went looking for justifications that could be used to market the war later .
Paul Wolfowitz even admitted this in his " bureaucratic reasons " explanation for how they all agreed on WMD as the fear factor they ’d use to sell the war .
Another classic example came from Bush ’s advocacy , as a candidate during flush times in 2000 , of massive tax cuts .
By the time he got to the White House , however , the economy was headed in a recessionary direction , and yet he was still advocating the same remedy for the polar opposite economic condition .
It was as if the guy had read the first three chapters of John Maynard Keynes in his college macro class , but never bothered to get to the rest .
Much more likely , of course , was that he had been too drunk to read any of it , and would n’t have been so inclined , anyhow , had he somehow miraculously sobered up for a day or two .
I mean , why study when you can be practicing your cheerleading routines instead ?
And anyhow , who needs that academic nonsense , anyhow , either at Yale or in the Oval Office ?
The economic theory mumbo- jumbo was for Rove to figure out in order to direct the marketing roll - out , just as if it were some sort of plastic Thanksgiving photo - op turkey for the troops .
Bush already knew the policy choice in advance , and he sure as hell was n’t going to let some pointy - headed ivory tower ideas or the cold , hard evidence from centuries of real - world experience dissuade him .
I mean , what would be the point of a Bush presidency , anyhow , if it was n’t to hoover up every shred of wealth from the public commons , nailed down or ( preferably ) not ?
To govern in the public interest , perhaps ?
Pshaw !
Yeah , right .
That ’s a good one , dude .
But even Americans who thought regressives clearly to be liars or thieves might still have believed that they were highly competent , especially if you ’d had your brain Luntz - framed long enough to believe that MBA CEO types are tough , skilled , administrative whiz - bangs ( you know , like the guys at Lehman Brothers , AIG , General Motors , etc. ) .
It was easy to mistake that sometimes , because normally they ’re very good at marketing and at winning elections .
But this year , the right ca n’t even begin to get that right .
The McCain - Palin campaign is a pathetic thing to see these days .
Such as it is , even .
There hardly seems to be a single campaign anymore , as a candidate so stiff he makes Bob Dole ( even the 1996 version ) look like James Dean by comparison lurches from embarrassing attack to awkward teleprompter - read , even - more - embarrassing , attack .
My friends .
There hardly seems to be a single campaign anymore , as insiders scramble to save their reputations , leaking stories claiming that they were off smoking a cigarette somewhere when the campaign debacle hit .
And there hardly seems to be a single campaign anymore , as every day McCain ’s running mate goes increasingly more native , leaving the reservation to begin her presidential campaign for 2012 .
All this might seem ungracious , but that ’s only because , in fact , it is .
It sure ai n’t surprising , though .
Any movement that builds its core ideology around the worship of an infantilist , developmentally - stunted , self - aggrandizement will inevitably wind up eating its young .
It ’s not a matter of if , but when .
And it ’s no longer even a matter of when , but now .
Politics is rife with ironies , and perhaps never so much as this particular cycle .
In many ways , John McCain should actually be winning this race , notwithstanding his daily acts of circus buffoonery and his decision to place his campaign in the hands of someone so sharp he regards George W. Bush as a profound political sage .
The public is really nervous these days , and a well - known and well - trusted leader with that m-word ( I ca n’t possibly hear it one more time ) brand could really have made a case for being the sort of steady rock people crave in a crisis like the current economic meltdown .
A different McCain might really have taken this in a run-away .
But not this one .
Obama has shrewdly tied McCain to Bush , but that is n’t really McCain ’s problem .
Rather , it ’s his being joined at the hip to Bushism , which is at its core Republicanism , which is at its core regressivism .
That ’s McCain ’s problem .
The irony here is that , while McCain has proven to be a scary monster at many junctures of his life and career , I do n’t think he is at heart really a regressive in the mold of , say , Dick Cheney or Mitch McConnell .
In fact , having been savaged in 2000 by the ‘ agents of intolerance ’ inside and outside of the Bush campaign , he actually really hated the SOBs , and with good cause .
But McCain wanted – more than anything and for the entirety of his life – to be president , and he made a calculation that his best strategy for getting there was to make nice to the radical right , support Bush for eight years , and then run again as the heir apparent in 2008 .
What he evidently did n’t consider in this sell - off of his principles to the lowest bidder was the possibility that he was hitching himself to a wagon that was headed over a cliff .
Into a bottomless pit .
Located on an imploding black hole star .
George W. Bush is a human wrecking machine of historical proportions , second only to the likes of Hitler , Stalin or Mao ( yet another way in which Bush is a two - bit hack – he could n’t even do genocide right ) .
The good senator was only one of Bush ’s many victims , though McCain perhaps alone among them has the dubious honor of having been diddled by the Boy King not once , but twice .
Among the great ironies of this election is that had McCain adopted another strategy , he might have had a pretty good shot at the presidency .
One possibility would have been to renounce the GOP and become a Democrat .
He could certainly have argued , with a straight face , that he was n’t leaving the Republican Party , but that the Republican Party had left him .
He might even have captured the Democratic nomination , and almost certainly would have destroyed a Mitt Romney or a Rudy Giuliani in the general election had he done so .
Perhaps even more plausibly , he could have become an independent and run a third party campaign for president .
McCain – like , say , Colin Powell – was one of the few Americans with the stature and reputation sufficient to pull that off , and it would in fact have suited his politics and temperament much better to have done so .
Instead , he tied himself to Bush , while Bush tied himself to the cement shoes of regressive politics and jumped off the bridge , taking down his own party and his party ’s presidential nominee with him ( not to mention a million Iraqis , 4,200 Americans , Tony Blair , Colin Powell , Bar , Poppy and Jeb , along with many , many more folks foolish enough to allow themselves within his orbit ) .
It ’s truly astonishing if you think about it .
This little twirp ’s need to redeem himself after a lifetime of failure and insecurity has produced destruction of galactic proportions .
In any case , McCain made the wrong choice , put ambition first , above all else ( including , with the Palin pick , above country ) , and gambled that Bush would n’t wreck the GOP brand before November 2008 .
Oops .
By going to bed with the likes of George Bush , McCain definitely owns his own fate .
And there ’s more than a little delight in watching a practitioner of these debauched politics destroy himself .
He ’s stuck with a base that loves Bush and Bushism , all while trying to attract independents who are ready to hurl at the prospect of either .
Every independent vote McCain might acquire – however implausibly , given his voting record ( but then this is America , so anything can be sold ) – by dissing Bush , means a Republican voter disenchanted .
Likewise , every play to keep the base happy with some inane red meat about socialism or terrorism only simultaneously alienates still sentient Americans in the middle .
The Palin selection epitomizes this dynamic .
Whatever else he thought she might bring to the table ( corruption charges , perhaps ?
shocking idiocy ?
disloyalty to the guy who made her ? ) , part of the rationale for her selection was to do something John McCain was unable to do himself – namely , to get Republicans interested in the 2008 Republican presidential ticket .
And so it did , but it has cost him dearly with just about every other voter , who look upon Palin with dropped - jaw astonishment , and McCain with deeply flawed judgement .
Meanwhile , nowadays George Bush is almost nowhere to be found .
He is irrelevant to any policy discussions , and if he is even remotely semi-conscious , would count himself lucky to be off the radar screen of a country and a world filled with an anger and anxiety that is the direct product of his destructive policies .
When right - wing commentator – and former press secretary for Newt Gingrich – Tony Blankley describes a Republican leader by noting that " The existing American president is a failed thing " , you know it ’s all very , very far gone down the tubes .
But notice how they all adored Bush when he was flying high .
The current state of the Republican Party is n’t just the product of a one - man demolition derby .
This has been a carcinogenic genetic mutation masquerading as a mass ideology , and it ’s had a lot of adherents .
The great farce of the GOP , which soon became the tragedy of the nation and the world , was to actually govern .
They would have been so much better off to retain their natural role as carping cranks , spreading disinformation at every turn , making up scandals for the other guys , proliferating and hiding their own , occasionally impeaching presidents .
But they made the mistake of actually seizing power , after which an entire world could see what they ’re really about , the destructiveness of their policies , their breathtaking arrogance , as well as their astonishing incompetence at providing for the basic functions of governance .
I suppose we ca n’t entirely blame them for their own self - destruction .
I mean , who knew that imploding economies , drowning cities , oceans of debt , disastrous wars based on lies , alienation of centuries - old allies , dismantling of Social Security , falling worker salaries , rising costs , diminishing healthcare , a massive terrorist attack while the president was on vacation , the national shame of torture , or catastrophic environmental disaster – who knew these would be unpopular policies ?
The regressive movement – so deluded that they still like to think of themselves as conservatives – is on death watch now , and yet it does n’t know it , nor does it remotely begin to understand why .
But the reasons – both proximate and distant – are plain enough to see .
The immediate problem is that they ran a pathetic candidate against a great candidate .
More importantly , they ran a slimy , Rovian campaign against a guy who knew how to fight back , and also had the guts to do so , and they presented it all to a national electorate that is frightened enough to no longer be willing to indulge foolery anymore .
The proof of this is that John McCain might actually have the best night of any Republican candidate on Tuesday , as Democrats massively increase their majorities in both the House and the Senate , perhaps even gaining a filibuster - proof 60 - seat Senate majority , perhaps even giving Senate Minority Leader and major scuzzbucket Mitch McConnnell ( from Kentucky no less ! ) his walking papers .
And , as if that were n’t proof enough , this comes after a similar blow - out in 2006 , when the GOP got a " thumpin ’ " , and lost control of both houses of Congress .
And , to top it all off , voters do n’t even particularly like Democrats , and they sure do n’t like the current Congress , which is controlled by Democrats .
It ’s rare for an American political party to get stomped two elections in a row , let alone by a generally disliked alternative party .
You have to be screwing up really badly to do that , in a collective effort sort of way .
Which , of course , is exactly what we ’re talking about .
Only regressives do n’t know it .
They think their policies and attitudes are popular in America .
They think George W. Bush ’s problem was that he was n’t regressive enough .
If only he had invaded Iran as well as Iraq !
If only he had deregulated Wall Street even more .
If only he had encouraged more oil consumption and more carbon emissions .
If only he had eliminated abortion rights .
If only he had cut wealthy Americans ’ tax liabilities down to zero , shifting those burdens to the middle class .
If only he had done to all of us what he did to Terri Schiavo ’s family .
If only he had eliminated all government spending on popular programs .
If only he had privatized Social Security and let Wall Street handle it .
If only he had wasted even more Iraqis and more American GIs .
If only he had let Osama bin Laden roam even freer , even longer .
If only he had quadrupled the national debt , instead of merely doubling it .
If only Exxon / Mobil had made even more than their all - time corporate record - breaking earnings , while the rest of us were unable to buy enough gas to get to work .
If only Bush could have appointed more regressive justices to the federal bench , where they could find that we have no constitutional right to privacy , and who would make sure that corporate and presidential power trump the people ’s and the people ’s representatives ’ at every turn .
If only there could have been more jobs lost on his watch .
If only we could have seen wages fall lower .
If only the country could have had its wealth more polarized so we could better emulate rotten banana republics .
If only we could have been more divided politically .
If only we could have made the world hate us more .
If only more of our cities could have drowned .
If only we could have hurtled toward planetary destruction even faster .

Taxpayers stuck with what now looks like a $ 45 BILLION to make the deal work .
Well , those investment bankers did work a long weekend to put together a deal that could only work after massive government subsidies and they probably had their annual bonuses trimmed back a bit , so that ’s fair .
Just because the already too - big - to - fail businesses are even larger now and that the ultimate US mega - bank ( Citigroup ) is being chopped into pieces and sold because they were too big , why not hand out more to delay the inevitable overhaul of Bank of America ?
Yea , they ’re probably going to fire even more people with this merger but I have n’t heard of employment being much of an issue today .
Who does n’t want to sacrifice $ 20 million to help a poor , starving investment banker ?
Anyway , it ’s probably not any business of Congress to ask questions so I guess it ’s OK .
Primary school teacher who told children : ' Santa does not exist ' is fired
A primary school teacher who left a class of 25 pupils in tears after she told told them Santa Claus did not exist has been fired ..
When excited youngsters became rowdy as they talked about Santa , the supply teacher blurted out : ' It 's your parents who leave out presents on Christmas Day . '
The class of seven - year - olds at Blackshaw Lane Primary School , Royton , near Oldham , Greater Manchester burst into tears and told their parents when they arrived home .
Santa sacked : A teacher has been told not to return to work after she told her primary school pupils that Santa Claus is not real
Mothers and fathers then complained about the incident and were sent a letter by the school saying the substitute teacher , who only worked at the school for one day last week , has been disciplined .
The school has now said it will not hire her again .
One father said : ' My son came home and said that his substitute teacher had told the class that Santa does n't exist and it's your mum and dad that put out presents for them .
' Apparently , they were all talking about Christmas and being a bit rowdy .
She just came straight out with it .
' My lad was in tears and so was everyone else in the class - especially as it was so close to Christmas .
' I thought it was wrong .
He was distraught about it .
He 's only seven - years - old and it's part of the magic of Christmas to him .
' We told him that she did not believe in Father Christmas because of her religion and he 's fine now . '
The father described the incident as ' shocking ' and believed it was done with malicious intent .
' A lot of parents were disgusted and complained to the school . '
The teacher , who was supplied by Rochdale and Oldham Supply Agency , is still registered and will work with other schools , the agency said .
Headteacher Angela McCormick refused to comment on the incident .
Mr Madoff is the former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange Some of the world 's biggest banks have revealed they are victims of an alleged fraud which has lost $ 50 bn ( £ 33 bn ) .
Bernard Madoff , who was arrested on Thursday , has been charged with fraud in what is being described as one of the biggest - ever such cases .
Among the banks that have been hit are Britain 's HSBC and RBS , Spain 's Santander and France 's BNP Paribas .
Other victims include film director Stephen Spielberg 's Wunderkinder Foundation charity .
One of the City 's best - known fund managers has criticised US regulators for not detecting the alleged fraud .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Nicola Horlick , boss of Bramdean investments , told the BBC : " I think now it is very difficult for people to invest in things that are meant to be regulated in America , because they have fallen down on the job . "
" This is the biggest financial scandal , probably in the history of the markets - $ 50bn is a huge amount of money , " she said .
Counting the cost Banks and financial institutions across the world had investments with Bernard Madoff , but not all have yet confirmed what their potential losses might be .
Among the potential losers is Spain 's largest bank , Santander , which owns the UK High Street banks Abbey , Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley .
The bank had a direct exposure of 17 m euros ( $ 23 m ; £ 15 m ) , but clients of its Optimal fund management unit have another 2.3bn euros invested in the firm run by Bernard Madoff Britain 's HSBC said it had investments of about $ 1bn , which could be affected .
WHAT IS A PONZI SCHEME ?
A fraudulent investment scheme paying investors from money paid in by other investors rather than real profits Named after Charles Ponzi who notoriously used the technique in the United States in 1920 Differs from pyramid selling in that individuals all tend to invest with the same person
Madoff millions vanish Royal Bank of Scotland said it could potentially lose about £ 400 m ( $ 601 m ) if all its investments had to be written off .
The French bank , Natixis , a subsidiary of Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire , said it could potentially lose up to 450 m euros ( £ 402 m ; $ 605 m ) .
One of the world 's biggest investment groups , Man , said it had invested about $ 360 m through its RMF institutional fund of funds business , representing 0.5 % of its total funds .
Banking shares fell around the world , with Royal Bank of Scotland dropping 3.7 % , HSBC losing 1.2 % and banks making up the top four losers on New York 's Dow Jones Industrial Average .
' Systemic failure '
Meanwhile , some of the biggest private losers seem to have been members of the Palm Beach country club , where many of Mr Madoff 's wealthy clients were recruited .
According to some reports , the list of prominent victims include a New Jersey Senator , the owners of the New York Mets and the charities run by film director Stephen Spielberg and Nobel Prize winning writer Elie Wiesel .
MAJOR POTENTIAL LOSSES
Clients of Santander , Spain - $ 3.1bn HSBC , UK - $ 1bn Natixis , France - $ 605 m Royal Bank of Scotland , UK - $ 601 m BNP Paribas , France - $ 460 m BBVA , Spain - $ 400 m Man Group , UK - $ 360 m Reichmuth & Co , Switzerland - $ 325 m Nomura , Japan - $ 303 m Mrs Horlick said 9 % of Bramdean 's own funds were invested with Mr Madoff , but that even if the money was written off , the fund involved would be down just 4 % .
" I just want to make it clear to investors that even after this , they would have done extremely well , relative to anything else they could have invested in , " she said .
In a statement , Bramdean said : " The allegations made appear to point to a systemic failure of the regulatory and securities markets regime in the US . "
However , some argued that the fund managers should themselves have done more .
" City figures cannot call for light touch regulation yet at the same time complain that regulators missed risks that the industry failed to spot , " said Simon Morris , a partner with City law firm CMS Cameron McKenna .
" It 's the unequivocal job of the fund manager to check out the bona fides of whoever they chose to pass their customers ' money onto , " he said .
The collapse of Madoff is likely to accelerate the disappearance of hedge funds
Robert Peston Read Robert Peston 's blog Send us your comments Antonio Borges , chairman of the Hedge Fund Standards Board , said the scandal highlighted the need for " robust governance practices and oversight via independent boards , which will challenge management procedures and behaviour " .
Meanwhile one of the City 's watchdogs , the Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) called on whistleblowers to come forward with evidence of corporate wrongdoing in the wake of the credit crunch .
The Serious Fraud Office said it wanted workers , former staff and shareholders to step up with information over suspected fraud in the current financial turmoil .
Director Richard Alderman said : " Our objective is to ensure that we can bring offenders to justice as quickly as possible . "
High returns promised US prosecutors say Mr Madoff , a former head of the Nasdaq stock market , masterminded a fraud of massive proportions through his hedge fund and investment advisory business .
Mr Madoff is alleged to have used money from new investors to pay off existing investors in the fund .
A federal judge has appointed a receiver to oversee Mr Madoff firm 's assets and customer accounts , while the 70 - year - old banker has been released on $ 10 m bail .
Mr Madoff founded Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities in 1960 , but also ran a separate hedge fund business .
According to the US Attorney 's criminal complaint filed in court , Mr Madoff told at least three employees on Wednesday that the hedge fund business - which served up to 25 clients and had $ 17.1 bn under management - was a fraud and had been insolvent for years .
He said he was " finished " , that he had " absolutely nothing " and " it 's all just one big lie " , and that it was " basically , a giant Ponzi scheme " , the complaint said .
If found guilty , US prosecutors say he could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 5 m .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
An Iraqi soldier went on the rampage at a joint security station in northern Iraq on Wednesday , shooting dead two U.S. soldiers and wounding six , the U.S. military said .
The U.S. military said the soldier opened fire on the Americans at the station -- one of many in which Iraqi and U.S. troops operate side by side -- in the city of Mosul .
“ The soldiers were in the courtyard ... an Iraqi soldier entered and shot two soldiers , killing one , mortally wounding another , and then spraying the others , ” said U.S. army spokeswoman for northern Iraq Major Peggy Kageleiry .
“ He was engaged by counter - fire and killed , ” she added .
A local morgue said it had received the body of the Iraqi soldier , riddled with bullets .
Two local police sources and an Iraqi army source , all of whom declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject , said a quarrel had broken out between the Iraqi and U.S. soldiers at the joint station .
But Kageleiry denied there was any altercation between the soldiers before the shooting .
“ The U.S. soldiers had no conversation with this soldier and there was no interaction of any kind before they were murdered , ” she said .
Ecologically blessed , economically challenged , vast and diverse , Indonesia is a country of contrasts .

Indonesia is populated by over 230 million people , speaking over 740 different languages and dialects within 300 distinct native ethnic groups - it is the fourth most populous country , after the United States .
Impoverished conditions amongst people living in an area so rich with natural resources has also put extreme pressure on the environment , as increased mining and deforestation make more of an impact .

Between 1968 and 1972 , Stewart Brand published The Whole Earth Catalog .
For Kevin Kelly , the Catalog was essentially " a paper - based database offering thousands of hacks , tips , tools , suggestions , and possibilities for optimizing your life . "
For Steve Jobs , it was a " Bible " of his generation , a kind of Google 35 years before Google came along .
( On a side note , I highly recommend the commencement speech where Jobs made those comments . )
The very good news is that The Whole Earth Catalog and some related publications are now available online .
You can read them for free , or download them for a fee .
Start delving into things here .
While we 're on this subject , I should also highlight a project that has more recently occupied Stewart Brand 's time .
The Seminars About Long Term Thinking is a monthly speaking series hosted by Brand and organized by the Long Now Foundation , which hopes to provide a counterpoint to today ’s “ faster / cheaper ” mind set and to promote “ slower / better ” thinking .

Subject : Mochalua - Lua for J2ME
: From : " Patrick Meehan " < patrick@ ...>
: " Patrick Meehan " < patrick@ ...>
Date : Mon , 17 Nov 2008 13:42:59 -0800
Hi , All : I 'd like to announce the release of Mochalua , a J2ME port of the Lua runtime and API , as open source under the MIT license .
It is now available for download on the Google Code site : http://code.google.com/p/mochalua/
We were aware of Kahlua but it was incomplete when we started the Mochalua project ( and may still be ) .
We were also aware that there was another project locked within the bowels of a short - sighted company .
So we put our money toward hiring a company , Nikitova , to work with us to do a conversion from scratch .
Mochalua is a port of the Lua runtime and API only , not the compiler .
The API functions have kept their original names and signatures from the C implementation with only minor variations to account for language differences .
It has been able to pass the Lua test vectors .
We have also put it through its paces for our own projects .
At this time , it should be a pretty stable codebase for you to use .
I hope you can make use of this application .
If you like it please provide feedback and / or help us optimize the code and improve on what we 've done so far .
Cheers , Patrick Meehan Senior Developer Groundspeak , Inc. www.groundspeak.com
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- AT&T Inc. on Thursday said it would cut 12,000 jobs , or 4 % of its workforce , and spend less on new equipment in 2009 in response to a weakening economy .
The Dallas - based phone giant , which had 303,000 employees at the end of the third quarter , becomes the latest corporate bellwether to announce major layoffs .
Also on Thursday , DuPont , Viacom and Credit Suisse said they would cull jobs .
Aside from a poor economy , AT&T T , - 0.28 % cited streamlining efforts and a " changing business mix " as reasons for the reductions .
The company noted that it 's still hiring in its stronger businesses such as wireless , video and high - speed Internet .
" There 's an ongoing industry shift from wireline to wireless and broadband , " AT&T spokesman Walt Sharp said .
Most job cuts will take place in AT&T 's traditional local and long - distance segments , which have been losing customers for years .
Millions of ex-subscribers have switched to cable - phone services or Internet - phone companies such as Vonage .
Others have chosen to rely exclusively on wireless , especially younger people .
" AT&T has been losing consumer retail lines at around 10 % per year due to wireless substitution and cable competition , necessitating the employee reductions , " analyst Peter Rhamey of BMO Capital Markets wrote in a research note .
The reductions will begin in December and continue into 2009 , the company said .
AT&T plans to book a onetime expense of $ 600 million in the fourth quarter to pay for severance and related costs .
With the economy now in recession , AT&T also said it expects to devote less money to capital expenses in 2009 than it 's spending in the current fiscal year .
AT&T is on track to spend roughly $ 17.8 billion or somewhat less on network expenses in 2008 .
The carrier said it will give more details when AT&T issues fourth - quarter results in late January .
AT&T and other phone companies have been scaling back capital expenditures for months and pushing projects further out , according to executives at firms that make networking equipment .
Just last month , Sprint Nextel Corp.
Chief Executive Dan Hesse said in an interview that that 's exactly what phone companies are doing .
" I think the input from the suppliers is very accurate , " Hesse said .
" Carriers will begin to slow down or delay projects . "
In November , Sprint initiated a buyout program for some employees .
The slowdown is sure to put more pressure on already - battered vendors such as Nortel Networks Corp .
NT , Alcatel - Lucent ALU , - 1.53 % and Tellabs Inc. TLAB
In recent Thursday trades , shares of AT&T fell 2.5 % to $ 28.35 , as futures trading indicated a lower opening for the U.S. market .
The government 's proposals to increase data sharing between departments will be buried in the Coroners and Justice Bill - which is expected to be presented to the House of Commons today .
The bill is expected to include measures covering the government 's response to the Data Handling Review , which we covered here .
In essence these will allow more data sharing between different arms of government - because we all know that current arrangements are too tight and too rigorously followed , do n't we ?
Recommendation 8 ( a and b ) was accepted by the government - it gives the Secretary of State the right to remove " an existing legal barrier to data sharing " .
Although the government response generally agreed that departments should admit who else they are sharing information with there were three provisos - national security , confidentiality agreements and market sensitivity .
The last two have been routinely used to suppress information about government IT contracts .
Lobby group No2ID expects the Bill to be pushed through its first reading on Friday .
Phil Booth , NO2ID National Coordinator , said :
Rather than protecting our personal information , as it should be , the government is cutting away safeguards for its own data - trafficking convenience .
This is a Bill to smash the rule of law and build the database state in its place .
Burying sweeping constitutional change in obscure Bills is an appalling approach .
Having proved - and admitted - they cannot be trusted to look after our secrets , they are still determined to steal what privacy we have left .
Parliament needs to wake up before it has no say any more .
A Ministry of Justice Spokesperson said :
Sharing data is essential for the delivery of efficient and effective joined - up public services , tackling crime and protecting the public .
The new power will lead to a more streamlined process for policies requiring data sharing whilst at the same time allowing fuller parliamentary scrutiny .
Any draft Order would require Parliamentary approval and a Privacy Impact Assessment .
Additionally , the Information Commissioner would have been invited to comment on the proposals .
This will ensure that any potential privacy issues and risks are identified and examined .
The power will be exercised only in circumstances where the sharing of the information is in the public interest and proportionate to the impact on any person adversely affected by it .
Although the government has gone some way to increase the ICO 's powers and funding , these proposals will also increase the burden on the watchdog . ®
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- A 3 - month - old girl born to an Indian surrogate mother has flown to Japan to join her biological father after spending the first months of her life in legal limbo .
Baby Manjhi and her grandmother flew to Osaka , Japan , from the Indian capital , New Delhi , Saturday night , said family friend , Kamal Vijay Vargiya .
While some countries have banned surrogacy as a money - making venture , it has been legal in India since 2002 .
Under the practice , infertile couples are matched with local women to carry babies for $ 12,000 to $ 30,000 .
Baby Manjhi was conceived when a Japanese couple paid a clinic in India to have the husband 's sperm and an anonymous donor 's egg implanted in the womb of an Indian surrogate .
The plan worked .
But a few months before Manjhi was born , the couple divorced .
The intended Japanese mother decided she did not want the baby .
Manjhi was born on July 25 .
Her father , Ikufumi Yamada , and grandmother traveled from Japan to pick her up and take her to her new home .
But Indian law stipulates that a mother must be present in order for a baby to receive a passport .
Do n't Miss Surrogate baby stuck in legal limbo
In this case , neither the birth mother nor the mother who had originally sought the child wanted to be involved .
Manjhi's father looked into a legal adoption , but Indian law does not allow single men to adopt .
The case garnered international headlines .
Eventually , Manjhi was issued a birth certificate with just her father 's name on it .
And on Saturday , she left for Osaka to be reunited with him .
" This is for the first time in 28 years in Jaipur that somebody ( in such a situation ) has been issued travel documents by Indian authorities .
And this became possible mainly because of media , " said Sanjay Arya , the doctor who treated Manjhi at a Jaipur hospital .

Maurizio Cattelan : The Art of Absurd Contradictions
Maurizio Cattelan is often described as a Shakespearian fool , expressing universal truths about themes such as power , death and authority through what appear to be jokes or stunts : a stuffed squirrel that has shot itself at the kitchen table , Pope John Paul II struck down by a meteorite , a child like Hitler praying on his knees .
His work tries to subvert and challenge contemporary thinking , blurring the distinction between art and reality to provoke reaction .
Cattelan likes to describe himself as an idiot .
He refuses to take a stance , and claims that he does n’t even know what his work means .
As a consolation for the bleakness of a professionalized social life , Cattelan offers up his own example .
He has said of his work as an artist , “ this is the one profession where I can be a little bit stupid and people will say , ‘ Thank you , thank you for being so stupid ! ‘”
This statement updates the now familiar nineteenth - century concept of the aesthetic field as the opposite of the ruthlessness of the market .
Art , in this understanding , is not a utopian alternative .
It is an adjacent , but equally competitive , field to the professions , but one which values rather than represses reflections on the nature of “ the game . ”
In keeping with this paradox , Cattelan is the ultimate professional unprofessional : he is unconcerned about demonstrating a mastery of his craft , except for the twin crafts of directing fabricators to realize his ideas and eliciting support from curators and collaborators .
His work , a series of sculptural vignettes or gestures , expresses not a poetics of mastery , but a comedy of failure .
If laughter can be said to express the whole of wisdom , Cattelan ’s body of artistic work tends to confirm this .

More than sixty groups call for revocation of presidential secrecy directive John Byrne
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008
Print This Email This More than 60 organizations called on President - elect Barack Obama Wednesday to revoke President George W. Bush 's executive order on presidential secrecy and lift the veil in numerous areas of governmental furtiveness .
The groups ' recommendations demand efficiency and openness from the Freedom of Information Act process , reforms in the classification system to reduce overclassification and ensure that presidential records are handled in accordance with US law and congressional intent .
Among the groups include the National Security Archive , OMB Watch -- a watchdog group of the White House Office of Management and Budget -- and the Radio Television News Directors Association .
" President - elect Obama can make a difference on Day One in the way his administration relates to the public , " National Security Archive 's general counsel Meredith Fuchs said in a release .
" Secrecy got out of control in the last eight years , but a few focused directives will go a long way towards reopening the government . "
Among the proposals include requests for Obama to :
* Issue a memorandum on the Freedom of Information
Act that establishes a policy of maximum possible public disclosure of government records and directing an attorney general memo that reinstitutes the presumption of openness under FOIA , calls on agencies to use technology to engage with and inform the public , and commits to creating a more collaborative and less adversarial relationship with the public on issues involving access to information .
* Revoke President Bush 's executive order on the Presidential Records Act , which undermined the PRA by purporting to create new constitutional privileges for the family members and descendents of former presidents and for former vice presidents ; commit to working with NARA and Congress to ensure necessary oversight for the transfer and processing of the Bush presidential records ; and establish a policy for the new administration to preserve all presidential records of administrative , historical , informational , or evidentiary value .
* Issue a presidential directive rejecting prior abuses of the classification system and tasking the relevant executive branch agencies to develop a new executive order on classification that will reduce overclassification , add internal mechanisms to prevent classification abuses , ensure consideration of the public interest throughout the lifecycle of classified information , and improve the declassification process and information sharing .
President Bush has acted to withhold governmental information from the public .
" In early 2002 , then - Attorney General John D. Ashcroft issued a memo to government agencies urging them to reject requests for access to public documents allowed under the Freedom of Information
Act if they could find a legal argument against the release , " the Washington Post reported Tuesday .
" It was a reversal from the Clinton administration 's stance , which assumed that records were public unless government proved otherwise . "

During the hearing held yesterday by the Senate Banking Committee into government assistance for the automotive industry Senator Bob Casey ( D - PA ) commented on the " scapegoating of the men and women of organized labor " in the auto industry .
He also called the false claim about autoworkers making $ 70 / hr a deliberate lie being perpetrated on the American people .
He said :
CASEY : I have to say also , with regard to the labor concessions -- Mr. [ Ron ] Gettelfinger [ UAW president ] , I wanted to review some of those .
Because I am stunned by the kind of -- when you hear the talking heads on television and when you read what some people say in this town and across the country about the mythology that 's out there about how we 're -- how we got to this situation .
And , frankly , the scapegoating of the men and women of organized labor , and in particular , autoworkers .
Point number one :
In 2005 , cuts in wages for active workers and health - care benefits for retirees -- point number one .
I 'm reading from your testimony .
Cuts for new workers , bringing the wage level down to 14 bucks an hour .
How many industries are doing that ?
Reducing the company 's liability for retiree health care by 50 percent .
And I realize these have been in the record before , but it is very important .
And wages and benefits .
You said yourself that they 're about 10 percent -- 10 percent of the budget ?
You would think listening to some of the people talk out there , some of the so - called experts , that wages and benefits were 70 percent of the cost .
So there 's a lot of mythology , a lot of myth generally that has been put on the record .
In 20 -- since 2003 , downsizing by the companies has reduced their workforce by 150,000 people .
That does n't get said very often .
The labor - cost gap with foreign transplant operations will be largely or completely eliminated .
OK ?
So , it 's -- I think it 's important to put this information on the record for this hearing .
And then we 've heard this garbage about 73 bucks an hour .
It 's a total lie , and some people have perpetrated that deliberately in a calculated way to mislead the American people about what we 're doing here .
It 's a lie , and they know it 's a lie .
NEW YORK , Nov 28 ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Treasury secretary Robert Rubin said the near - collapse of Citigroup Inc C.N , where he is a senior counselor , was due to the buckling financial system and not his own mistakes , according to an interview published on The Wall Street Journal 's website on Friday .
Rubin , who is also a director at Citigroup , acknowledged he was involved in a board decision to ramp up risk - taking in 2004 and 2005 , according to the paper , and said if executives had executed the plan properly , the bank ’s losses would have been less .
The Journal said Rubin has earned $ 115 million in pay since 1999 , excluding stock options .
“ I bet there ’s not a single year where I could n’t have gone somewhere else and made more , ” said Rubin , according to the Journal .
Rubin cited former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as another example of someone whose reputation has been unfairly damaged by the financial crisis , according to the Journal
The paper reported that Rubin said of the current crisis : “ what came together was not only a cyclical undervaluing of risk ( but also ) a housing bubble and triple - A ratings were misguided , ” he said .
“ There was virtually nobody who saw that low - probability event as a possibility . ”
Rubin told the Journal that the Citigroup board could bear some responsibility and that some things should have been done differently .
The former Treasury secretary also gave his support to Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit .
“ Vikram runs this company on a worst reasonable case for this economy .
Essentially , the pieces of Citi will look how they do today , ” the Journal quotes Rubin as saying .
Citigroup could not immediately be reached for comment .
RIVERSIDE , Calif . - Typically , tobacco companies market harm - reduction cigarettes as being safer than traditional " full - flavored " brands , leading many smokers to conclude that the use of harm - reduction brands lowers their exposure to toxicants .
But a UC Riverside study now shows that smoke from these " light " or " low - yield " harm - reduction cigarettes retains toxicity and that this toxicity can affect prenatal development .
" Many chemicals found in harm - reduction cigarette smoke have not been tested , and some are listed by manufacturers as safe , " said Prue Talbot , a professor of cell biology who led the study .
" But our tests on mice clearly show that these chemicals adversely affect reproduction and associated development processes .
The effects are likely to be the same in humans , in which case pregnant women would be particularly vulnerable to the effect of smoke from these cigarettes . "
Talbot 's research team used mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) as a model for pre-implantation embryos -- embryos that have not yet implanted in the wall of the uterus -- and compared the toxicity on these cells of cigarette smoke emanating from traditional and harm - reduction brands .
Further , they studied the effects on the mESCs of two kinds of cigarette smoke : mainstream smoke , which is smoke actively inhaled by smokers ; and sidestream smoke , which is smoke that burns off the end of a cigarette .
They found that both kinds of smoke from traditional and harm - reduction cigarettes are toxic to pre-implantation embryos and can retard growth or kill embryonic cells at this stage of development .
Equally surprising to them was their discovery that mainstream smoke and sidestream smoke from harm - reduction cigarettes are more potent than the corresponding smoke from traditional brands of cigarettes .
" This result was unexpected since harm reduction brands purportedly have lower concentrations of toxicants , " Talbot said .
" Dr. Talbot 's work significantly enhances our understanding of the harmful effects of smoking on very early pregnancy , " said Olga Genbacev , a senior scientist in the Department of Obstetrics , Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UC San Francisco , who was not involved in the research .
" This study for the first time sends a clear message to nonsmoking women of reproductive age who are planning to become pregnant that they must avoid exposure to sidestream smoke . "
Study results appear in the journal Human Reproduction ( published online , Nov. 29 ) .
The hardcopy version of the research paper is scheduled to appear in January 2009 .
" Clearly , the tobacco companies have not eliminated all toxins from harm - reduction brands of cigarettes , " said Talbot , who also is the director of the UCR Stem Cell Center .
" We found that both mainstream and sidestream smoke from traditional and harm - reduction cigarettes hindered the attachment of mESCs to extracellular materials .
Such attachment is crucial to normal embryonic development .
Moreover , cell survival and proliferation -- also necessary for embryonic growth - - were hindered as well . "
The researchers ' experiments on the mESCs showed , too , that on a per puff basis sidestream smoke was more potent than mainstream smoke in both traditional and harm - reduction brands of cigarettes .
" This may be because sidestream smoke is produced at a lower temperature and therefore contains higher concentrations of toxicants , " Talbot said .
When she and her colleagues performed the experiments directly on pre-implantation mouse embryos that had been cultured for one hour in mainstream or sidestream smoke solutions from a harm - reduction brand , they found that the effect of smoke on the embryos was similar to the effect it had on the mESCs .
" This strongly supports our use of embryonic stem cells as a valuable and effective model to study embryo toxicity during pre-implantation development , " said Sabrina Lin , a graduate student in the Cell , Molecular and Developmental Biology Program working towards her doctoral degree , and the first author of the research paper .
" This means we can use human embryonic stem cells to draw conclusions about the effect of cigarette smoke on pre-implantation human embryos . "
Next in their research , Talbot and Lin plan to conduct their experiments on human embryonic stem cells .
" To relate this research more strongly to humans , we have to use human embryonic stem cells , " Talbot said .
" Sabrina has already started working on them , and her preliminary results are similar to those with mESC . "
###
Talbot and Lin were joined in the 18 - month study by Vu Tran , who graduated from UCR in 2007 and is now at the Ross University School of Medicine , West Indies .
The Tobacco - Related Disease Research Program of the University of California provided funding for the study .
The UCR Stem Cell Center , which oversees research , teaching , and outreach activities related to stem cells , will work with faculty in UCR's School of Medicine , and broaden the university 's participation in translational applications of stem cell biology .
The UCR School of Medicine is projected to enroll its first incoming class of students in fall 2012 .
The University of California , Riverside is a doctoral research university , a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California , the state and communities around the world .
Reflecting California 's diverse culture , UCR 's enrollment of about 17,000 is expected to grow to 21,000 students by 2020 .
The campus is planning a medical school and has reached the heart of the Coachella Valley by way of the UCR Palm Desert Graduate Center .
The campus has an annual statewide economic impact of more than $ 1 billion .

In at least one obvious way , 2008 was a pretty good year in my country .
We made history in electing an African - American president .
I and 67 million of my fellow citizens brought the era of conservative dominance to a thundering close .
For those of us who 've been told for eight years that we were n't real Americans - liberals , urbanites , non-believers , cabernet - sippers , same - sex lovers , anti-war - mongerers , Volvo drivers - well , the tables have turned .
We 're the real Americans now .
But ill winds still blew , and blow , across the republic .
It being the duty of journalism to take the measure of these winds , I hereby dedicate my year - end column to ranking some of the worst Americans of the year .
It started as a bottom 10 list , but consultations with various associates persuaded me that 10 was not enough , and further research suggested that a non-round and totally capricious number better suited the exercise .
Herewith , the Tomasky List of the 19 Worst Americans of 2008 .
19 ED Hill .
Ms Hill is the Fox News anchor who referred to Barack and Michelle Obama 's on - stage fist bump in early June as a " terrorist fist jab " .
I guess she 's well familiar with the various and sundry ways in which couples express intimacy - she 's been married three times herself .
Fox announced in November that it was n't renewing her contract .
18 Don Blankenship .
Who ?
He 's the head of a huge coal - mining company that is an industry leader , if one must put it that way , in so - called mountain - top removal mining .
It 's a hideous practice that destroys mountains and communities , and Blankenship is its poster child .
Our supreme court has agreed to hear a case in which Blankenship financed the election of a state judge who , in a $ 50 m lawsuit , ruled for Blankenship 's company .
Google Caperton v Massey , read more about Massey , and tell me if this fellow should n't perhaps be even higher .
17 Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher .
The man better known as Joe the Plumber was n't a licensed plumber .
He owed back taxes .
He shocked even a Fox News anchor with his cavalier relationship to the facts .
Let 's hope he 's 14 minutes into his allotted 15 minutes of fame .
16 John Edwards .
How could a person run for president knowing that he'd cheated on his cancer - stricken wife with a woman who subsequently bore a child ?
( He denies paternity . )
What if he 'd actually won the nomination , and then this news came out ?
He gives bad judgment a bad name .
15 Heath and Deborah Campbell .
You know , the parents who named their son Adolf Hitler Campbell .
Nuff said .
14 Geraldine Ferraro .
One of the worst vice - presidential candidates in recent history distinguished herself in 2008 as one of the worst political surrogates ( for Hillary Clinton ) in recent history .
In between , she found a way to lose two Senate races that she once led by 20 points .
What a career .
13 Stephen L Johnson .
The Bush administration 's chief environmental enforcement officer is ... about what you 'd expect out of the Bush administration 's chief environmental officer .
He 's loosened rules , ignored subpoenas and been rebuked by his own staff .
12 Sam Zell .
Yes , market forces and technology are putting the American newspaper on life support , but that does n't mean that the man who bought the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times should stroll into the intensive - care unit and pull the plug .
Zell 's belief that productivity should be measured purely by word output is a death knell for intensive , investigative work that uncovers corruption .
11 David Addington .
Dick Cheney 's top aide told Congress in June that he did n't even know what the unitary executive theory of presidential power was .
This would be rather like Lavrenti Beria insisting that Lubyanka prison was actually a hotel .
10 The boys from AIG .
Less than a week after the insurance giant received an $ 85 bn federal bail - out , some AIG execs and sales reps spent $ 440,000 on a retreat at an exclusive resort , including $ 23,000 in spa charges .
Well , they were under tremendous stress , you know .
9 Eliot Spitzer .
The prostitute - visiting ex -New York governor , remember ?
Usually , when a scandal breaks , one reads the reports and starts thinking , " Well , I can see how they could wriggle out of this one . "
Even when the Lewinsky scandal broke , I could see how Bill Clinton might get out of it .
But when the Spitzer story broke , it was evident instantly that he was dead meat .
8 Dick Cheney .
Just because .
If he lives to be 99 - and he's not as old as he looks : can you believe , for instance , that he 's younger than Ringo ? - and I 'm still doing this column , something tells me he 'll always find his way on the list .
It 'll take that long to undo the damage he 's done to flag and country .
7 Steve Schmidt .
John McCain did n't make the list , but his chief campaign strategist has earned an indisputable spot .
He displayed a rare combination of incompetence , tone - deafness and cynicism .
He 's only as low as number eight because it did n't work .
6 Joe Lieberman .
It 's not that the Connecticut senator backed McCain .
It 's the way he did it , the way he does everything - the self - regard , the pride , the arrogation to himself of some kind of moral authority that he in fact does not have any more ( even if he once did , itself a debatable proposition ) .
Do n't take it from me .
Take it from his constituents , who ignored him to the tune of supporting Obama by a 22 - point margin .
5 Michele Bachmann .
Of the many memorable moments the campaign produced , I will never forget watching this Minnesota congresswoman say on national TV in October that Obama " may have anti-American views " and endorse the idea of a media investigation of all members of Congress to determine whether their views were sufficiently pro-American .
The single most appalling political statement of the year .
4 Rod Blagojevich .
" Whatever I say is always lawful , whatever I 'm interested in doing is always lawful . "
Uh-huh .
Depending on what comes out at his trial , he 's a strong contender for an even higher spot in 2009 .
3 George Bush .
There were years when he would have been higher - 2000 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .
I 'll give him a slight pass for 2001 , what with the attacks and all that .
In those previous years , he stole an election , started an unnecessary war , lied about it , approved torture , let a great US city drown and so on .
This year he merely presided over the bankruptcy of the global economy .
Twenty days and counting .
2 Sarah Palin .
Does she really deserve to be this high ?
Never in my adult lifetime has one politician so perfectly embodied everything that is malign about my country : the proto - fascist nativism , the know - nothingism , the utterly cavalier lack of knowledge about the actual principles on which the country was founded .
So , heck , you betcha she does !
1 Bernard Madoff .
It 's pronounced " made - off " .
Could Dickens have named him better ?
Bilking people and institutions out of $ 50bn is a pretty surefire way to make yourself No 1 with a bullet on anyone 's year - end bad guys ' list .
Well , here 's to a better 2009 , for America , the world , and you and yours .
And keep yer nose clean .

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics have detected what seems to be a magnetar .
What makes this discovery unique is that the object observed emitted radiation in the visible part of the spectrum , not in the x-ray and gamma wavelengths typical of magnetars .
The rapid changes in the magnetar ’s activity suggest the radiation is n’t thermal , but caused by a different process not yet understood .
At 20:52 UT on June 10 , 2007 the Burst Alert Telescope aboard NASA ’s Swift satellite detected a possible gamma ray burst 5 seconds long .
Initial studies of this radiation by a group of scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics ( MPE ) suggested this was not a standard gamma ray burst , but something different .
Seven minutes after the first detection optical observation of the object began and it remained observed for the next 5 nights .
The high resolution tracking of the object ’s brightness was done with OPTIMA , a high speed photometer built by MPE and mounted at the 1.3 m Telescope of the Skinakas Observatory in Crete .
The system detectors enable the recording of each photon ’s arrival time at an accuracy of four millionths of a second .
This enabled the scientists to reconstruct in detail the object ’s changes in brightness .
The data collected showed a number of bright flares that rose rapidly followed by slower decay .
The source in fact changed its brightness by a factor of over 200 in a mere four seconds .
Study of the light ’s behavior led to the estimate that the object has a radius of no more than a tenth the radius of the sun .
In addition , it was discovered that this object lies within the Milky Way galaxy , providing further contradictory evidence to the source being a gamma ray burst as these rarely lie within our own galaxy .
The speedy changes in the object ’s luminosity in high probability rule out a thermal process as the cause of these emissions , as the object would n’t be able to heat up and cool down so rapidly .
This suggests that the object observed was a magnetar , a neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field .
As Alexander Stefanescu , a member of the OPTIMA team explained , “ The only possible conclusion was that we had observed a non- thermal process : light that is not produced by heat as in a light - bulb or in a candle , but for example , by particles in a magnetic field . ”
If the object observed was indeed a magnetar , this detection constitutes the first observation of optical flares in a magnetar , as they usually radiate x-rays and gamma-rays .
Not only did the object glow in the optical spectrum , but no x-ray radiation was detected at the corresponding times .
Since to date most magnetar observations were in the high energy band and not in the visible energy region , the theory behind such emissions has been somewhat neglected .
“ We know 15 other magnetars , but up to now , no optical flashes of these have ever been seen , ” says Stefanescu .
“ Accordingly , the main efforts of theoreticians were made in the high - energy regime .
That ’s why we do n’t have an adequate theory with which to compare the observations from OPTIMA . ”
One proposed theory suggests that emission in the microwave and radio wavelengths was emitted near the neutron star and then absorbed higher in the magnetosphere by ions .
These ions in turn re-emit in optical wavelengths .
This theory , along with others , must be studied in depth before a complete understanding of the observed object and its behavior can be reached .
TFOT reported on NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope ’s recent discovery of a magnetar , which may help scientists figure out whether a star ’s mass determines if it becomes a magnetar when it dies .
Another related article covers NASA ’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observation of a pulsing neutron star acting like a magnetar .
This discovery can shed light on the mysterious evolutionary relationship between pulsars and magnetars .
NASA ’s Swift satellite , which made the initial discovery of the object discussed above , was also the satellite that enabled the first real time observation of a supernova .
Further information on the recent discovery , which was published in the September 25th issue of Nature magazine , can be found in the Max Planck Society press release and in the Arxiv website .

As Barack Obama ponders whom to pick as agriculture secretary , he should reframe the question .
What he needs is actually a bold reformer in a position renamed “ secretary of food . ”
A Department of Agriculture made sense 100 years ago when 35 percent of Americans engaged in farming .
But today , fewer than 2 percent are farmers .
In contrast , 100 percent of Americans eat .
Renaming the department would signal that Mr. Obama seeks to move away from a bankrupt structure of factory farming that squanders energy , exacerbates climate change and makes Americans unhealthy  all while costing taxpayers billions of dollars .
“ We ’re subsidizing the least healthy calories in the supermarket  high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated soy oil , and we ’re doing very little for farmers trying to grow real food , ” notes Michael Pollan , author of such books as “ The Omnivore ’s Dilemma ” and “ In Defense of Food . ”
Zinc Oxide Breakthrough Creates High Performing LEDs
December 9th , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
German scientists have discovered a method of hydrogen doping that allows the production of higher - performing LEDs and other semiconductors .
Check out this HOT story : Los Angeles Installing 140,000 New LED Streelights Starting June ’09
The scientists provided evidence that hydrogen disturbs the process of doping with zinc oxide ( ZnO ) .
But a controlled concentration of hydrogen atoms might be the key to making use of ZnO in semiconductor production .
Doping is necessary to activate semiconductors .
It involves inserting foreign atoms into the crystal lattice of a solid .
These foreign atoms either release an electron ( n - doping ) , or absorb an electron , thus creating a “ hole ” in the solid ( p - doping ) .
Scientists have really struggled with p-doping and hydrogen .
hydrogen atoms always result in n-doping .
And according to ScienceDaily , this disturbs the process greatly .
Stupid hydrogen !
P - doping is necessary to create LEDs and transistors .
By the way , zinc oxide is everywhere – thousands of tons are produced all over the world every year !
It is used in everything from food to sunscreen .
Okay , that ’s kinda gross .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Amid fresh signs that the nation is in recession -- and yet another jaw - dropping decline in the stock market -- Congress is gearing up to enact a new economic stimulus plan to help ordinary Americans .
But getting quick bipartisan agreement and White House support to help consumers is far from certain .
The battle could be even tougher than the one that played out last month over the $ 700 - billion rescue plan for the financial system .
Democrats and Republicans have starkly different views of what a stimulus package should contain , and President Bush has signaled his opposition to some of the key ideas being floated .
What could force compromise is the outpouring of evidence that the nation is headed for tough times even if the financial system should begin to stabilize .

The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 700 points Wednesday after the government reported that retail sales sank 1.2 % in September , the third straight monthly decline and the largest such pullback since 2005 .
The unexpectedly steep drop was an ominous sign heading into the crucial holiday shopping season and comes as more Americans are losing their jobs .
“ I believe the economy is now in a recession , ” said Richard DeKaser , chief economist at banking firm National City Corp. in Cleveland .
“ What today ’s retail sales report implies is that it will be steeper than many of us had feared . ”
The grim retail sales report coincided with a warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , who told a group of economists in New York that the government ’s plan to infuse $ 250 billion into the banking system was n’t a cure - all .

“ Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step , but even if they stabilize as we hope they will , broader economic recovery will not happen right away , ” Bernanke said .
He added that the Fed would continue to use all available tools to support the economy , leaving open the possibility of additional interest rate cuts .
Key members of both parties in Congress believe the government must find a way to put more money into the hands of average Americans , especially with consumer spending accounting for more than two - thirds of gross domestic product .
“ Clearly , a significant initiative is required to promote job creation and economic growth , ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) wrote to Democratic members this week .
“ I agree wholeheartedly that Congress should take additional measures to get our economy back on track , and we should not wait until January , ” said House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .

The question is whether Congress can unite behind a stimulus plan before a new president takes office .
If not , substantial pump - priming might not take effect until the spring or summer , a delay that could intensify the pain for many people .
Though it ’s better late than never , the delay could hurt many struggling Americans , said Christian E. Weller , an associate public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts in Boston .
“ We ’ve now , I think , avoided at least a major financial crisis , but we have n’t done enough on the economic side to avoid a major recession , ” he said .
“ In the end , there are hundreds of thousands of people who wo n’t be helped if it ’s delayed for five or six months , ” said Weller , who supports a broad stimulus package .
What makes quick agreement problematic is that the two parties have very different ideas about what a plan should contain .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) unveiled a $ 150 - billion package that mirrors a stimulus proposal made by Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama this week .
It includes spending on infrastructure projects , such as roads and school construction , extending unemployment benefits , providing energy assistance to low - income families and offering tax breaks to encourage businesses to hire more workers .
It would also require the federal government to be “ more aggressive ” in using its authority to push lenders to reduce foreclosures by renegotiating mortgage loans .
House Democrats have been discussing a similar package that would also help states with such costs as healthcare for the poor via Medicaid .
Pelosi asked committee heads to hold hearings on such provisions and Bernanke is already scheduled to testify at one such event Monday .

Republicans , by contrast , favor tax cuts , including suspending the capital gains levy , lowering the corporate tax rate and providing federal guarantees on interbank lending .
Among other things , they believe such measures would help create jobs .
“ Our constituents are not looking at the mess in Washington or Wall Street and asking for the federal government to take care of other governments , ” Boehner said .
“ They are not asking for a one - term accounting fix to Medicaid , or pork - barrel spending masquerading as stimulus . ”
For his part , Bush , speaking Wednesday at a deli in the hard - hit state of Michigan , argued that the government ’s plan to inject billions of dollars directly into banks and buy “ toxic ” mortgage - backed securities would help workers and businesses .

“ I was worried that if we did not do something about the financial situation , the economics would affect a lot of hardworking people all throughout our country , including right here in western Michigan , ” Bush said in Ada , outside Grand Rapids .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that Bush would consider economic stimulus proposals but has objections to some components advocated by Democrats , such as extending unemployment benefits and funding infrastructure projects .
Sen . Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , the top Republican on the Budget Committee and the Senate GOP ’s lead negotiator on the bailout , said he would resist another stimulus package .
“ I would hope that common sense would prevail and that we would n’t simply do another package that is going to dramatically aggravate what is going to be our really next major fiscal crisis , which is the size of this deficit we ’re headed toward , ” he said .

The parties could come together , as they did earlier in the year , in passing a stimulus package that included tax rebates .
And their effort could be aided by taking up a bill after the election , in a less partisan atmosphere .
Outside groups are stepping up their efforts to pressure lawmakers to act .
Stephen E. Sandherr , chief executive of the Associated General Contractors of America , wrote to Pelosi this week touting the role construction projects can play in stimulating the economy and arguing that more than 3,000 highway projects could start in 30 to 90 days if Congress appropriated the $ 18 billion needed to fund them .
Tracy Mullin , president of the National Retail Federation , wrote to congressional leaders Wednesday calling for them to return to Washington after the election to put money in the hands of consumers .

“ Consumer confidence has been badly eroded by the foundering economy and instability of the financial markets , ” Mullin said .
But fear of economic turmoil could limit the effect of sending tax rebate checks directly to consumers , said Gary Schlossberg , senior economist at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco .
“ Even if you get the tax rebate , you still have to make the decision of whether you save it or spend it , and I think the portion that saves will be larger if you still have the cloud of the financial markets hanging over us , ” he said .
Schlossberg favors tax cuts instead of rebate checks , which he said only temporarily boosted consumer spending in the spring , after the government mailed them out as part of a $ 168 - billion stimulus package .
Advertisement
But Douglas W. Elmendorf , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former economist for the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department , said temporary stimulus still helps the economy .
He opposes tax cuts as too slow to lead to a burst of new spending and said infrastructure projects also will not work fast enough .
But giving money directly to states such as California , which must slash spending in a downturn because they are forced to balance their budgets , “ would be a very powerful boost to the economy . ”
Elmendorf said Congress and the Bush administration were right to focus on Wall Street first but now must turn their attention to average Americans .

“ I think it was appropriate to deal with financial issues first because the financial system was becoming unglued on a daily basis .
And you ca n’t do everything at once , ” he said .
“ But I think fiscal stimulus should be a very high priority at this point . ”

The suicide rate among young male veterans who served during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan reached a record high in 2006 , the latest year for which records are available , according to data released on Tuesday by the Department of Veterans Affairs , USA Today reports .
According to the data , the suicide rate among male veterans ages 18 to 29 who use VA services increased to 46 suicides per 100,000 in 2006 , compared with a rate of 20 per 100,000 among male civilians in the same age group .
The data also indicate that 141 male veterans who left the military after Sept. 11 , 2001 , committed suicide between 2002 and 2005 , compared with 113 in 2006 .
The data did not specify the number of those 113 veterans who were in combat .
VA released the data in conjunction with a study conducted by a committee panel of mental health experts appointed by VA Secretary James Peake from the Army , the Department of Defense , CDC and NIH .
In a statement , Peake said that VA will follow the recommendations issued by the panel to help reduce the number of suicides among veterans .
The panel recommends that VA :
* Design a study that identifies suicide risks among veterans ;

* Increase efforts to screen veterans with depression or post - traumatic stress disorder for suicide risk ; and
* Improve efforts to prescribe appropriate medications to treat depression , suicidal behavior and PTSD among veterans .
Peake said that VA will design such a study in 30 days and that the department will begin a trial system to screen veterans for suicide risk on Oct.

Dave Autry , a spokesperson for the Disabled American Veterans , said , " We 've been telling Congress and the ( VA ) for a long time that what we have seen are increasing numbers of mental health issues that have not been adequately addressed " ( Zoroya , USA Today , 9/9 ) .

When asked on last night ’s ‘ Late Show with David Letterman ’ about French reaction to the recent election of President - elect Barack Obama , Bruni gushed : “ Oh !
France is thrilled … yes , delighted .
I think the whole world is delighted . ”
When asked how her husband , the President of France gets along with Bush she said : “ They have to … No choice . ” which was met with audience laughter and applause .
The Senate hopes to revive the rescue plan by packaging it with popular tax breaks and aid to rural schools .
Senate bailout bill keeps growing
The Senate hopes to revive Treasury ’s $ 700 billion financial rescue plan Wednesday night by packaging it together with more than $ 100 billion in popular tax breaks as well as aid to rural schools important to House Republicans .
To calm voters fearful of bank failures , the $ 100,000 cap on federal insurance for deposits would also be raised to $ 250,000 — a concession backed by both parties but also aimed at community banks who can be helpful in building small town support for the larger bill .

With each permutation , the bill has steadily grown in size .
Treasury ’s initial plan was about three pages long .
The House version , which failed , stretched to 110 .
The Senate substitute now runs over 450 pages .
And tucked away in the tax provisions is a landmark health care provision demanding that insurance companies provide coverage for mental health treatment — such as hospitalization — on parity with physical illnesses .
Really a bill onto itself , the mental health parity measure has been a bipartisan priority for top lawmakers in both chambers but has stalled because of disagreements again over how to pay for its estimated $ 3.8 billion five - year cost .
In the current climate , that seems to be no longer a stumbling block , and if the Treasury plan becomes law , it will also .
Both presidential candidates , Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama , are slated to return for two important roll calls Wednesday evening , and Obama appears to be playing an increased role in shoring up support among House Democrats after the bill failed Monday .
Proponents hope a strong Senate vote — with support from both candidates — will marginalize the opponents in the House , which could vote Friday on the revised package .
In early trading Wednesday , the Dow was holding steady .
More important perhaps in the credit markets , the London inter - bank offer rate or Libor , which influences what charge in borrowing from one another , had dropped by 3 points — after spiking Monday night in the wake of the House defeat .
When the Treasury plan went down in the House , it was clearly hurt by the public perception that it was nothing more than a costly bailout for Wall Street .
And since then there has been a more concerted effort by proponents to broaden grassroots support around the nation .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has begun radio ads targeted at lawmakers .
The Republican and Democratic chairmen of national governors associations for the two parties released a joint letter Wednesday urging Congress to act .
And the courtship of community banks — by raising the insurance level for deposits –builds on a decision over the weekend to also include tax breaks for local banks which were hurt by the government takeover of the two mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Senate leaders are confident that they can prevail , but the strategy is not without risks in the House given the added costs of the tax package .
Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate that the net impact will be to add almost $ 105 billion to an already large deficit next year , and fiscal conservatives will feel they are being straight - armed by the Senate which has refused to do more to offset the costs .
The biggest single piece in the package is an extension of protections for millions of middle class families who would otherwise find themselves exposed to the higher levy under the alternative minimum tax .
This alone accounts for about three quarters of the cost or $ 78.8 billion in 2009 .
Almost $ 14 billion more can be attributed to a variety of tax break extensions important to business , including the R&E credit worth about $ 8.4 billion in 2009 .
The rural school aid is smaller — about $ 3.3 billion over the next five years — but has great importance for many Western communities and could be important then in the House .
Yet many House Democrats are already upset that Republicans and the White House had rejected their effort to require Treasury to impose a fee on Wall Street transactions in five years to help recoup any taxpayer losses .
The expanded Senate package would compound this loss and puts Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Cal. ) in an awkward spot since she has vowed to stand up for these moderates in her caucus .
“ The Senate has made a decision about how to proceed and what can pass that body , " Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday night .
" The Senate will vote tomorrow night and the Congress will work its will .
House Democrats remain strongly committed to a comprehensive bill that stabilizes the financial markets , restores confidence , and protects taxpayers , and we hope Congress can agree on legislation in the very near future . "
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) also warned on Wednesday morning that adding tax extenders might cause Democratic votes to drop of .
Speaking on The Today Show on NBC , Hoyer said he was “ not particularly pleased ” that the Senate has decided to add a set of tax breaks to the bailout package .
" There 's no doubt the tax package is very controversial , " Hoyer said .
Soon after the defeat in the House Monday , the administration and leadership began exploring ways to revive Treasury ’s plan in the Senate , where it has enjoyed more bipartisan support .
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) took the lead but he was also helped by the fact that his chief negotiator on the Treasury bill , Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) enjoys a good humored , working relationship with Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. )
“ The voters sent us here to respond to crises , not to ignore them , " McConnell said .
" And if you fail the first time , you get back up , and you work with each other . ”
Reid had been fearful that he would be drawn into prolonged negotiations about changes in the core Treasury plan .
But the decision to raise the cap on insurance for savings deposits won wide support Tuesday , and as a practical matter , all sides know they must deal with the tax extenders now or risk having to come back into session after the November elections .
“ This is a brilliant move by Harry , and I believe it will help pick up votes on both sides of the aisle , ” said Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y . )
How brilliant will rest on the House reaction .
The White House itself was somewhat apprehensive Tuesday night until it has seen a better vote count .
And if Pelosi starts to lose Democrats who voted for the bill Monday , that means the burden will be even greater on House Republicans to increase their numbers from the 65 who backed the plan then .
Last Wednesday night we received a text message out of Miami from a source working the BCS Championship .
“ Dude , did you know Erin Andrews had a sister ? ”
Or something like that .
Yes , we knew that , was the response .
But there was never a really good time to bring Kendra ( a professional dancer and a Florida State grad ) into the fray – until now that Dan Patrick ’s web portal over at SI is bragging that the former ESPNer spent his Thursday night in a luxury box with the infamous Andrews ’ sisters .
Straight from the source ’s handlers …
Dan watched the BCS title game with Erin Andrews and her sister in a private suite last night .
Not bad .
So , of course over the last two days our stat counter started going nuts with “ Erin Andrews Sister ” searches .
You guys want to see ?
We put our little greasy freelance Indian researchers to work this weekend and have a few photos of Ms. Kendra .
Kendra for H2O magazine circa 2007 .
[ Credit ]
We ’re not sure where to take this post because , let ’s face it , you really just want to see Kendra and by now are n’t even reading anything about how she graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance .
Or that “ she performed works by Lynda Davis , Alex Ketley , Brent Schneider , Jack Clark , and Millicent Johnnie .
In addition , she danced for Dance Reparatory Theatre , the Golden Girls dance team , and PHLAVA Dance Co . ”
While the professional dancer look is hot , we ’re just not sure the muscular , “ I ’d beat your ass ” look is for us .
Not that we would n’t stop on a dime while watching BET if Kendra was in one of those ass in the air car wash videos .
BC has never wavered from the “ Erin Andrews was put on this planet for a reason , ” stance .
Still , this sister tandem is officially on the radar .
Thanks , Dan .
Just last week I was noting that Janet Porter had squandered whatever tiny shred remained of her credibility when she joined the crackpot right - wing conspiracy theory that Barack Obama ( if that is his real name ) was not a natural born citizen of the United States and was therefore ineligible to be President .
Today , she takes to the pages of WorldNetDaily , the home of insane right - wing ravings , to explain as cleary as she can that the very existence of the nation is at stake if Obama is not stopped and that “ the gallows for our freedoms are already being built ” :
The good news is the real election has n’t taken place yet .
The Electoral College does n’t meet until Dec. 15 .
That gives us less than a month to find the answers to the looming questions regarding whether Barack Obama meets the constitutional requirements for the office of president …
If you believe in life , liberty and the family , you already are a target .
The henchmen are selected ; the gallows for our freedoms are already being built .
And the only candidate in history to never move an inch to the center during the campaign has no intentions of changing his agenda of outlawing our viewpoint with the “ unfairness doctrine , ” “ thought crimes , ” “ The Employment Non Discrimination Act ” the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and all the rest .
As I wrote about in my book , “ The Criminalization of Christianity ” ( which will surely come true if we do n’t act now ) , “ Never fail to do the right thing for fear that the opposition will attack you in response .
The other side can and will attack you anyway , at a time of their own choosing rather than yours , regardless of whether you act ” …
In four years , we wo n’t be able to recognize what ’s left of our country .
And if you think taking on this issue right now is hard , try doing it when our radio airwaves are shut down and our freedoms are stripped from us , as he has promised to do .
And with Obama ’s promise to pass the so - called Freedom of Choice Act as “ the first thing ” he does , you can say goodbye to the notion of protecting unborn children again – and goodbye to every law in all 50 states that notifies parents , keeps our tax dollars from footing the abortion bill and prevents even a single partial - birth abortion … With God , all things are possible .
Eight years ago the election was called for Al Gore , and he never took office .
If God is the same today as He was yesterday , He can still split the sea , raise the dead , stop the sun and reverse the results of the popular vote if the basic requirements of the Constitution are not met in the candidate .
Also pushing the case that Obama is ineligible for the office is Alan Keyes and his running mate Wiley Drake , who are claiming that they are really doing Obama a favor by trying to eliminate any “ doubt as to the legitimacy of his tenure ” :
In response to questions about why the suit was being filed , Ambassador Alan Keyes commented , “ I and others are concerned that this issue be properly investigated and decided before Senator Obama takes office .
Otherwise there will be a serious doubt as to the legitimacy of his tenure .
This doubt would also affect the respect people have for the Constitution as the supreme law of the land .
I hope the issue can be quickly clarified so that the new President can take office under no shadow of doubt .
This will be good for him and for the nation . ”
The scary thing is that these people and their views are not only not shunned by the Republican Party and its right - wing base , but are actually embraced – after all , Porter was co-chair of Mike Huckabee ’s Faith and Family Values Coalition during his presidential campaign and Keyes was once the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Illinois .
As many people will have read there was a glitch in the surface temperature record reporting for October .
For many Russian stations ( and some others ) , September temperatures were apparently copied over into October , giving an erroneous positive anomaly .
The error appears to have been made somewhere between the reporting by the National Weather Services and NOAA ’s collation of the GHCN database .
GISS , which produces one of the more visible analyses of this raw data , processed the input data as normal and ended up with an October anomaly that was too high .
That analysis has now been pulled ( in under 24 hours ) while they await a correction of input data from NOAA ( Update : now ( partially ) completed ) .
There were 90 stations for which October numbers equalled September numbers in the corrupted GHCN file for 2008 ( out of 908 ) .
This compares with an average of about 16 stations each year in the last decade ( some earlier years have bigger counts , but none as big as this month , and are much less as a percentage of stations ) .
These other cases seem to be mostly legitimate tropical stations where there is n’t much of a seasonal cycle .
That makes it a little tricky to automatically scan for this problem , but putting in a check for the total number or percentage is probably sensible going forward .
It ’s clearly true that the more eyes there are looking , the faster errors get noticed and fixed .
The cottage industry that has sprung up to examine the daily sea ice numbers or the monthly analyses of surface and satellite temperatures , has certainly increased the number of eyes and that is generally for the good .
Whether it ’s a discovery of an odd shift in the annual cycle in the UAH MSU - LT data , or this flub in the GHCN data , or the USHCN / GHCN merge issue last year , the extra attention has led to improvements in many products .
Nothing of any consequence has changed in terms of our understanding of climate change , but a few more i’s have been dotted and t’s crossed .
But unlike in other fields of citizen - science ( astronomy or phenology spring to mind ) , the motivation for the temperature observers is heavily weighted towards wanting to find something wrong .
As we discussed last year , there is a strong yearning among some to want to wake up tomorrow and find that the globe has n’t been warming , that the sea ice has n’t melted , that the glaciers have not receded and that indeed , CO 2 is not a greenhouse gas .
Thus when mistakes occur ( and with science being a human endeavour , they always will ) the exuberance of the response can be breathtaking – and quite telling .
A few examples from the comments at Watt ’s blog will suffice to give you a flavour of the conspiratorial thinking : “ I believe they had two sets of data :
One would be released if Republicans won , and another if Democrats won. ” , “ could this be a sneaky way to set up the BO presidency with an urgent need to regulate CO2 ? ” , “ There are a great many of us who will under no circumstance allow the oppression of government rule to pervade over our freedom — - PERIOD !!!!!! ” ( exclamation marks reduced enormously ) , “ these people are blinded by their own bias ” , “ this sort of scientific fraud ” , “ Climate science on the warmer side has degenerated to competitive lying ” , etc … ( To be fair , there were people who made sensible comments as well ) .
The amount of simply made up stuff is also impressive – the GISS press release declaring the October the ‘ warmest ever ’ ?
Imaginary ( GISS only puts out press releases on the temperature analysis at the end of the year ) .
The headlines trumpeting this result ?
Non-existent .
One clearly sees the relief that finally the grand conspiracy has been rumbled , that the mainstream media will get it ’s comeuppance , and that surely now , the powers that be will listen to those voices that had been crying in the wilderness .
Alas !
none of this will come to pass .
In this case , someone ’s programming error will be fixed and nothing will change except for the reporting of a single month ’s anomaly .
No heads will roll , no congressional investigations will be launched , no politicians ( with one possible exception ) will take note .
This will undoubtedly be disappointing to many , but they should comfort themselves with the thought that the chances of this error happening again has now been diminished .
Which is good , right ?
In contrast to this molehill , there is an excellent story about how the scientific community really deals with serious mismatches between theory , models and data .
That piece concerns the ‘ ocean cooling ’ story that was all the rage a year or two ago .
An initial analysis of a new data source ( the Argo float network ) had revealed a dramatic short term cooling of the oceans over only 3 years .
The problem was that this did n’t match the sea level data , nor theoretical expectations .
Nonetheless , the paper was published ( somewhat undermining claims that the peer - review system is irretrievably biased ) to great acclaim in sections of the blogosphere , and to more muted puzzlement elsewhere .
With the community ’s attention focused on this issue , it was n’t however long before problems turned up in the Argo floats themselves , but also in some of the other measurement devices – particularly XBTs .
It took a couple of years for these things to fully work themselves out , but the most recent analyses show far fewer of the artifacts that had plagued the ocean heat content analyses in the past .
A classic example in fact , of science moving forward on the back of apparent mismatches .
Unfortunately , the resolution ended up favoring the models over the initial data reports , and so the whole story is horribly disappointing to some .
Which brings me to my last point , the role of models .
It is clear that many of the temperature watchers are doing so in order to show that the IPCC - class models are wrong in their projections .
However , the direct approach of downloading those models , running them and looking for flaws is clearly either too onerous or too boring .
Even downloading the output ( from here or here ) is eschewed in favour of firing off Freedom of Information
Act requests for data already publicly available – very odd .
For another example , despite a few comments about the lack of sufficient comments in the GISS ModelE code ( a complaint I also often make ) , I am unaware of anyone actually independently finding any errors in the publicly available Feb 2004 version ( and I know there are a few ) .
Instead , the anti-model crowd focuses on the minor issues that crop up every now and again in real - time data processing hoping that , by proxy , they ’ll find a problem with the models .
I say good luck to them .
They ’ll need it .

Jamie Boyle , of the Duke Center for the Public Domain , has a new book out , The Public Domain : Enclosing the Commons of the Mind .
Boyle ranks with Lessig , Benkler and Zittrain as one of the most articulate , thoughtful , funny and passionate thinkers in the global fight for free speech , open access , and a humane and sane policy on patents , trademarks and copyrights .
A legal scholar who can do schtick like a stand - up comedian , Boyle is entertaining as well as informative .

For one of my students it
was United States Patent number 6,004,596 for a " Sealed Crustless
Sandwich . "
In the curiously mangled form of English that patent law
produces , it was described this way :
A sealed crustless sandwich for providing a convenient sandwich without
an outer crust which can be stored for long periods of time without a
central filling from leaking outwardly .
The sandwich includes a lower
bread portion , an upper bread portion , an upper filling and a lower filling
between the lower and upper bread portions , a center filling sealed be -
tween the upper and lower fillings , and a crimped edge along an outer
perimeter of the bread portions for sealing the fillings there between .
The
upper and lower fillings are preferably comprised of peanut butter and
the center filling is comprised of at least jelly .
The center filling is pre-
vented from radiating outwardly into and through the bread portions
from the surrounding peanut butter .

Rocker Eric Clapton is a fan of shooting trips in the countryside - because the outings help him bond with like - minded people .
The star is the co-owner of London shop Cordings , a supplier of hunting and fishing supplies , and admits he often indulges in trips to bag game .
And Clapton is adamant he has learnt a lot from his favourite pastime .
He says , " I 'm not really that gregarious .
And shooting with groups of people up and down the country has taught me a lot about how to get on with my fellow human beings . "
The musician recently cleared out his gun cabinet , selling 13 pieces off at auction in Britain .
Clapton insists he had to get rid of the weapons , because he became hooked on collecting them .
He adds , " It is following the same pattern as when I collected guitars - I get obsessed , then engulfed and finally narrow the collection down . "
Oil is far below the record of $ 147 a barrel reached in July
Oil prices have tumbled by more than $ 5 a barrel after producers ' group Opec declined to cut output at its informal meeting at the weekend .
Extending recent falls , US light crude was down $ 5.15 to $ 49.28 a barrel , while Brent was $ 5.52 lower at $ 47.97 .
The falls came despite Opec saying it may vote on a " major " output cut at its next regular meeting later this month .
Opec added it would trim output if prices continued to " deteriorate " towards the end of the year .
Falling steadily
Oil prices have fallen back steadily from July 's all - time high of $ 147 a barrel , as demand has declined on the back of the slowing worldwide economy .
Demand is disappearing underneath them fast
Energy analyst Victor Shum
" If we see the market is deteriorating we will make a major action in Algeria and anywhere if necessary , " said Opec secretary general Abdalla Salem El - Badri .
Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah said at the weekend that oil prices should be above $ 75 a barrel , but oil analysts believe this would be hard to achieve .
" They need to cut a lot to get the price to $ 75 , " said Victor Shum , an energy analyst with consultancy Purvin & Gertz in Singapore .
" Demand is disappearing underneath them fast . "
Iranian calculation
Iran 's Oil Minister Gholam Hossein Nozari has estimated that the global market is currently oversupplied by about 2 million barrels per day .
He now wants Opec to cut production by the same amount .
The producers ' group , which is responsible for 40 % of global crude supplies , last cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day in October .
Opec comprises 12 countries - Algeria , Angola , Ecuador , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , and Venezuela .
RedCloth is a module for using Textile in Ruby .
Textile is a simple text format that can be converted to HTML , eliminating the need to use HTML directly to create documents , blogs , or web pages .
The new version 4 promises to be faster and without the bugs from version 3 .
And indeed it feels more reliable and many of the earlier security concers have now been dealt with .
For example :
RedCloth.new ( “ < script> alert (1) </ script >” ) .
to_html
now returns
< script>alert(1)</ script >
instead of
< script>alert(1)</ script >
in earlier versions .
And it ’s good that it escapes the input instead of deleting malicious parts .
I tried many examples from the XSS cheatsheet and hand - crafted ones .
The result is that nearly no malicious parts get through .
Yes nearly .
The < code > tag gets through :
RedCloth.new (‘< code onmouseover= ” bad_code_here ” > asdf</code >’ , [ : filter_html ] ) .to_html
< code onmouseover = ” bad_code_here ” > asdf </ code >
I ’ve created a ticket for that .
Also remember that CSS injection will work in textile , if you allow styles .
See the earlier post for that .
Nevertheless the new version is far better .
And in combination with a whitelist ( namely Rails ’ sanitize ( ) method ) it is even secure .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The pilot aboard U.S. Airways Flight 1549 came over the speaker system and told passengers " brace for impact . "
One passenger turned on his cell phone so his body could be found with its GPS tracking .
Others reflected on their lives .
i Reporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the crash scene on the Hudson River .

Survivors said it was about 20 seconds later when the plane struck the water of the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon .
Each of them lauded the heroics of the pilot , Chesley B. " Sully " Sullenberger III .
Here are survivor accounts in their own words :
Watch message to pilot : " I 'll buy you a beer " »
Vince Spera
" He 's the man !
He 's absolutely the man .
...
If you want to talk to a hero , get ahold of him because that is the hero in this whole deal . "
Spera described " the moment of impact " : " Have you ever been in a speedboat and hit some wake ?
That 's what it felt like , when you go over the wake and you hit the water again .
...
It was n't that bad of an impact , which was strange .
And then after that , there was n't a lot of yelling and screaming .
It was fairly orderly getting off the plane . "
Valerie Collins
As the pilot announced the plane was going down , Collins grabbed her cell phone .
" I grabbed my phone and turned it on and got my husband 's name and texted him , ' My flight is crashing , ' because I wanted him to know I was thinking of him and , also , I did n't want there to be this , if it did turn out terrible , a time where he was trying to figure out if I was on there or not . "
Collins described trying to exit from the back of the plane and the problems a flight attendant had .
" She had tried to open both of the back doors and could n't get them open because of the water pressure .
But they were open enough that the water was flowing in .
And all of a sudden , she said , ' We 're in the water , go to the wings . '
And she looked at me and she said , ' We have two minutes . ' "
Andrew Jamison
" God was certainly looking out for all of us . "
Watch one describe how " the engine blew " »
Brad Wentzell
Wentzell cried when talking about returning home to snuggle with his young daughter .
" When I get home , I am going to take my nose and put it by her ear , her little warm body and give her a nice kiss from Daddy .
I 'm alive .
That 's it .
I do n't have much else to say . "
" We have a second chance in life . "
See photos of the " Miracle on the Hudson " »
Carl Bazariane
" We were all looking to see how we were gonna die .
It was really strange . "
On the crash landing , he said , " Usually in moments like that , you would expect chaos .
It got really quiet and nobody said a word .
There was a child crying .
That was about it .
That was understandable . "
Joe Hart
He said passengers did n't panic on the plane .
It was only after the crash when things got chaotic , he said .
" It 's when we got outside and in the cold water .
And I mean the water was cold .
Within seconds , my legs were numb , standing in the cold water . "

" We 're just happy to be around .
We 're just happy to be around . "
Jeff Kolodjay
" The plane started filling with water pretty quick .
...
It was scary .
There was a lady with her baby on my left - hand shoulder , and she was crawling over the seats . "
Alberto Panero
On the " brace for impact " moment : " That 's the only thing that was said .
I guess that 's probably a better thing so that people did n't panic .
But at the time , he said it so calmly .
From that point until we hit the water , it was pretty quick . "
He said he turned on his cell phone before impact so that his body could be found via GPS .
Panero added , " We just hit , and somehow the plane stayed afloat , and we were able to get on the raft .
It 's just incredible right now that everybody 's still alive . "
Fred Berretta
" I think a lot of people started praying and just collecting themselves , " Berretta said .
" It was quite stunning . "
He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart , but it did n't .
" It was a great landing , " he said .

WEST PALM BEACH , Fla. , Dec. 11 ( UPI ) --
An attorney for an incarcerated woman said his client lost out on alimony from her Florida husband because a court ruled her cellmate is a cohabitant .
Attorney Steven Cripps said he was disturbed by Andrew Craissati 's attempt to avoid alimony payments to his ex-wife , Patricia , by claiming her current cellmate honored a cohabitation clause in their divorce agreement , The Palm Beach ( Fla . )
Post said Wednesday .

But Cripps said that notion was nothing compared to the impact the 4th District Court of Appeal 's support of the request could have on the legal community .
" It goes to show the most winnable case is losable and the most losable case is winnable , " the attorney said after Wednesday 's ruling .
Under the terms of their divorce , Craissati could stop alimony payments to his ex-wife if she remarried or was deemed to have lived with a cohabitant for at least three months .

One of the moons in our solar system that scientists think has the potential to harbor life may have a far more dynamic ocean than previously thought .
If the moon Europa is tilted on its axis even slightly as it orbits the giant planet Jupiter , then Jupiter 's gravitational pull could be creating powerful waves in Europa 's ocean , according to Robert Tyler , an oceanographer with the University of Washington 's Applied Physics Laboratory and author of a letter in the Dec. 11 Nature .
As those waves dissipate , they would give off significant heat energy .
Depending on the amount of tilt , the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa 's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet .
That 's the current assumption – that oceans on moons are heated mainly by this flexing of their cores .
In the case of Europa , it also has been thought that the thick ice covering its ocean probably generates some heat as two sides of cracked ice rub together in response to gravitational pull .
" If my work is correct then the heat source for Europa 's ocean is the ocean itself rather than what 's above or below it , " Tyler says .
" And we must form a new vision of the ocean habitat that involves strong ocean flow rather than the previously assumed sluggish flows . "
Both are important considerations if exploratory missions are ever sent to Europa in search of life .
Europa , which is slightly smaller than Earth 's moon , is one of Jupiter 's 63 moons .
With surface temperatures as cold as minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit , Europa 's surface is covered with a thick layer of ice .
There is evidence of a liquid ocean beneath the ice and , if there is volcanic activity on the sea floor , this could be a recipe for generating microorganisms that live without sunlight , perhaps like the microorganisms found at hydrothermal vents and other places on Earth .
Many planets and moons are known to be tilted within their orbital plane .
The Earth , for example , has an axial tilt of about 23 degrees .
It 's why the northern and southern hemispheres have different seasons , depending on whether they are tilted more toward or away from the sun .
Previous theoretical calculations expected Europa to have an axial tilt of at least 0.1 degrees .
It has n't been measured and could be bigger than this .
But even at this minimum value the tidal flow on Europa using Tyler 's new calculation is quite strong – some 10 centimeters a second – and enough to cause significant heating .
The new calculation differs from previous ones in that it allows a more realistic dynamic response of the ocean to the tidal forces .
His assumptions and calculations led him to say that he thinks this kind of wave action could be the dominant heat source in the oceans of Europa and other moons .
" But this proposal is a relatively new contender – so let 's see how it does , " he says .
Tyler is the sole author of the letter in Nature .
His work was supported by NASA 's Outer Planets Research program .
George Osborne suggests Gordon Brown does not care about debt Gordon Brown 's willingness to borrow his way out of trouble could lead to the collapse of sterling , shadow chancellor George Osborne has warned .
In the Times , he accused the PM of being " irresponsible " and suggested he " does n't care " how much he borrows .
Sterling has fallen sharply in recent weeks amid fears about a UK recession .
Labour has accused Mr Osborne of " talking down " the economy , with the prime minister dismissing the attack on his handling of the crisis .
But a former advisor to three Thatcher chancellors said he had been right to raise the issue .
There has been a so - called convention that opposition spokespeople do not say anything that might damage the economy and talk down the pound , said BBC political correspondent David Thompson - and Mr Osborne would appear to have broken that .
But the Tories say Mr Osborne is the shadow chancellor and is meant to give a critique .
Warwick Lightfoot , who advised Nigel Lawson , John Major and Norman Lamont , told BBC 5 Live : " The exchange rate has fallen sharply this year , by about 16 % overall .
In my judgement , that 's been a good thing ...
" But you do not want , even in a very deep recession , your exchange rate to go into some kind of freefall because it completely undermines confidence in your economy . "
' Scorched - earth policy ' Will Hutton , of the Work Foundation , and Conservative MP Michael Fallon , who is a member of the Commons '
Treasury select committee , said it was clear the pound had fallen and there was no point in keeping silent about it .
The Alpha and Omega of economic policy at the moment is to persuade the banks to maintain public borrowing
John Hutton
Chart : Pound 's fall against dollar Mr Fallon said : " It 's the shadow chancellor 's job to warn , and there 's a very serious issue with sterling now . "
On Friday , the pound slipped to a 13 - year low against a basket of other currencies , hovered near a six - and - a - half year low against the dollar , and traded at a near - record low against the euro .
Mr Osborne says the more the prime minister borrows , the less attractive the currency will become .
He said : " We are in danger , if the government is not careful , of having a proper sterling collapse , a run on the pound . "
He said that would push up long - term interest rates , " which is a huge burden on the economy " .
" The more you borrow as a government the more you have to sell that debt and the less attractive your currency seems . "
He went on to label Mr Brown 's tactic as a " scorched - earth policy " , which a future Conservative government would have to clear up .
" His view is he probably wo n't win the next election .
The Tories can clear this mess up after I 've gone , " he said .
Internal criticism A Labour spokesman said George Osborne was making " panicky " criticisms " in a desperate last throw of the dice to save his career " .
Labour MP John McFall , who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee , told the BBC that Mr Osborne 's comments were " very dangerous " : " We have abormal economic times here , " he said .
" You can witness that by the G20 meeting in Washington this weekend and George Osborne is running the risk of a run in sterling or making false predictions if and when sterling recovers . "
And Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable said Mr Osborne 's criticism signalled " massive intellectual confusion " within the Conservatives over fiscal policy .
He said : " For the last decade , the Conservatives have been rubbishing the idea of Britain joining the euro on the basis that we need to have a flexible exchange rate , yet when we have a flexible exchange rate , they complain because it 's flexible . "
Mr Hutton said the most important thing was to persuade the banks to maintain public borrowing .
The really important thing here is that we continue to protect the public 's stake in these banks
Michael Fallon
He said banks that had been bailed out by public funds should have had non-executive government directors placed on their boards to oversee how the money was used .
Mr Fallon said : " The really important thing here is that we continue to protect the public 's stake in these banks , which has already gone down , and that we get it back with added value . "
BBC political correspondent Nick Robinson said Mr Osborne 's intervention was " pretty extraordinary " and marked the sense of frustration from the opposition that they are seeing political and economic orthodoxy torn up .
The Tories have chosen to say this is " very dangerous indeed " - but they are doing it in a way in which they themselves can be accused of damaging the economy , he said .
And until the government 's pre-Budget report due out on 24 November , it is hard to tell how great a departure from recent economic practice we are actually going to see , he said .
Mr Osborne has also been criticised by former Conservative treasurer Lord Kalms , who told the BBC that former shadow home secretary David Davis would be more appropriate as shadow chancellor .
Up until now , any unease among Conservatives about Mr Osborne 's performance during the credit crunch has been off the record .
Last month , Mr Osborne admitted he had " made a mistake " by meeting Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska while on holiday in Corfu in the summer .
But he denied claims he tried to solicit a £ 50,000 donation for the Conservative Party .

A new comparison of chimpanzee and human genomes has offered an early but tantalizing look into what makes the two species , nearly identical at the DNA level , so different .
Scientists found key differences in areas linked to cell differentiation and immune response — and that could be just the beginning .
" By looking at all the variations , we will get a catalog , and when we find a variation in a person with a disease , it will help us understand the function of that variation , " said study co-author Richard Redon , a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute .
" It will help us understand better how our species emerged . "
Researchers already know that humans and chimpanzees share about 98 percent of the same genes .
But rather than searching for mutations , Redon 's team looked at a relatively unstudied phenomenon known as copy number variation , or CNV , in which genes are redundantly duplicated .
These variations were ignored in the early days of genetics , but have recently been recognized as important : Mutations are more likely to accumulate in a given type of gene when multiple copies exist , and the simultaneous application of multiple genes can provide a functional boost .
Redon 's team is the first to assemble maps of CNV similarities across both chimpanzees and humans , and then compare the maps to each other .
What roles those cell differentiation and immune response variants might play is n't yet known — but the details of the findings , said
Redon , are less important than the example set by the study , published today in
Genome Research .
" It 's just a start , " he said .
" We used a platform that is n't very high - resolution .
We found the largest variations , but the smaller ones , maybe we missed .
And the biggest are n't the most important — it 's just a matter of size .
Some of the littlest changes can have the largest effect . "
Melanie Babcock , an Albert Einstein College of Medicine geneticist who has studied copy number variations in primates , called the work
" fascinating . "
But Babcock , who was not involved in the study , cautioned that simple comparisons could n't indicate when and where duplicate genes are active .
That information could prove necessary in understanding the function of CNVs .
" Without looking at expression levels , it 's hard to say .
Yes , there might be a CNV , and it might mean that there is an amazing difference between humans and chimps — or that they do n't use the genes very much , and so they accumulate and are not important , " said Babcock .
Redon stopped short of saying that CNVs are more important than other types of genetic variation , instead calling them complementary .
" To have a better view , it 's good to have a global picture with all types of variation , " he said .

Note :
An eloquent evaluation of the study by molecular anthropologist Jonathan Marks arrived after the article was posted .
The author of What it Means to Be 98 % Chimpanzee noted that scientists do n't fully understand the links between genes and physiology .
The chimp - human CNV comparison " is reasonable , " said Marks , and " calls attention to a generally overlooked mode of mutation that seems to produce a non-trivial amount of difference " between our genomes — but we should n't " interpret that to mean that they have discovered why we are not sleeping in trees and eating the placentas of our newborns .

São Paulo is the annual stage for the largest gay pride march on Earth and home to one of South America 's most vibrant gay communities .
But a wave of homophobic murders has cast a shadow over one of the most tolerant cities in Latin America .
Six months after 3.5 million revellers gathered on the streets to celebrate gay pride , police announced last week that they were hunting for a serial killer thought to be responsible for as many as 16 murders on the western outskirts of São Paulo , Brazil 's largest city .
Police believe the killer - labelled the Rainbow Maniac by the press - is behind the murders of 13 men in Carapicuíba , a city of nearly 400,000 people in greater São Paulo .
They were killed in a park used as a gay meeting point .
Police are now investigating whether the same killer was behind three murders in the neighbouring city of Osasco , where a similar weapon was reportedly used .
One of the victims was a transvestite , shot in one of the city 's many love motels .
' In his head , he thinks he is doing a clean - up job , ' said Paulo Fernando Fortunato , the police chief heading the inquiries .
' He does n't like homosexuals , he hates them . '
The killing began on 4 July 2007 when 32 - year - old José Cicero Henrique was murdered in the Paturis park .
Since then another 12 men have been killed in the park , nine in virtually identical circumstances .
Their half - naked bodies were dumped in the undergrowth with a .38 bullet in the back of the head and their trousers wrapped around their knees .
Fortunato said one of the men was beaten to death while the latest victim , whose body was found in August and has not yet been identified , was shot 12 times .
Police sources told newspapers the hail of bullets had turned his body into a ' sieve ' .
One local newspaper suggested the killer may have arranged meetings with his victims over the internet , using the social networking service Orkut .
No link was made between the 13 murders until recently .
Last week the governor of São Paulo , José Serra , visited Carapicuíba and vowed that police would catch the Rainbow Maniac .
Plainclothes officers are now patrolling the park at night .
The 13 - month killing spree coincides with a recent study by the Grupo Gay da Bahia , Brazil 's oldest gay rights group , that described Brazil as leading the world in the murder of homosexuals .
According to the study , there were 122 homophobic murders in Brazil in 2007 , compared with 35 in Mexico and 25 in the US .
A previous study claimed that between 1980 and 2006 at least 2,680 gay people were killed in Brazil , mostly as a result of homophobic violence .
Brazil has some of the world 's most progressive laws on sexual discrimination .
Until 2005 the government lobbied the UN to adopt a resolution condemning discrimination against gays and lesbians .
Both Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are major destinations for gay tourists from the US and Europe , while the federal government recently launched a drive to make the country more ' gay friendly ' .
Next year Rio de Janeiro 's first gay samba school , nicknamed the Rainbow School , will join the carnival .
But activists say prejudice remains widespread .
Openly gay figures remain a rarity in Brazilian politics and sport .
A 2006 study at São Paulo 's gay pride march found that 65 per cent of those polled had suffered physical or verbal abuse as a result of their sexuality .
' People do n't understand , so they attack , ' said Alessandra Saraiva , a representative of São Paulo 's gay pride association and one of the organisers of a recent campaign , ' Homofobia Mata ! ' ( ' homophobia kills ' ) .
Saraiva said a study by her organisation found that 70 per cent of São Paulo 's transvestites had suffered some kind of violence .
Many blame the intolerance on ultra-conservative evangelical sects which see homosexuality as the work of the devil .
One church performs ' exorcisms ' of gays and lesbians live on TV , while churches promising to ' cure ' gays and lesbians can be found across the country .
Police stepped up patrols of the park last week , despite the arrest of a suspect .
Jairo Francisco Franco , 46 , a retired police sergeant , was seen by two witnesses committing the 13th murder in the park , police said .
João Batista , owner of the supermarket where Franco was a security guard , said on TV that his employee had seemed like ' a calm guy ' .
The waves from the subprime disaster have reached China , where the bottom has dropped out of the packing - case industry .
Americans , in particular , no longer want cheap goods made by migrant peasant women in the southern Chinese sweatshops .
What is also plain is the folly of Beijing ’s deliberate destruction of the once - prosperous rural economy .
Peasant uprisings , the nightmare that has kept Chinese rulers awake since the second century BC , are already causing panic in Beijing , where the official press reports hundreds of rural demonstrations against corrupt , land - grabbing officials .
Now the riots have spread to the cities .
About 67,000 factories have shut down across the country .
As the owners do midnight flits , sometimes to Taiwan , thousands of rioting wageless workers have been beaten up by the police outside the closed factory gates .
In Dongguan , a city of perhaps 10 million in the southern Pearl River delta , 3,000 toy manufacturers , half the total , have shut down , as have 2,000 shoe factories .
South China ’s railway stations are usually jammed before the Chinese New Year as city workers return to their villages , but now hundreds of thousands are leaving early for the rural homes they so eagerly fled during the past decade .
Why the toy factories in particular ?
Chinese toys have been found to be coated with deadly lead paint , leaving Mattel , the US toy giant , facing lawsuits and possible ruin .
A similar scandal struck contaminated pet food and toothpaste .
More recently and worse , Chinese powdered milk was found to be tainted with melamine , a plastic that makes the liquid thicker .
This has poisoned 290,000 Chinese children , according to official admissions , and killed six .
Nestlé is only one of the foreign companies that has used this milk powder in Asia .
President Hu Jintao recently warned the politburo about the economic crisis .
His words , carried in the party ’s People ’s Daily , could not have been starker , especially in an organ which tends to blur bad news :
“ In this coming period , we will starkly confront the effects of the sustained deepening of the international financial crisis and pressure as global economic growth clearly slows . ”
He noted that the crisis would “ steadily weaken our country ’s traditional competitive advantage . ”
The terrified government has just poured $ 586 billion into what is vaguely called the infrastructure .
Leaders know that as millions of peasants return to villages left behind since 1990 because of the communist party ’s concentration on urban development , the regime ’s newest slogan , “ Build a Harmonious Society ” , may be losing whatever lustre it may have had .
From almost 12 per cent per year , the figure that dazzled experts into predicting that this would be the Chinese century , this year ’s economic growth has sunk to 9 per cent .
The World Bank estimates it will fall to 7.5 next year .
“ If economic growth fell below 8 per cent there would be social tension , complaints and job losses , ” warned Chen Xingdong , chief economist at BNP Paribas in Beijing .
Arthur Kroeber , managing director of Dragonomics , a Beijing - based economic research and advisory firm , predicted : “ Next year we might see export growth in the country as a whole go down to 0 per cent . ”
But those fleeing to their rural families will find scant relief .
In
addition to the 15 - year decline in rural prosperity , all over China corrupt officials have seized the small plots that the peasants were told in 1979 - 1980 they could farm on their own .
According to the Ministry of Land and Resources , from 1999 to 2002 alone 300,000 acres were illegally confiscated from 1.5 million farmers .
Rapacious local officials seized these holdings and sold them to entrepreneurs who will turn them into privately - run big farms or into factories .
As the villages fell on hard times , the children of newly - poor farmers , usually their daughters , headed for the Pearl River delta and cities like Dongguan .
Factory life was exploitative and dangerous , but once the girls became used to the Chinese equivalent of the bright lights , they were alienated from the families to which they sent portions of their wages but visited only briefly each year .
The rural crisis need not have happened .
Indeed , it is the result of the intentional undermining of the real Chinese economic miracle – the rural prosperity of the 1980s .
This is the revelation of Huang Yasheng , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who was himself , until a few years ago , one of the many China experts convinced that the country ’s economic miracle was urban .
In his new book , Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics : Entrepreneurship and the State ( Cambridge University Press , 2008 ) , Huang stresses that he now believes that the stupendously corrupt foundations of current Chinese growth are unsustainable .
Many manufacturers have been exposed as having “ committed fraudulent business practices [ toys , toothpaste , pet food , powdered milk ] in order to skimp on costs ” .
Looking forward to 2008 , long before the American Treasury and banks did , Huang brilliantly foresaw an American recession , “ even a subprime crisis ” , and rising energy costs .
“ The issue , ” he warned , “ is whether such developments would trigger [ Chinese ] financial instability in the form of a crisis . ”
Now 2008 has passed , the southern factories are closing , China ’s stock market has dropped by 66 per cent , and the Chinese crisis has arrived as Huang predicted .
Huang ’s book is that rare thing , a conceptual earthquake .
Its dedication encapsulates its theme .
Huang names three Chinese he has never met .
In 1982 , Nian Guangjiu , a farmer from a poor province , began selling a particularly delicious version of the popular snack , roasted sunflower seeds , which he called “ Idiot ’s Seeds ” because he had a low opinion of himself .
Soon , he was well on the way to becoming a corporate giant .
The other two dedicatees , both from provincial areas , are Sun Dawu , who ran an animal - feed company , and Zheng Lefeng , an illiterate female
moneylender .
In 1989 , Nian was arrested for corruption and embezzlement , charges so flimsy , even by Chinese standards , that he was recharged as a “ hooligan ” who had had “ immoral relationships ” with 10 women .
Nian reportedly replied , “ No , 12 . ” He was sentenced to three years ’ imprisonment and his business was closed down .
Sun was imprisoned for “ illegally absorbing public funds ” .
He had refused to bribe bank officials .
He is remembered for his remark in prison : “ Chinese peasants , your name is misery . ”
Zheng Lefeng was executed .
Huang says of Nian , Sun and Zheng that “ millions like them created the true Chinese miracle ” .
But they “ met the common unhappy fate of being brought down by the illiberal policies of the 1990s ” .
Nian , Sun and Zheng were smashed , as the Chinese say , because they made money while free of state control .
Before the trio were detained , Huang shows , China was moving “ fast and far ” towards a laissez - faire home - grown entrepreneurial economy , founded on the rural - based capitalism of township and village enterprises .
But that free economy , which created China ’s true economic miracle , was swept away soon after Tiananmen in 1989 , and its place taken by “ crony capitalism ” , built on foreign investment , “ systematic corruption and raw political power ” , in which property rights , the basis of lasting economic progress , are not secure .
As for Shanghai , the city praised by Western businessmen as a model for China ’s future , much of its success is based on foreign investment , regime - based land - taking and the impoverishment of the poorest 10 per cent of the population .
Shanghai ’s accomplishments , Huang observes , are built on a “ Potemkin foundation ” .
Huang ’s research is based on his close examination of banking information beyond the grasp of most foreign observers .
He argues that China ’s foreign fans are wowed by flashy tall buildings , shopping malls , up - to - date fashions and high - speed transport , which he derides as tourist impressions .
These fans are being misled by their maladroit examination of Gross Domestic Product statistics .
Huang attacks some of them : Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz ; Jeffrey Sachs , a universally - admired academic expert on economic reform ; the World Bank ’s Beijing office ; McKinsey consultants ; and the authorities and businessmen who hail China as a star of the East Asian miracle .
More recently , there is Harvard ’s Niall Ferguson who wrote in this magazine in September : “ China ’s planned economy seems unlikely to be significantly affected by that [ US ] slowdown because net exports are no longer the key driver of China ’s growth . ”
The new capitalism of the 1990s , Huang shows , imperils rural welfare .
Two key examples are illiteracy and health .
Thirty million new illiterates are being added annually for the first time in the history of communist China .
The government now invests relatively little in education and , as they become poorer , rural Chinese cannot afford to educate their children , especially girls .
Mortality figures , which fell in the 1970s and ’ 80s , began to rise again in the ’90s and China is now near the bottom in its region .
“ China , ” Huang says , “ is ranked by the World Health Organisation as one of the most inequitable countries in the world in terms of the distribution of and access to health care . ”
As immunisation fees increase , parents vaccinate fewer girls than boys , and the mortality rates for peasant girls have risen .
Hospitals began to charge fees and in the countryside , notes Huang , “ 65 per cent of those who should have been hospitalised were not because they could n’t afford it ” .
Inequality is widening .
In 1989 , during Tiananmen , the government feared that peasants would join the nationwide protests .
They did n’t , because they were content with their improving incomes , based as much on entrepreneurial businesses as on farming .
Even during the Cultural Revolution , peasants often managed tiny private plots or small businesses , while urban dwellers were persecuted for any sign of profit - seeking .
After Deng Xiaoping guaranteed individual property rights in 1979 - 80 and encouraged commerce , rural enterprise flourished .
In one of his many felicitous phrases , Hang says : “ One should never underestimate the incentive effect of not getting arrested . ”
Rural enterprises were encouraged by party general secretary Hu Yaobang and premier Zhao Ziyang ( both now dead ) , men with rural administrative experience , who issued documents inaugurating polices such as “ peasants in their private capacity can engage in trade .
They can go into cities and leave their counties and provinces . ”
They did , and even founded an airline and a great pharmaceutical business .
The number of Chinese poor – defined at a very low standard – fell by 154 million between 1978 and 1988 , but only by 62 million during the next decade .
Zhao and Hu , whose reformist politics enraged Deng , were gone by the end of Tiananmen , in June 1989 , and their places taken by heavy - hitting urban planners with engineering backgrounds .
Having made their careers in Shanghai , these men , including the new party general secretary Jiang Zemin , began curtailing credits to rural
enterprises .
Since the 1990s , as rural businesses languished and inequality widened , China has been riven by hundreds of protests of those left behind by the urban reforms .
Poor , badly - educated rural migrants swarmed to the urban factories which are now collapsing , as the worldwide crunch hits China .
Now , they are returning to the countryside they fled , where another crisis is sparking riots and demonstrations that the security forces have been called out to suppress .
It could be argued that during the past 50 years , China has weathered worse crises .
But South China has been the driver of the urban economic miracle .
If its collapse accelerates , following those manufacturers of shoes , toys , toothpaste , pet food and powdered milk , “ security ” , the communist party ’s over - arching watchword , could crack .
Furious country people will be joined by their disillusioned daughters , whose factory jobs in the Pearl River delta have disappeared .
It is part of China ’s rural folklore to recall that every dynasty for more than 2,000 years , no matter how mighty , has been brought down by angry peasants .
Thats a mouthful for sure .
Those brilliant Maoists have been banging their heads together for six days to try and mend a catastrophic rift in their party .
It seems most of the hard - liners want to announce an all Communist " People 's Republic " immediately ; while Prachanda wants to go a little slower so as not to throw the country back into chaos .
After what blogdai can only assume to be and excruciating application of sheer brainpower , our boys in red have decided to call Nepal the " People 's Federal Democratic National Republic . "
Just think of the expense in stationary this will incur !
PFDNR Nepal .
What this title tells us , just by looking at it , is that the Maoists are still deeply divided and deeply factionalized .
it 's as if the Maoists threw every point of contention they had into the title , not caring if it worked or even made sense .
Nepal is now the " agree to disagree " nation from its title .
Maoist honcho's called this new title a " synthesis " of party policy documents .
blogdai sees it as an " emulsion : " hurredly mixing together things that do n't belong .
Imagine if we left the Maoists to rename our popular Kathmandu watering holes :
Fire and Ice Pizza would be : " Cold Firey Hot Pizza Ice "
Tom and Jerry Pub : " Jerry 's Pub with Tom 's Name but mostly Jerry 's unless it '
Not "
Yin / Yang Bar : " Yin or Yang both at once with no balance or compromise Bar . "
Let 's break down this new title and look at it .
Both the words that are used and their positioning tell us quite a lot about what went on in that Maoist meeting .
People's
Only ideologically totalitarian or Communist governments use this word to describe their country .
The fact that it occurs first in the title tells blogdai that the hard - line Communist ideologues in the Maoist party holding sway .
It also shows that every Maoists eventually wants a Communist Nepal .
Federal
Means a type of representative government ; the type that no Nepali can adequately describe , but is supposed to limit the chaos of pure democracy by letting elected representative speak for the majority of people in any given district or " federated " sub - unit of a nation .
It is the second term used in the new Maoist title and probably sits there to appease the NC and UML .
Democratic
Dead in the middle of the new title .
It is in the weakest position for emphasis -- almost an afterthought .
Maoists know that if you use any variation of the word " democracy , " to describe yourself , whether applicable or not , the U.S. will leave you alone , the world media will fawn all over you , and foreign aid will keep arriving .
It 's a lot like all of those ridiculous military medals that despots like to create and wear on their uniforms :
No real meaning but gives a good impression .
National
A poor thinker 's stab at national unity .
Mainly , it 's just the Maoists way of saying that they 've finally made it to the big leagues .
No factionalizing , they tell us , " we are now a national brand . "
Thanks to Ian Martin and James Moriarty .
Republic
If you read the new title quickly , you find that Nepal is actually called a " People 's Republic " Notice how " People 's " and " Republic " frame all other words ?
They are the two most strategically placed words in the title .
Republic , next to Federal and sometimes Democracy , is unnecessary and redundant .
All three terms share concepts and mechanisms .
This new title shows what can happen when a room full of hog butchers begins to squabble .
We get nothing approaching compromise , but we can infer quite a lot about the Maoist 's intentions from the mish - mash of a title they want to slap on Nepal :
We are on our way to a Communist state .

The Eurelia diamonds are the latest ultra - deep diamonds to have been found ( Image : R Tappert )
Talk about deep , dark secrets .
Rare “ ultra - deep ” diamonds are valuable – not because they look good twinkling on a newlywed ’s finger – but because of what they can tell us about conditions far below the Earth ’s crust .
Now a find of these unusual gems in Australia has provided new clues to how they were formed .
The diamonds , which are white and a few millimetres across , were found by a mineral exploration company just outside the village of Eurelia , some 300 kilometres north of Adelaide , in southern Australia .
From there , they were sent to Ralf Tappert , a diamond expert at the University of Adelaide .

Tappert and colleagues say minerals found trapped inside the Eurelia diamonds could only have formed more than 670 kilometres ( 416 miles ) beneath the surface of the Earth – a distance greater than that between Boston and Washington , DC .
Clues from the deep
“ The vast majority of diamonds worldwide form at depths between 150 km and 250 km , within the mantle roots of ancient continental plates , ” says Tappert .
“ These diamonds formed in the Earth ’s lower mantle at depths greater than 670 km , which is much deeper than ‘ normal ’ diamonds . ”
Fewer than a dozen ultra - deep diamonds have been found in various corners of the globe since the 1990s .
Sites range from Canada and Brazil to Africa – and now Australia .
“ Deep diamonds are important because they are the only natural samples that we have from the lower mantle , ” says Catherine McCammon , a geologist at the University of Bayreuth in Germany .
“ This makes them an invaluable set of samples – much like the lunar rocks are to our studies of the moon . ”
The Eurelia gems contain information about the carbon they were made from .
Their heavy carbon isotope signatures suggest the carbon was once contained in marine carbonates lying on the ocean floor .
‘ Oddball ’ gems
Location , though , provides researchers with a common thread for the Brazilian , African and Australian deep diamonds , which could explain how they were born .
All six groups of diamonds were found in areas that would once have lined the edge of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana .
“ Deep diamonds have always been treated like oddball diamonds , ” says Tappert .
“ We do n’t really know what their origin is .
With the discovery of the ones in Australia we start to get a pattern . ”
Their geographic spread suggests that all these ultra - deep diamonds were formed in the same way : as the oceanic crust dived down beneath Gondwana – a process known as subduction – it would have dragged carbon down to the lower mantle , transforming it into graphite and then diamond along the way .
Eventually , kimberlites – volcanic rocks named after the town of Kimberley in South Africa – are propelled to the surface during rapid eruptions , bringing the gems up to the surface .
Surprisingly young
According to John Ludden of the British Geological Survey , if the theory were proven true , it would mean the Eurelia diamonds are much younger than most diamonds are thought to be .
“ Many of the world ’s diamonds are thought to have been sampled from subducted crust in the very early Earth , 3 billion years ago , ” says Ludden .
Yet Tappert ’s theory suggests these diamonds would have been formed about 300 million years ago .
“ This may well result in a revision of exploration models for kimberlites and the diamonds they host , as to date exploration has focused on very old rock units of the early Earth , ” Ludden told New Scientist .
McCammon says Tappert ’s theory is “ plausible ” but just “ one among possible models ” .
She says not all deep diamonds fit the Gondwana model , but adds that the new gems “ proved a concrete idea that can be tested by others in the community ” .

Rafael Correa said he was ready to confront international lenders
Ecuador is to default officially on billions of dollars of foreign debt it considers " illegitimate " , says President Rafael Correa .
Mr Correa said he had given the order not to approve a debt interest payment due on Monday , describing the international lenders as " monsters " .
The president said that some of Ecuador 's $ 10 bn debt was contracted illegally by a previous administration .
It is the first debt default by a country in Latin America since 2001 .
At that time , Argentina failed to repay debt in the midst of its financial meltdown .
Restructure plan
Speaking in the city of Guayaquil , Mr Correa said " as president I could n't allow us to keep paying a debt that was obviously immoral and illegitimate " , according to the AFP news agency .
" We 'll present a proposal to restructure the debt in order to resolve this problem as fast as possible , " added the US - trained economist and ally of left - wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
His decision follows a government audit in November which recommended that Ecuador default on almost 40 % of the $ 10 bn foreign debt , accusing former officials and bankers of profiting irresponsibly from bond deals .
The country 's foreign debt amounts to about a fifth of its Gross Domestic Product , or GDP .
In the past , Mr Correa has vowed to put money he has earmarked for spending on public programmes - ahead of paying foreign debt .
Correspondents say Ecuador 's decision to effectively cut itself off from outside financing could lead to a budget shortfall , especially if the price of oil - the country 's main revenue earner - continues to fall .
Oil is Ecuador 's main source of income and accounts for 40 % of the national budget .
Recession Anxiety Believed Spreading to Dogs and Cats , Owners ' Glum Faces Blamed ; Here 's How to Calm Your Pet
There 's no need for your four - legged friend to feel as insecure as you do about the recession .
Among the expert suggestions for keeping your dog or cat on the emotionally sunny side despite your recession gloominess : maintain his or her accustomed routines , do n't neglect health checkups and preventive care , and - on the offbeat side - buy your pet some flowers , those with anxiety - relieving properties .
You 're not the only one frightened by news of the deepening recession .
Also trembling in fear : your pet .
No , your dog or cat is n't reading the Wall Street Journal behind your back or channel - surfing to CNN's " Moneyline " after you leave the house .
But he or she may be picking up on the recession anxiety you experience as stock prices tumble and unemployment figures soar , recent animal - behavior research seems to suggest .
Pets see you worry about the recession and may be needlessly frightened
For example , a University of Florida study which received considerable attention earlier this month offered evidence that dogs are more perceptive of human conduct than previously understood .
Other research over the years has described humanlike cognitive and emotional characteristics in pets , such as an ability of dogs to read body language and sense fear in humans .
Thus , it holds that your head - in - hands , slump - shouldered , glum - faced dejectedness over the tanking economy and the recession it portends can be telegraphed to your pet who might perhaps start fretting - and grieving - about it along with you .
Dr. Katarina Reilly at the Veterinary Center of Greater Newburyport in Salisbury , Mass. , doubts whether dogs and cats are able to interpret downcast moods and pit - of - despair gestures in quite so sophisticated a manner .
However , she allows that owners do give their pets worry - inducing clues when big changes are coming .
" Your pet , " she says , " may get anxious if your routine varies , " as could be the case were you to lose your job because of the recession and start packing a suitcase in preparation for a trip to another city in search of employment .
Some veterinarians specialized in animal behavior advise against causing your pet emotional stress because that can trigger physical health problems .
Of course , it 's not possible to engage your dog or cat in reasoned discourse , rationally spelling out that there 's nothing to fear but fear itself .
Still , there are ways to help your pet avoid sharing your recession - induced funk .
For starters , maintain your pet 's accustomed routines .
Walks in the park , having him or her sit in your lap while you watch a favorite television show , even visiting the vet for periodic checkups and shots should be continued in order to provide a reassuring sense of stability despite the instability of your recession - plagued finances just now , experts recommend .
Speaking of vet visits , protecting the health of your pet becomes even more important than usual during stressful , recessionary times like these , warns Dr. Jennifer Adler , internal medicine specialist at the Center for Animal Referral and Emergency Services ( CARES ) in Langhorne , Pa .
" Neglecting checkups can lead to big health problems , which are often difficult and expensive to treat , " says Adler , who hints that some pet owners , in a misguided attempt to save money during a recession , skip vet checkups .
" Preventative medicine is an excellent idea .
For pet parents wanting to save money in the long run , wellness visits should be made a priority . "
Reilly agrees .
" It is very important pets routinely see a veterinarian to evaluate any changes in their health and catch any problems early , " she says .
" Blood work is important as well , since it uncovers things that can not be seen by the eye .
Catching problems early is important for your pet 's health , and can avoid costly treatments if illnesses go undetected . "
Other advice for keeping your pet from feeling as insecure as you do about the recession :
-- Exercise .
Adler says letting your pet romp more often ( and with your boisterous participation , more energetically ) can serve as a major stress reliever - for the both of you .
-- Do n't let your treat cupboard go bare .
Make sure you keep on hand a supply of wholesome comfort - foods .
For dogs , these might include all - natural biscuits and pesticide - free carrots .
For cats , consider organic cheese treats and purest high - altitude - grown catnip leaves .
-- Moderate your voice .
It 's easy to come across as a basket case practically every time you open your mouth to lament the banking crisis or some other aspect of the recession .
Use care in the tone and tenor you take during such conversations while your pet is within earshot .
-- Give flowers .
Some naturopaths assert that aromatic exposure to certain fragrant blooms , such as olive blossom and the Star of Bethlehem flower , can sooth a traumatized canine .
Obtain these from a local florist or nursery .

I have a bone to pick with Rush Limbaugh about the word " intellectual . "
He says he is n't one .
But Rush is the sharpest political commentator we have today .
He is a public intellectual in the old sense : A fine , original thinker who constantly reveals new truths that slip past the mindless media .
He can communicate with whoever bothers to listen , as tens of millions of people do every week , throwing a sharp light on the biggest questions we face .
And he 's entertaining and funny .
Rush has a well - thought - out political philosophy , with deep roots in European and American history .
He constantly collects real evidence , and is better at explaining it to millions of listeners than anybody else today .
Limbaugh has a twenty year track record of sifting truths from lies ; that is not an accident , any more than Tiger Woods is an accident .
It comes from great talent and lifelong practice .
In the upshot , Rush is a voice for rationality and sanity in a world awash in madness and propaganda .
If that 's not the proper role of an intellectual , what is ?
The words " intellect " and " intellectual " deserve to be rescued from the myth - makers of the Left , which has decided in its amazing arrogance that it really owns those words .
But that is just another sign of its narrow - minded cultism .
The Left shuts out competing voices , like any other cult , and then becomes outraged when independent thinkers do n't agree with its " smelly little orthodoxies " --- as George Orwell famously called them .
( Orwell started as a Leftist and then figured out the scam . )
An intellectual is just a thinker , somebody who uses the intellect and does it well .
An athlete is somebody who uses physical talent and does it well .
Those words stand for excellence .
Rush Limbaugh listens to hundreds of competing voices and finds ways to make sense of them .
That is what good intellectuals do -- a lot of listening , a lot of dialogue , a lot of clarification .
Talk show hosts have the perfect job for it .
By far the majority of the great intellectuals in history have been conservatives , going back to the two main wellsprings of Western thought , the Greeks and the Bible .
It is also true in ancient India and China .
Confucius was one of the world 's great conservative thinkers , emphasizing personal and governmental morality , correct social relationships , justice and sincerity .
( Which is why that Leftist hero Mao Zedong murdered tens of millions of people trying to uproot Confucian traditions in China .
In the end , Confucius won . )
Plato was a great conservative .
Cicero was a great conservative .
The American Founders were conservatives , with rare exceptions .
The wisdom books of the Bible are full of conservative sayings .
That 's what the Ten Commandments are about .
" Honor your father and mother " is a profoundly conservative idea .
All high civilizations have been built by conservatives .
You can't accumulate the cultural capital needed to build any high civilization if you try to destroy the past , as the Left constantly tries to do .
You can't build a chariot if you have to reinvent the wheel every generation .
The batty idea that kids have the real answers in life is just a modern delusion .
It is just ignorant .
Conservatism builds .
Leftism overthrows .
That is the meaning of that pop word " revolution . "
The all - destroying revolution is an adolescent fantasy , and the Left hangs on to those fantasies a lot longer than conservatives do .
The idea of a " revolutionary " intellectual class is also a modern invention , made up to prop up the cult ego of the scribbling classes -- the teachers , newspaper writers and bureaucrats .
Doctor Johnson called them the ink - stained drudges , and he was one himself .
( A conservative , needless to say . )
Professional word merchants only go back to 1800 or so .
Most prominent thinkers in history were talented amateurs , and did n't need to ride the wild horse of social revolution to gain control over other people .
They kept their powerlust in check .
Socrates did n't have a college degree .
He became an intellectual through constant dialogue .
The Socratic dialogue is the origin of Western thought .
Aristotle , the pupil of Plato , who in turn was the pupil of Socrates , founded the original " college " -- Aristotle 's academy , which met in an Athenian grove .
Mathematics goes back to Pythagoras and Euclid and many others , 25 centuries of cumulative thinking by talented amateurs .
Almost nobody got paid for doing advanced mathematics until the 19th century .
All from amateurs -- " lovers " -- of knowledge .
The same is true for the sciences and the other " departments " of human thought .
But even the idea of " departments of thought " is a modern invention :
As Alfred North Whitehead pointed out , " Nature has no departments . "
Neither does the human intellect .
All that is just a bunch of paid professors trying to divide up the loot .
Intellectual creativity arose in thousands of places in the ancient world .
We just happen to know more about Greece and the Hebrew and Christian sources than about the others .
But they existed .
Good thinkers are found all over , like good athletes and musicians .
When they find other , they start to learn from each other , and then you see a spurt of creativity .
It only takes a few to get it started .
But let me get back to Rush : Rush Limbaugh is far closer to the great tradition of Western intellectuals than anybody in the celebrity freak - show of the Left .
It is the Rush Limbaughs who became Socrates and Plato in the ancient world .
They composed the Psalms and the Book of Proverbs .
They were not professional scribblers .
They did not found a revolutionary cult designed to overthrow all the good traditions .
They were talented talkers , and even better listeners .
All good thinking starts from dialogue .
I 've been using git for source code management for over a year now and I 'm totally hooked .
I wo n't rave about all the usual reasons WhyGitIsBetterThanX since it 's been done already .
Instead , I 'm going to share how I use git for easy agile development .
The basic idea is to never do anything in the master branch except use it to move changes between the remote repo and local branches .
Keeping master clean takes very little effort and will save your bacon when you get into trouble .
The example I 'll use here is working on a story to render title text in a bold style on a page .
1. Locate story " titles are in bold text " in Pivotal Tracker and click Start .
What do you mean you 're not using Pivotal Tracker ?
2 . Get going with a clean start .
$ git checkout master $ git pull $ rake db : migrate # if there are new migrations $ rake # if you do n't have a CI server
3 . Make a branch to work in .
$ git checkout - b bold_titles
4 . Test - drive the story .
Since you are committing locally , you can commit often .
Sometimes I like to commit every time I get a test to pass , or after crucial steps in a refactoring .
$ git commit - am " Do n't bold empty titles "
We should all know the advantages of frequent commits : when an experiment fails , it 's easy to get back to a previous state where things worked ; or when refactoring , you can see how things were before you started changing things around .
With git you can also do things like cherry - pick commits , so if you want to grab a single test and its implementation and extract it as a patch or whatever , you can do that .
When you are done ...
$ rake $ git commit - am " Render titles with bold style "
5 . Merge with master
When you 're done with the story , you need to integrate your changes with the master branch .
You 'll have to fetch and merge the changes from origin / master into your branch .
a. Review changes
I like to review changes to make sure I did n't leave any debugging cruft in , and as a final check on code quality .
$ git diff master
b. Merge changes
$ git checkout master $ git pull $ git checkout bold_titles $ git rebase master
The four commands above may seem a bit convoluted , but all you 're really doing is merging updates from the remote repo to your story branch by way of the master branch .
Now , if you have any merge conflicts , they are all in the story branch where you can work on resolving them in your normal work environment without disturbing the master branch .
If you took enough time resolving merge conflicts that someone else checked in changes to the remote repo , repeat this step until you 're fully merged locally .
Also , notice I used rebase instead of merge to integrate the master branch changes , but that choice is up to you .
Whether you use rebase or merge is a matter of convention for your project .
Doing a rebase will replay your changes on top of the changes you just merged with .
That should have a net effect of zero on the final product but has the advantage of keeping all your changes contiguous in the history , and wo n't generate a separate merge commit when you merge back to the master branch since the changes come in as a fast - forward .
You can also rebase with the - i ( or -- interactive ) option to squash several ( or all ) of your commits into a single commit , or to organize your changes as a reduced number of commits .
Frequent commits are great to manage your own work and give many checkpoints to roll back to if needed .
But adding dozens of commits to the project for a simple feature can be overwhelming for others on your team , and can make it difficult to navigate or understand the project history .
For example :
$ git rebase - i master
That will show you an $ EDITOR session like this :
# Rebasing 1234abc..3333ccc onto 1234abc # # Commands : # pick = use commit # edit = use commit , but stop for amending # squash = use commit , but meld into previous commit # #
If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST .
# pick 1111 aaa Use < strong > tag to bold titles pick 2222 bbb
Do n't render empty titles as bold pick 3333ccc
Use font - weight property on h1.title instead of < strong >
The commits are listed in chronological order , oldest on top .
If you want to combine several commits into one , edit the word pick at the start of the line to say squash , and that commit will be merged with the one above it .
Since you are seeing all your commits and their messages , you can probably say something useful about the whole set as you package it for pushing to the shared repo .
Sometimes you 'll want to squash down to just one commit , others you may want to structure the package as a small number of related commits , say one commit for your feature addition , and another for a refactoring your feature relies on .
Important : Rebasing rewrites history and should never be done to reorder changes you have previously pushed to another repo or shared publicly .
c. Be green
Once done merging , make sure you 're still green .
$ rake
d. Merge early , merge often
If the work on your branch takes long enough , you might want to perform a merge several times .
As other people push to origin / master , you can pull those changes and integrate them into your branch incrementally , rather than waiting until the end when you 're done .
Whether to do this is a judgement call , and would depend on factors like the nature of the work you 're doing the the kind of changes you'd be integrating .
But one of the more valuable practices of agile development is continuous integration , and spending too much time accumulating change on a branch that is cut off from the rest of the development stream can eventually make for a difficult merge at the end of your story .
6. Push
Once you have integrated your changes with those from master , you can merge them back to the master branch and from there to the remote repo .
$ git checkout master $ git merge bold_titles $ git push
7. Cleanup
$ git branch -d bold_titles
Delete the story branch , click Finish on the story in Pivotal Tracker , then get up and stretch and get some water .
Caution
Probably the biggest gotcha particular to Rails development on more than one branch is dealing with database migrations .
It 's easy to get confused between the state of the database and which migrations are in what branch .
I 'll take one of two approaches , depending on how complicated things are .
One is to rollback the migration on the current branch before switching to another branch that does n't have that migration yet , then run pending migrations on the new branch after switching .
But if you 're going to be switching around branches with different migrations a lot , the best thing is to integrate the migration changes so they exist on both branches and it ceases to be an issue .
Discussion
Okay that 's a lot of stuff going on .
What 's the point ?
Well , the point is dealing with the unintended .
( I was going to say " unexpected " , but if you 're developing software or working on a team , you should expect crazy things to occur occasionally . )
There is obviously overhead in managing multiple branches , and you may wonder what you 're getting for the cost of that overhead .
There are a couple things that come to mind that I 'll mention here , but I 'd like to hear more in the comments from people about what situations they deal with this way ( or other ways ) .
The first thing this approach helps with is being able to make frequent commits without breaking the build or disrupting the work of teammates .
Working with a centralized SCM system like Subversion can force you to choose between checkpointing your work and keeping the state of the project consistent .
I know agile developers who swear that making frequent commits to the shared repo is the way to go , and just deal with having to keep the build green and functional on every commit .
But I find that approach too constraining , and it can impose an uncomfortable style on how I do my work .
I find being able to do frequent commits without worrying about disrupting my teammates ' work with half - finished features lets me concentrate on getting things done , instead of thinking about how big a change I can make without messing up someone else 's work .
And I also do n't have to worry about the converse either .
Do n't you hate pulling down changes that include a migration and wondering if the relevant model changes to let that migration do the right thing have been made yet ?
But why the separate story branches ?
Is n't it just as convenient to do all your work in your local master branch and do your local commits there ?
Up to a point , sure .
But keeping a separate branch for work means that you always have a good baseline around for reference , it lets you rebase to manage your changesets easily , and it makes dealing with merge conflicts a bit more sane .
And if you have to share or backup the state of your work in progress , it 's very easy to push your local branch to a branch in the remote repo without disrupting anything .
There 's also the advantage that it 's easier to deal with being interrupted .
Say you 're working on a story that 's going to take you all day and someone finds a nasty bug in production .
Time to drop everything and get it fixed right away !
If you have your work in progress on a branch , it 's simple to do a checkpoint commit , switch back to master , create a new branch for the bugfix , fix the bug , push the fix , then get right back to where you were before .
Push
I 've been using the story branch pattern for development for most of the last year , and have found it useful , convenient and a lifesaver when things get weird .
I 've also watched teammates that do their work in the master branch , and it is more work for them to deal with issues and avoid making unintended messes .
Like all useful practices it takes a little bit of effort up front , but it saves a lot more effort when it really matters .
The victim's three - year - old daughter was unhurt A 26 - year - old man was stabbed to death as he travelled to hospital with his young daughter to visit his wife who had just given birth to a boy .
He became involved in an argument with a second man and died " in front of his daughter 's eyes " in Croydon , south London , police said .
A 22 - year - old man was arrested and is in custody at a south London police station .
Det Ch Insp Cliff Lyons described the murder as " particularly tragic " .
He said the man 's three - year - old daughter had not been injured in the attack on Thursday evening .
The man was attacked outside a Lidl supermarket in London Road , close to West Croydon railway station , at 1815 GMT .
The victim was taken to Mayday Hospital where he was pronounced dead an hour later .

Mr Lyons said : " This was a shocking attack in a public place in the early evening .
" The victim 's three year - old daughter was with him when he was attacked , though fortunately she was n't physically injured . "
He added : " Even more tragically , his partner had given birth to a son just that morning .
The investigation is at a very early stage and I 'm keeping an open mind about the circumstances of the attack at this point .
" A number of witnesses have already come forward but I believe there are still people with information we need to speak to and I urge those people to get in touch . "
Mr Lyons added that police wanted to talk to two teenage boys who were at the bus stop when the incident happened .
He said : " They are described as black , aged between 15 and 20 years old , of slim build and wearing hooded tops . "
Mr Lyons said officers were still trying to find out if the man had seen his newborn son before he died .
He said London Road , where the incident occurred , was " one of the busiest roads in the area " .
Officers have found a number of knives in the area and were also reviewing CCTV footage from a number of cameras .
A post -mortem examination was being carried out on the man .

In the Supreme Court on Wednesday , Philip Morris , America ’s largest cigarette company , compared itself to the NAACP .
And to a South Carolina death row inmate illegally denied due process .
And to indigent criminal defendants not afforded adequate legal representation .
And it did so to win a case against an elderly African American woman named Mayola Williams whose husband died from lung cancer in 1997 , after smoking three packs of Marlboros a day for more than 40 years .
The tobacco company has declared itself a civil rights victim , says Ray Thomas , one of Williams ’ lawyers .
“ That they have the gall to do that shows how brazen they are , ” he says .
Philip Morris ’ victimhood dates back to 1999 , when an Oregon jury hit the company with a $ 79 million punitive damages award in a lawsuit Williams filed after her husband Jesse died .
She had argued that Philip Morris had deceived Jesse with its long - running misinformation campaign to convince the public that smoking was harmless , and that the company was thus liable for his death .
( It ’s easy to forget that it was n’t until 1999 — after the Williams verdict — that the tobacco company finally publicly admitted that smoking causes cancer . )
The verdict was a rare smoker ’s victory .
For nearly 50 years , Philip Morris had defeated an endless string of personal injury lawsuits by waging a war of attrition on the plaintiffs , a strategy perfected by the tobacco industry .
As RJ Reynolds ’ general counsel explained in a 1988 memo , “ To paraphrase General Patton , the way we won these cases was not by spending all of Reynolds ’ money but by making that other son of a bitch spend all his . ”
The first major verdict in a smoker ’s lawsuit in 1988 was for only $ 400,000 .
The lawyers who brought the case spent $ 2.5 million to win it ; the tobacco company spent $ 50 million .
After the Supreme Court sent that case back for a new trial , the lawyers gave up , virtually bankrupt .
That ’s why , until 2001 , when a smoker finally prevailed , no tobacco company had ever paid out a dime in damages .
( The lawyers who eventually did get rich from tobacco litigation were not representing smokers but the states attempting to recoup Medicaidcosts related to smoking , a different issue . )
So naturally , after its big loss in Oregon , Philip Morris appealed , asking the Oregon appellate courts to overturn the verdict .
The trial court judge had already trimmed the verdict to $ 32 million , saying that the original award was excessive .
But the Oregon courts have not been a friendly playing field for the company .
After hearing its appeal , the Oregon Court of Appeals responded by restoring the $ 79 million punitive damages award , a move the state Supreme Court approved unanimously , saying that Philip Morris ’ egregious conduct merited the stiff punishment .
Since then , the cigarette manufacturer has succeeded in appealing the case to the US Supreme Court no fewer than three times , including this latest trip .
And despite two separate orders from the Supreme Court to revisit the size of the punitive damage award , the Oregon Supreme Court has continued to find reasons to uphold its original decision — unanimously .
In the last round , the Oregon court found a problem with one of Philip Morris ’ proposed jury instructions , a state law issue , as grounds to avoid dealing with the question the Supreme Court had raised over the size of the award .
An outraged Philip Morris calls this a “ pretext ” for refusing to overturn the award , and it has worked hard to frame its loss as the product of a rogue state court .
To do so , it has drawn on a case brought by the NAACP in 1958 after the state of Alabama tried to force the group to turn over its membership records .
The case went to the Supreme Court four times because the Alabama courts , invoking state civil procedure rules , refused to comply with orders from above that it respect the civil rights group ’s constitutional due process rights .
In court Wednesday , Philip Morris ’ lawyer Stephen Shapiro in effect compared the Oregon Supreme Court to racist Alabama judges , saying that the case was “ very similar ” to what happened in the NAACP case .
The rest of Philip Morris ’ argument relies on the sort of cases that the modern Supreme Court has been somewhat hostile toward : habeas corpus cases .
Those are the appeals from criminal defendants , for instance , whose lawyers slept through their trials but whose convictions were upheld anyway .
In the rare instances where defendants in those cases prevail , it ’s usually because the courts recognize that they had a poorly paid , incompetent lawyer who screwed up the procedural rule at issue .
The courts find that the constitutional issues trump the state procedure .
But those criminal defendants do n’t bear much resemblance to Philip Morris , which not only has enormous financial resources but was also represented at trial in this case by a lawyer who literally wrote the book on Oregon civil procedure rules .
Nonetheless , Shapiro repeatedly likened the company ’s plight to that of the defendant in a 2002 habeas case , Lee v. Kemna .
In Kemna , a jury convicted the defendant of murder after his alibi witnesses disappeared from the courtroom and the judge refused to grant a recess in the trial so the witnesses could be located .
The Supreme Court granted the defendant a new trial because it found that the state court procedural rule was n’t sufficient grounds to deny him a critical constitutional right .
Philip Morris thinks it ’s in the same boat in the Williams case .
Yet the justices did n’t seem to be buying that argument , perhaps for good reason .
Kemna was an all - too - rare victory for a criminal defendant , says David Vladeck , a Georgetown law professor who worked on the case , noting that most criminal defendants in similar straits usually lose because the Supreme Court defers to the states to run their courts .
“ The Supreme Court ’s answer to those people is ‘ tough nuggies , ' ” he says .
To give Philip Morris a victory , the high court would have to find some way to square such a decision with its general approach to criminal cases — which is not an easy act of jurisprudence .
Indeed , Justice Anthony Kennedy , the court ’s new swing voter , wrote a dissent in Kemna , joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , in which he bashed the majority for disrespecting state courts and for not allowing the Missouri Court of Appeals to enforce its own rules .
Unfortunately , perhaps , for Williams , Kennedy seemed to have forgotten that case on Wednesday .
His comments during oral arguments suggest that he was mighty upset that the Oregon Supreme Court had defied a direct order from the high court , however cleverly it might have done it .
But Williams might not need Kennedy .
During oral arguments , Justice Stephen Breyer , who had voted against Williams during her case ’s last visit to the court , noted that when he had first read Philip Morris ’ petition for certiorari , he thought that the Oregon court was indeed trying to do an end run around the Supreme Court .
“ I ’m not sure that I think that now , ” he admitted .
After showing a surprising familiarity with the factual record , Breyer expressed skepticism that the Oregon Supreme Court had “ ambushed ” the tobacco company with an obscure , rarely used procedural rule , as Philip Morris had argued in its briefs .
Instead , Breyer said he had to put himself in the shoes of the Oregon Supreme Court , and after doing so , he suggested that those Northwest justices actually did a pretty thorough job of handling the case and applied its rules the same way it had been done for 100 years .
Breyer ’s conversion had Robert Peck , the lawyer who argued the case for Williams , beaming after the arguments .
Peck had gone into court as the underdog .
The day before the arguments , Thomas , his cocounsel , had despaired that the court had not taken up the case “ to do any good for Mayola Williams , ” who is now in her late ’ 70s and who will be lucky to live long enough to see the decade - long litigation resolved in her favor .
Yet after hearing Breyer ’s questions , Peck remarked after the hearing , “ This is not necessarily the case [ the justices ] thought it was . ”
Indeed , it ’s not such a stretch to believe that the court just might find that Oregon is not Alabama , and Philip Morris is not the NAACP .

Businessman cuts off finger in court after judge refuses his offer to settle debt
A Portuguese businessman said he cut off one of his fingers in court with a butcher 's knife in an ' act of despair ' after a judge refused his offer to settle a 170,000 euro debt and said part of his farm must be sold .
' My intention was to tear up all the case papers and splatter them with blood so I could prevent the expropriation order for my land , ' Orico Silva was quoted as saying in local media after his drastic action in the court house .
' Act of despair ' : Orico Silva cut off his index finger in court after being ordered to sell part of his farm
Silva , who owns a 20 hectare ( 50 acre ) farm in the central town of Figueira da Foz , was being sued by a company for holding onto a cash deposit on a land deal which had fallen through , the local newspaper said .
' I freaked out when the judge refused my offer to pay the debt and ordered the sale of part of my land .
I told her I had a 1.2 million euro bank guarantee which would have allowed me to pay the debt , ' Silva said .
When he went to take the bank papers from his briefcase , he noticed the butcher 's knife he had recently bought at a market and decided to cut off his index finger , using a court desk as a chopping board .
He then cut the finger into three .
' I did n't feel anything , I could even have cut off all my fingers .
It was an act of despair , ' he said .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Eight South Asian countries have agreed to create a 243,000 - tonne strategic grain reserve to meet any sudden spurt in demand in the region , India ’s farm minister Sharad Pawar said on Tuesday .
India will contribute 153,000 tonnes of grains , Pakistan and Bangladesh will provide 40,000 tonnes each and other countries will put aside smaller amounts , Pawar said .
“ The food bank will have 243,000 tonnes capacity to begin with which will be scaled up gradually , ” Pawar told reporters after meeting farm ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) .
“ Forty percent of the world ’s poor live in this region ...
The idea behind the food bank is to meet any sudden rise in demand due to a natural calamity or any other eventuality , ” Pawar said , adding the store would be operational from 2009 .
Pawar said SAARC countries would be able to buy grains from the strategic reserves at free - on - board prices .

Che : The Ronald McDonald of Revolution
Speaker 's Corner : Rolf Potts examines the clichés of the revolutionary 's admirers and detractors
REUTERS /AIN / Justo Gonzalez Ortega REUTERS /AIN / Justo Gonzalez Ortega
Visit the Museo de la Revolución in central Havana , and two things about the museum ’s photo displays will immediately capture your attention .
First , it ’s clear that the battle to control Cuba in the late 1950s was ultimately won by the cool guys .
Young , bearded and ruggedly handsome , the rebel warriors of Fidel Castro ’s 26th of July Movement look like Beat hipsters and rock stars —
Fidel tall and imposing in his fatigues ; Camillo Cienfuegos grinning under his broad - brimmed cowboy hat ; Ernesto “ Che ” Guevara looking smolderingly photogenic in his black beret .
By contrast , the U.S. - backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and his cronies look bloated , balding and unquestionably corrupt in their stubby neckties and damp armpits and oversized paunches .
Even without reading the captions , it ’s easy to discern the heroes from the villains .
Look closer , however , and you ’ll notice that the triumphant photos of Fidel and Che are faded and mildewed , their corners curled by age and humidity .
The photo captions are spelled out in a clunky die - cast typeset that has n’t been used in a generation , and contain glowing present - tense references to the magnanimity of the Soviet Union — a country that has n’t existed since 1991 .
Despite the grungy glamour of the young men who toppled a tyrant all those years ago , the anachronism and decay of the museum ’s exhibits reveal just how tired and toothless Cuba ’s revolutionary myths have become in Havana .
In many ways , the building is a museum of a museum — a yellowing relic of how the communist regime chose to portray itself in the 1970s .
Step outside the Museo de la Revolución into the humid Havana air , and the glamorous sheen of the bygone Cuban revolution seems to have been distilled into a single image —
Alberto Korda ’s famous 1960 photo of a bearded Che Guevara looking steely and determined in his beret .
In a city where few buildings outside the restored Habana Vieja district have seen a new coat of paint in half a century , freshly retouched renderings of Che ’s mug adorn countless walls and billboards .
Moreover , in a country largely devoid of public advertising and religious iconography , Guevara ’s ubiquitous image appears to fill the role of both Jesus Christ and Ronald McDonald — a sainted martyr of unwavering purity who also happens to promote a meticulously standardized ( if not particularly nutritious ) political menu .
Study the life of Che Guevara and a complicated portrait emerges .
Raised by old - money bohemian parents in Argentina , young Ernesto struggled with asthma , read voraciously , studied medicine and became inspired to help the world ’s poor after vagabonding through the Americas in his early 20s .
Falling in with Fidel and Raul Castro in Mexico , he played a heroic role in the Cuban insurgency that eventually brought down one of the most spectacularly corrupt regimes in the history of Latin America .
As he worked with Fidel to consolidate the revolution , Che displayed incredible physical and intellectual energy , an unyielding ( if rather creepy and totalitarian ) idealism and a consistent inability to see any project through to a successful completion .
Guevara ’s stint as minister of industry and president of the national bank crippled the Cuban economy and resulted in food rationing ; his rigid Marxist - Leninist fantasies helped derail the revolution ’s original democratic - socialist inclinations and led to Cuba ’s dependence on the Soviet Union ; his inability to recruit and organize the very peasants he meant to liberate led to a series of disastrous guerrilla adventures in Africa and Latin America , ultimately resulting in his capture and execution in Bolivia .
Fortunately for his legacy , he left a beautiful corpse ( quite literally , as photographed by his killers ) , and he ’s been an icon of revolutionary romanticism ever since .
Interestingly ,
Che ’s legacy inspires some of the least street - level romanticism within the country he influenced the most .
I recently spent a month in Cuba , and — despite the surplus of government - issued Che images along the avenues of Havana — I rarely met Cubans under the age of 40 who regarded Guevara with anything other than ambivalence .
Whereas outsiders see Guevara as a symbol of rebellion , two generations of Cuban children have been required to bleat “ Seremos como el Che ! ” ( “ We will be like Che ! ” ) at the outset of each school day .
Most people I spoke with were proud to be Cuban and could intellectualize the historical merits of the revolution ( and Guevara ’s role in it ) , but they were less concerned with emulating Che than navigating the absurd challenges of day - to - day life in a repressive , dysfunctional gerontocracy .
Indeed , to get a sense for what it ’s like to be 18 and Cuban these days , imagine going to a high school that won a miraculous and inspiring football championship in 1959 .
The guy that quarterbacked the team some 50 years ago is still wearing the same damned uniform — only now he ’s the school principal , and he ’s decreed that all academic subjects must be studied within the context of that bygone championship game .
Everyone at your school is now an honorary member of the football team — though the stadium is condemned from years of neglect , no actual games have been played in decades and anyone with the temerity to point out this discrepancy is summarily sent to detention .
On most school days you ’re required to study your principal ’s old pass - routes and blocking schemes and tell him how ingenious he was to have devised them .
All of which would seem insane were it not for the fact that tourists from wealthier schools — schools with actual , functioning football teams — are constantly visiting your class to marvel over how wonderful it was that your team triumphed 50 years ago , and gush about how proud you must be to have such innovative role models .
In this context , it ’s easy to understand why young Cubans are underwhelmed by the idea of Che :
To them , he ’s just another sepia portrait in the trophy case — handsome and intriguing , perhaps , but hardly relevant or revolutionary .
Granted , it ’s not hard to find Che Guevara aficionados in Cuba — just keep an eye out for anyone who has the option to leave the country at their leisure .
During my month in Havana , I met half a dozen Europeans with Che tattoos on various body parts , no less than two Uruguayan medical students who unironically wore black berets , and a woman from Oregon who sported a homemade “ Guerrillero Heroico ” tank top and insisted that the blame for contemporary Cuban misery could be traced to the small - minded prejudices of red-state America .
Whenever I mentioned the more troubling aspects of Che ’s biography to these folks , none of them seemed all that fazed .
Sure ,
Che might have promoted his ideals through force and violence , they said , but unwavering conviction and action are the only forces that can change a complacent world .
Sure ,
Che shrugged off torture and executions on his watch , but he was at heart an inspiring humanitarian who ultimately hoped to improve the lives of millions .
Sure ,
Che tried to impose a one - size - fits - all political vision on faraway cultures — but at least that vision was just , and might well have worked had it been given a chance to take hold .
This kind of rationalization sounded vaguely familiar at the time , and it was n’t until I returned to the United States that I realized neo-conservative apologists were using the exact same language and reasoning to defend the foreign policy decisions of George W. Bush .
While it ’s doubtful that any filmmaker would endeavor to dramatize Bush through the unvarnished lens of his political ideals , that ’s more or less the treatment Guevara gets in “ Che , ” Steven Soderbergh ’s four - hour , two - part film biopic , screening in select theaters nationwide .
Soderbergh ’s project , which stars Academy Award - winner Benicio del Toro , depicts
Che ’s military accomplishments in Cuba as well as his failed guerrilla insurgency in Bolivia .
Though both installments of the film are too grungy and impressionistic to spin Guevara as a typecast Hollywood hero , the continual portrayal of Che sacrificing and suffering for his ideals makes him come off like something more fanciful — a warrior - humanist martyr , as comfortable tending to the sick and illiterate as he is brandishing his rifle or facing certain death .
Guevara ’s less - than - saintly real - life exploits between his Cuba and Bolivia campaigns ( including but not limited to his role in executing political prisoners in Havana , his callous mismanagement of the Cuban economy and his military blunderings in the Congo ) are conveniently glossed over .
Omission or embellishment of context is , in fact , a central pillar of the Che Guevara movie sub - genre ( which goes all the way back to 1969 ’s “ Che ! ” — which starred Omar Sharif and was directed by the same guy who made “ Soylent Green ” and “ Mandingo ” ) .
In the climactic scene of Walter Salles ’ 2004 film “ The Motorcycle Diaries , ” for instance , a young Che played by Mexican heartthrob Gael Garcia Bernal swims across a swollen Amazon tributary as a display of solidarity with a group of dispossessed Peruvian lepers .
Read the actual diary on which the movie was based , however , and it ’s apparent that Guevara ’s river - swim was an apolitical test of his own aquatic skills — and , on saying goodbye to the lepers , he glibly noted that they looked “ like a scene from a horror movie . ”
Moreover , Guevara ’s unnerving sense of entitlement in the pages of “ The Motorcycle Diaries ” ( at one point young Ernesto throws a sullen tantrum when a local shipping deputy wo n’t comp his riverboat fare ) never makes the transition onto Salles ’ big - screen version .
Tempting as it may be to attribute
Che ’s popular appeal to the reductionist tropes of photography and cinema , however , I ’d wager his enduring potency goes beyond mere imagery .
Of the many books that have been released or reprinted to coincide with the release of Soderbergh ’s movie , Humberto Fontova ’s “ Exposing the Real Che Guevara ” is perhaps the most telling .
Published by Penguin ’s politically conservative Sentinel imprint , “ Exposing the Real Che Guevara ” is meant to be a polemic against Guevara ’s T - shirt - certified mythology — but in function it does a lot to show how Che ’s reputation actually benefits from the myopic fury ( and misguided political influence ) of those who hate him the most .
Taken in selective doses , Fontova ’s book does punch some well - placed holes in Che ’s presumed humanism and military competence .
The problem is that each argument invariably meanders off into subject matter that has little to do with the book ’s premise .
A chapter that starts out as an indictment of Guevara ’s battlefield acumen ultimately turns into a tribute to the Cuban - exile fighters who stormed the Bay of Pigs in 1961 ; a chapter meant to debunk
Che ’s intellectual proclivities wanders off into a jeremiad on behalf of the Cuban - exiles who lost their art collections after the revolution .
In places , Fontova ’s books seems less an indictment of Guevara than the New York Times ( which gave positive coverage to Che and Fidel in the months before they toppled Batista ) or John F. Kennedy ( who scuttled U.S. military support when the Bay of Pigs invasion went sour ) .
Ultimately , “ Exposing the Real Che Guevara ” is less about Che Guevara than the “ King Lear ” - style resentments of the Cuban - Americans who hate him — and the effectiveness of its argument suffers as a result .
In two lengthy chapters detailing Guevara ’s bloodthirsty stint as commander of Havana ’s La Cabaña Fortress prison , Fontova veers into abstraction by continually comparing Che and Fidel ’s tyranny to that of Hitler and Stalin instead of contemporary Latin American dictators like Somoza or Trujillo .
The most damning comparison might well have been to draw parallels to the brutal repression of Batista himself — the very tyrant Che helped depose — but this would have been too awkward a juxtaposition for the Cuban exiles the author seems anxious to venerate .
This gives the book a slightly schizophrenic tone , from which it never fully departs .
At one point , Fontova convincingly argues that Guevara wanted the all - encompassing U.S. economic embargo that strains Cuban - American relations to this day .
So why not ruin
Che ’s master plan by lifting the embargo and flooding Cuba with American investment , trade and tourism ?
Fontova ’s answer is incoherent : “ Libertarian - free - market ideologues got it wrong , ” he writes .
“ They insisted that with the lifting of the embargo , capitalists would sneak in and eventually blindside Castro .
All the proof was to the contrary .
Capitalism did n’t sweep Castro away or even co-opt him .
He swept it away . ”
Such an inane suspension of logic and chronology would be easier to dismiss if it did n’t mirror 50 years of American foreign policy toward Cuba .
There is no doubt that Cuban exiles suffered when Fidel and Che took power all those years ago , but basing present - day policy decisions on 1959 - vintage revenge fantasies is not only ineffective ( as Castro ’s lengthy reign has illustrated ) — it ’s bad for the image and national interests of a country that already has a less - than - honorable track record in Latin America .
Che Guevara ’s radicalization is famously tied to America ’s moral hypocrisy in the region ( specifically the CIA - sponsored 1954 coup in Guatemala , when Eisenhower chose the corporate interests of United Fruit Company over the authority of a democratically elected government ) — and his revolutionary legacy will likely remain strong so long as the U.S. government flouts international law with the Helms - Burton Act , permits prisoner abuse in Guantánamo and punishes Cuba for the same set of political circumstances it tolerates in China and Vietnam .
In recent years many people have pointed out how Che Guevara may someday be remembered as a capitalist brand as much as a communist firebrand .
Those affronted by the intolerant extremes of Che ’s Marxism can take comfort in the fact that his visage is now used to sell T - shirts , belt buckles , Taco Bell gorditas , bikinis and “ Cherry Guevara ” ice cream sandwiches ( “ the revolutionary struggle of the cherries ... trapped between two layers of chocolate ” ) .
This in itself is a telling contradiction .
But so long as U.S. - Cuba policy remains as warped and dated as the photos in Havana ’s Museo de la Revolución , Che Guevara will continue to thrive as a catchall symbol of the American government ’s own tendency to contradict itself .

She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Tuesday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown says the Utah parents are fighting the ruling and she hopes they prevail .
( CNN ) --
As a mother , I can hardly bear to imagine what the Larson family is going through .
The Utah couple this past weekend said goodbye to the little boy they legally adopted six months ago .
The boy 's name is Talon and when they took him in , they say he had drugs in his system , and that his birth mother had been declared unfit .
They took care of the child , and have loved and cared for him for the last six months .
But this couple has now lost their son because the birth mother is part Native American .
Watch Campbell Brown 's commentary »
She 's a member of the Leech Lake band of the Ojibwa tribe .
Her tribe went to court and argued that the mother had changed her mind and the tribe won the right to take custody of this child .

A federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act gives the tribe a legitimate claim .
This was a law that was designed to keep Native American children with Native American families .
It was passed in 1978 amid concerns by Native Americans that their numbers were dwindling and that they were losing their culture .
The law allows them to broadly declare who is Native American .
For example , the birth mother is apparently only one - quarter Native American .
The little boy apparently is less than that .
The Larsons say he does n't even meet the blood requirements to become a member of the tribe .
But the outrage here is this :
The little boy is n't going back to his birth mother .
He is expected to go into foster care , perhaps with other siblings already in foster care , again because the birth mother has been declared unfit .
So , a little boy is being taken away from loving parents who have cared for him for the last six months and put into tribal foster care because that is what the law says is the right thing to do .
To me , that is a ridiculous law .
If there is concern in the Native American community that children are being lost to the tribe through adoption because of unfit parents , then focus on strengthening your families so that your children wo n't be parentless .
It seems to me that entirely lost here is what is in the best interest of this child .
The Larson family is going back to court to try to get their little boy back .
I wish them the best of luck .

Boy George Found Guilty of Imprisoning Male Escort
received a guilty verdict in a London court on Friday morning on charges of falsely imprisoning 29 year old male escort , and will be sentenced on January 16 , 2009 .
George reportedly handcuffed Audun and beat him with a metal chain .
George admitted to the court that he handcuffed the victim , but it was only because he thought that he was tampering with his computer .
The mood was anything but joyous after the guilty verdict was announced .
The judge even went as far as to make sure that George does n't expect a dose of celebrity justice :
" The fact that your bail is being continued does not imply that this will be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence .
I do n't want any false expectations created . "
The last time that George was sentenced for breaking the law was back in 2006 where he was order to do community service and spent three days sweeping the streets .
THE INTERNATIONAL JEW ,
THE WORLD'S FOREMOST PROBLEM
Abridged from the original as published by the world renowned industrial leader ,
HENRY FORD , SR .
Appearing originally in the periodical published by the Ford Motor Co .
" The Dearborn Independent . "
IN an interview published in the New York World February 17 , 1921 , Mr. Henry Ford put the case for the " Protocols of Zion " tersely and convincingly .
He said : " The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on .
They are sixteen years old and they have fitted the world situation up to this time .
They fit it now . "
He made this statement when Jewish leaders and the Jewish Press in America were fulminating against a series of articles printed in Ford 's newspaper The Dearborn Independent during the years 1920 to 1922 .
After some years of pressure such as only organized Jewry can conceive or inflict , Henry Ford was made to apologise to Jewry in a letter addressed to Louis Marshall , then leader of the American Jewish Committee , dated June 30 , 1927 .
Ford 's apology was abject , but neither then nor since did he ever deny the truth of the articles .
As clearly as the " Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion " reveal a concerted plan of action , of intention and achievement , through centuries of world history , so the long series of articles in The Dearborn Independent expose the powerful concentration of forces organized by Jewish interests and the effects of Jewish influences in the United States from the time of the Civil War up to the uneasy years following the first world war .
The scope of the original articles is wide , the analysis of the relentless march of Jewish ambition and the rapid acquisition of political power is deep and dispassionate .
In their entirety they present a most thorough exposition of the range of Jewish influences in America over many decades ; they provide adequate evidence of the motives that inspire such phenomena and the ultimate objective towards which Jewish policy is leading the world .
In the 29 years that have passed since the publication of the series began , Jewish power in the United States has developed to a degree far out - distancing even the alarming proportions exposed at that time .
The Jewish " National State " of which we have heard so much deceptive talk elsewhere is already firmly established .
De jure and de facto the United States of America can claim that title , though many American citizens may even yet be astonished and no doubt indignant to read the statement .
But , examine the FACTS .
The Dearborn Independent articles fitted the American scene 30 years ago , they fit it now !
The Jewish Question continues to mount the scale of public attention all over the civilized world , attracting ever a higher type of mind to the discussion of its significance .
It can not be encompassed within the range of a single volume .
This edited version seeks merely to give the gist of the four volumes in which the famous series of articles were printed under the title : THE INTERNATIONAL JEW .
Presenting the essential facts in easier sequence and condensed to about one - tenth of the original wordage , many contemporary illustrations have been eliminated , but the implications of the Jewish Question in America and the evidence of the impact of the Jewish Idea on the lives of ordinary American citizens have been marshalled in a form readily assimilable by new readers , providing a useful digest for the informed .
The way to a just solution of " the world 's foremost problem " is clearly indicated .
Truth is visible when honest men seek Her diligently .
The reader , wherever he may be , to whatever nation he may belong , should seriously reflect upon the fact that the conditions long - operating in the United States and the conclusions which emerge from this investigation of the Jewish Question in that powerful country , can , in all probability , now be paralleled in his own land , his own city .
If he should seek confirmation -- let him look around .
G. F. Green .
London , February , 1948 .

HENRY FORD was born on July 30 , 1863 , during the American Civil War , on a farm at Dearborn , near Detroit , Michigan .
He was the son of William Ford , a prosperous farmer who was of Irish stock .
His mother was of mixed Dutch and Scandinavian origin .
At 17 he became an apprentice in a machine shop in Detroit , and he also kept a machine shop of his own and worked for a harvester company by repairing their portable farm engines .
His mechanical genius showed itself in early youth , and in 1890 , when he secured a post with the Detroit Edison Electric Company , he realized that the public were more interested in road vehicles than in tractors and he studied the principles of the gas engine to overcome the weight of steam engines .
In 1887 he had built his first gas engine and kept on building more .
His first gasoline " buggy " was given a public trial in 1893 at which it attained a speed of 25 miles an hour .
In 1903 he formed the Ford Motor Company with 12 shareholders and a capital of 100,000 dollars .
In 1924 he was producing one thousand of the world - famous Ford motor - cars a day .
In 1924 the annual production of the Ford works reached the towering peak of two million cars , trucks and tractors .
The secret of his success lay in mass production methods , and high wages .
Of humble origin himself he had a deep feeling for his employees , and worked out rough and ready principles in regard to labour which he constantly applied .
One was to pay the highest possible wages , and in this he was a true reformer ; another , to accept applicants for work without questions or references .
Many European socialists were impressed by Ford 's proof demonstration that Marx had been rendered obsolete by Ford and that capitalism could be rationalized and moralized .
In 1918 , Ford , who had been a supporter of President Wilson , had unsuccessfully run for the Senate , and there was some talk later -- it caused alarm among the professional politicians -- that he would run for the Presidency , but he announced that he would not stand against Coolidge .
Ford made great endeavours , most of them impracticable , to negotiate peace between the warring nations of Europe in the first world war .
In 1920 he went into print and bought " The Dearborn Independent , " a virile and very independent journal published in his home town .
It was noted for its courageous and continuous examination of the Jewish Question in America , and for its objective views on true Americanism .
Ford was accused by many Jews , along with Deterding and Greuger , to be a financial backer of the Hitler movement in Germany .
At the Nuremberg Tribunal , Baldur Von Shirach , Hitler Youth Leader , said he had become " Jew - wise " through reading Ford 's books .
Ford was a resolute opponent of Roosevelt 's policy of " controls " in industry and commerce , but in his later years his political and other public activities were few .
He died aged 83 , at Detroit , April 7 , 1947 .
A famous American and one of the world 's outstanding individuals .
* * * *
In his book " My Life and Work , " published in 1922 , Henry Ford includes the following concerning the " International Jew " series of articles : " The work which we describe as Studies in the Jewish Question , and which is variously described by antagonists as " the Jewish campaign , " " the attack on the Jews , " " the anti-Semitic pogrom , " and so forth , needs no explanation to those who have followed it .
Its motives and purposes must be judged by the work itself .
It is offered as a contribution to a question which deeply affects the country , a question which is racial at its source , and which concerns influences and ideals rather than persons .
Our statements must be judged by candid readers who are intelligent enough to lay our words alongside life as they are able to observe it .
If our word and their observation agree , the case is made .
It is perfectly silly to begin to damn us before it has been shown that our statements are baseless or reckless .
The first item to be considered is the truth of what we have set forth .
And that is precisely the item which our critics choose to evade .
Readers of our articles will see at once that we are not actuated by any kind of prejudice , except it may be a prejudice in favour of the principles which have made our civilization .
There had been observed in this country certain streams of influence which were causing a marked deterioration in our literature , amusements , and social conduct ; business was departing from its old - time substantial soundness ; a general letting - down of standards was felt everywhere .
It was not the robust coarseness of the white man , the rude indelicacy , say , of Shakespeare 's characters , but a nasty Orientalism which has insidiously affected every channel of expression -- and to such an extent that it was time to challenge it .
The fact that these influences are all traceable to one racial source is a fact to be reckoned with . . .
Our work does not pretend to say that last word on the Jew in America .
It says only the word which describes his present impress on that country .
When that impress is changed , the report of it can be changed . . .
Our opposition is only to ideas , false ideas . . . which are sapping the moral stamina of the people .
These ideas proceed from easily identified sources , they are promulgated by easily discoverable methods and they are controlled by mere exposure .
When people learn to identify the source and nature of these influences swirling around them , it is sufficient .
Let the American people once understand that it is not natural degeneracy but calculated subversion that inflicts us , and they are safe .
The explanation is the cure .
This work was taken up without personal motives .
When it reached a stage where we believed the American people could grasp the key , we let it rest for the time .
Our enemies say that we began it for revenge and that we laid it down in fear .
Time will show that our critics are merely dealing in evasion because they dare not tackle the main question . "

Hill has been told the bundle of cut - up £ 10 and £ 20 notes he found in a Lincoln litter bin could be exchanged for new ones - if he can piece the bits together .
Lincolnshire Police launched an investigation and held the money for six months after Mr Hill , from Gainsborough , discovered it in Lincoln City Square .

But the force gave him it back when no one came forward to claim it .
Detective Constable Nick Cobb said : " Following extensive inquiries , there was no evidence that the money was stolen or linked to any criminal activity .
" This was a very unusual case and despite our inquiries the circumstances of why and how the money came to be torn up and put in the bin remains a mystery . "
The value of the notes has been estimated at around £ 10,000 but Mr Hill faces a tough task , police said .
The currency has been chopped into small pieces and it appears no serial numbers have been left intact .
" He 'll have a job making some money out of it , " a force spokesman said .
A Bank of England spokeswoman said : " Providing the bank notes meet the evidence requirements , then an application for reimbursement should be successful . "
Speaking shortly after he found the money , Mr Hill told the Lincolnshire Echo : " I was gutted when I looked in there and saw it all cut up . "
Net neutrality really is the hot topic at the moment .
After the FCC slapped Comcast for slowing down BitTorrent users , Canada is now looking into the network management practices of its ISPs .
And rightly so , as a CRTC investigation reveals that most of the ISPs in Canada actively slow down customers using P2P applications .
Ignited by the Comcast fiasco in the US , the concept of net neutrality has certainly been brought into the mainstream .
ISPs are rarely transparent when it comes to their throttling , capping and otherwise interfering behavior , but in Canada they had to come clean due to a CRTC investigation .
The Canadian Radio , Television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) is currently looking into the traffic management practices of Canadian ISPs , which came to a head as a result of a dispute between CAIP , and its wholesale provider , Bell .
The core objectives of the investigation are to examine the Internet traffic management practices being used , and check that they are in accordance with the Telecommunications Act .
The CRTC is looking at the effects of filtering on both regular customers and wholesalers , and the results of the first round of questions are just in .
Even though some of the responses are filed in confidence ( summarized by Chris Parsons ) , there is enough information to conclude that all major ISPs slow down customers , with most specifically targeting peer - to - peer traffic .
In their response to the CRTC investigation , Bell , Cogeco , Rogers and Eastlink all admit to slow down P2P traffic , arguing that it negatively affects network performance .
Shaw , one of the other big players , admitted that customers are slowed down , but most of its responses were filed in confidence and P2P was not specifically mentioned .
Bell was more open about its practices , and admits using deep packet inspection ( DPI ) to throttle its individual customers and wholesalers .
On Bell Wireline , P2P traffic is slowed down between 4.30 PM and 2 AM .
To cope with the increasing bandwidth demands of its customers , they further plan to disconnect heavy users and introduce metered plans where customers pay for the bandwidth they use .
Cogeco started to throttle P2P users back in 2001 , when they were only using a tiny fraction of what they do now .
However , it was seen as necessary because of the increasing load these users put on the network .
Like other ISPs , Cogeco considered other options such as metered plans , but these would not solve the network ‘ abuse ’ by P2P users .
Furthermore , the ongoing battle with P2P users who strive to evade their management solutions led the ISP to use deep packet inspection ( DPI ) as well .
Rogers claims it has to throttle P2P users to prevent their network from becoming “ the world ’s buffet , ” as they like to call it .
Not only does this affect their network , their bandwidth bills also increased due to the growing popularity of BitTorrent and other filesharing networks .
Similar to Bell and Cogeco , Rogers is also known to use DPI .
Upstream P2P traffic is slowed down across their entire network , regardless of congestion ,
Shaw filed most of its answers in confidence , but provided a rather paradoxical statement which clearly shows that they slow down upstream traffic .
“ The traffic management technologies have reduced the rate of upstream consumption to a more manageable rate , ” they write , claiming that this allows their customers to reach their full contract speeds .
Similar to the other ISPs Shaw is predicting that bandwidth usage will grow , and that traffic shaping is essential to manage their network .
In summary , we can conclude that there is no such thing as net neutrality in Canada .
All of the larger ISPs slow down their customers , with most of them specifically targeting P2P traffic through deep packet inspection .
Because of this , P2P users ca n’t enjoy the speeds they were promised , and several legitimate businesses whose income depends on delivering content through BitTorrent or other filesharing networks are unable to compete with those who do n’t .
It ’s now up to the CRTC to draw the right conclusions .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Karma caught up with former Culture Club singer Boy George on Friday when a court sentenced the star to 15 months for falsely imprisoning a male escort , a court spokeswoman said .
George O'Dowd , also known as Boy George , arrives at Snaresbrook Crown Court , in east London .
Full details of the sentence were n't immediately clear .
A jury unanimously found the pop star and DJ , whose real name is George O'Dowd , guilty of the charge last month after a seven - day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in northeast London .
The jury determined O'Dowd , 47 , had chained male escort Audun Carlsen to a wall at his apartment in London 's hip Shoreditch neighborhood .
Carlsen had also said the singer beat him with a metal chain .
Watch as Boy George arrives at court »
O'Dowd , who maintained his innocence , came to court Friday sporting a multicolored tattoo on his bald head , none of his trademark makeup , and a black winter coat .
The star quit Culture Club in 1987 after a string of hits with the group , including " Karma Chameleon , " " Do you really want to hurt me ? " and " Church of the Poison Mind . "
He has since become a DJ and revived his singing career , releasing a single last year called " Yes we can , " inspired by Barack Obama and featuring clips of the U.S. president - elect .
O'Dowd is no stranger to the law .
In August 2006 , he spent five days cleaning the streets of Manhattan as part of a community service sentence for falsely reporting a break - in at his New York City home .
He has also publicly battled drug addiction .
All About Boy George
Fluent programming gets a bad reputation , since some developers like to write code like the following :
var time = 7 .Days ( ) . Plus( 4.Hours ( ) )
Barf .
However , when used properly , I think it ’s very powerful .
Let ’s look at a typical method with some parameter validation :
// Copy src[srcOffset , srcOffset + length ) into dst[ dstOffset , dstOffset + length )
public static void Copy < T > ( T [ ] dst , long dstOffset , T [ ] src , long srcOffset , long length )
{
if ( dst == null )
throw new ArgumentNullException ( “ dst ” ) ; if ( src == null )
throw new ArgumentNullException ( “ src ” ) ; if ( dstOffset + length > dst. Length || dstOffset < 0 )
throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException (
“ dst , dstOffset , length ” ,
string .
Format ( “ dst range is not within bounds , ( {0} + { 1} ) > { 2} ” , dstOffset , length , dst. Length ) ) ; if ( srcOffset + length > src. Length || srcOffset < 0 )
throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException (
“ src , srcOffset , length ” ,
string .
Format ( “ src range is not within bounds , ( {0} + { 1} ) > { 2} ” , srcOffset , length , src. Length ) ) ; if ( length < 0 )
throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ( “ length ” , “ length must be >= 0 , ” + length .
ToString ( ) ) ; for ( int di = dstOffset ; di < dstOffset + length ; ++di )
dst[di ] = src[ di – dstOffset + srcOffset ] ;
}
That ’s a lot of code for parameter validation , but in a robust system it is necessary .
For debugging purposes , having all the information in there with the actual parameter values is invaluable , so that you can get a stack trace that tells you , “ Length was too big .
It was 50 , but the max was 49 . ”
The problem here is twofold .
One , code like this gets sprinkled all over the codebase of a large application and so it gets repetitive , tiresome , and is a bug hazard .
Having an off - by - 1 error is many times worse if it ’s in your validation code .
Or , because it ’s tiresome , sometimes there just wo n’t be any validation .
The second problem is actually much more subtle .
Ask yourself this : if both src and dst are null , what exception does the caller get ?
( and subsequently , what goes into the crash log or Watson upload ? )
It will only tell you that dst is null .
This leads to more iterations in debugging than is optimal , where you fix the problem of dst equaling null only to immediately get it crashing on you again when src is null .
If the exception told you about both errors , you could have saved a lot of time .
This happens more often than I ’d like when debugging issues on other people ’s systems , especially ones I do n’t have any direct access to ( physical or remote , ala Remote Desktop ) .
The end - user will post a Paint.NET crashlog to the forum , I ’ll fix it and send them a patch or new build , and then the same method will crash on the very next line of code .
This is especially relevant to methods for graphics which take parameters for stuff like width , height , location , bounding box , etc .
The X value may be bad , but the Y value might also be bad .
I need to know about both , along with the valid ranges ( and not just “ out of range ” ) .
There are times where I have fixed issues with no direct interaction with a user : if I get a bunch of crash logs for a certain issue , but I ca n’t reproduce it , I have often been able to fix it by incorporating a hopeful and conservative fix into the next release and then monitoring to make sure that no more crash logs come in .
And yes , I ’ve done that many times with Paint .
NET .
Reporting an aggregated judgement like this is just not fun .
To go the extra mile you need to create a StringBuilder , decide on the preciding exception type , manage concatenation of multiple parameter names ( “ sentence - ization ” ) , etc .
Like this …
public static void Copy < T > ( T [ ] dst , long dstOffset , T [ ] src , long srcOffset , long length )
{
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder ( ) ;
if ( dst == null )
sb. Append(“ dst. “ ) ; if ( src == null )
sb. Append(“ src. “ ) ; if ( sb. Length > 0 )
throw new ArgumentNullException ( sb.ToString ( ) ) ; if ( dstOffset + length > dst. Length || dstOffset < 0 )
… if ( srcOffset + length > src. Length || srcOffset < 0 )
… if ( length < 0 )
… if ( sb. Length > 0 )
throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ( sb.ToString ( ) ) ; …
}
Boo .
This is still tiresome , and creates extra objects , etc .
Because of the extra work involved , this tends to be done reactively instead of proactively .
Only the “ hot ” methods get the comprehensive logic .
I ’ve come up with another method .
Check this out :
public static void Copy < T > ( T [ ] dst , long dstOffset , T [ ] src , long srcOffset , long length )
{
Validate .
Begin ( )
. IsNotNull ( dst , “ dst ” )
. IsNotNull ( src , “ src ” )
. Check ( )
. IsPositive ( length )
. IsIndexInRange ( dst , dstOffset , “ dstOffset ” )
. IsIndexInRange ( dst , dstOffset + length , “ dstOffset + length ” )
. IsIndexInRange ( src , srcOffset , “ srcOffset ” )
. IsIndexInRange ( src , srcOffset + length , “ srcOffset + length ” )
. Check ( ) ; for ( int di = dstOffset ; di < dstOffset + length ; ++di )
dst[di ] = src[ di – dstOffset + srcOffset ] ;
}
Yow !
Ok that ’s much easier to read .
And here ’s the kicker : if no problems are found with your parameters , then no extra objects are allocated .
The cost for this pattern is only in the extra method calls .
There are three classes involved here : Validate , Validation , and ValidationExtensions .
Here ’s the Validate class :
public static class Validate
{
public static Validation Begin ( )
{
return null ;
}
}
That was easy .
This allows us to not allocate a “ Validation ” object , and its enclosed fields , until we actually encounter a problem .
The presiding philosophy in code that uses exception handling is to optimize for the non-exceptional code path , and that ’s exactly what we ’re doing here .
Here ’s the Validation class :
public sealed class Validation
{
private List < Exception > exceptions ; public IEnumerable < Exception > Exceptions
{
get
{
return this .exceptions ;
}
} public Validation AddException ( Exception ex )
{
lock ( this.exceptions )
{
this.exceptions .Add(ex ) ;
} return this ;
} public Validation ( )
{
this .exceptions = new List < Exception > ( 1 ) ; // optimize for only having 1 exception
}
}
It ’s basically just a list of exceptions .
AddException ( ) returns ‘ this ’ to make some of the code in the ValidationExtensions class easier to write .
Check it out :
public static class ValidationExtensions
{
public static Validation IsNotNull <T >( this Validation validation , T the Object , string paramName )
where T : class
{
if ( the Object == null )
return ( validation ?? new Validation ( ) ) .
AddException ( new ArgumentNullException ( paramName ) ) ;
else
return validation ;
} public static Validation IsPositive ( this Validation validation , long value , string paramName )
{
if ( value < 0 )
return ( validation ?? new Validation ( ) ) .
AddException ( new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ( paramName , “ must be positive , but was ” + value .
ToString ( ) ) ) ;
else
return validation ;
} … public static Validation Check ( this Validation validation )
{
if ( validation == null )
return validation ;
else
{
if ( validation .
Exceptions .
Take ( 2 ) . Count ( ) == 1 )
throw new ValidationException ( message , validation .
Exceptions .
First ( ) ) ; // ValidationException is just a standard Exception - derived class with the usual four constructors
else
throw new ValidationException ( message , new MultiException ( validation .
Exceptions ) ) ; // implementation shown below
}
}
}
The sum of these collections allows us to write validation code in a very clean and readable format .
It reduces friction for having proper validation in more ( or all ? :) ) methods , and reduces the bug hazard of either incorrect or omitted validation code .
Missing from this implementation , and other kinks to work out :
Could use lots of additional methods within ValidationExtensions .
( some were omitted for brevity in this blog post )
Calling ValidationExtensions .
Check ( ) is itself not validated .
So , if you forget to put a call to it at the end of your validation expression then the exception will not be thrown .
Often you ’ll end up plowing into a null reference and getting a NullReferenceException , especially if you were relying on ValidationExtensions .
IsNotNull( ) , but this is n’t guaranteed for the other validations ( esp. when dealing with unmanaged data types ) .
It would be simple to add code to Validation to ensure that its list of exceptions was “ observed ” , and if not then in the finalizer it could yell and scream with an exception .
The exception type coming out of any method that uses this will be ValidationException .
This is n’t an issue for crash logs , but it is for when you call a method and want to discriminate among multiple exception types and decide what to do next ( e.g. , FileNotFoundException vs. AccessDeniedException ) .
I ’m sure there ’s a way to fix that , with better aggregation , and ( hopefully ) without reflection .
Should probably change the IEnumerable < Exception > in Validation to be Exception [ ] .
Here ’s the implementation of MultiException , as promised in the code above .
And , in fact , it ’s incomplete because it does not print all of the exceptions in a ToString ( ) type of call .
Umm … how about I leave that as an exercise for the reader ? 🙂

We 're semi-liveblogging the Scopes Monkey Trial of the 21st Century -- today 's meeting of the State Board of Education , which is discussing science standards .
Here 's the first report and here 's the second :
Board member Ken Mercer of San Antonio , who has a really hard time following the " board members may not comment , only ask questions " rule , is obsessed with the difference between micro and macroevolution .
He has pretty much asked every person who 's testified whether they understand the difference .
Mercer is completely cool with microevolution , which he defines as small changes within a species over time .
" These 15 board members are good evidence of microevolution within one species , " he said with a guffaw before Chair Don McLeroy had to remind him to ask questions , not make comments .
But what about macroevolution , the idea that one species can eventually evolve into another ?
Dr. Royal Smith , a tall , white - haired soap - boxer , says there is " absolutely no foundation to support macroevolution . "
Mercer asked him if he was talking about the possibility humans evolved form apes , noting that chimps and humans share 95 percent of their genes .
Then Smith got all cutesy .
" I do n't think that would get you child support payment in Texas , " he said .
Cue the giggles .
Only the third time there 's been a collective laugh in here , or any sort of collective expression of emotion , if you can believe it .
Come on people , start getting really mad or really funny or that screaming baby in front of me is just going to go home !
When McLeroy is thanking the board and the public for being so calm and collected at a debate on evolution , you know something is not right !
Oh , wait !
Everyone just laughed because someone ended her testimony at the precise moment of the three - minute warning bell .
I 'm serious .
And disappointed .

The indictment is the second in the case .
In May , Bradley C. Birkenfeld , an American who was a senior private banker at UBS , was accused of helping a UBS client evade taxes through undeclared offshore accounts .
He pleaded guilty in June and is cooperating with prosecutors in their investigation .
Mr. Birkenfeld is expected to be sentenced to in January .
The offshore banking services brought in annual revenue of $ 200 million before UBS said it shut them down this year .
Mr. Weil , who turns 49 on Thursday , was the head of UBS ’s wealth management business , which included the United States cross - border business now under scrutiny .
He was promoted in July 2007 to chief executive of a UBS division that oversaw the United States cross - border business and worldwide private banking .
The bankers , managers and desk heads identified as co-conspirators helped American clients hide assets by preparing forms called W8 - BENs that made it look as if offshore entities , and not the clients , held the assets .
The clients also failed to file I.R.S. disclosure forms that are required if they have an interest in foreign financial accounts worth more than $ 10,000 .
One unnamed manager referred clients in 2000 to outside lawyers and accountants to set up illegal offshore entities with UBS .
Another manager told clients worried about being caught by the I.R.S. that UBS “ would not be pressured ” to disclose clients ’ identities .
Mr. Weil , the indictment said , referred to the private banking business he oversaw as “ toxic waste , ” because he knew that UBS was flouting United States tax and securities laws as well as a special agreement between the bank and the I.R.S. Mr. Weil , the indictment said , instructed bankers to expand the private banking business even as it was coming under federal scrutiny .
Letters reviewed by The New York Times in August showed that senior executives were alerted at least three years ago to possible violations of securities laws in dealings with American clients of its private bank .
The letters cast a spotlight on the senior executives who were copied on them , including Marcel Rohner , who led the bank ’s global wealth management unit and has been chief executive since 2007 , and Peter Kurer , the bank ’s former top lawyer , who is now its chairman .
A key compound cuts damaging proteins
University of South Florida scientists found the component prevented Alzheimer 's - like damage in the brains of mice bred to develop symptoms .
The component - EGCG - is already strongly suspected of offering protection against certain cancers .
The study is published in the Journal of Neuroscience .
It provides evidence that EGCG decreases production of the beta - amyloid protein thought to play a key role in the development of Alzheimer 's symptoms .
A new generation of dietary supplements containing pure EGCG may lead to the greatest benefit for treating Alzheimer 's disease
Dr Doug Shytle
It is this protein that forms the characteristic plaques found in the brain of Alzheimer 's patients which are thought to lead to nerve damage and memory loss .
After treating Alzheimer 's mice for several months with daily injections of pure EGCG , the researchers observed a dramatic decrease - as much as 54 % - of brain - clogging Alzheimer 's plaques .
Lead researcher Dr Jun Tan said : " The findings suggest that a concentrated component of green tea can decrease brain beta - amyloid plaque formation .
" If beta - amyloid pathology in this Alzheimer 's mouse model is representative of Alzheimer 's disease pathology in humans , EGCG dietary supplementation may be effective in preventing and treating the disease . "
Green tea contains many antioxidants , including those known as flavonoids , that can protect against damage to the brain caused by charged particles called free radicals .
However , the Florida team showed that other flavonoids in green tea actually block EGCG 's ability to prevent the harmful build up of beta- amyloid .
Thus drinking green tea alone would not likely have a beneficial effect .
Supplements
Dr Doug Shytle , who also worked on the study , said : " This finding suggests that green tea extract selectively concentrating EGCG would be needed to override the counteractive effect of other flavonoids found in green tea . "
" A new generation of dietary supplements containing pure EGCG may lead to the greatest benefit for treating Alzheimer 's disease . "
Humans would need a daily dose of 1,500 to 1,600 mg of EGCG to approximate the level that had a positive impact on mice .
That dosage has already been studied in healthy human volunteers and was found to be safe and well tolerated .
The Florida team now plans to study whether multiple oral doses of EGCG can reduce memory loss in Alzheimer 's mice as well as reducing plaque formation .
Harriet Millward , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , told the BBC News website : " This is quite encouraging progress , building on previous evidence that antioxidants in green tea might be beneficial to Alzheimer 's patients either as treatment or prevention . "
However , Dr Millward said the role of beta - amyloid in the brain was not well understood , and reducing levels too far might cause damage .
It was also not clear whether the formation of plaques was a cause of Alzheimer 's , or just an effect of it .
Dr Susanne Sorensen , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " It is valuable to identify any compound that may halt the development of amyloid plaques , which are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer 's disease .
" Especially as there is currently no cure for Alzheimer 's disease .
" However , more research is needed before it is possible to recommend the compound found in green tea as a treatment for Alzheimer 's disease in humans . "
SYDNEY has been ranked at the bottom of a list of the world 's most important 20 cities for the quality of its transport infrastructure , behind Mumbai , Sao Paulo and Mexico City .
With no underground metro , a shortage of taxis and worsening congestion , Sydney fell short of its international peers according to the Cities of Opportunity report , compiled by the New York Chamber of Commerce and PricewaterhouseCoopers .
The report comes after the NSW Government slashed its promised spending on transport infrastructure in its November mini-budget , and after new figures from the state 's audit office showing Sydney 's traffic congestion has deteriorated over the past four years .
" Why would investors be attracted to Sydney if we can't get basic transport infrastructure right ? " said Patricia Forsythe , the executive director of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce .
" Other global cities have shown only one path for an efficient transport network , and that is metrorail .
We 've got to invest now so that we do n't have a mobility crisis in the future . "

His name is Floyd and he drinks Maker ’s Mark bourbon , and as midnight approached on Nov. 28 , 2007 , I was buying Floyd ’s whiskey at Shelly ’s Backroom Tavern on F St. in downtown Washington , D.C .
Floyd is a handsome man about six feet tall , with gray hair and a passing resemblance to Richard Gere .
Unlike Gere , however , Floyd is neither a Buddhist nor a liberal .
He ’s a former New York City policeman , and his business is security .
A few feet from where Floyd stood quietly enjoying his bourbon that November night , his client sat on a sofa drinking a glass of white wine ( also my treat ) and laughing with her admirers .
Ann Coulter does n’t routinely hang out and socialize with her fans , but this was a special occasion .
The National Journalism Center that evening had held its 30th anniversary dinner where Coulter , perhaps the center ’s most famous alumna , had been the featured speaker .
Afterwards , investigative journalist Richard Miniter ( also an NJC alum ) had suggested that Coulter join us as we adjourned across the street to Shelly ’s , a cigar bar where D.C. ’s smoking ban does not apply .
So there we were , a couple dozen of us including Coulter ’s NJC classmate Washington Times copy editor Peter J. Parisi , relaxing at Shelly ’s when , about 10:30 p.m. , I thought to place a call to Washington Times deputy national editor Victor Morton .
“ Victor , you ’ve got to get down here —
Ann ’s here . ”
Victor and I sat next to each other at the national desk , and at some point every Wednesday evening , after first - edition deadline , Victor would say to me , “ Stacy , it is Wednesday . ”
Then we would both go online to read Coulter ’s latest column and laugh at her jokes .
It became a weekly ritual for us , and I knew that Victor would n’t want to miss the chance to meet Ann in person .
That night in November , however , Victor was very busy on the national desk .
It was the night of the Republican presidential debate in St. Petersburg , Florida — the CNN / YouTube debate — and it was Victor ’s job to edit the final story for the second edition , which did n’t clear the desk until midnight .
If Victor was to meet Ann Coulter , I ’d have to find a way to keep her at the bar until he could get there .
So I went to Floyd and explained the problem .
He said it was getting late already , that it was unusual for Coulter to stay out so late , and she had appointments to keep the next day .
However , if I ’d buy Ann a Pinot Grigio , he ’d see if he could get her to hang out until Victor arrived .
I ordered the wine , and bought Floyd a Maker ’s Mark for his troubles .
This proved an excellent investment , for when Victor at last arrived and was introduced to Coulter , he mentioned that he had been editing the debate coverage and instantly became her new best friend .
She invited him to sit down and tell her all about it , and for the next hour - and - a - half they sat side - by - side on that sofa , chatting amiably as if they ’d known each other all their lives .
We closed the bar that night and forevermore , when Victor and I meet for drinks , he ’s buying .
“ A sense of humor is not considered mandatory for those who want to get heavy into presidential politics .
Junkies do n’t laugh much ; their gig is too serious – and the politics junkie is not much different on that score than a smack junkie . ”
— Hunter S. Thompson
The most important thing to understand about Hunter S. Thompson ( and not even most gonzo fans seem to get this point ) is that he never planned to become a journalist .
As a teenager , he dreamed of becoming a novelist after the model of his heroes Fitzgerald and Hemingway , and later stumbled into journalism as a way to pay the bills .
That fact undoubtedly accounts for Thompson ’s flagrant disregard — indeed , his towering contempt — for all that J - school crap about Ethics and Objectivity .
You see this even in his first book , Hell ’s Angels , in which Thompson dismisses as “ hired bullshit ” the misleading coverage that the national press corps provided about the bike - gang menace .
Politically , Thompson was a man of the Left , to whom Republicans symbolized the respectable , conformist instinct he scorned as “ Rotarianism . ”
But he also despised as inauthentic such typical postwar liberals as Hubert Humphrey and Ed Muskie , so when he finally decided to get into political journalism — back then , the idea of a campaign correspondent for Rolling Stone was shockingly radical — his commitments were clear .
In late 1971 , the conventional wisdom peddled by the “ hired bullshit ” journalists was that Muskie was a cinch for the Democratic nomination .
Thompson did n’t believe it , did n’t want to believe it , and from the outset lined up solidly behind George McGovern .
The result was some of the most fantastically un-objective journalism in history , and arguably the most readable account of a presidential campaign ever written .
Given the Newtonian opposition of their political loyalties , and their vastly different literary ouevres , the fans of Hunter S. Thompson and the fans of Ann Coulter are very near to being mutually exclusive sets .
A Venn diagram would show an almost infinitesimal overlap between Set A ( those who admire the drug - addled king of gonzo ) and Set B ( those who admire the acid - tongued right - wing blonde ) .
Yet as one of the few occupants of Set AB , I find striking parallels between the two , and wonder why others do n’t also see these parallels .
Coulter never planned to become a novelist , but she actually tried to avoid a career in journalism .
In her speech to NJC ’s 30th anniversary banquet , she explained how her mentor — conservative journalist M. Stanton Evans , the center ’s original director — had been disappointed that , after her internship in the spring of 1985 , Coulter decided to go to law school at the University of Michigan .
There followed a clerkship with a federal judge and a stint as an attorney in New York before Coulter returned to Washington in the mid-1990s as a Senate Judiciary Committee staffer .
That position led in turn to her becoming a featured commentator on MSNBC , the perch from which she sprang to national prominence .
She got herself axed from MSNBC just in time for the Lewinsky scandal — her free agency permitting her to expand her audience bouncing between appearances on CNN and Fox — while she finished her first book , High Crimes and Misdemeanors : The Case Against Bill Clinton .
Here , then , is one of the biggest misconceptions about Coulter .
When she made her debut as a controversial TV “ pundette ” — a coinage that was applied in the mid-90s to a group of female Republican commentators that also included Monica Crowley and Kelly Anne Fitzpatrick ( nee Conway ) — she was already in her mid-30s , and was 36 when she published her first book .
One nowadays encounters College Republican girls who aspire to be The Next Ann Coulter , but seem to imagine they ’ll attain national fame as commentators by age 24 .
Coulter herself sought to temper such unrealistic expectation during her NJC speech , telling one young questioner during the Q - and - A session : “ Nobody cares about your opinions when you ’re 24 .
You do n't know anything when you ’re 24 . ”
Similarly , many young admirers of Hunter S. Thompson think that all they need is a colorful vocabulary , an obnoxious attitude and a penchant for substance abuse to attain precocious gonzo glory .
In fact , Thompson paid some serious dues before vaulting to national fame .
Joining the Air Force at 18 , he managed to land an assignment as sports editor of the base newspaper at Eglin AFB in Florida , meanwhile moonlighting under a pen-name for a local civilian paper .
After being discharged , Thompson bounced around through several short - lived jobs ( including a stint as a copy boy at Time magazine ) before spending a year doing freelance journalism from Latin America .
He was married and living in San Francisco with a young son , eking out a meager existence on occasional freelance assignments , when he did a story about the Hell ’s Angels for The Nation that led to his first book , published in 1966 .
Thompson was then 29 years old and had been a working journalist for a full decade , and yet today it seems that every college sophomore who ’s ever done a record review for a crappy “ alternative ” weekly thinks himself on the verge of full - blown gonzo fame .
This is absurd , as I heard Thompson ’s widow explain at a book - signing a couple months before Coulter ’s speech at the NJC .
Anita Thompson was 30 when she became her husband ’s second wife in 2003 , after working four years as his assistant .
Since his suicide in 2005 at age 67 , his widow has struggled to come to grips with the loss .
Her book , The Gonzo Way : A Celebration of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson , attempts to distill the larger meaning of the writer and his work .
At her September 2007 book - signing in Washington , Anita took dead aim at how Thompson ’s admirers misunderstand his legend : “ A lot of young people are under the assumption that if you do a lot of cocaine and drink a lot of Wild Turkey , you , too , can write like Hunter S. Thompson . ”
Binge drinking wo n’t make you gonzo , just as being blonde and opinionated wo n’t make you a cable - news celebrity , but these are the superficial notions harbored by the wannabe admirers of Thompson and Coulter — and also by their critics .
There was a certain high - wire performance - artist ethos to Thompson ’s outsized persona , just as it often seems that the entire purpose of booking Coulter on TV is the producers ’ hope that she ’ll finally utter the outrage that ends her career .
Beneath these superficialities , however , the reader encounters writers of unquestionable talent .
Thompson was capable of detailed and insightful reporting , and Coulter ’s books are based on prodigious research — Guilty provides 34 pages of endnotes for a 264 - page book .
But in both cases , their reputations precede them , so that those who abjure the drug culture ca n’t get past Thompson ’s stoned image to appreciate his reporting , and those who despise Republicans ca n’t get past Coulter ’s right - wing image to appreciate her research .
Likewise , neither Thompson nor Coulter neatly fit the pigeonholes into which hostile critics would cram them .
Thompson may have been a drug - addled lefty , but he also had the chivalrous charm of a Kentucky gentleman whose courtesy and hospitality endeared him to friends .
Coulter is widely viewed as particularly venomous right - winger , but she is also a fan of the Ramones and the Grateful Dead who used to date Spin publisher Bob Guccione Jr .
And if it ’s impossible to imagine them agreeing on anything else , Thompson ’s fierce enthusiasm for the Second Amendment is something Coulter would appreciate .
What I appreciate about them both is their ability to make me laugh .
I was a teenage dopehead ( and a Democrat ) when I first encountered Thompson ’s fiendish wit , and still laugh when I re-read my tattered paperback of Fear and Loathing On the Campaign Trail ’ 72 , with its hyperbolic putdowns of Humphrey , Muskie , and Tom Eagleton , the “ harmless , Catholic , neo- liberal Rotarian nebbish ” whose hidden psychiatric problem finally doomed the McGovern campaign , assuming it was n’t doomed from the start .
More than three decades later , no one remembers how serious it all seemed back then , just as no one now seems to recall that John Edwards was once considered a serious contender for the 2008 Democratic nomination — even as he was secretly cheating on his cancer - stricken wife .
Coulter had provoked outrage in February 2007 by dismissing Edwards as a “ faggot , ” and in Guilty , she clearly relishes his exposure as an adulterer , describing his fateful Los Angeles hotel encounter with reporters for the National Enquirer :
Edwards fled from the reporters and blockaded himself in a hotel bathroom until hotel security came to rescue him .
Even more suspicious , while Edwards was barricaded in the bathroom , no one reported hearing sounds of a blow dryer .
If only Republican Larry Craig had been in that bathroom , NBC might have covered it !
With Barack Obama now safely ensconced in the White House , perhaps even Democrats can now laugh with Ann Coulter at the foibles of Edwards , and wonder how anyone ever thought him to be presidential timber .
But her enemies are mostly political junkies and junkies do n’t laugh much , do they ?
Maybe they ’d laugh if she called Obama a “ shallow , contemptible , and hopelessly dishonest old hack ” — but Hillary Clinton has claimed dibs on that .

Or mailed to : Sara Baker Trust Fund #10350222753 Exchange Bank8220 Old Redwood HighwayCotati , CA 94931_________One year ago , our fellow deviant Sara Baker AKA Glory was on her way her way to school .
Sara was 19 - years - old at the time , a college student , happily in love with her boyfriend of a few years , making art and having fun .
As she was merging onto a highway , a reckless driver tried to pass her on the right and hit her .
The bump sent her flying out into traffic causing her to lose control of her car .
She tried to come to a safe stop and pull to the side of the road , but something when wrong in the last moment and her car was sent flipping over into a ditch on the side of the road , bursting into flames .
Passers by came to her aid , trying to break the windows to get to Sara , throwing mud on the flaming car to try and keep the flames from her .
Miraculously , she had no injuries from the accident .
She is taken to the hospital to recover , likely to wake up with a really bad headache .
However , in the hospital , Sara was struck by another attack , silent and devastating : she suffered a stroke .
Sara is now what 's called " locked - in , " a condition which allows her to feel her whole body but without being able to move voluntary muscles , with the exception of her eyes .
She is a quadriplegic that can feel everything : every itch , every fly that lands , every pain .
Sara will never draw again ; not the way she used to .
Every day she lives attached to tubes that feed her and help her breath .
After 11 months in the hospital she is finally home , but life will never be back to normal for her .
She requires constant care , and she is obviously very limited in what she can do for hours and hours .
She 's a fighter though .
She 's gotten back some mobility in her head and lips .
She is working on strengthening control of her vocal chords and working on gaining more control of her tongue so she can eventually breath through her mouth and eat again .
When she coughs , her legs move up to her chest .
Sara communicates with her mother , nurses , and her few visitors by using a computer that types based on her eye movements .
As the computer scrolls through rows of letters , she looks up when she wants to select a row .
The inferred light on the glasses reflects off the white of her eyes to make the selection .
Then she waits for the selector to get to the letter she wants , and then she starts over until she has spelled out what she wants .
I went to see Sara a few weeks ago and we talked for hours .
It was strange because I was used to talking to her online , and in some ways , talking through the computer was kind of similar ( all be it slower ) .
We had a few laughs and it was great to see the same funny , smart kid was still in there .
But there were sad parts too , like when she told me how much she misses making art .
I asked her if it hurt and she told me , " Always .
" Most of the time , she 's in good spirits , keeping herself busy with lots of movies and her physical therapy , but lately things have been getting a lot harder for her .
She 's suffered some emotional set backs in the last week , and she is starting to be more isolated .
She is lonely a lot because she is really disconnected from everyone .
The technology she has does n't allow her to access the web in a way that works for someone in her condition .
The technology she needs is , as you can imagine , very expensive .
Cyberlink will not only allow Sara to get online , it also has means for her to make digital art .
Sara 's mom is a single mom and she takes the brunt of Sara 's care like a true hero .
She is just making ends meet with the money required for Sara 's care on top of the rent and other everyday expenses .
She cannot afford to get this technology on her own .
I amto make a difference for this brave girl .
She does not have to be alone in herself .
There IS technology out there to reconnect her to her friends .
Please let me know if you donate , I 'd like to try to keep track of what we raise .
So far , her online friends at the web forum Tower of Time have raised $ 1090 , but so much more is needed .
Please help if you can , and if you cannot afford even just a dollar , then please pass this along to everyone you know .

Dude Who Takes Board Games Too Seriously
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -- Historians say Ponzi schemes and con men are a fact of life .
The best , the brightest and the richest can all become victims : from President Ulysses S. Grant in 1884 when the partners of his Wall Street firm left him penniless a year before he died of throat cancer to Bernard Madoff 's investors , many whom became instantly penniless , just before Christmas and Hanukkah .
Greed is a fact of life .
Thomas Friedman said it best in the N.Y .
Times : " I have no sympathy for Madoff .
But the fact is , his alleged Ponzi scheme was only slightly more outrageous than the ' legal ' scheme that Wall Street was running , fueled by cheap credit , low standards and high greed .
" What do you call giving a worker who makes only $ 14,000 a year a nothing - down and nothing - to - pay - for - two - years mortgage to buy a $ 750,000 home , and then bundling that mortgage with 100 others into bonds , which Moody 's or Standard & Poor 's rate AAA , and then selling them to banks and pension funds the world over ?
That is what our financial industry was doing .
If that is n't a pyramid scheme , what is ? "
Just when you thought it could n't get any worse along comes Madoff , the new poster boy for everything that 's happened to the America 's soul the past eight years : greed , arrogance , stupidity and megalomania .
OK , folks , you 're right , maybe it is bad and it could get worse in 2009 .
But it really is the " season to be jolly . "
So indulge me .
Maybe we can't erase the nightmare of the past eight years .
But for a few moments join me , take a trip down memory lane to 2000 as I reminisce on what makes America strong and resilient in tough times .
Noah 's Ark Survival Kit for Investors
We moved into our new home a week after Bush was elected in 2000 .
Maybe we were just focused on adjusting to the new home and community , but for a while America seemed peaceful .
Until that turning point a year later .
During a moment of heavy grief our president made the decision to focus our anger on revenge , war , evil .
But more significant , we were told to ignore our pain : Spend , " go shopping at the malls . "
And with that , we lost our moral authority to materialism , consumerism ... now , after eight years , we 've paid a huge price .
Not in money .
No , America entered a Faustian bargain , we traded away part of our soul that made us the moral leader of the world .
And now we want it back !
It was late summer when we first saw the house .
It had a mysterious spirit everywhere as we got the tour , as if an upbeat " Santa Noah " was silently singing Christmas carols .
Yes , Noah , the ark - builder who survived the perfect storm and saved the world .
That Noah , the perfect symbol as we navigate the worst economic storm since the thirties .
Yes , it was love at first sight when we saw our new home .
The owners had Noah 's Arks everywhere : Pictures .
Statutes .
Ceramics .
Tapestry .
And on a kitchen bulletin board , an email : " All I Really Need to Know I Learned From Noah 's Ark . "
Now that really got my attention .
The message was from Capt .
Jerry Shields , chaplain for the First Marine Expeditionary Force , their son's unit .
I 'm a Marine veteran , so I stopped , had to read that " thought for the day " emailed for support during troubled times .
Today , as the ominous storm clouds continue darkening , that message carries more impact .
So you 're tired of endless bad news .
Me too .
Let 's take a brief break .
Christmas , Hanukkah and the New Year are times of joy , love and celebration .
Laughter , singing , bowl games , presents .
And Noah 's spirit reminds me of how to navigate successfully through bear markets , economic storms .
Yes , if you want to know how to survive , Noah 's got the answer .
The ark - builder is one of history 's best long - term investors .
He thinks like a Coast Guard ice cutter heading through the storm .
The ark 's the perfect metaphor , a symbol of survival .
Noah 's message fits today .
We paraphrase it , but you 'll get his gift .
Listen to his survival tips .
Here 's how to build your " ark , " your very special ark :
1. Plan ahead .
It was n't raining when Noah built the Ark
Yes , we know it 'll be raining in 2009 .
Pouring hard .
But the real storm is within you .
So is your ark .
A state of mind .
Like my favorite special forces instructor put it : " If you have a guy with all the survival training in the world who has a negative attitude and a guy who does n't have a clue but has a positive attitude , I guarantee you that the guy with a positive attitude is coming out of the woods alive . "
Plan ahead , budget , save .
Cut expenses .
Build your ark .
It 's never too late .
2 . Do n't listen to critics , just get on with what needs to be done
Only one in three Americans were building their retirement ark before the credit crunch .
Most have less than $ 15,000 savings .
Most ignored the coming flood , laughing at ark - builders for wasting their money .
Do n't listen , do what 's right .
3. Remember , the Ark was built by amateurs , the Titanic by pros
The Pros : Wall Street , Corporate America , Washington , Cable anchors , White House , Congress , SEC , the Fed. Best .
Brightest .
Listen to their happy talk ... and you 'll sink in the flood .
You know what 's best for you .
Trust your inner voice .
4 . Two heads are better than one
Remember , " they boarded in twos . "
You 're not alone .
Your spouse .
Best buddy .
Mentor .
Ask for help .
Think long - term , to after troubled waters recede .
Maybe a new career , self - employed .
Time to start building a big ark for your retirement .
5 . Build your future on high ground
Goals , goals , goals .
Research studies prove that successful folks , the millionaires , get there by setting goals .
In one major university a small percentage of graduates with specific goals made more money than all the rest of their classmates 20 years later .
Today 's recession is a great time to rethink your goals .
Just do it .
6 . Do n't miss the boat , the ark will keep you from sinking
Action .
Now .
Yes , the market 's below last year 's peak , even below the 2000 dot - com peak .
Stocks are n't the only answer .
Hard assets ?
Realty ?
Commodities ?
Oil ?
History tells us cycles happen .
We 've had 25 bull / bear cycles over the past century .
Steady your ark .
Recoveries happen too .
7 . Do n't forget , we 're all in the same boat
America is the great land of opportunity , even in a bear - recession .
You can still become a millionaire .
And when you 're getting yours , remember to help someone who missed the boat , throw them a lifeline .
8 . Speed is n't always an advantage , turtles came on with cheetahs
Let 's hear it one more time :
In the race to build your financial ark , the tortoise beats the hare .
Trust .
You 've got a lifetime .
You can do it .
9 . Woodpeckers inside are a larger threat than the storm outside
Attitude is the key to success , it 's an inside job folks , " all in your head . "
Successful investing begins with that " positive mental attitude . "
10 .
When you 're stressed out , float awhile
Going over the edge ?
Time out .
Turn within .
Listen to the still small voice .
Ask .
And receive .
Pray .
Meditate .
Exercise .
Go for a walk .
Take a break .
Call an old friend , kibitz .
Help someone worse off .
Answers will come .
This too will pass .
11 . Stay fit
When you 're 600 years old , " someone " might ask you to do something really big , like build a big " ark " and " save your world . "
And that someone will be you .
Yes , a new calling .
To follow your dreams .
To achieve the mission you came here for .
12 . Overwhelmed ?
Your higher power 's with you , a rainbow 's ahead
I 'm very visual .
I love symbols , icons .
Reminders that a higher power 's working in my life .
It 's so easy to forget .
Everywhere in our house and outside we have them : Noahs , Santas , Buddhas , angels .
Protecting us .
And encouraging us to follow these " Survival Tips . "
Do it , you 'll weather the storm , discover a new day .
Bears and recessions do pass .
Bulls eventually return .
And when doubts seep back , worries the big guy in the sky 's abandoning you on the high seas , there 's always that rainbow off the bow of Noah 's Ark , dead ahead , sail into it !
Merry Christmas Chaplain Shields wherever you 're serving .
And thanks .
" Noah 's Ark Survival Kit " is the perfect gift for investors .
We 're the richer for it , outside and in .
And if you hit a real rough patch in the weeks and months to come , find inspiration in my book " Millionaire Meditation , " you can download online for free .
Namaste .
Shalom .
Peace .
Canada 's Governor - General , Representing the Queen , Invokes Rarely - Used Power to Temporarily Suspend Parliament , Saving PM Stephen Harper 's Minority Government From No-Confidence Vote -- But Harper Remains in Danger of Being Toppled by a Coalition of Opposition Parties When Parliament Resumes in January
Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada looked cool , calm and collected as he delivered a rare televised speech to the nation from his Parliament Hill office in Ottawa on Wednesday night .
And for good reason : Harper successfully headed off a no-confidence vote in Parliament that could have toppled his minority government just weeks after winning a second term in Canada 's general election in October .
A planned no -confidence vote pushed by opposition parties that was scheduled for next week was blocked by Governor - General Michaelle Jean , Queen Elizabeth II 's representative as head of state , when she invoked her rarely - used authority to suspend Parliament until January 26 .

By SKEETER SANDERS
Less than two months after Canadians went to the polls to hand Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative Party a second consecutive minority government , the country is in the grip of its worst political crisis in 13 years -- one that could see the Harper government fall as early as January to a coalition of opposition parties without the voters ' blessing .
Harper 's government , which won re-election in October but failed to win a majority in Parliament , could have fallen in a no-confidence vote that was scheduled for Monday .
But Governor - General Michaelle Jean , Queen Elizabeth
II 's representative as head of state , exercised a rarely - used authority and suspended Parliament until January 26 , when the 2009 - 10 federal budget is scheduled to be unveiled .
Jean had the option of either suspending Parliament , dismissing Harper outright and calling another election or allowing the opposition 's no-confidence motion to be voted on and then ask opposition leader Stephane Dion to form a government in a rare coalition between the three opposition parties not seen in Ottawa since World War I .
The embattled prime minister delivered a rare televised address to the nation Wednesday night from his Parliament Hill office in Ottawa , in which he criticized the two opposition parties -- the Liberals and the New Democrats , backed by the pro-independence Bloc Quebecois -- for attempting to " thwart the will of the Canadian people " and form a coalition government just seven weeks after the October 14 general election .
The proposed coalition of the Liberals and the more left - leaning NDP " cannot help Canada , " Harper said in his address , in which he made a direct appeal to Canadians to pressure the opposition to allow the Conservatives to stay in power , arguing that the opposition has no " democratic right " to form a government so soon after the election .
It is the worst political crisis to grip America 's northern neighbor since the 1995 Quebec independence referendum that almost tore the country apart .
Never before has a Canadian government faced ouster so soon after the ruling party won re-election .
The opposition 's planned no -confidence vote in Parliament on Monday ironically would have fallen on the same day that Quebecers go to the polls in a hotly - contested early general election in the French - speaking province , where the minority Liberal Party government of Premier Jean Charest is also fighting to stay in power against the opposition conservative Parti Action Democratique and the more militantly pro-independence Parti Quebecois .
COALITION GOVERNMENTS , COMMONPLACE ELSEWHERE , VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN IN CANADA
It is not unusual in parliamentary democracies elsewhere for the party that wins the greatest number of seats in a general election to fail to win an absolute majority in parliament and must form a coalition with other parties in order to govern .
But Canada has not experienced a coalition government at the federal level since World War I and at the provincial level since the early 1950s in British Columbia .
Canadians had grown accustomed to elections in which if the largest party fails to win a majority , it forms a minority government and then must compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation .
Historically , minority governments in Canada last an average of 18 months , although Harper 's Conservatives , which ousted the Liberals in 2006 , survived for 21 months before calling an early election for October 14 in the hopes of winning a parliamentary majority .
But those hopes were wiped out by the economic meltdown that rocked the world in September , resulting in yet another minority Conservative government , albeit with a slightly larger plurality .
The Conservatives currently hold 143 seats in the 308 - seat House of Commons , 12 seats shy of the 155 needed for a majority .
The opposition Liberals hold 77 seats , the Bloc 49 and the NDP 37 , for a combined total of 163 .
HARPER APPEALS TO NATION TO STOP OPPOSITION TAKEOVER
" At a time of global economic instability , Canada 's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together .
At a time like this , a coalition with the separatists cannot help Canada , " he said , referring to the Bloc Quebecois .
" The opposition does not have the democratic right to impose a coalition with the separatists they promised voters would never happen , " Harper continued , accusing the opposition of attempting to " impose " the coalition on Canadians " without your consent . "
" This is no time for backroom deals with the separatists ; it is the time for Canada 's government to focus on the economy , " he said , calling the parliamentary crisis a " a pivotal moment in our history . "
With his government 's back against the wall , Harper repeated his vow to use " every legal means " to block the coalition " to protect Canada . "
Harper also made a play for time , saying that the fiscal 2009 - 10 federal budget scheduled to be unveiled on January 27 will " contain additional measures to boost Canada 's economy , while making sure we avoid a long - term structural deficit in Canada 's finances . "
OPPOSITION LEADERS BLAST BACK AT HARPER OVER ECONOMIC STIMULUS
The crisis was triggered by what the opposition parties say is the Harper government 's lack of action in response to the worsening effects of the global economic crisis on the Canadian economy .
When their call for an economic stimulus package was ignored by the Conservatives , opposition leaders decided to forge an unprecedented coalition to oust the Harper government and form one of their own , with Dion as interim prime minister .
Dion resigned as Liberal leader following his party 's loss in the October election , but would serve as prime minister in a Liberal - NDP coalition government until a new Liberal leader is chosen at a party convention in May .
In a taped rebuttal broadcast shortly after Harper 's address , Dion defended the notion of a proposed coalition government " as normal and current practice in many parts of the world . "
Moreover , the Conservatives — largely based on their reaction to Canada 's financial crunch — have lost the confidence of the majority of members of the House of Commons and thus , " have lost the right to govern , " Dion said .
Dion said he sent a letter to the governor - general on Wednesday , urging her to reject any attempt by Harper to suspend Parliament .
" If Mr. Harper wants to suspend Parliament , he must first face the vote of confidence , " Dion said .
" In our Canada , the government is accountable for its decisions and actions in Parliament — your Parliament , " he told Canadians .
NDP Leader Jack Layton said Canada is at " a crossroads in our collective history " where there is a coalition government waiting in the wings to take over from the sitting Conservative government , which he maintains has done little to help ordinary Canadians during these tough economic times .
" An economic storm unlike anything seen in a generation is upon us and Canada must have a strong and effective government that holds the confidence of Parliament .
Tonight , we do not , " Layton said .
" A new kind of government , with a new kind of politics , is ready to serve , one that will put the economy and working families first . "
POWER STRUGGLE IN OTTAWA AFFECTING QUEBEC ELECTION CAMPAIGN
For his part , Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe is not backing down from his decision to support the proposed coalition government -- which is having some impact on the campaign for Monday 's provincial election in Quebec .
" I ask Mr. Harper to let the House of Commons vote , that we are finished with his government , " Duceppe said according to an advance copy of his speech delivered in response to the prime minister 's address .
" We can work to fight with all our strength the economic crisis that faces us . "
Pauline Marois , leader of the Bloc 's more hard - line pro-independence provincial cousin , the Parti Quebecois , is putting pressure on Premier Charest to take a side in the power struggle unfolding in Ottawa .
Marois accused Charest , leader of the Quebec Liberal Party , of letting the province down by refusing to take an official position on the ongoing federal parliamentary crisis .
Marois also demanded Charest speak up about the advantage she said the Bloc secured for Quebec by supporting the Liberal - NDP coalition -- a highly unusual move , given the decades - long rivalry between the Bloc and the federal Liberals .
Charest said he wo n't get involved in the power struggle between the Conservatives and opposition parties because neutrality is the best path to lead Quebec .
GOVERNOR -GENERAL HOLDS EXTRAORDINARY
POWERS IN TIMES OF CRISIS
Jean , whose post as governor - general representing the queen is largely ceremonial , nonetheless possesses extraordinary powers she has the authority to exercise in times of extreme crisis .
The unprecedented nature of the political crisis gripping Ottawa made it apparent to the governor - general that she had to step in .
" Today 's decision will give us an opportunity - I 'm talking about all the parties - to focus on the economy and work together , " the prime minister said outside the front door of Rideau Hall , the governor - general 's official residence .
The decision also sets the stage for a fierce partisan battle for public support between Harper 's Tories and a proposed opposition - party coalition over the coming weeks , during which Jean could , if necessary , intervene again by dismissing the government altogether and calling a new election .
No Canadian governor - general has ever actually dismissed a sitting prime minister .
Indeed , throughout the worldwide Commonwealth of former British colonies that still recognize the British monarch as head of state , only once has a governor - general done so .
In 1975 , Australia 's governor - general , Sir John Kerr , ousted Prime Minister Gough Whitlam 's government amid a constitutional power struggle between Australia 's upper and lower houses of Parliament , which were controlled by different parties .
Australia amended its constitution three years later to cut out any involvement of its governor - general in government .
In 1999 , a referendum on declaring Australia a republic with a ceremonial president as head of state failed .
Although the opposition Liberals hold a substantial majority in Canada 's unelected upper chamber , the Senate , no such power struggle between the Senate and the Commons is expected , nor is Jean likely to dismiss Harper , although circumstances might force her to intervene in other ways .
The Haitian - born Jean , Canada 's 27th governor - general , is the first person of African descent to hold the post .
Ironically , Jean moved to Canada with her family as a little girl to flee the political violence that ripped apart her native country during the last days of the Duvalier dictatorship .
CRISIS AROUSES CANADIANS NORMALLY ALOOF TO POLITICS
The power struggle -- unprecedented in a country with an international reputation for its politics being dull almost to the point of putting people to sleep -- has galvanized Canadians in a lively mixture of confusion , disbelief , anger and delight .
A random sampling of comments posted to the Web site of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation since news of the coalition emerged less than a week ago suggests Canadians are roiled as never before .
Many people writing to the CBC expressed anger over what they feel is an attempt to nullify the results of October 's election , with many openly accusing the opposition parties of attempting the equivalent of a coup d'etat .
" Our country supposedly is a democracy , but the opposition is talking like any other country that just overthrows the government because of disagreements , " one poster wrote .
" Honestly , are we the same as other countries that act against what the people want ? "
" Why should we even bother to vote if it no longer matters what the outcome ?
What a waste of the $ 30 million we spent on the recent election ! " wrote another .
Others are going further than simply calling the opposition parties ' moves undemocratic .
The attempt to defeat the government and form a coalition is " nothing more than a bloodless coup that does not in any way take into account the will or decisions made by the people in Canada , " wrote a Toronto man .
" Why have an election ?
Why make light of Iran and other countries ' abuse of power ? "

Chinese regime rediscovers the working class
By John Chan
30 December 2008
For decades , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has presided over the most rapacious forms of capitalism .
The overriding concern of CCP officials from top to bottom has been economic growth , the fostering of the market and the accumulation of wealth , including their own personal fortunes .
Workers were barely referred to , and then usually in derogatory terms .
Now the CCP has suddenly rediscovered the proletariat .
A prominent comment in the official Xinhua news agency on December 15 declared that the " Chinese working class will continue to maintain its position as the leading class " .
The CCP will " wholeheartedly depend on the working class , " it added .
This slogan was said to be the main emphasis of CCP leaders at the recent 15th congress of state - run trade unions .
Lu Xueyi from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences told Xinhua : " The working class is still the class basis of the CCP , the CCP is still the vanguard party of the working class and the advanced nature of the CCP is still expressed through the working class . "
No attempt was made to justify this claim nor , given the mountain of evidence to the contrary , could there be .
Confronted by the greatest global economic crisis since the 1930s , Beijing has openly collaborated with the major imperialist powers as well as bankers and corporate chiefs to save the profit system .
If the CCP has decided to pay lip service to " the leading role of the working class " , it is because it is terrified of the social upheavals that will be unleashed by rising unemployment and poverty .
Such a party has nothing to do with socialism or communism .
The CCP broke from Marxism and the proletariat more than 80 years ago .
Following the betrayal of Second Chinese Revolution in 1927 at the hands of Stalin , Mao abandoned the working class and based the party on peasant guerrillaism .
Under the Stalinist " two - stage " perspective , Mao sought an alliance with sections of Chinese bourgeoisie in carrying out democratic , national reforms , putting off socialism to the distant future .
When the CCP 's peasant armies entered the cities in 1949 , they suppressed any independent action by the working class .
Mao's " socialism " in the 1950s and 1960s mixed his own peasant radicalism with the reactionary Stalinist dogma of " socialism in one country " — that is , national economic autarchy .
Mao's utopian project produced one economic catastrophe after another , paving the way for openly capitalist elements headed by Deng Xiaoping to come to power in 1978 .
In January 1979 , Deng worked out a program of establishing export processing zones with five " red capitalists " — the magnates of steel , machinery , textile , cement and pig bristle who had joined Mao's regime in 1949 and formally handed over their properties in return for interest payments and senior posts .
Deng 's rehabilitation of the former bourgeoisie and the opening up of China to foreign capital led to an explosion of private entrepreneurs .
World imperialism did not forget that historic moment .
Commenting on the 30th anniversary of the " market reform " , the Financial Times wrote on December 18 : " Mao Zedong was right all along .
Deng Xiaoping was a ‘ capitalist roader ' . "
China became the sweatshop of the world , especially after the regime crushed the last upheaval of the working class in 1989 with tanks and troops in Tiananmen Square .
It was proof to global investors that the CCP would do whatever was necessary to crush unrest among workers .
In 2002 , the former Chinese President Jiang Zemin formally allowed private capitalists to join the CCP .
His " theory of three represents " declared that the new business elite and emerging middle classes were the most " advanced " representatives of society .
Private entrepreneurs were elevated as " part of the working people " and awarded official prizes as " model workers " .
Until recently , the " working class " and the " proletariat " scarcely featured in CCP propaganda which was directed at attacking ideas of social equality and extolling the virtues of getting wealthy .
Official ideologues branded workers in state enterprises as irresponsible loafers who should be subjected to the whip of market forces .
The result was the lay - off of tens of millions of workers in the 1990s .
The new ideological slant is clearly motivated by fear .
As Xinhua explained , the working class in China has exploded from 120 million in 1978 to more than 400 million .
Its share of the total workforce increased from 30 percent to 50 percent over the same period .
While Xinhua praised the proletariat as the " most farsighted , most selfless and best organised class " , its revolutionary character is what most concerns the entrenched bureaucracy .
Xinhua pointed indirectly to widespread hostility to the CCP regime .
Referring to the collapse of the Soviet Union , it cited a survey showing that only 4 percent of the Soviet citizens in 1991 regarded the Communist Party of Soviet Union ( CPSU ) as the representatives of the working class .
The rest thought the party was a regime of privileged bureaucrats .
If such a survey were done in China today , the results would be similar .
The vast majority of CCP members are state bureaucrats , military officers and businessmen .
Their privileges of luxury goods , mansions , wining and dining , constitute a substantial drain on public spending and a major burden on working people .
The gulf between rich and poor in China is as great as anywhere in the world .
CCP party bosses are widely hated for enforcing sweatshop exploitation , sanctioning or operating deadly mining operations and expelling peasants from their land to make way for real estate speculators .
They are notorious for plundering state enterprises , causing them to go bankrupt and workers to lose their jobs .
When protests erupt , local officials do not hesitate to use police repression .
A recent investigative report by college students published online revealed the abuses suffered by workers in Coca - Cola 's five bottling plants and suppliers .
Some worked more than 100 hours overtime per month — much more than the legally allowed 36 hours — for the minimum wage .
" These employees are involved in the most dangerous , intense and tiresome labour , work the longest hours , but receive the lowest wage and face arrears with and even cutbacks on their pay , " the report said .
Xinhua acknowledged the glaring social inequality in China , writing : " At present , China 's Gini Co-efficiency [ the standard measure of social inequality ] has exceeded 0.46 percent , as the gap between rich and poor is widening .
Among the 100 million people living in poverty nationally , a significant part is the working class masses . "
To justify this appalling situation , Xinhua cited the comments of a Peking University professor who declared that private enterprise and capitalist exploitation were " unavoidable " at present stage of China 's development , but would be " eventually abolished " .
According to the latest version of the Stalinist two - stage theory , due to China 's relative backwardness , it must pass through a protracted stage of market economy — officially at least 100 years — before socialism can be built .
Such feeble rationalisations are wearing thin , however .
While the Chinese economy was expanding rapidly , the CCP was able to balance precariously in power using a mixture of small concessions and police state methods .
Now that the economy is slowing dramatically , skyrocketing unemployment is threatened to trigger social unrest .
A report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences this month showed that 1.5 million college graduates would not find a job this year .
Even if China were able to maintain a growth rate of 8 - 9 percent , it will face an " oversupply " of 12 million workers a year until 2050 .
Many analysts predict a growth figure well below 8 percent in 2009 .
The real purpose behind the Xinhua comment was revealed in its praise for the expansion of state unions into the private and foreign firms that now employ the bulk of the workforce .
It hailed the building of trade unions as " strengthening the class basis of the CCP " .
In fact , these unions , like their counterparts around the world , do not represent the class interests of the working class , even in a limited way , but rather function as an industrial policeman to supervise the working class , guarantee higher efficiency and productivity , and above all to suppress the struggles of workers .
For all of its tributes to the " leading role of the working class " , Xinhua is calling for the strengthening of the police state apparatus in preparation for the turbulent period ahead .
ATLANTA / RICHMOND , Virginia ( Reuters ) - Bankrupt electronics retailer Circuit City Stores said on Friday it will liquidate its assets and shutter hundreds of U.S. stores after failing to reach a deal to sell the company .
Circuit City is one of the largest retail bankruptcies in the current U.S. recession .
Its demise paves the way for larger rival Best Buy Inc to boost sales and gain clout with suppliers as the leading electronics retailer .
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Huennekens approved the plan to liquidate Circuit City , and the No. 2 retail player in U.S. electronics said it would begin closing stores on Saturday .
“ Regrettably for the more than 30,000 employees of Circuit City and our loyal customers , we were unable to reach an agreement with our creditors and lenders to structure a going - concern transaction ... and so this is the only possible path for our company , ” Vice Chairman James Marcum said .
Private equity firm Golden Gate Capital and Mexican retail and media tycoon Ricardo Salinas Pliego , who owns more than 28 percent of the company , had indicated an interest in bidding for the company , Gregg Galardi , a lawyer representing Circuit City , told the bankruptcy court in Richmond .
Shares of the chain fell 77 percent to 3.5 cents .
Shares of Best Buy , which analysts have said stood to gain longer - term if Circuit City went out of business , closed up 8.1 percent .
An evaluation of bids for Circuit City ’s Canadian unit is still under way , and it may seek to sell its website , Galardi said .
The company does not expect any value will remain from the bankruptcy estate for common shareholders .
It has up to $ 1.3 billion in inventory to liquidate .
Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 protection in November , citing a deteriorating cash position and tighter terms from vendors .
It recently closed 155 stores , and now has about 567 U.S. stores .
A group including Great American Group , Hudson Capital Partners , SB Capital Group and Tiger Capital Group won the auction to run Circuit City ’s liquidation .
During its auction this week , Circuit City sought a deal with Salinas to operate a smaller group of 180 stores , but that attempt failed as the retailer lacked necessary support from trade vendors and financing to continue operating .
Circuit City ’s liquidators will continue to accept gift cards throughout the liquidations , Galardi told the court .
BEST BUY ’S GAIN
Anthony Chukumba , an analyst with FTN Midwest Securities , said although the demise of Circuit City could hurt Best Buy in the next few months , the Minneapolis retailer stands to gain a significant portion of sales in the long run .
He estimated that should Best Buy gain 30 percent of Circuit City store sales , that could add 50 cents in annual earnings per share over its next fiscal year .
“ We think they ’ll get better pricing , more access to exclusive merchandise , better terms , ” Chukumba added .
Best Buy spokeswoman
Sue Busch Nehring said in an email that her company would not project how any Circuit City store closings might affect its business .

“ It does mark a sad day .
We ’re sorry to see the stores close and employees move on , ” Busch Nehring wrote .
Circuit City , founded in 1949 when Samuel Wurtzel opened Ward ’s , the first retail television store in Richmond , stumbled as rising unemployment and tighter credit led consumers to cut back sharply on purchases beyond food and other staples .
Restructuring experts are expecting a wave of store closures and potential bankruptcies due to the recession .
Earlier this week , regional department store chain Gottschalks Inc filed for bankruptcy reorganization , and Goody ’s , a clothing retailer , said it plans to liquidate remaining stores in a return to Chapter 11 .
The bankruptcy case is Circuit City Stores Inc , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Eastern District of Virginia , No. 08-35653 .
GENEVA ( AP ) 
The world ’s most comprehensive legalized heroin program became permanent on Sunday with overwhelming approval from Swiss voters , who separately rejected the legalization of marijuana .
The heroin program , started in 1994 , is offered in 23 centers across Switzerland .
It has helped eliminate scenes of large groups of drug users shooting up openly in parks and is credited with reducing crime and improving the health and daily lives of addicts .
The nearly 1,300 addicts selected for the program visit one of the centers twice a day to receive a carefully measured dose of heroin produced by a government - approved laboratory .
They keep their paraphernalia in cups labeled with their names , and use the equipment and clean needles to inject themselves under the supervision of nurses .
They also get counseling from psychiatrists and social workers .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Bank of England , European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank announced Monday they will take whatever measures are needed to ensure sufficient liquidity in money markets .
The banks said they would conduct conduct tenders of U.S. dollar funds at 7- , 28 - and 84 - day maturities .
" Counterparties in these operations will be able to borrow any amount they wish against the appropriate collateral in each jurisdiction , " the banks said in a joint statement .
Swap lines between the U.S. Federal Reserve and the central banks will be increased to provide the quantity of dollars demanded .
An unusual project monitoring the accuracy of electronic voting in Humboldt County , Calif .
uncovered a glitch that dropped or miscounted 197 ballots in the November election .
The bug has been known to the manufacturer for four years .
E-voting 's troubles are widely known by now , so much so that Humboldt County registrar Carolyn Crnich consented to work with a group of election integrity experts -- banded together and calling themselves the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project ( HCETP ) -- to find a way to double - check the results of the June 2008 voting in her county .
Humboldt uses Diebold optical - scan units running , as it turned out , version 1.18.19.0 of the firm 's Gems software .
Note the version number .
Someone at Premier Election Solutions ( which changed its name from Diebold in August 2007 ) did , in an e-mail sent to Lindsey McWilliams , Crnich 's predecessor , on October 19 , 2004 .
That e-mail detailed a fix for that version of the Gems software .
What it fixed was n't made clear -- the memo only said that " an issue exists with correctly sorting committed decks , in some reports , and also deleting other decks under certain conditions , when ' deck 0 ' has not been deleted . "
Advertisement
What it meant , for those who do n't speak Diebold , is that the machines using version 1.18.19 ( and the later 1.18.22 version ) were dropping votes .
Political careers being what they are , Crnich did n't see that memo until last month , after local programmer Mitch Trachtenberg uncovered the 197 - vote gap .
( According to political commentator and talk radio host Brad Friedman , writing in The Brad Blog , California 's secretary of state also did n't receive a copy of the memo , despite her " top- to - bottom " review of all California e-voting machines in 2007 .
A Diebold spokesman describes the 2004 memo as " a workaround . " )
Trachtenberg , one of the HCETP group who approached Crnich with their concerns , pulled together an open - source method of scrutinizing a closed - system problem .
He describes the process and his tools on his site -- start with Debian Linux , slap SANE ( Scanner Access Now Easy ) around a bit to get it working with his Fujitsu scanner , and get ready to re-scan and re-tabulate the November ballots .
( The group did a test run on the project with June 's results . )
At that point , Trachtenberg had to take particular care not to risk invalidating the entire batch of ballots .
If a ballot can be identified , the vote can be sold , so California law invalidates any ballot that can be traced to an individual .
While he awaited their arrival , he wrote a program that could scrub any potentially identifying information from each card .
Additional modules were written to increase project transparency , and the project was off to the races -- deputized volunteers , chain - of - custody controls , and all .
Of the 64,161 ballots cast in Humboldt County in November , 197 were found to have been dropped -- about .0031 % , in other words .
( Could be worse ; county officials say that no race outcomes were affected . )
Trachtenberg 's full story of the discovery is a must - read , especially if you 've ever been on a project that made you feel like you were at a parade honoring the emperor 's new clothes .
Now what ?
Premier says that the " product advisory process " has been changed since 2004 to ensure that secretaries of state hear about issues with software or hardware as soon as the notices go to the actual election precincts .
The company rep also said that software recalls and re-issuance of manuals were n't practical options , federal and state certification processes being already expensive and tedious affairs .
In Humboldt County , Carolyn Crnich ended up re-certifying the November elections in light of the corrected results .
And Mitch Trachtenberg 's got a great idea for a new business -- with his Ballot Browser software a manifest success , he 's launching a new turnkey vote - confirmation solution early next year as Trachtenberg Election Verification Systems .
The project proves that independent counts are practical and safe -- and that without oversight errors happen : " Our votes are too important to be counted by secret software running on black - box vendor machines . "
Is Mormon Church involvement in Yes on 8 violating tax - exempt statutes ?
Are n’t there laws against religions becoming directly involved in political activities ?
The Mormon Church has raised $ 10 million for Yes on 8 , has pressured members to phone bank and donate , and the campaign has threatened businesses that donated to No on 8 .
Now they ’ve been – uh – outed , they are backing down .
Guess they did n’t expect to get so much unwanted publicity .
Well heck , let ’s give them lots more .
Let ’s see if the Mormon Church has violated tax - exempt statutes by being so directly involved .
And if so , then yank their non-profit ( and tax - free ) status .

Mary Margaret McMurray was almost 6 years old when she and her sister arrived at the orphanage after their parents died of influenza in 1917 .
She stayed until she graduated from high school and took a job as a secretary at an insurance company .
“ The convent was so big , ” said Ms. McMurray , now 97 and living in Queens with her daughter , herself a Sister of Mercy .
“ And there were so many children there .
I had a lot of company .
But it was very pleasant . ”
The nuns taught her a lot , she said , and not all the lessons were found in books .
“ They taught me to be a positive person , ” she said .
“ And of course , religion , too . ”
Changes in social welfare policies in the 1970s led the order to open group homes , encourage adoption or foster care , and expand services to the homeless and developmentally disabled .
Fewer women were entering the order , while the remaining sisters grew older .
The convent became their retirement home , including one floor devoted to the infirm .
The neighborhood around them changed , too , attracting Latino , black and Hasidic families .
The order ’s leadership realized in the last few years that the old building presented too many obstacles for older women .
An engineering study in February recommended extensive exterior renovations , removal of asbestos and rebuilding the foundation .
Sister Christine McCann , the president for the region that includes the convent , said the millions of dollars needed for repairs could be better used to finance social and educational work by the order , which still has about 4,000 nuns in the United States .
Selling the convent could help raise even more money for their mission , Sister McCann said , but no decision has been reached .
Though the building is not a landmark  giving wide leeway for any new owners to develop or demolish the property  some nuns said they hoped they could still return to the chapel on special occasions .
Since September , with the help of two sisters with nursing backgrounds , the 38 nuns who lived at the convent have been presented with options for new homes  from apartments in assisted - living centers to nursing homes run by religious orders .
Will scientists one day be able to slow the aging of the brain and prevent diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson’s ?
Absolutely – once the genetic coding associated with neuronal degeneration has been unraveled .
According to a new study published in The Journal of Neuroscience , a research team from the Université de Montréal , Maisonneuve - Rosemont Hospital and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has taken a giant step in this direction by identifying a gene that controls the normal and pathological aging of neurons in the central nervous system : Bmi1 .
The primary risk factor for diseases such as macular degeneration , Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s is age .
Although many researchers have sought to better understand the genetics and pathophysiology of these diseases , few studies have focused on the basic molecular mechanisms that control neuronal aging .
Dr. Gilbert Bernier , of the Université de Montréal and Maisonneuve - Rosemont Hospital , led a team that identified a mutation in mice that dramatically accelerates the process of aging in the brain and the eye .
The new study reveals that neurons in the retina and cerebral cortex require a gene called Bmi1 to prevent activation of the p53 pathway and the accumulation of free radicals .
“ Overall , we have now established that the Bmi1 gene is a direct regulator of cell aging in brain and retinal neurons of mammals through its action on the defense mechanisms against free radicals , ” says Dr. Bernier .
Every industrialized nation in the world except the United States has a national system that guarantees affordable health care for all its citizens .
Nearly all have been popular and successful .
But each has taken a drastically different form , and the reason has rarely been ideology .
Rather , each country has built on its own history , however imperfect , unusual , and untidy .
Social scientists have a name for this pattern of evolution based on past experience .
They call it “ path - dependence . ”
In the battles between Betamax and VHS video recorders , Mac and P.C. computers , the QWERTY typewriter keyboard and alternative designs , they found that small , early events played a far more critical role in the market outcome than did the question of which design was better .
Paul Krugman received a Nobel Prize in Economics in part for showing that trade patterns and the geographic location of industrial production are also path - dependent .
The first firms to get established in a given industry , he pointed out , attract suppliers , skilled labor , specialized financing , and physical infrastructure .
This entrenches local advantages that lead other firms producing similar goods to set up business in the same area — even if prices , taxes , and competition are stiffer .
“ The long shadow cast by history over location is apparent at all scales , from the smallest to the largest — from the cluster of costume jewelry firms in Providence to the concentration of 60 million people in the Northeast Corridor , ” Krugman wrote in 1991 .
“ Well , all I can say , sir , is that it ’s a darn good thing for Barton , Franklin , Battersby , Klempstein & Pierce that you decided not to become a Zen monk ! ” Facebook

With path - dependent processes , the outcome is unpredictable at the start .
Small , often random events early in the process are “ remembered , ” continuing to have influence later .
And , as you go along , the range of future possibilities gets narrower .
It becomes more and more unlikely that you can simply shift from one path to another , even if you are locked in on a path that has a lower payoff than an alternate one .
The political scientist Paul Pierson observed that this sounds a lot like politics , and not just economics .
When a social policy entails major setup costs and large numbers of people who must devote time and resources to developing expertise , early choices become difficult to reverse .
And if the choices involve what economists call “ increasing returns ” — where the benefits of a policy increase as more people organize their activities around it — those early decisions become self - reinforcing .
America ’s transportation system developed this way .
The century - old decision to base it on gasoline - powered automobiles led to a gigantic manufacturing capacity , along with roads , repair facilities , and fuelling stations that now make it exceedingly difficult to do things differently .
There ’s a similar explanation for our employment - based health - care system .
Like Switzerland , America made it through the war without damage to its domestic infrastructure .
Unlike Switzerland , we sent much of our workforce abroad to fight .
This led the Roosevelt Administration to impose national wage controls to prevent inflationary increases in labor costs .
Employers who wanted to compete for workers could , however , offer commercial health insurance .
That spurred our distinctive reliance on private insurance obtained through one ’s place of employment — a source of troubles ( for employers and the unemployed alike ) that we ’ve struggled with for six decades .
Some people regard the path - dependence of our policies as evidence of weak leadership ; we have , they charge , allowed our choices to be constrained by history and by vested interests .
But that ’s too simple .
The reality is that leaders are held responsible for the hazards of change as well as for the benefits .
And the history of master - planned transformation is n’t exactly inspiring .
The familiar horror story is Mao ’s Great Leap Forward , where the collectivization of farming caused some thirty million deaths from famine .
But , to take an example from our own era , consider Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s disastrous reinvention of modern military operations for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , in which he insisted on deploying far fewer ground troops than were needed .
Or consider a health - care example : the 2003 prescription - drug program for America ’s elderly .
This legislation aimed to expand the Medicare insurance program in order to provide drug coverage for some ten million elderly Americans who lacked it , averaging fifteen hundred dollars per person annually .
The White House , congressional Republicans , and the pharmaceutical industry opposed providing this coverage through the existing Medicare public - insurance program .
Instead , they created an entirely new , market - oriented program that offered the elderly an online choice of competing , partially subsidized commercial drug - insurance plans .
It was , in theory , a reasonable approach .
But it meant that twenty - five million Americans got new drug plans , and that all sixty thousand retail pharmacies in the United States had to establish contracts and billing systems for those plans .
On January 1 , 2006 , the program went into effect nationwide .
The result was chaos .
There had been little realistic consideration of how millions of elderly people with cognitive difficulties , chronic illness , or limited English would manage to select the right plan for themselves .
Even the savviest struggled to figure out how to navigate the choices : insurance companies offered 1,429 prescription - drug plans across the country .
People arrived at their pharmacy only to discover that they needed an insurance card that had n’t come , or that they had n’t received pre-authorization for their drugs , or had switched to a plan that did n’t cover the drugs they took .
Tens of thousands were unable to get their prescriptions filled , many for essential drugs like insulin , inhalers , and blood - pressure medications .
The result was a public - health crisis in thirty - seven states , which had to provide emergency pharmacy payments for the frail .
We will never know how many were harmed , but it is likely that the program killed people .
This is the trouble with the lure of the ideal .
Over and over in the health - reform debate , one hears serious policy analysts say that the only genuine solution is to replace our health - care system ( with a single - payer system , a free - market system , or whatever ) ; anything else is a missed opportunity .
But this is a siren song .
Yes , American health care is an appallingly patched - together ship , with rotting timbers , water leaking in , mercenaries on board , and fifteen per cent of the passengers thrown over the rails just to keep it afloat .
But hundreds of millions of people depend on it .
The system provides more than thirty - five million hospital stays a year , sixty - four million surgical procedures , nine hundred million office visits , three and a half billion prescriptions .
It represents a sixth of our economy .
There is no dry - docking health care for a few months , or even for an afternoon , while we rebuild it .
Grand plans admit no possibility of mistakes or failures , or the chance to learn from them .
If we get things wrong , people will die .
This does n’t mean that ambitious reform is beyond us .
But we have to start with what we have .
That kind of constraint is n’t unique to the health - care system .
A century ago , the modern phone system was built on a structure that came to be called the P.S.T.N. , the Public Switched Telephone Network .
This automated system connects our phone calls twenty - four hours a day , and over time it has had to be upgraded .
But you ca n’t turn off the phone system and do a reboot .
It ’s too critical to too many .
So engineers have had to add on one patch after another .
The P.S.T.N. is probably the shaggiest , most convoluted system around ; it contains tens of millions of lines of software code .
Given a chance for a do - over , no self - respecting engineer would create anything remotely like it .
Yet this jerry - rigged system has provided us with 911 emergency service , voice mail , instant global connectivity , mobile - phone lines , and the transformation from analog to digital communication .
It has also been fantastically reliable , designed to have as little as two hours of total downtime every forty years .
As a system that ca n’t be turned off , the P.S.T.N. may be the ultimate in path - dependence .
But that has n’t prevented dramatic change .
The structure may not have undergone revolution ; the way it functions has .
The P.S.T.N. has made the twenty - first century possible .
So accepting the path - dependent nature of our health - care system — recognizing that we had better build on what we ’ve got — does n’t mean that we have to curtail our ambitions .
The overarching goal of health - care reform is to establish a system that has three basic attributes .
It should leave no one uncovered — medical debt must disappear as a cause of personal bankruptcy in America .
It should no longer be an economic catastrophe for employers .
And it should hold doctors , nurses , hospitals , drug and device companies , and insurers collectively responsible for making care better , safer , and less costly .
We cannot swap out our old system for a new one that will accomplish all this .
But we can build a new system on the old one .
On the start date for our new health - care system — on , say , January 1 , 2011 — there need be no noticeable change for the vast majority of Americans who have dependable coverage and decent health care .
But we can construct a kind of lifeboat alongside it for those who have been left out or dumped out , a rescue program for people like Starla Darling .
In designing this program , we ’ll inevitably want to build on the institutions we already have .
That precept sounds as if it would severely limit our choices .
But our health - care system has been a hodgepodge for so long that we actually have experience with all kinds of systems .
The truth is that American health care has been more flotilla than ship .
Our veterans ’ health - care system is a program of twelve hundred government - run hospitals and other medical facilities all across the country ( just like Britain ’s ) .
We could open it up to other people .
We could give people a chance to join Medicare , our government insurance program ( much like Canada ’s ) .
Or we could provide people with coverage through the benefits program that federal workers already have , a system of private - insurance choices ( like Switzerland ’s ) .
These are all established programs , each with advantages and disadvantages .
The veterans ’ system has low costs , one of the nation ’s best information - technology systems for health care , and quality of care that ( despite what you ’ve heard ) has , in recent years , come to exceed the private sector ’s on numerous measures .
But it has a tightly limited choice of clinicians — you ca n’t go to see any doctor you want , and the nearest facility may be far away from where you live .
Medicare allows you to go to almost any private doctor or hospital you like , and has been enormously popular among its beneficiaries , but it costs about a third more per person and has had a hard time getting doctors and hospitals to improve the quality and safety of their care .
Federal workers are entitled to a range of subsidized private - insurance choices , but insurance companies have done even less than Medicare to contain costs and most have done little to improve health care ( although there are some striking exceptions ) .
Any of the programs could allow us to offer a starting group of Americans — the uninsured under twenty - five years of age , say — the chance to join within weeks .
With time and experience , the programs could be made available to everyone who lacks coverage .
The current discussion between the Obama Administration and congressional leaders seems to center on opening up the federal workers ’ insurance options and Medicare ( or the equivalent ) this way , with subsidized premiums for those with low incomes .
The costs have to be dealt with .
The leading proposals would try to hold down health - care spending in various ways ( by , for example , requiring better management of patients with expensive chronic diseases ) ; employers would have to pay some additional amount in taxes if they did n’t provide health insurance for their employees .
There ’s nothing easy about any of this .
But , if we accept it , we ’ll all have a lifeboat when we need one .
It wo n’t necessarily be clear what the final system will look like .
Maybe employers will continue to slough off benefits , and that lifeboat will grow to become the entire system .
Or maybe employers will decide to strengthen their benefits programs to attract employees , and American health care will emerge as a mixture of the new and the old .
We could have Medicare for retirees , the V.A. for veterans , employer - organized insurance for some workers , federally organized insurance for others .
The system will undoubtedly be messier than anything an idealist would devise .
But the results would almost certainly be better .
Massachusetts , where I live and work , recently became the first state to adopt a system of universal health coverage for its residents .
It did n’t organize a government takeover of the state ’s hospitals or insurance companies , or force people into a new system of state - run clinics .
It built on what existed .
On July 1 , 2007 , the state began offering an online choice of four private insurance plans for people without health coverage .
The cost is zero for the poor ; for the rest , it is limited to no more than about eight per cent of income .
The vast majority of families , who had insurance through work , did n’t notice a thing when the program was launched .
But those who had no coverage had to enroll in a plan or incur a tax penalty .
The results have been remarkable .
After a year , 97.4 per cent of Massachusetts residents had coverage , and the remaining gap continues to close .
Despite the requirement that individuals buy insurance and that employers either provide coverage or pay a tax , the program has remained extremely popular .
Repeated surveys have found that at least two - thirds of the state ’s residents support the reform .
The Massachusetts plan did n’t do anything about medical costs , however , and , with layoffs accelerating , more people require subsidized care than the state predicted .
Insurance premiums continue to rise here , just as they do elsewhere in the country .
Many residents also complain that eight per cent of their income is too much to pay for health insurance , even though , on average , premiums amount to twice that much .
The experience has shown national policymakers that they will have to be serious about reducing costs .
For all that , the majority of state residents would not go back to the old system .
I ’m among them .
For years , about one in ten of my patients — I specialize in cancer surgery — had no insurance .
Even though I ’d waive my fee , they struggled to pay for their tests , medications , and hospital stay .
I once took care of a nineteen - year - old college student who had maxed out her insurance coverage .
She had a treatable but metastatic cancer .
But neither she nor her parents could afford the radiation therapy that she required .
I made calls to find state programs , charities — anything that could help her — to no avail .
She put off the treatment for almost a year because she did n’t want to force her parents to take out a second mortgage on their home .
But eventually they had to choose between their daughter and their life ’s savings .
For the past year , I have n’t had a single Massachusetts patient who has had to ask how much the necessary tests will cost ; not one who has told me he needed to put off his cancer operation until he found a job that provided insurance coverage .
And that ’s a remarkable change : a glimpse of American health care without the routine cruelty .
It will be no utopia .
People will still face co-payments and premiums .
There may still be agonizing disputes over coverage for non-standard treatments .
Whatever the system ’s contours , we will still find it exasperating , even disappointing .
We ’re not going to get perfection .
But we can have transformation — which is to say , a health - care system that works .
And there are ways to get there that start from where we are . ♦
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Army , struggling to ensure it has enough manpower as it fights wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , is wooing young Americans with videogames , Google maps and simulated attacks on enemy positions from an Apache helicopter .

Departing from the recruiting environment of metal tables and uniformed soldiers in a drab military building , the Army has invested $ 12 million in a facility that looks like a cross between a hotel lobby and a video arcade .
The U.S. Army Experience Center at the Franklin Mills shopping mall in northeast Philadelphia has 60 personal computers loaded with military videogames , 19 Xbox 360 video game controllers and a series of interactive screens describing military bases and career options in great detail .
Potential recruits can hang out on couches and listen to rock music that fills the space .
The center is the first of its kind and opened in August as part of a two - year experiment .
So far , it has signed up 33 full - time soldiers and five reservists -- roughly matching the performance of five traditional recruiting centers it replaced .
The U.S. military says it has been meeting or exceeding its recruiting and retention goals , with 185,000 men and women entering active - duty military service in the fiscal year that ended on September 30 -- the highest number since 2003 .
Defense officials say the recession and rising unemployment were likely to boost recruiting .
The Philadelphia center lures recruits with a separate room for prospective soldiers to “ fire ” from a real Humvee on enemy encampments projected on a 15 - foot - high ( 4.5 - meter - high ) battleground scenario that also has deafening sound effects .
In another room , those inclined to attack from above can join helicopter raids in which enemy soldiers emerge from hide - outs to be felled by automatic gunfire rattling from a simulator modeled on an Apache or Blackhawk helicopter .

The Army is not simply looking for new recruits , said First Sgt. Randy Jennings , who runs the center .
It also aims to dispel misperceptions about Army life .
“ We want them to know that being in the Army is n’t just about carrying weapons and busting down doors , ” said Jennings , who wears slacks and a polo shirt rather than a uniform .
About 80 percent of soldiers are not involved in direct combat roles , he said .
GLAMORIZING WAR ?
Jesse Hamilton , a former Army staff sergeant who served in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 , said the use of videogames glamorized war and misled potential recruits , calling it “ very deceiving and very far from realistic . ”
“ You ca n’t simulate the loss when you see people getting killed , ” said Hamilton , who left the Army after his Iraq tour and is now a member of Iraq Veterans Against the War .
“ It ’s not very likely you are going to get into a firefight , ” he said .
“ The only way to simulate the heat is holding a blow dryer to your face . ”
The center is an experiment in boosting urban recruitment , which has traditionally lagged behind that of rural areas .
Eddie Abuali , 20 , who was waiting to take an Army aptitude test , said he felt more comfortable in the center than he would in a traditional recruiting office .
“ It ’s a more relaxed environment , ” said Abuali , who plans to join the Army when he graduates from college .
“ You do n’t feel like you are being pressured . ”
Project manager Maj .
Larry Dillard said recruitment was more difficult about two years ago when the United States was struggling in Iraq and jobs at home were easier to get .
“ Now the news coming out of Iraq is better and we are in an economic downturn .
It will be easier , ” he said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Promising " a new era of openness in our country , " President Obama signed executive orders Wednesday relating to ethics guidelines for staff members of his administration .

" Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency , " Obama said .
In his first full day in office , Obama touched upon many of the major issues facing his administration , and even carved out time to retake the oath of office .
The move was aimed at dispelling any confusion that might arise from Tuesday 's oath , which Chief Justice John Roberts flubbed by mixing up the order of the words .
The do - over was also intended to erase any questions regarding the legitimacy of Obama 's presidency , although per the Constitution , Obama became president at noon Tuesday without taking the oath .
Earlier in the day , Obama said he would issue a pay freeze for his senior staff members .
The new president has also promised swift action on the beleaguered economy .
House Democrats , at Obama 's urging , have signed an $ 825 billion economic recovery package that the president says will save or create up to 4 million jobs and invest in health care , energy and education .
Watch Obama address his staff »
House Republican leaders , however , asked to meet with Obama on Thursday to offer major changes to the recovery proposal .
" The challenge as we see it is to create a plan that helps middle - class taxpayers and small businesses without wasting money or exploding our national deficit , " the leaders wrote in a letter to the new president .
Rep . Paul Ryan , the top Republican on the House Budget committee , argued that the main tax provision in the Democrats ' plan -- cutting payroll taxes -- was not an effective way to jump - start the economy .
House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence declined to say whether the Democrats ' package would get any Republican support if it did n't change significantly .
Obama also moved fast to address a campaign promise to close the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility .
The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the closure of the detention facility , according to two administration officials .
Obama began the day with a moment of solitude in the Oval Office .
When he arrived , he spent 10 minutes alone there , reading a note left for him on a desk by outgoing President George W. Bush .
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel met with the president 10 minutes later to discuss the daily schedule , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
Obama called Middle East leaders , including King Abdullah of Jordan , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Gibbs said .
On Sunday , Israel and Palestinian militants declared a cease - fire after 22 days of fighting in Gaza .
First lady Michelle Obama joined her husband in the Oval Office at 9:10 a.m. , shortly before the first couple departed for the National Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral .
Later in the day , Obama and the first lady greeted those who came to the White House for a formal open house .
Obama joked , " Do n't break anything . "
Obama also met with his economic team and top brass from the Pentagon .

Later in the afternoon , he met with the Ambassador to Iraq , the commander in Iraq , and the " theater commander " in the region for an update on the situation in Iraq .
" The meeting was productive and I very much appreciated receiving assessments from these experienced and dedicated individuals .
During the discussion , I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq , " he said in a statement .
" In the coming days and weeks , I will also visit the Department of Defense to consult with the Joint Chiefs on these issues , and we will undertake a full review of the situation in Afghanistan in order to develop a comprehensive policy for the entire region , " he said .
He plans to tell the top U.S. officers that he wants them to plan to have combat forces out of Iraq in 16 months , as he promised during his election campaign , an adviser said .

Branson Hunter , writing for the Big Bear Observation Post blog , reports that the Marine Corps Air and Ground Combat Center ( MCAGCC ) and the local California Highway Patrol will be working together over the holiday “ in a joint effort to reduce accidents and drinking and driving ” in San Bernardino County .
Hunter contacted Corporal Knuesn of the MCAGCC Provost Marshal office and MCAGCC Public Affairs Chief , Gunny Sgt. Chris Cox .
Both confirmed the USMC will be present on public roads in order to setup a military presence during routine DUI check stops .
“ They will be working closely over the month to cut down of traffic accidents , ” said Cox , “ the Military Police will observe DUI check points and watch for their own guys .
The intent is to have military presence out there . ”
Infowars attempted to contact the MCAGCC Provost Marshal office and MCAGCC Public Affairs to confirm the story but we were unable to reach them .
Dispatching Marines on California highways is an obvious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act ( 18 U.S.C. § 1385 ) passed on June 16 , 1878 .
The Act prohibits members of the federal uniformed services , including military police , from working with state and local police and law enforcement .
However , since September 11 , 2001 , the federal government has increasingly ignored Posse Comitatus .
On October 1 , 2008 , the U.S. Army announced its 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team will be under the day - to - day control of the Northern Command , ostensibly “ on call ” to respond to emergencies and disasters .
The world has gone digital in just about everything we do .
Almost every iota of information we access these days is stored in some kind of digital form and accessed electronically -- text , charts , images , video , music , you name it .
The key questions are :
Will your data be there when you need it ?
And who ’s going to preserve it ?
In the December 2008 edition of Communications of the ACM , the monthly magazine of the Association for Computing Machinery , Dr. Fran Berman , director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center ( SDSC ) at the University of California , San Diego , provides a guide for surviving what has become known as the “ data deluge . ”
Managing this deluge and preserving what ’s important is what Berman refers to as one of the “ grand challenges ” of the Information Age .
The amount of digital data is immense : A 2008 report by the International Data Corporation ( IDC ) , a global provider of information technology intelligence based in Framingham , Mass. , predicts that by 2011 , our “ digital universe ” will be 10 times the size it was in 2006 - and almost half of this universe will not have a permanent home as the amount of digital information outstrips storage space .
“ As a society , we have only begun to address this challenge at a scale concomitant with the deluge of data available to us and its importance in the modern world , ” writes Berman , a longtime pioneer in cyberinfrastructure – an open but organized aggregate of information technologies including computers , data archives , networks , software , digital instruments , and other scientific endeavors that support 21st century life and work .
Berman is a strong advocate of cyberinfrastructure that supports the management and preservation of digital data in the Information Age – data cyberinfrastructure : “ Just like the physical infrastructures all around us -- roads , bridges , water and electricity – we need a data cyberinfrastructure that is stable , predictable , and cost - effective . ”
In her article , Berman explores key trends and issues associated with preserving digital data , and what ’s required to keep it manageable , accessible , available , and secure .
However , she warns that there is no “ one - size - fits - all ” solution for data stewardship and preservation .
“ The ‘ free rider ’ solution of ‘ Let someone else do it ’-- whether that someone else is the government , a library , a museum , an archive , Google , Microsoft , the data creator , or the data user -- is unrealistic and pushes responsibility to a single company , institution , or sector .
What is needed are cross-sector economic partnerships , ” says Berman .
She adds that the solution is to “ take a comprehensive and coordinated approach to data cyberinfrastructure and treat the problem holistically , creating strategies that make sense from a technical , policy , regulatory , economic , security , and community perspective . ”
Berman ’s ACM article closes with a set of “ Top 10 ” guidelines for data stewardship :
Make a plan .
Create an explicit strategy for stewardship and preservation for your data , from its inception to the end of its lifetime ; explicitly consider what that lifetime may be .
Be aware of data costs and include them in your overall IT budget .
Ensure that all costs are factored in , including hardware , software , expert support , and time .
Determine whether it is more cost - effective to regenerate some of your information rather than preserve it over a long period .
Associate metadata with your data .
Metadata is needed to be able to find and use your data immediately and for years to come .
Identify relevant standards for data / metadata content and format , following them to ensure the data can be used by others .
Make multiple copies of valuable data .
Store some of them off - site and in different systems .
Plan for the transition of digital data to new storage media ahead of time .
Include budgetary planning for new storage and software technologies , file format migrations , and time .
Migration must be an ongoing process .
Migrate data to new technologies before your storage media becomes obsolete .
Plan for transitions in data stewardship .
If the data will eventually be turned over to a formal repository , institution , or other custodial environment , ensure it meets the requirements of the new environment and that the new steward indeed agrees to take it on .
Determine the level of “ trust ” required when choosing how to archive data .
Are the resources of the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration necessary or will Google do ?
Tailor plans for preservation and access to the expected use .
Gene - sequence data used daily by hundreds of thousands of researchers worldwide may need a different preservation and access infrastructure from , for example , digital photos viewed occasionally by family members .
Pay attention to security .
Be aware of what you must do to maintain the integrity of your data .
Know the regulations .
Know whether copyright , the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 , the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 , the U.S. National Institutes of Health publishing expectations , or other policies and / or regulations are relevant to your data , ensuring your approach to stewardship and publication is compliant .
Berman is a national leader in this area and also co-chairs of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Sustainable Digital Preservation and Access with OCLC economist Brian Lavoie .
The task force was formed late last year to explore and ultimately present a range of economic models , components , and actionable recommendations for sustainable preservation and access of digital data in the public interest .
Commissioned for two years , the task force will publish an interim report outlining economic issues and systemic challenges associated with digital preservation later this month on its website .
A s madcap comedy , one of those smash - 'em - up cop farces , a police cruiser parked on the tracks getting slammed by a train might be good for a hardy - har - har action sequence .
In real life , it 's not so funny .
It 's colossally stupid .
The best that can be said of what occurred in Toronto late Saturday night is that no one was hurt – except for an officer grazed by a shotgun pellet , this being unrelated to the crunched cruiser .
The vehicle , out of 13 Division in the west end , was mercifully empty of occupants when struck by a passenger train at the level railway crossing on Wallace Ave .
Why the cruiser would have been parked on a crossing – and it had been left there for at least 20 minutes , according to witnesses – has yet to be explained .
" I have no idea why this happened , '' says Staff Sgt. Courtney Chambers , of 13 Division .
" It could have been a case of bad judgment . "
The cruiser was dragged about 100 metres by the train 's locomotive , big steel on little steel .
VIA Train 1 – The Canadian , en route from Toronto to Vancouver – left Union Station at 10 p.m. with 47 passengers and two engineers up front .
Some 30 minutes later , it would have been travelling at relatively slow speed through the urban neighbourhood of The Junction .
" Trains can not stop on a dime , " points out Catherine Kaloutsky , spokesperson for VIA Rail .
Details will be confirmed when transportation authorities retrieve the train 's " black box ' ' – similar to the data recordings found on a plane – upon its arrival in Vancouver Wednesday .
The Canadian was delayed less than an hour at the scene before continuing on its way with the same two engineers in the locomotive .
Police told Kaloutsky the cruiser was only " a little bit on the tracks ' ' when it was struck , but Kaloutsky agreed that was like being " a little bit pregnant . ''
How dangerous was this scenario ?
Last year , there were 214 crossing collisions across Canada , resulting in 26 fatalities and 36 serious injuries .
What was this cruiser 's driver thinking ?
Events began when some two dozen police cars responded to a holdup at The Beer Store , around 8 p.m. , near Symington Ave. and Dupont St . Two men fled from the scene .
A pursuing officer , confronting one of the suspects , was struck in the head by a shotgun pellet – buckshot .
He was treated at St. Michael 's Hospital and released .
" The officer is doing fine , '' says Staff Sgt. Mark Tilley , of 11 Division .
" He was very lucky . "
Both suspects were caught and appeared in court yesterday afternoon , facing a total of 26 charges , including three of attempted murder .
Jeron Powell , 32 , and Craig Buckle , 29 , were remanded to Feb. 11 and Jan. 28 , respectively .
Pending an investigation , it 's pointless to speculate why the cruiser was parked on the crossing , says Tilley .
" Considering it 's winter , maybe the only clear path would have been on the railway track . "
One suggestion is that the cruiser had stalled there , battery dead due to frigid temperatures .
A witness recounted that another cruiser had just received a cable boost .
But there had been no assistance activity around the vehicle that was struck ; nobody pushing it out of harm 's way .
Yet another witness told the Star that at the time of the accident , police were interviewing a man – innocent bystander – near the tracks and were examining his ID .
" I heard a train whistle and I thought , that 's weird , '' said the witness .
" The guy being questioned , he said to the cop , ' Hey man , give me my ID , there 's a train coming ! '
And the cop 's saying , ' Settle down , settle down . '
" Then all of a sudden everybody 's running and the train hits . "

Boredom , isolation and poverty may encourage substance abuse
Australian officials are reporting an increase in petrol - sniffing in Aboriginal communities controversially taken over by the government .
The government is managing dozens of troubled Northern Territory settlements in a move to curb child abuse and alcoholism .
But tribal leaders believe attempts to curb alcohol abuse could have fed a sharp rise in petrol sniffing .
The chemical fumes provide a cheap high and respite from crushing poverty .
Alcohol banned
The federal government 's decision to send troops and medical teams to Aboriginal communities in Australia 's Northern Territory in 2006 was an emergency response to rampant alcoholism and child abuse .
Alcohol was prohibited under the multi-billion - dollar rescue plan but as the flow of beer , wine and spirits dried up , some tribal elders have reported an increase in petrol - sniffing .
Aboriginal children as young as five have developed an addiction .
The abuse of petrol can cause brain damage , depression and high blood pressure as well as heart disease and miscarriages .
Some indigenous communities have tried drastic measures to eradicate this scourge by sending addicts to harsh outback camps far away from temptation .
The introduction of a specially designed unleaded fuel has also helped .
It has been stripped of the odours that sniffers find so appealing .
Wet season
But serious problems remain and the situation in some areas is likely to get worse in the coming months .
Aboriginal leaders have said that petrol - sniffing invariably escalates during tropical Australia 's wet season .
Many settlements will be closed off by high rivers and impassable roads , and isolation and boredom will often conspire to fuel a rise in this type of substance abuse .
Schoolgirl with learning difficulties gang - raped and scarred with acid
A schoolgirl with learning difficulties was gang - raped by up to ten thugs who then threw caustic soda over her .
They left her screaming in agony , with skin peeling off her face and body , as they ran away laughing .
The horrific attack has left the 15 - year - old , who has a mental age of eight or nine , disfigured for life and severely traumatised .
Rogel McMorris , Jason Brew , and Hector Muaimba were all found guilty of rape and will be sentenced next month
Yesterday three of her attackers were convicted of rape after pleading not guilty , forcing the girl to relive her ordeal by giving evidence via video - link .
They sneered in the dock at Wood Green Crown Court , North London , as the Ghanaian - born teenager frequently paused because her wounds were causing discomfort .
The rape happened in January this year in Tottenham after the girl arranged to meet a man she knew .
Instead she was lured to see Jamaican - born Rogel McMorris , then 17 .
Then at least nine of his friends arrived and the terrified teenager was stripped and repeatedly raped .
Finally the youths poured caustic soda over her body in an apparent an attempt to get rid of forensic evidence .
She suffered deep burns to her face and neck , chest , and private parts .
The attackers were all members of a gang calling themselves ' Tugs From Around ' , meaning thugs from several parts of North London .
The jury found McMorris , now 18 , guilty of rape .
His immigrant status is being investigated .
Jason Brew , 19 , who was born in the UK , and Hector Muaimba , 20 , an immigrant from Angola , were also found guilty of rape .
All have previous convictions and will be sentenced next month .
Some of the attackers were never identified , but those convicted were caught by DNA and fingerprint evidence plus data proving their mobile phones were at the location at the time .

A Legacy For The Ages As Bush Wraps Up Title Of " Worst President Ever " In New Poll Of American Historians
Talk about a legacy !
Talk about a performance !
Talk about a Presidency !
After years and years of hard work , dedication to his own vision , passionate defense of his own personal war , brilliant fear - mongering initiatives and , let 's not forget , brave indifference , if not outright disdain , for domestic and worldwide public opinion , George W. Bush has finally done it .
He 's incontrovertibly clinched the title .
He 's made his own distinguished mark on History .
Yes , people , as you may have already heard , the man now has an insurmountable lead in the race for the title of Worst President Ever and from this day forward no one can deny him his rightful place in History .
Buchanan , Andrew Johnson , Fillmore , Pierce , Harding , Hoover and Nixon all put up a damn good fight , but in the end none of them could compete with the complete disaster , horrific train wreck and inane , inept , ideocracy / idiotcracy that is the Bush Presidency .
But , hey , do n't take my word for it , take the word of the 109 American historians who were recently surveyed on the topic by the History News Network .
You 've really got to feel good for the guy .
Time and time again he 's explained how he 's unconcerned about what people think of him today and that he 's only really concerned about his historical legacy .
And , although " Hands Down Worst President Ever " may not be the one he was hoping for , at least now he 's finally got himself one .
So congratulations Dubya , you did it .
Some of you may say it 's still too early for History to judge , but , come on now , was it really too early in 1945 to claim that Hitler was perhaps Worst Chancellor Ever ?
Was it too hasty a judgement for people in 1960's China to conclude that Mao's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was , in fact , a disastrous program for the entire nation ?
Was it out of line for people in the late - 70s to claim that Pol Pot really REALLY sucked ?
And , likewise , was it rash and foolhardy for people in 1985 - people like myself - to immediately KNOW that Starship 's " We Built This City " was the Worst Song Ever ?
I think not .
You 've really got to hand it to this Dubya guy .
It truly takes a special , and quite determined , person to fail so spectacularly on so many different fronts and on so many different levels .
I mean , it really takes a unique form of pigheaded stubbornness and complete unwillingness to listen to anyone outside of a small tightknit group of advisors to be THIS awful , dangerous , reckless and downright ridiculous .
So , once again , way to go Dubya , you certainly wo n't be forgotten by History and , in a way , you 'll be highly influential , if only as a lesson to others of how NOT to do , well , anything .
It 's quite amazing when you think about it .
Here , in this one person , you have all that 's wrong with America : A war - mongering , fundamentalist , cowboy of little intelligence or vision .
Do n't get me wrong , there 's also a whole lot that 's good about America .
After all , this is the country that gave the world Bob Dylan , Noam Chomsky , Martin Luther King , Tom Robbins , Aretha Franklin , Marlon Brando , Louis Armstrong , Martin Scorsese , Billie Holiday , Meryl Streep and Jefferson Airplane 's " White Rabbit " .
It 's just that this dude from Texas does n't incorporate any positive American qualities whatsoever .
But , thankfully , he and his neocon clique will soon be gone .
Though , sadly , I imagine we 'll be living with the repercussions of their actions for years to come .
Anyhow , enough from me already , check out this article from the History News Network discussing the survey of those 109 professional historians and , if you doubt Bush 's place in History even for a moment , make sure to read some of the reasons given at the bottom of the piece .
HNN Poll : 61 % of Historians Rate the Bush Presidency Worst
As you 'll see , 98.2 percent of these historians judged the Bush Presidency to be a failure and more than 61 percent concluded that Bush is , in fact , the Worst President In American History .
Another 35 percent rated Bush in the bottom ten .
Which leaves four of the 109 who somehow ranked him within the top two - thirds of American administrations .
So , to be completely fair , he does n't have the title 100 % wrapped up just yet , but it'd be hard to get much closer than this ... especially when you consider that those four dissenters are , most likely , Falwell 's Famous Fundamentalist
Four who have spent their entire careers working at Jerry Falwell 's university trying to prove that the dinosaurs never actually existed and that Jesus did indeed walk on water and that Mary was in fact a historical virgin and that ...
But , hey Dubya , do n't be sad because , as that old Meat Loaf song goes , 98.2 out of 100 ain't bad .
The title is yours buddy .
You 've worked so hard , you deserve it !
Mike Cowie ( Oredakedo )
Thursday , April 24th , 2008
As for the 33 % of Americans who , according to a new opinion poll I saw the other day , still somehow support Bush , I 'd certainly have a lot to say if I had n't already said it here : The Not - So - Great 38 Rant ( Who are these people ? )

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has appealed to India not to punish his country for last week ’s attacks in Mumbai , saying militants have the power to precipitate a war in the region , the Financial Times reported on Monday .
Zardari , whose wife Benazir Bhutto was assassinated by Islamist militants last year , warned that provocation by rogue “ non-state actors ” posed the danger of a return to war between the nuclear - armed neighbors .
“ Even if the militants are linked to Lashkar - e - Taiba , who do you think we are fighting ? ” asked Zardari in an interview with the Financial Times .
“ We live in troubled times where non-state actors have taken us to war before , whether it is the case of those who perpetrated ( the ) 9/11 ( attacks on the United States ) or contributed to the escalation of the situation in Iraq , ” said Zardari .
“ Now , events in Mumbai tell us that there are ongoing efforts to carry out copycat attacks by militants .
We must all stand together to fight out this menace . ”
The Mumbai assaults that killed nearly 200 people bore the hallmarks of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based group blamed for previous attacks in India .
Indian officials have said most , perhaps all , of the 10 Islamist attackers who held Mumbai hostage with frenzied attacks using assault rifles and grenades came from Pakistan , a Muslim nation carved out of Hindu- majority India in 1947 .
The fallout from the three - day rampage in Mumbai , India ’s commercial center , has threatened to unravel India ’s improving ties with Pakistan and prompted the resignation of India ’s security minister .
RICE VISIT
The White House said on Sunday that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would travel to India on Wednesday , as analysts warned the United States could get ensnared in the row and it may prove to be a setback in the war on Islamic radicals on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
“ Secretary Rice ’s visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States ’ commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement .
Rice will arrive in New Delhi on Wednesday after attending a NATO meeting in London on Tuesday .
New Delhi has said it was raising security to a “ war level ” and had no doubt of a Pakistani link to the attacks , which unleashed anger at home over the intelligence failure and the delayed response to the violence that paralyzed India ’s financial capital .

Officials in Islamabad have warned any escalation would force it to divert troops to the Indian border and away from a U.S. - led anti-militant campaign on the Afghan frontier .
Zardari has vowed to crack down if given proof .
But security officials in Islamabad said Pakistan would move troops from its western border with Afghanistan , where forces are battling al Qaeda and Taliban fighters as part of the U.S. - led campaign against militancy , to the Indian border if tension escalated .

“ It ’s part of the usual blackmail of the United States that Pakistan does to take more interest in India - Pakistan issues , ” said B. Raman , a former head of Indian intelligence agency RAW .
“ They think this kind of argument will make the United States sit up and take notice of their sensitivities and do something about it , ” he added , referring to warming ties between Washington and New Delhi , including a nuclear accord .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Sunday he would boost and overhaul the nation ’s counterterrorism capabilities , an announcement which came after Federal Home Minister Shivraj Patil resigned over the attacks .

Tony Iltis interviewed on Iranian television
By Tony Iltis
November 7 , 2008 -- Despite Western media and politicians having largely ignored a decade of genocidal warfare that has cost 6 million lives , the recent upsurge in fighting in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) has drawn not only media attention , but visits to the region by the British and French foreign ministers and United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon .
The current round of fighting in North Kivu province , which began on October 26 with an offensive by the Rwandan - backed rebel forces of General Laurent Nkunda , is indeed a humanitarian catastrophe — 200,000 people have been displaced , many not for the first time .
Refugee camps have been burned .
There has been widespread looting , rape and murder by both government troops and Nkunda ’s rebels , as well as by other militias involved in the fighting .
United Nations “ peacekeeping ” forces , who have been deployed in the eastern DRC since 2000 , have warned that they will engage the rebels if they attempt to take the provincial capital , Goma .
However , on October 27 , civilians attacked the UN ’s Goma compound , accusing the UN troops of failing to protect them from the fighting .
On October 29 , Nkunda declared a unilateral ceasefire , denying any intention of taking Goma .
However , retreating government troops indulged in a two - day violent rampage through the city .
On November 6 , Nkunda carried out a brutal crackdown against the town of Kiwanja after it was briefly taken from his rebels by local militias currently in alliance with the government .
European politicians have begun echoing media calls for a Western military intervention on humanitarian grounds .
However , this ignores that the UN presence since 2000 has been worse than ineffective — there have been several scandals concerning UN soldiers ’ involvement in sexual exploitation , including trading food - aid for sex with minors .
Colonial legacy
Furthermore , these calls are based on a simplistic interpretation of the violence as ethnic or tribal conflict .
In fact , this brutal multi-sided conflict , involving shifting alliances between a bewildering array of armed factions as well as both government and opposition forces from seven neighbouring countries , is the product of continual Western intervention since the 1880s .
The current boundaries of the DRC were arbitrarily created at the 1885 Berlin Congress , at which the European imperialist powers literally carved up Africa .
This congress gave the “ Congo Free State ” to Belgium ’s King Leopold as a private commercial enterprise .
The wholesale enslavement of the population to produce rubber and ivory left millions of Congolese dead , but made the Belgian royal dynasty ’s fortune .
In 1960 , Patrice Lumumba led the DRC to independence with the promise that the era of exploitation by Western powers was over .
However , Belgium and the US colluded in his overthrow and murder and established the brutal dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in power .
Resistance by pro-Lumumba forces continued , but by the time Latin American revolutionary Che Guevara led a small Cuban military mission to them in 1965 , they were little more than remnants .
Guevara withdrew the Cubans after concluding that the remants ’ leader , Laurent - Desire Kabila , was more interested in timber and ivory smuggling than waging a liberation struggle .
Mobutu renamed the country Zaire and set about making his fortune , in part through plundering his country ’s mineral resources and pocketing World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans , but also through acting as a conduit for US covert wars and insurgencies against a number of neighbouring countries .
The most significant of these was in Angola , where the US supported an invasion by South Africa in an attempt to stop the coming to power of the progressive MPLA after liberation from Portugal in 1975 .
When this was thwarted by the intervention of Cuban internationalist volunteers , Zaire became the base for the brutal CIA - led UNITA forces for the next 15 years .
Rwanda
The overthrow of Mobutu , and the current war , was triggered by the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the overthrow of the French - backed “ Hutu - power ” regime responsible .
With French support , Mobutu allowed the army and militias of the overthrown regime to regroup in Zaire .
However , the new Rwandan regime of Paul Kagame countered by arming the Banyamulenge Tutsis , Congolese of the same ethnicity as the Tutsis who were the victims of the Rwandan genocide .
With the end of the Cold War , the Mobutu regime had outlived its usefulness to the US , who made no attempt to save it when , in 1996 , Rwanda , Uganda , Burundi , Zimbabwe , Namibia and Angola invaded in support of an insurrection by a loose coalition that united the Banyamulenge militias with Kabila ’s forces , as well as other armed groups .
In fact , by this time the US was giving military training to the Kagame regime in Rwanda .
Furthermore , behind Kabila ’s insurrection , which took the capital , Kinshasa , in May 1997 , stood Western mining interests .
According to the July 2006 Le Monde diplomatique , Kabila ’s invasion , and initial administration , were directly funded by a consortium of the US - based Mineral Fields , Australian company Russel Resources and the Zimbabwe - based Ridgepointe Overseas .
However in 1998 , Kabila tried to re-negotiate the deals made with these companies , which brought him into conflict with Rwanda and Uganda and their allied militias in the east of the country ( which reverted to the name DRC when Mobutu fell ) .
Zimbabwe , Angola , Namibia and Sudan came to Kabila ’s aid .
This was the beginning of the current war .
The genocidal methods of all parties led to a proliferation of armed militias , with many groups originating as local defensive formations but becoming predatory .
Ethnic and tribal divisions multiplied .
Mining interests
In this environment the Western mineral companies adopted new methods .
Rather than trying to obtain large - scale mining concessions from the non-existent central government , they set up mineral processing operations that bought ores off local suppliers .
These local suppliers were the various contending militias .
The mineral trade has thus provided the various armed factions with both a means of buying weapons and profits for which to fight .
Fuelling this has been a byproduct of the IT boom in the West : an explosion in demand for a metal called coltan that is used in the manufacture of mobile phones and personal computers .
Between 2000 and 2007 , the price of coltan increased eightfold .
The coltan rush led to a falling out between Rwanda and Uganda , as entrepreneurs in both countries tried to maximise their involvement in the trade .
This in turn led to splits in their Congolese proxies and further escalation of the violence .
In 2001 , Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguards and replaced by his son Joseph Kabila , who in 2003 signed a peace agreement that left the DRC as a loose collection of four warlord fiefdoms in a state of armed truce , with violence periodically erupting between them .
Conflict between smaller militias at the local level has never ceased .
Neither have depredations by the remnants of the Rwandan “ Hutu - power ” forces .
The current offensive by Nkunda is allegedly to defend the Banyamulenge Tutsis from these forces , however it is actually driven by the demands of his Rwandan backers for coltan .
Because coltan - containing ores are suited to labour intensive , small - scale mining operations , the coltan boom gave the West little interest in stability in the DRC .
However , according to Le Monde diplomatique , cobalt , uranium and other minerals that require more capital - intensive , large - scale mining operations , are now becoming more profitable than coltan — giving the West an incentive to impose some sort of order .
This may explain why the bloodshed in the DRC has finally become a major news story in the West , accompanied by calls for a “ humanitarian ” intervention .
However , what African - American revolutionary Malcolm X said in 1964 remains true today : “ The basic cause of most of the trouble in the Congo right now is the intervention of outsiders — the fighting that is going on over the mineral wealth of the Congo and over the strategic position that the Congo represents on the African continent .
“ And in order to justify it , they are … trying to make it appear that the people are savages . ”

Levels of drug - resistant tuberculosis ( TB ) in China are nearly twice the global average .
Nationwide research published in the open access journal BMC Infectious Diseases has shown that almost 10 % of Chinese TB cases are resistant to the most effective first - line drugs .
Susan van den Hof , from the KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation in The Netherlands is one of the authors on a Chinese study into the prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR - TB ) .
She said , " In order to obtain insight into the prevalence and distribution of resistance , China has joined the global project on anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance , and investigated drug resistance in ten provinces between 1996 and 2004 . "
China has the second largest number of TB cases in the world , and is one of the countries with high levels of drug - resistant TB .
According to the authors , " The prevalence of drug resistance varied greatly between the provinces , but on average was worryingly high , with a weighted mean for MDR - TB of 9.3 % among all cases ; 5.4 % among new cases and 25.6 % among previously treated cases .
The global MDR - TB estimates are 4.8 % for all cases , 3.1 % for new cases and 19.3 % for previously treated cases . "
Treatment of MDR - TB requires use of costly , toxic and less effective second - line drugs and infected patients are less likely to survive treatment .
In a well - functioning TB control program with low levels of defaulting from treatment , high resistance levels are expected among previously treated cases .
This is consistent with the authors ' observations in China .
If a good TB control program is in place , the proportion of previously treated patients among all TB patients should also be low .
In China the proportion of previously treated patients varied between the provinces but on average was about 20 % , compared to a global average of 11 % .
The authors said , " Many possible explanations for the development of drug resistance in China exist , and different explanations may prevail in different areas of this vast country .
These include the inadequate use of anti-TB drugs in public hospitals , lack of supervision of treatment , poor drug - management and absence of infection control measures in hospitals .
Also , availability of anti-TB drugs without a prescription in some areas of China in the past may have contributed to the development of drug resistance . "
At this moment , programmatic treatment of MDR - TB cases with second - line drugs is being piloted in some areas of China .
MDR - TB treatment will then be expanded within China to prevent further spread of MDR - TB and help to bring MDR - TB rates down .

" Honestly , I did not know much about him before I met him .
I 'd heard , you know , uh ' Your Body ' -- that song .
But what I can say is that I had no idea what an extraordinary musician he is -- and it 's just great to sit and be witness that . "
The former " Friend " also poked fun at the recent headlines where she called Angelina Jolie " uncool " -- a quote Jen has since insisted was taken out of context .

Murray Waas has uncovered a major piece of evidence tying Vice President Dick Cheney to the efforts to attack Joe Wilson by exposing his wife as a CIA operative :
Vice President Dick Cheney , according to a still - highly confidential FBI report , admitted to federal investigators that he rewrote talking points for the press in July 2003 that made it much more likely that the role of then - covert CIA - officer Valerie Plame in sending her husband on a CIA - sponsored mission to Africa would come to light .
Cheney conceded during his interview with federal investigators that in drawing attention to Plame ’s role in arranging her husband ’s Africa trip reporters might also unmask her role as CIA officer .
Cheney denied to the investigators , however , that he had done anything on purpose that would lead to the outing of Plame as a covert CIA operative .
But the investigators came away from their interview with Cheney believing that he had not given them a plausible explanation as to how he could focus attention on Plame ’s role in arranging her husband ’s trip without her CIA status also possibly publicly exposed .
At the time , Plame was a covert CIA officer involved in preventing Iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction , and Cheney ’s office played a central role in exposing her and nullifying much of her work .
Cheney revised the talking points on July 8 , 2003 – the very same day that his then - chief of staff , I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby , met with New York Times reporter Judith Miller and told Miller that Plame was a CIA officer and that Plame had also played a central role in sending her husband on his CIA sponsored trip to the African nation of Niger .
Jim Morrison died at 27 years old
Enlarge Image
Scientists have revealed what late Doors frontman Jim Morrison would look like if he were still alive today as a pensioner .
Morrison died prematurely of a heart attack in Paris on 3 July 1971 , aged 27 .
Had he lived he would have been celebrating his 65th birthday on Monday .
St Andrews University researchers used special computer software to produce the ageing likeness of the rock star .
The singer and poet would be the same age as rock contemporary Mick Jagger if he had lived .
Morrison 's former bandmates Ray Manzarek and Robbie Kreiger will celebrate the milestone at West Hollywood eaterie Barney 's Beanery , one of Morrison 's favourite hangouts in the 60s .
The researchers from the university 's Perception Lab used ' ageing ' software to reproduce the natural effects of aging , taking into account changes in skin texture , hairline and hair colour .
They used an image of Morrison aged in his mid 20s as a starting point .
Jim Morrison in his 20s
The process of ageing was mimicked by changing the texture and shape of the original image to simulate the changes in the skin that would occur between the ages of 40 and 70 .
The team have previously created aged images of Hollywood stars Marilyn Monroe and James Dean , who both suddenly died at a young age , and Elvis Presley and John Lennon at projected ages of 70 and 64 respectively .
The software could be used for assisting with missing person inquiries , particularly those who have been missing for many years and will look considerably different .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama said on Tuesday attacking global climate change is a “ matter of urgency ” that will create jobs as he got advice from Al Gore , who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the issue .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
In remarks to reporters , Obama made clear he would adopt an aggressive approach to global warming when he takes over the White House on January 20 .
He and Vice President - elect Joe Biden met for nearly two hours with former Vice President Gore at Obama ’s presidential transition office in Chicago .
“ All three of us are in agreement that the time for delay is over , the time for denial is over , ” Obama said .
Obama hopes addressing climate change can create the kind of jobs that will help pull the U.S. economy out of a deepening recession .
He has begun to lay out plans for a massive recovery program to help stimulate the U.S. economy and create about 2.5 million jobs .
He said he would work with Democrats and Republicans , businesses , consumers and others with a stake in the issue to try to reach a consensus on a bold , aggressive approach to tackling the problem .
“ This is a matter of urgency and of national security and it has to be dealt with in a serious way .
That ’s what I intend my administration to do , ” Obama said .
Obama had a willing partner in Gore , who won a Nobel in 2007 for his years - long effort to educate people about the gradual warming of the planet and to argue against those scientists who believe a warming trend is a naturally occurring event .
There was no talk of offering Gore a job in the Obama administration .
Gore has indicated he is not interested in a position of climate “ czar ” or any Cabinet post .
Just two days after Obama won the November 4 election , Gore ’s Alliance for Climate Protection rolled out a media campaign to push for immediate investments in energy efficiency , renewable power generation like wind and solar technology and the creation of a unified national power grid .
Gore and his group are in line with most U.S. environmental groups , which believe the Obama administration has a chance to stem global warming .
Critics have accused the outgoing Bush administration of stalling on the issue , but the White House insists it is taking steps aimed at addressing the problem without damaging the U.S. economy .
“ We have the opportunity now to create jobs all across this country , in all 50 states , to re-power America , to redesign how we use energy , to think about how we are increasing efficiency , to make our economy stronger , make us more safe , reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make us competitive for decades to come , even as we ’re saving the planet , ” Obama said .
Given the amount of money needed to keep the Big Three automakers afloat , it 's a lot more efficient to simply lend them the money rather than to spur sales through an incentive program .
American consumers also do n't like to be told what to buy .
A rebate program would have to specify that they purchase a vehicle from General Motors , Ford or Chrysler , limiting their choices to the Big Three .
Consumers and foreign - based manufacturers would likely pressure the program to open up to at least all cars made in the United States .
Also keep in mind that the government is n't giving money to the automakers - it 's lending it to them , with the intention of getting it back in a few years .
Rebates are not loans , and consumers could not be expected to pay them back .

I 'm facing a dilemma here y'all .
I have a wonderful 17 year old son named Stuart who works after school and weekends at the Wee Wok Chinese restaurant in the town where we live .
He 's a sweet boy who 's had self esteem issues and due to his obesity and acne problem .
Well , I came across his diary this morning and had a peek .
Stuart wrote that he likes to masturbate into the bucket of soup they have in the fridge at the restaurant .
He wrote that he sneeks the bucket of egg drop soup into the bathroom in the back and will masturbate into it .
I 'm not sure what to do .
He 's a sweet boy , and this job has been wonderful for him .
I do n't want to say anything to him because I do n't want to embarrass him and I do n't want him to lose his job .
And besides , I do n't think anybody would notice anyway because egg drop soup has them white stringy things floating around in it anyway .
What people do n't know wo n't hurt em .
What should I do ?
( CNN ) --
The number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe continues to increase , a World Health Organization spokesman said Monday .
Cholera victims lie in a hospital ward in Harare , Zimbabwe , last week .
more photos »
As of Sunday , the outbreak had killed 1,564 people , and 29,131 cases had been reported , Gregory Hartl told CNN .
These figures represent increases from numbers released Thursday that showed 1,518 deaths and 26,497 cases .
The World Health Organization says the outbreak has affected all of the country 's 10 provinces and has spread to neighboring South Africa .
It is " closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water , poor sanitation , declining health infrastructure and reduced numbers of health care staff reporting to work . "
The organization also says factors " include the commencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the country , and possibly across borders , during the Christmas season . "
Health experts have warned that the water - borne disease could infect more than 60,000 people unless its spread is halted .
Long wracked by political and economic turmoil , Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from Great Britain 28 years ago .
There is an acute shortage of all essentials such as cash , fuel , medical drugs , electricity and food .
President Robert Mugabe blames the crisis on sanctions imposed by the West on grounds that he is disregarding human rights .
But Mugabe 's critics attribute the crisis to his economic policies .
The charity Save the Children recently issued a report saying some of Zimbabwe 's children are " wasting away " amid the turmoil .
Five million Zimbabweans -- out of a population of about 12 million -- need food aid now , the report said .
The group is appealing for 18,000 tons of food for next month .

Python 2.6 and 3.0 are upon us .
I helped a friend set up the new Python environment for research and development , and we thought about constructing a PythonPack : a compilation of packages every home should have lying around .
I decided I ’d write down my list of generic Python packages : packages you ’d want to have regardless of what you were working on .
So I did n’t include any of the numerous web - development platforms , or some other very specialized packages .
What you wo n’t see in this list however , are IDE ’s and editors .
I do n’t feel like joining in on the religious wars just yet :)
So without further ado , here ’s my list :
IPython – I just ca n’t stress enough how useful this tool is .
If you ever worked with Python ’s interactive prompt , this is the same thing , just on steroids .
It has completion , history , shell capabilities , you name it .
If you did n’t yet work interactively , you wo n’t do badly to start with IPython .
ActiveState Python , or the win32 python extensions – if you ’re developing on win32 , it will allow you to get at the native win32 API , which I usually found as a blessing
PyGame –
If you want to start game development on Python , that ’s the tool for you .
Even if you do n’t , I found out I ’ve used PyGame many times just for quick and dirty visualizations .
Besides , it makes for a nice toy :)
numpy – Ever needed to do any computation that ’s a bit more complicated than 1/(1- math.sin(x ) ) * * 2 ? numpy is the way to go , with plenty of tools for vectors , matrices , and what not .
After mentioning numpy , it ’s important to mention scipy and pylab ( matplotlib ) .
Just a bit of visualization strength , in the vein of matlab .
coverage.py – Python code coverage by Ned Batchelder .
An essential tool for effective testing .
While you ’re there I ’ll also recommend checking out his blog .
ply – for most of your text parsing needs .
Of course , this is just my preference .
I heard about ( but did n’t use ) PyParsing and other modules
construct –
If you intend to do some binary parsing , construct is an excellent tool for that .
PyOpenGL – I use it mostly for 3D visualizations , see for example my recursive spring .
PIL – Python Imaging Library is a very useful tool for working with images .
I used it in my twindragon fractal implementation
nltk – Natural Language Toolkit – I realize most people wo n’t be using this one , but it ’s generic enough , and I ’ve used it enough times so far to include it in here .
For example , I used it when I wanted to find rhymes .
WinPDB – A Python debugger especially useful for embedded Python apps ( Python running from within another application ) .
nose – the framework I use for testing .
Easy to start using it if you ’re already using unittest .
psyco – if it so happens that you start to care about speed , psyco is by far the easiest way to go about doing it , short of writing your code in a different language .
Other useful but less often used packages include :
pefile – for parsing win32 pe files .
PyDBG ( from within PaiMei ) – an interace to the win32 debugging api ( there ’s an upcoming post about that one :)
scapy – I did n’t use it lately , but if you want to sniff packets programmatically , that ’s a good way to go about doing that
Peach – Easy Python tool for fuzzing .
Did n’t get the chance to use it myself though .
diStorm – the fastest disassembler for x86 and amd64 around , with a Python interface .
Of course , it helps if I ’m also working with gil on the next version :)
sqlalchemy and sqlobject – your handy ORMs .
I use them mostly for web development .
For other work I do n’t often need a full blown db .
wx and PyGTK– I really do n’t do that much GUI work , so I do n’t have really much to say about those two .
I still have them lying around though , just in case .
RPyC – Did n’t get a chance to use it myself , but if you want to get into distributed Python programming , I ’ll look into RPyC first .
NetworkX – if you happen to need some graph algorithm or visualization , I ’d go for networkx .
Last time I used graphs I mostly wrote my own code , and discovered networkx only afterwards .
Next time I ’ll be sure to use it .
SymPy – Symbolic Python , in the vein of Maple and Mathematica .
It allows you to do symbolic operations for example , integrating f( x ) =sin(x ) and still getting a function and not a number .
I used it a little bit for my homework .
Now it ’s your turn : what packages did I miss ?

U.S. crude settled up 27 cents to $ 61.04 a barrel off earlier highs of $ 62.82 a barrel .
London Brent crude for December settled down 8 cents at $ 57.35 a barrel .
Despite Friday ’s gains , prices are down nearly ten percent this week , having fallen $ 6.77 .
Oil prices have dived nearly 60 percent from record highs of over $ 147 dollars per barrel in July , as the global economic crisis has hit the wider economy , shrinking demand in major consumer nations .
The U.S. dollar on Friday eased against a basket of currencies after government data showed U.S. employers cut payrolls by 240,000 in October .
In addition , data showed September registered the biggest monthly loss in jobs in nearly seven years .
The Labor Department said the U.S. unemployment rate shot up to 6.5 percent from 6.1 percent in September , the highest since March 1994 .
Wall Street economists had previously estimated that 200,000 U.S. jobs had been lost in October .
“ Crude oil futures , like the stock market , are hanging in there .
People came in today amid worries that the jobless data would crush the markets , but they have n’t , ” said Andy Lebow , broker at MF Global , New York .
“ But despite that , the data looks pretty downbeat .
The crude oil market has to look at the fact that we ’re losing jobs and that ultimately will have an impact on petroleum demand . ”
In New York , the ICE Futures ' dollar index .
DXY , a measure of the greenback 's value against a basket of six currencies , traded around 0.1 percent lower this afternoon .
A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies and tends to support prices .
“ Seems like the weaker dollar is what gave us the bounce , ” said Tom Bentz , analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc .
However , the dollar ’s retreat was offset by a rise in stocks on Friday as investors bought beaten - down sectors .
U.S. automakers General Motors Corp and Ford Motor
Co reported billions in losses on Friday , far deeper than expected , as car sales slumped with consumers tightening belts in the face of what analysts are now calling a serious recession .
Oil ’s tumble from July highs has already spurred OPEC to rein in supply from November 1 , and some members of the cartel are talking of reducing production further .
Venezuela ’s oil minister Rafael Ramirez has said OPEC should act again .
“ We say ( a new cut should be ) at least a million , ” he told Reuters on Thursday . [ n N06321366 ]

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A tidal wave of layoffs washed across the world on Monday , sending tens of thousands of workers into joblessness as the pain of the global recession worsened .
Amid reports of tumbling corporate profits , dire outlooks and a lowered global growth forecast from the International Monetary Fund , companies in Europe and the United States announced they would cut employees in a dramatic effort to reduce costs and keep their businesses afloat .
Despite the corporate gloom , markets rallied on some of Monday ’s other news : No. 1 drugmaker Pfizer Inc said it would buy rival Wyeth for $ 68 billion , Barclays said it had no need to raise capital and sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly rose 6.5 percent .
“ In the midst of a global recession , here is Pfizer , hopefully spending their dollars wisely , ” said Andre Bakhos , president of Princeton Financial Group in New Brunswick , New Jersey .
“ It adds a little confidence that all is not lost . ”
But the darkening view was reinforced by a dismal revised outlook from the IMF , which slashed its forecast for 2009 global growth to 0.5 percent from 2.2 percent in its last economic outlook in November , a source told Reuters .
The IMF saw the U.S. economy contracting 1.6 percent in 2009 , with the euro zone shrinking 2 percent and Japan contracting 2.6 percent , according to the source .
The IMF pegged 2010 world growth at 3 percent .
The tsunami of layoff announcements , affecting more than 70,000 workers , started in Europe , with electronics maker Philips reporting 6,000 job cuts as it posted a bigger - than - expected 1.5 billion euro ( $ 1.9 billion ) loss , its first quarterly loss since 2003 .
ING cut 7,000 of its 130,000 jobs , replaced its CEO and got guarantees from the Dutch government as other European banks sought to reassure investors they are coming to grips with the turmoil in financial markets .
Corus , Europe ’s second - largest steelmaker , said 3,500 jobs would go worldwide , including 2,500 in Britain , as the company , owned by India ’s Tata Steel , sought to boost operating profit .
CATERPILLAR , SPRINT , HOME DEPOT
In the United States , Caterpillar , the world ’s largest maker of heavy equipment , said it would eliminate nearly 20,000 jobs , reported a 32 percent drop in profit and forecast the weakest year for business since the end of World War Two .
Sprint Nextel Corp the No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider , said it will cut up to 8,000 jobs , or about 14 percent of its workforce .
[ ID :nN26368948 ]
Retailer Home Depot Inc said it will cut 7,000 jobs , or about 2 percent of its workforce .
Chip maker Texas Instruments said it was cutting 12 percent of its workforce , including 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 voluntary departures [ ID : nN2638388 ] , and car maker General Motors Corp said it would lay off 2,000 more workers at two assembly plants .
On the flip side of Pfizer ’s deal for Wyeth , Pfizer said it will cut 15 percent of the companies ’ combined 130,000 workers -- about 19,500 jobs .
Major U.S. indexes rose .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent and the broader S&P 500 was up 0.6 percent .
Bond prices fell as the increase in existing - home sales raised questions whether the housing market was as weak as thought .
European stocks rose , with Europe ’s FTSE 300 index closing 3.2 percent higher .
Gold climbed above $ 900 an ounce , the highest in more than three months .
Governments around the world focused on stimulus packages to grapple with the financial crisis .

U.S. President Barack Obama ’s spokesman , Robert Gibbs , told reporters the president “ would do everything in his power to ensure the financial system does not collapse , ” after a weekend in which Republicans voiced objections to Obama ’s stimulus proposals .
Obama ’s choice to help lead the government effort , Treasury Secretary - designate Timothy Geithner , won Senate approval after a delay due to qualms over his underpayment , since rectified , of some personal taxes earlier this decade .
Geithner is expected to be sworn in quickly and within weeks will likely unveil reforms to the $ 700 billion financial bailout program to provide more support for housing and credit markets and possibly to absorb troubled assets from banks .
Canada will spend C$ 7 billion ( $ 5.7 billion ) on infrastructure over the next two years , a government minister said , and officials said Canada will run budget deficits totaling C$ 64 billion over the next two years .
“ We not only create jobs and economic activity now , we also improve our economic competitiveness for decades to come , ” said Minister of Transport John Baird .
The Norwegian government presented a $ 2.87 billion fiscal stimulus package to prevent a surge in unemployment .
In Iceland , however , the government of Prime Minister Geir Haarde collapsed under the pressures of the financial crisis .
Banks have borne the brunt of the credit crisis , which was sparked by mass defaults on U.S. home loans .
The sector has seen a wave of consolidation as leading banks around the world have collapsed or been taken over .
But shares in Britain ’s Barclays leaped 73 percent after it said its projected 2008 pretax profit of more than 5.3 billion pounds ( $ 7.3 billion ) would include significant writedowns of 8 billion pounds and that the bank had made a good start to 2009 .
Lån uten sikkerhet , ofte omtalt som kredittlån , har blitt svært populære i Norge .
E24 kunne i 2018 avsløre at nordmenn har over 106 milliarder utestående i slike lån , og tallet virker å vokse hvert år .
Et økt marked tiltrekker seg ofte nye aktører .
Nå er det mer enn 30 banker i Norge som tilbyr forbrukslån – og det dukker stadig opp nye forbruksbanker som vil ta en del av markedet .
I realiteten betyr det at bankene må være innovative for å skaffe seg kunder .
De må hele tiden fornye seg og legge til rette for en enkel søknadsprosess .
En av løsningene har vært å åpne for at man kan ta med seg en medsøker når man søker lån .
Det betyr at to mennesker hefter for ett og samme lån .
Om det å søke lån som et par
Det kan faktisk bety ganske mye .
Dette er noen av de vanligste belønningene :
– Bedre effektiv rente .
Det betyr kutt i både gebyrer samt den faktiske renten .
Det lønner seg særlig hvis dere har planer om å refinansiering .
– Større mulighet for å få lån .
Dere kan spare veldig mye hvis dere refinansierer dyr forbruksgjeld , som enten begge eller kun én av partene har tatt opp .
– Betraktelig større mulighet for å få lån hvis man søker om mye penger .
Enkelte banker gir kun lån over 400,000 til låntakere som har en medsøker .
– Mer fleksibilitet og lengre nedbetalingstid ( hvis man ønsker det ) .
Som ektefelle vil du kun være ansvarlig for lånet dersom du faktisk signerer gjeldsbrevet .
Hvis du ikke signerer vil det kun påvirke boet ditt , står det hos Advokatenhjelperdeg .
Noen særegne krav man bør vite om ?
I utgangspunktet ikke .
Begge personene som står på lånekontrakten skal være fylt 18 år , ha en stabil inntekt og ingen betalingsanmerkninger .
Det finnes ikke særegne regler .
Husk på at enkelte banker også tilbyr betalingsforsikringer .
Dette minimerer risikoen for at begge havner i økonomisk uføre .
En betalingsforsikring vil slå inn hvis det skjer noe uforutsett med økonomien din .
Det kan for eksempel være at du mister jobben din og / eller blir sykemeldt i en lengre periode .
Inntekten vil reduseres , og det er vanskelig å betjene forbrukslånet .
Du bør høre med banken din om de har slike forsikringer .
I mange tilfeller kan det være verdt å utforske den muligheten .
Blitt spurt om å bli medsøker
Du er den eneste som klarer å svare på det .
Det er i hvert fall ingen tvil om at du må stille deg følgende spørsmål :
– Er personen vanskelig å stole på ?
– Har vedkommende en historie med dårlig privatøkonomi ?
– Har låntaker misligholdt lån tidligere ?
Hvis du kan svare ” ja ” på ett eller flere av disse spørsmålene , så bør du virkelig vurdere å takke nei til å bli medsøker .
Risikoen du kan utsettes for
Husk på at det å være medsøker på et lån bærer med seg en risiko .
Risikoen ligger i at lånet blir misligholdt .
Det vil si at avdragene ikke betales slik de skal .
I stedet for at banken skal fortsette å presse på for at låntaker skal betale , så vil de henvende seg til medsøkeren .
Du forstår kanskje at det er utrolig kjedelig å måtte betale på et lån som man i utgangspunktet ikke hadde noe glede av .
Derfor skal du tenke deg nøye om før du blir medsøker på et forbrukslån .
En enkel oppsummering
Det er ingen tvil om at låntaker vil komme veldig godt ut av å ha en medsøker .
Ikke bare vil du kunne få høyere lån .
Du vil også kunne få bedre rentebetingelser .
Allikevel er det et stort ansvar å ta med seg en medsøker i en lånesøknad .
Tenk om du skulle havne i en situasjon der du misligholder lånet .
Det trenger ikke nødvendigvis være med vilje .
Du kan miste jobben , huset ditt brenner ned eller at det kommer noen andre uforutsette hendelser som velter hele privatøkonomien din .
Da står du i fare for å dra med deg en venn eller familiemedlem ned i sluket .
Det er en kjedelig situasjon å stå i .
Hvis du har blitt forespurt om å bli medsøker , så skal du også tenke deg veldig nøye om .
De aller fleste klarer å betale ned lånene sine uten noen problemer .
Allikevel er det folk der ute som er i dyp økonomisk trøbbel .
Og dette er folk som i stor grad trenger andre mennesker for å få godkjent lånesøknadene .
Derfor bør du gjøre grundige undersøkelser før du takker ja til et slikt tilbud .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
In the large Women ’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study , participants who took beta carotene , vitamin C , vitamin E , or a combination of supplements had no significant reductions in their risk of cancer .
The clinical trial , which involved 7,627 women who were followed for an average of 9.4 years , was conducted by Dr. Jennifer Lin and colleagues at Harvard Medical School in Boston , and is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
The patients were randomly assigned to a placebo group , or to 500 mg ascorbic acid daily , 600 IU alpha - tocopherol every other day or 50 mg beta - carotene every other day .
Overall , 624 women developed invasive cancers and 176 died from their disease .
Compared with women who took placebo , the relative risk of developing cancer was almost identical in the vitamin C group , the vitamin E group and the beta carotene group .
There was also little difference of dying from cancer in any of the groups .
The risk increased by 28 percent in women who took vitamin C , decreased by 13 percent in those who took vitamin E , and decreased by 16 percent in the beta carotene group .
“ We observed no overall associations of the three antioxidant supplements , taken singly or combined , with total cancer incidence or mortality .
Duration of supplementation also did not appear to alter the associations of these supplements with risk of cancer or mortality due to cancer , ” Lin and her colleagues write .
The findings “ suggest that there are no overall benefits or risks of vitamins C and E and beta carotene supplementation in the primary prevention of total cancer incidence or cancer mortality , ” the authors conclude .
Dr. Demetrius Albanes of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland notes in an editorial that despite the lack of overall benefits with antioxidants , two of the study ’s findings “ deserve additional mention . ”
First , there was a trend toward protection against colorectal cancer with vitamin E supplementation .
Second , there was an elevated lung cancer risk in the women who took beta carotene supplements .
Albanes adds that clinical trials with negative results or those with outcomes that are unexpected are not failures ; “ they have and will continue to shed light on the causes of cancer and help us discover the means for its prevention . ”

The Bishop of Manchester accused Labour of being beguiled by money Five Anglican bishops have attacked the government by calling into question the morality of its policies .
The bishops of Durham , Winchester , Hulme , Manchester and Carlisle told the Sunday Telegraph the UK was beset by family breakdown , debt and poverty .
Bishop of Manchester the Rt Rev Nigel McCulloch said Labour was " beguiled by money " and " morally corrupt " .
But Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell , who represents the Church in the Commons , said the comments were " nonsense " .
' Inevitable come- uppance ' Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph , Bishop of Durham the Rt Rev Tom Wright accused ministers of making promises that had later " vanished into thin air " .
" We have not seen a raising of aspirations in the last 13 years , but instead there is a sense of hopelessness .
While the rich have got richer , the poor have got poorer , " he said .
The government is n't telling people who are already deep in debt to stop overextending themselves
Rt Rev Stephen Lowe
Bishop of Hulme
Recession ' a test of character '
In a separate interview with the paper , Bishop McCulloch echoed those criticisms , just days after he used his Christmas Day sermon to warn that society was facing an inevitable come - uppance for its " buy now , pay later " culture .
The Rt Rev Stephen Lowe , the Church 's Bishop for Urban Life and Faith , said he feared Britain would simply return to a " financial system based on indebtedness " after the current crisis .
" The government is n't telling people who are already deep in debt to stop overextending themselves , but instead is urging us to spend more , " he said .
" That is morally suspect and morally feeble .
It is unfair and irresponsible of the government to put pressure on the public to spend in order to revive the economy . "
Bishop Lowe , who is bishop of Hulme within the diocese of Manchester , later told the BBC he wanted to see an end to " the notion of greed , of getting something you want immediately using the credit card " .

Meanwhile , the Bishops of Carlisle and Winchester claimed ministers had squandered their opportunity to transform society .
The Rt Rev Graham Dow , the Bishop of Carlisle , said : " I agree with the Conservatives that the breakdown of the family is a crucial element in the difficulties of our present society .
" The government has n't given sufficient support to that because it is scared of losing votes . "
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said while it was not the first time the Church and state have clashed in recent times , the bishops ' language was " particularly robust " .
Only last week , the Archbishop of Canterbury launched a public attack on the government .
Dr Rowan Williams said Gordon Brown 's plans to spend more in order to tackle the recession were like an " addict returning to the drug " , and suggested the economy had been going in the wrong direction for decades .
' Bishops ' palaces '
We 've all got to make ourselves more responsible
John McFall , Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell MP , who is the Second Church Estates Commissioner and the Church 's representative in the Commons branded the criticism as " nonsense " .
He said : " Not only is the government seeking to help those on lower incomes , it is leading the fight in the Third World to relieve poverty - a task Gordon Brown pursued in all his years as chancellor and since as prime minister .
" It is also nothing short of nonsense to say that the government 's policies are designed to win a future election .
They are designed to assist all sections of the community through the difficulties that face them .
" Possibly the bishops would prefer the proposed policies of the Conservatives , to reduce taxes by reducing public expenditure - thus ensuring the closure of schools and hospitals and a reduction in services - in which case they would allow themselves the luxury of further criticism . "
Sir Stuart added that it " ill - behoved " those who lived in " bishops ' palaces " to condemn government policies aiming at alleviating poverty .
But Labour MP
John McFall told the BBC he believed there was " a kernel of truth " in the bishops ' remarks .
" It 's important for people to look at this in a moral dimension - right and wrong - and to ensure that we bring back some of the responsibility that was evident many , many years ago when people had to save up for things , " he said .
" We 've all got to make ourselves more responsible and if that 's what the bishops are pushing out , that message , then I 'm on their side . "

City law firm Taylor Wessing is believed to be working on a plan to create a bank backed by six leading UK listed corporates disenchanted with the failing lending institutions in the Square Mile .
The firms are thought to have sounded out Glenn Cooper , the banking veteran famed for floating Manchester United , to head the new bank .
A City source said : " These guys are totally fed up with the problems with the inertia , so are looking to get together and create an institution that can lend to small and medium - sized firms .
Given that most banks have horribly messy balance sheets , they figure it 's easier to start from scratch . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The group of firms , which is thought to include one FTSE 250 company , is believed to have begun working on the plan late last year .
The bank would look to use wholesale funding lines , guaranteed by government , that would lend to firms .
Tentative approaches to government officials are thought to have been made .
Mr Cooper , who is currently working on raising investment for a £ 500 m activist fund targeting FTSE 100 companies such as GlaxoSmithKline , was a director of City merchant bank , Ansbacher Holdings during the 1980s and 1990s .
In 2007 he spearheaded a campaign against Vodafone and its chief executive , Arun Sarin , calling for the sale of the company 's stake in American group Verizon .
News of the initiative comes just days after Gordon Brown 's announcement of a second government bank bailout failed to allay the fears of continuing banking failure in the City .
Barclays 's chief executive John Varley sought to calm the bank 's investors on Friday saying he would prefer to pay for state insurance on assets with cash rather than giving up equity .
The bank had sold sufficient amounts of assets last year to enable the it to avoid dipping into the Government 's bailout fund , he said .
State Sen. Bill Brady , the Bloomington Republican running for governor in the Illinois Republican primary , is n't your typical lawyer politician .
He runs a construction business and can do math with a pencil on a two - by - four .
After all the trite commercials from another candidate about the hair of disgraced former Democratic Gov. Bouffantovich , it 's plain arithmetic that could figure in the GOP primary .
It revolves around the numbers 6 and 1 .
Six of the candidates are from the Chicago metropolitan area .
Brady is the only one from downstate .
He figures they 'll split the vote .
" Mathematically , this makes sense , but what boggles my mind is that in our polls , 50 percent of the people in the Chicago metropolitan area say they 're more likely to vote for a candidate who comes from the outside , " he told me .
We were sitting over lunch at Ditka's .
Naturally , I was compelled to order the pork chop .
It was extremely tasty .
Brady , now running from the center - right , asked for meatloaf .
Having grown up in the food business , I never order meatloaf .
Ever .
It 's just like ordering a Ham Salad Surprise .
You never really know .
And I thought conservatives were skeptics .
Bill , you do n't get meatloaf at home ?
" Why ?
Is there something wrong with meatloaf ? " he said , digging in .
" This is delicious meatloaf .
I love meatloaf . "
And he chomped on some to prove it .
This column on Brady is one in a series of pieces on the candidates running for governor .
The Democrats were first in line , and now the Republicans are getting their say .
My big idea was to let them do the talking and introduce themselves to readers , and to try to curb my sarcasm until after Thanksgiving .
But at least one of the candidates is using one of the columns to suggest I 've endorsed him : State Sen.
Kirk Dillard , the Republican from Hinsdale , caught a headline that said " Dillard a rare find in Illinois politics . "
The headline was about our steaks , not his politics , but my army of spies tells me he 's been repeatedly mentioning " Kass says I 'm a rare find ! " at candidate forums , as if I 'm in his corner .
Endorsements are n't my job .
And politicians savvy enough to run for governor know that we do n't write the headlines over our columns .
So if I were Dillard , I would n't play such lawyerly word games .
I told this to Brady while repeatedly piercing my pork chop with a forked vengeance best served cold .
" OK , " Brady said .
" I get it . "
Hey , I 'm just saying .
Brady , 48 , runs his construction and real estate management business with his brothers .
He was first elected to the Illinois House in 1993 , and has been in the state Senate since 2002 .
Though a career pol now , he also works for a living .
" The No. 1 issue is n't taxes .
It is n't health care , education .
It 's employment , " Brady said .
" People in Illinois are worried if they 're going to have their job tomorrow .
It 's an 85 percent issue . "
To that end , he advocates giving tax credits to small businesses for creating new jobs , eliminating the so - called death tax and cutting the bloated state budget by 10 percent .
" We need to make Illinois a competitive place to live and work , " Brady said .
Whether he can do it , I can't say .
In 2006 , he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination and would n't stand up to what I still consider the corrupt elements of the Republican Party .
I did n't think he had a chance , and I figured he would split the conservative vote , allowing Judy Baar Topinka to polka dismally toward failure and give former Gov. Rod Blagojevich another term before he was indicted .
And that 's what happened .
But I figure that we 're all entitled to a mistake , and he 's older and wiser now .
The other conservatives in the race are political newcomer Adam Andrzejewski and the rapier - tongued pundit Dan Proft .
I asked Brady about the state of the Republican Party , still broken by the appetites of imprisoned former Gov. George Ryan , and by the reach of Combine masters like Blagojevich 's co-defendant , Springfield Republican boss William Cellini .
" The reality is that Democrats are n't philosophical , and they 'll embrace their nominee regardless of where they are on the issues , " Brady said .
" But Republicans in their core are pro-life , pro-marriage , anti-tax , anti-corruption and anti-gambling .
And they feel that candidates who are n't these things are hypocritical .
And they wo n't support them .
So to win this election , a candidate has to bring the party together .
" Our nominee [ Topinka ] lost 30 percent of the people who called themselves Republican conservatives .
And the middle is not partisan , not philosophical , and at the end of the day they look for a candidate who is supported by their party , as long as they 're not scary , " Brady said .
Brady is working overtime not to be scary .
And then I looked at the meatloaf on his plate .
Eureka !
Meatloaf is n't scary , is it ?
But then , like that Ham Salad Surprise , you just never know .

Moon AND Stars
Composite Image Credit : T.A. Rector , I.P. Dell ' Antonio , NOAO , AURA , NSF
Explanation :
Here 's something you do n't see too often ... a detailed picture of the full Moon surrounded by a rich field of background stars .
It 's true that bright moonlight scattered by the atmosphere tends to mask faint stars , but pictures of the sunlit portion of the Moon made with earthbound telescopes or even with cameras on the lunar surface often fail to show any background stars at all .
Why ?
Because the exposure times are too short .
Very short exposures , lasting fractions of a second , are required to accurately record an image of the bright lunar surface .
But the background stars ( and galaxies ! ) such as those visible above are much fainter and need exposures lasting minutes to hours which would seriously overexpose the surface of the Moon .
So , of course this stunning view really is a combination of two digital images -- a short exposure , registering the exquisite lunar surface details at full Moon , superposed on a separate very long exposure , made with the Moon absent from the star field .
The final representation of Moon and background stars is very dramatic , even though it could not have been captured in a single exposure .
Anti-drug law could draw 30 - year sentence for Blackwater shooters RAW STORY
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Blackwater Worldwide guards who fired on Iraqi civilians in a 2007 massacre that left 17 dead , including young children , may actually meet the business - end of justice .
According to a recent report , the Department of Justice may use an anti-drug law intended to fight the 80's crack epidemic to put the gunmen away for up to three decades , minimum .
While no drugs were involved in the killings , the government 's attorneys may attempt to apply a clause in the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse
Act that requires a 30 - year sentence for any violent crime committed with a machine gun .
Blackwater International , a North Carolina - based mercenary group , defended the shooters as recently as August , claiming the killing spree was " self defense . "
A witness to the massacre called the scene " a horror movie , " in a 2007 report .
According to officials , charges could be announced as early as Monday .
Panel three was one of those things where I could not stop giggling while I drew it .
Hopefully you agree !
We got word from our printer on the ETA for the first printing of Library Science shirts - we should be getting some in just before Thanksgiving , and the rest of the shipment in the days following the holiday .
We 'll send 'em out as fast as we can .
Thanks for your patience !
Okay that is it .

The remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still delivers a modern warning wrapped in an ancient myth
Klaatu is back and he ’s badder than before , with Gort the robot four times the size of the original and a new message for humans to straighten up and save the environment … or else .
The remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still closely parallels Robert Wise ’s 1951 science fiction film classic that was a Cold War warning shrouded in a Christ allegory .
In the original screenplay by Edmund H. North , an alien ambassador named Klaatu ( Michael Rennie ) arrives in Washington D.C. in his flying saucer - shaped spaceship ( following the UFO convention of the time ) with an eight - foot humanoid robot named Gort ( played by the 7 - foot , 7 - inch Lock Martin , who was working as a doorman at Grauman ’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood at the time ) .
Trigger - happy soldiers shoot Klaatu and whisk him away to a government facility from which he subsequently escapes and disappears into the city , walking among the common people and eventually taking up residence in the home of single mom Helen Benson ( Patricia Neal ) under the assumed name Mr. Carpenter ( to reinforce the allegory for those who are hard of biblical hearing ) .
Having failed to gain access to the United Nations where he hoped to spread the word of peace and to warn the Earthlings of their impending threat to neighboring planetary civilizations now that the deadly combination of nuclear weapons and spaceflight had been achieved , Klaatu meets with Professor Barnhardt , an Einsteinesque figure who is working on an exceedingly difficult problem in physics that Klaatu helps him solve ( like Jesus lecturing the rabbis in the temple ) .
Impressed but still skeptical , the doubting Thomas Professor Barnhardt demands proof of his interlocutor ’s divine power , which Klaatu delivers henceforth by causing civilization to stand still for an hour through the cessation of all electrical transmissions .
As Barnhardt scrambles to gather together the world ’s greatest minds for a meeting with Klaatu , military goons once again show the darker side of humanity by gunning down Klaatu in cold blood , which he , like Jesus , had prophesized to his followers .
As he lay dying in the arms of Patricia Neal ’s Mary Magdalene figure , he reminds her to deliver a vital message to Gort that has come down to us as one of the most famous lines in SciFi history : “ Klaatu Barada Nikto . ”
Loosely translated : “ Klaatu says do n’t destroy Earth just yet … and come get me and bring me back to life because these idiot humans shot me again . ”
Gort gets the message and goes to the government building to empty the tomb and haul the corpse back to the ship , where he resurrects Klaatu .
The astonished Mary Magdalene exclaims , in reference to the seemingly omnipotent Gort , “ You mean , he has the power of life and death ? ”
The original screenplay called for an affirmative answer to this ultimate how - far - can - science - go ?
question , but the Breen Censorship Board ( a self - policing committee of the film industry ) nixed the line , explaining “ Only God can do that ” .
In its stead Klaatu answers , with ecumenical sensitivity : “ No , that power is reserved to the almighty spirit . ”
( In the Boris Karloff version of Frankenstein — Mary Shelley ’s science fiction story in which scientists are punished for pushing the envelope of technology — when the monster first comes alive Dr. Frankenstein exclaims “ now I know what it feels like to be God . ”
The voice track was dropped and the background music elevated .
I am told , but have not had a chance to check it , that in the remastered DVD of the film the vocal track is restored . )
Born again , Klaatu emerges from the ship to deliver his stern warning to the authorities in this thinly veiled defense of the newly formed United Nations :
I am leaving soon and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly .
The universe grows smaller every day and the threat of aggression from any group anywhere can no longer be tolerated .
There must be security for all or no one is secure .
Now , this does not mean giving up any freedom , except the freedom to act irresponsibly …
The test of any higher authority is of course the police force that supports it .
For our policemen we created a race of robots .
Their function is to patrol the planets in spaceships like this one and preserve the peace …
At the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor .
The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk .
The result is , we live in peace without arms or armies , secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war .
Free to pursue more profitable enterprises .
We do not pretend to have achieved perfection .
But we do have a system and it works .
I came here to give you these facts .
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet .
But if you threaten to extend your violence , this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder .
Your choice is simple .
Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration .
Having delivered his message of threatened destruction and potential redemption , Klaatu ’s Jesus ascends to the heavens .
The remake adds and subtracts from the original , and nearly always does so in constructive ways .
Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly fill the main characters perfectly , but the director Scott Derrickson and the screenplay writer David Scarpa elevated Helen to an astrobiologist and made her the scientific link to Klaatu .
Professor Barnhardt ( John Cleese of Monty Python fame who nevertheless sells the character as serious ) is working on his theory of “ biological altruism ” ( read evolutionary ethics ) , added as an element in the story to convince Klaatu that humans deserve a second chance to express our altruistic nature ( reinforced by Bach playing on Barnhardt ’s stereo —
“ It ’s beautiful ” Klaatu says in his transformation from destroyer to redeemer of worlds ) .
Derrickson also skillfully provided an explanation for why Klaatu would be a bipedal hominid ( an unlikely product of independent evolution on another planet ) — genetic engineering of placental tissue surrounding his original alien body , with embryological development sped up hundreds of times to transform him into recognizably human .
“ What were you before you were human ? ” Benson queries .
Klaatu ’s answer : “ It would only frighten you . ”
That is a far likelier scenario than the portrayal of aliens in most science fiction films .
Derrickson was also a stickler for scientific accuracy , employing the astronomer and astrobiologist Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute to check the dialogue ( and chalkboard equations ) for precision .
As Derrickson explained at a panel discussion on his film at Caltech — joined by Keanu Reeves , Caltech cosmologist Sean Carroll , and JPL roboticist Joel Burdick — Shostak redacted some meaningless mumbo jumbo in the description of the spaceship ’s approach to Earth and replaced it with “ The object was not following a gravitational free - fall trajectory ; as such its path was recalculated . ”
( The Caltech students delighted in firing both technical and nerdy questions at the panel .
For example , question for Carroll : “ Are the laws of physics invariant ? ”
Answer : “ I see you ’ve been reading my recently published technical paper in which I show that it is possible that the laws of nature could be different in different times and places in the universe . ”
A slightly less technical question for Keanu Reeves : “ Are you human ? ” Answer : “ If you cut me do I not bleed ? ” Nice .
My favorite part of the evening was seeing a hand - made sign hoisted by a group of Caltech coeds — probably 800 - on - their - SAT tests all — that read “ The Day I Met Keanu the Earth Stood Still ” . )
Some additions were unnecessary , such as Gort ’s name as a military acronym for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology ; or heavy handed , as in overplaying the environmental destruction theme by turning the spaceship into a species - saving Ark .
At least the robot was n’t renamed Gore .
Klaatu is no longer Mr. Carpenter , but he fills Jesus ’ shoes by resurrecting a Lazerus - like state trooper from the dead .
When Benson ’s step - son asks Klaatu to do the same for his father who died in the Iraq war , Derrickson self - censored by having Klaatu explain that “ there are some things I cannot do . ”
( Why not ?
Is resurrection restricted by length of time after death ? )
Gone too is the electrical blackout , but in its stead ( and escalating the seriousness of Klaatu ’s warning ) , the 28 - foot metallic Gort dissolves into billions of tiny nanobots that feed on manmade materials — tanks , trucks , cars , roads , sports stadiums , office buildings , and everything else that represents civilization — growing as they spread around the globe .
( It ’s the grey goo from beyond ! )
Klaatu has not come to destroy Earth ; he has come to save Earth … from us .
“ If the Earth dies , you die .
If you die , the Earth survives . ”
The Day the Earth Stood Still has stood the test of time and its remake is far more than that , and well worth seeing .
Both touch on timeless mythic themes : destruction and redemption , death and resurrection , mortality and immortality , individual liberty and group unity , national sovereignty and global community , and of course , scientists playing God and technology run amok .
Myths , whether in written or visual form , serve a vital role of asking unanswerable questions and providing unquestionable answers .
Most of us , most of the time , have a low tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty .
We want to reduce the cognitive dissonance of not knowing by filling the gaps with answers .
Traditionally , religious myths have served that role , but today — the age of science — science fiction is our mythology .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Taiwanese investigators report that an ointment made from an extract of Indigo naturalis is effective in treatment - resistant plaque psoriasis -- and the treatment appears to be safe .
Indigo naturalis is a plant that is the source of a dark blue dye .
The extract has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of psoriasis , the researchers explain in the Archives of Dermatology .
Forty - two patients with recalcitrant plaque psoriasis applied indigo naturalis ointment or vehicle ( sham ointment ) topically to two symmetrical psoriatic plaque lesions on each side of the body for 12 weeks .
Dr. Yin -Ku Lin of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan , Taiwan , and colleagues report “ significant reductions ” in scores of scaling , rash , and induration with indigo naturalis ointment .
The mean sum of these scores was 6.3 with indigo naturalis ointment and 12.8 with the vehicle , and the percentage of the plaque area remaining was 38.5 percent after indigo naturalis treatment compared with 90 percent with the vehicle ointment .
Thirty - one of 42 patients ( 74 percent ) experienced clearance or near - clearance of psoriasis lesions with indigo naturalis ointment .
Lin ’s group reports that “ severity was not a significant factor in predicting treatment success . ”
They also point out that “ the color and smell of indigo naturalis may affect compliance of the patients and the longer - term durability of the benefit simultaneously .
The indigo naturalis ointment slightly stains the skin and clothing , which can be cleaned thoroughly by common detergents .
Repeated application has no significant effect on skin color and will not change the skin appearance . ”
On the plus side , “ Indigo naturalis ointment treatment has neither adverse effects , such as those found with corticosteroid treatment , nor other toxic effects based on our past 5 years of clinical observation .
Furthermore , it costs much less in comparison with other topical agents , ” Lin and colleagues write .
“ We anticipate that indigo naturalis ointment can be an alternative or complementary therapy for psoriasis and believe it will be a great benefit to this large patient population . ”

Merry Grav-Mass !
Here is a video Grav-Mass greeting .
On December 25 , Isaac Newton 's birthday , we celebrate the existence of comprehensible physical laws .
Remember , Gravitation is a well - established scientific theory , but Intelligent Falling is just religion pretending to be science .
Here 's a gallery of Grav- Mass cards that you can contribute to .
One way to celebrate Grav-Mass is to decorate a tree with apples and other fruits .
Glue them or attach them , but not too well !
The idea is that occasionally a fruit should fall .
Put them on the tree no more than 2 feet up , so that they wo n't get damaged or hurt anybody when they fall .
Investigating and perfecting the methods for doing this is a great way expose a child to the process of scientifically studying the behavior of the physical world .
Another way to celebrate Grav-Mass is by throwing a ball or fruit back and forth .
Another way to celebrate Grav-Mass , in a group , is by telling each other about scientific knowledge and understanding , or discussing what kind of experiment could answer an unresolved question about the world .
There is a Grav- Mass discussion group .
To participate you will need an account on a GNU Social server ( you can find several options here ) although read only access does not require any account .
We have one Grav-Mass carol , We Three Laws .
If you know of any others , please tell me about them : rms at gnu dot org .
Other songs about science are also suitable to play or sing on Grav - Mass ;
The Symphony of Science .
The Ten Days of Newton .
Also , The Galaxy Song by Monty Python .
( And some commentaries on it . )

I think the idea of Grav-Mass was conceived by science fiction writer James Hogan .
On Dec 19 , 2012 , I opened an envelope and saw what I believe was the first Grav-Mass card ever made .
It was made and sent to me by Simon and Jane Whiteley .
Here are the images that appear in the card , in case you would like to make some .
Here 's info about their family Grav-Mass celebration in 2012 .
Here is another Grav - Mass card .
Here is an animation of the card .

Liberals are growing increasingly nervous that President - elect Barack Obama seems to be stiffing them on Cabinet jobs and policy choices .
Liberals voice concerns about Obama
Liberals are growing increasingly nervous – and some just flat - out angry – that President - elect Barack Obama seems to be stiffing them on Cabinet jobs and policy choices .
Obama has reversed pledges to immediately repeal tax cuts for the wealthy and take on Big Oil .
He ’s hedged his call for a quick drawdown in Iraq .
And he ’s stocking his White House with anything but stalwarts of the left .

Now some are shedding a reluctance to puncture the liberal euphoria at being rid of President George W. Bush to say , in effect , that the new boss looks like the old boss .
“ He has confirmed what our suspicions were by surrounding himself with a centrist to right cabinet .
But we do hope that before it's all over we can get at least one authentic progressive appointment , ” said Tim Carpenter , national director of the Progressive Democrats of America .
OpenLeft blogger Chris Bowers went so far as to issue this plaintive plea : “ Is n't there ever a point when we can get an actual Democratic administration ? ”
Even supporters make clear they ’re on the lookout for backsliding .
“ There ’s a concern that he keep his basic promises and people are going to watch him , ” said Roger Hickey , a co-founder of Campaign for America ’s Future .
Obama insists he has n’t abandoned the goals that made him feel to some like a liberal savior .
But the left ’s bill of particulars against Obama is long , and growing .
Obama drew rousing applause at campaign events when he vowed to tax the windfall profits of oil companies .
As president - elect , Obama says he wo n’t enact the tax .
Obama ’s pledge to repeal the Bush tax cuts and redistribute that money to the middle class made him a hero among Democrats who said the cuts favored the wealthy .
But now he ’s struck a more cautious stance on rolling back tax cuts for people making over $ 250,000 a year , signaling he ’ll merely let them expire as scheduled at the end of 2010 .
Obama ’s post-election rhetoric on Iraq and choices for national security team have some liberal Democrats even more perplexed .
As a candidate , Obama defined and separated himself from his challengers by highlighting his opposition to the war in Iraq from the start .
He promised to begin to end the war on his first day in office .
Now Obama ’s says that on his first day in office he will begin to “ design a plan for a responsible drawdown , ” as he told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” Sunday .
Obama has also filled his national security positions with supporters of the Iraq war : Sen. Hillary Clinton , who voted to authorize force in Iraq , as his secretary of state ; and President George W. Bush ’s defense secretary , Robert Gates , continuing in the same role .
The central premise of the left ’s criticism is direct – do n’t bite the hand that feeds , Mr. President - elect .
The Internet that helped him so much during the election is lighting up with irritation and critiques .
“ There do n't seem to be any liberals in Obama 's cabinet , ” writes John Aravosis , the editor of Americablog.com .
“ What does all of this mean for Obama 's policies , and just as important , Obama Supreme Court announcements ? ”
“ Actually , it reminds me a bit of the campaign , at least the beginning and the middle , when the Obama campaign did n't seem particularly interested in reaching out to progressives , ” Aravosis continues .
“ Once they realized that in order to win they needed to marshal everyone on their side , the reaching out began .
I hope we 're not seeing a similar ‘ we can do it alone ’ approach in the transition team . ”
This is n’t the first liberal letdown over Obama , who promptly angered the left after winning the Democratic primary by announcing he backed a compromise that would allow warrantless wiretapping on U.S. soil to continue .
Now it ’s Obama ’s Cabinet moves that are drawing the most fire .
It ’s not just that he ’s picked Clinton and Gates .
It ’s that liberal Democrats say they ’re hard - pressed to find one of their own on Obama ’s team so far – particularly on the economic side , where people like Tim Geithner and Lawrence Summers are hardly viewed as pro-labor .
“ At his announcement of an economic team there was no secretary of labor .
If you do n’t think the labor secretary is on the same level as treasury secretary , that gives me pause , ” said Jonathan Tasini , who runs the website workinglife.org .
“ The president - elect would n't be president - elect without labor . "
During the campaign Obama gained labor support by saying he favored legislation that would make it easier for unions to form inside companies .
The “ card check ” bill would get rid of a secret - ballot method of voting to form a union and replace it with a system that would require companies to recognize unions simply if a majority of workers signed cards saying they want one .
Obama still supports that legislation , aides say – but union leaders are worried that he no longer talks it up much as president - elect .
“ It 's complicated , ” said Tasini , who challenged Clinton for Senate in 2006 .
“ On the one hand , the guy has n't even taken office yet so it 's a little hasty to be criticizing him .
On the other hand , there is legitimate cause for concern .
I think people are still waiting but there is some edginess about this . ”
That ’s a view that seems to have kept some progressive leaders holding their fire .
There are signs of a struggle within the left wing of the Democratic Party about whether it ’s just too soon to criticize Obama -- and if there ’s really anything to complain about just yet .
Case in point :
One of the Campaign for America ’s Future blogs commented on Obama ’s decision not to tax oil companies ’ windfall profits saying , “ Between this move and the move to wait to repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy , it seems like the Obama team is buying into the right - wing frame that raising any taxes - even those on the richest citizens and wealthiest corporations - is bad for the economy . ”
Yet Campaign for America ’s Future will be join about 150 progressive organizations , economists and labor groups to release a statement Tuesday in support of a large economic stimulus package like the one Obama has proposed , said Hickey , a co-founder of the group .
“ I ’ve heard the most grousing about the windfall profits tax , but on the other hand , Obama has committed himself to a stimulus package that makes a down payment on energy efficiency and green jobs , ” Hickey said .
“ The old argument was , here ’s how we afford to make these investments – we tax the oil companies ’ windfall profits . …
The new argument is , in a bad economy that could get worse , we do n’t . ”
Obama is asking for patience – saying he ’s only shifting his stance on some issues because circumstances are shifting .
Aides say he backed off the windfall profits tax because oil prices have
dropped below $ 80 a barrel .
Obama also defended hedging on the Bush tax cuts .
“ My economic team right now is examining , do we repeal that through legislation ?
Do we let it lapse so that , when the Bush tax cuts expire , they 're not renewed when it comes to wealthiest Americans ? ”
Obama said on “ Meet the Press . ”
“ We do n't yet know what the best approach is going to be . ”
On Iraq , he says he ’s just trying to make sure any U.S. pullout does n’t ignite “ any resurgence of terrorism in Iraq that could threaten our interests . ”
Obama has told his supporters to look beyond his appointments , that the change he promised will come from him and that when his administration comes together they will be happy .
“ I think that when you ultimately look at what this advisory board looks like , you 'll say this is a cross-section of opinion that in some ways reinforces conventional wisdom , in some ways breaks with orthodoxy in all sorts of way , ” Obama recently said in response to questions about his appointments during a news conference on the economy .
The leaders of some liberal groups are willing to wait and see .
“ He has n’t had a first day in office , ” said John Isaacs , the executive director for Council for Livable World .
“ To me it ’s not as important as who ’s there , than what kind of policies they carry out . ”
“ These are n’t out - and - out liberals on the national security team , but they may be successful implementers of what the Obama national security policy is , ” Isaacs added .
“ We want to see what policies are carried forward , as opposed to appointments . ”
Juan Cole , who runs a prominent anti-war blog called Informed Comment , said he worries Obama will get bad advice from Clinton on the Middle East , calling her too pro-Israel and “ belligerent ” toward Iran .
“ But overall , my estimation is that he has chosen competence over ideology , and I 'm willing to cut him some slack , ” Cole said .
Other voices of the left do n’t like what they ’re seeing so far and are n’t waiting for more before they speak up .
New York Times columnist Frank Rich warned that Obama ’s economic team of Summers and Geithner reminded him of John F. Kennedy ’s “ best and the brightest ” team , who blundered in Vietnam despite their blue - chip pedigrees .
David Corn , Washington bureau chief of the liberal magazine Mother Jones , wrote in Sunday ’s Washington Post that he is “ not yet reaching for a pitchfork . ”
But the headline of his op - ed sums up his point about Obama ’s Cabinet appointments so far : “ This Was n’t Quite the Change We Envisioned . ”
It has happened to everyone .
You spend countless hours producing a beautiful , pixel - perfect comp only to have it rejected by the client because it is n’t what they were envisioning in their mind ’s eye .
It ’s the dreaded “ I ’ll know it when I see it ” curse .
You get sent back to the drawing board , your ego and the budget take a hit , and everyone is frustrated by the process .
After this happens a few times you realize that getting the client involved earlier in the process can make a huge difference in the outcome of your design presentations .
As designers , we often think we have all the answers .
It is our job to know what looks good and we take that responsibility seriously !
But even if you are talented and your work is top - notch its easy to misread client expectations .
Words fail miserably when trying to translate design concepts .
What one person calls “ edgy ” another might see as chaotic .
And if your client has n’t been very forthcoming about what they want their new site to look like it ’s even harder to hit the mark in one shot .
Visuals communicate things that words cannot .
A picture is worth a thousand words , and mood boards are a great tool to create that picture for your client .
What exactly is a mood board ?
Mood boards ( sometimes called inspiration boards ) are used in a variety of disciplines .
You ’ve no doubt seen them used for Interior Design , where fabric swatches and paint chip samples are grouped together on a poster to show a homeowner what type of atmosphere the new decor will create .
They are also used frequently in Fashion to highlight trends and styles .
In essence they are a compilation of inspirational elements used by designers to flesh out ideas at the beginning of a design project .
A mood board is extremely useful for establishing the aesthetic feel of a web site .
It usually fits into the process somewhere after wireframes and before design mockups .
Things that can be explored in the mood board include photography style , color palettes , typography , patterns , and the overall look and feel of the site .
Soft or hard ?
Grungy or clean ?
Dark or light ?
A rough collage of colors , textures and pictures is all it takes to evoke a specific style or feeling .
The mood board is intentionally casual ; it lets the designer start with broad strokes and get feedback before too much time is invested in the wrong direction .
Think of it as rapid visual prototyping .
How do I create one ?
The first thing you should do is evaluate the project and pick the mood board style that will work best .
There are many different ways to present a mood board .
The direction you choose will be based on the time allotted , personal work habits and most importantly your client ’s personality .
Style 1 : Loose Collage
If they are big thinkers who are n’t obsessed with the details , chances are they will love this part of the process and wo n’t require refined mood boards .
A loose collage will work just fine to convey the type of look and feel you are going for .
An example of this style is below :
This is the easiest way to create a mood board because it can be thrown together quickly and does not force you to make decisions about smaller details such as fonts or specific colors .
Grab bits of inspiration from anywhere you choose .
Scan in things you find around you or search online for suitable pictures and textures .
Sometimes it is helpful to include screenshots of other sites with a similar look and feel .
While this is the most time - efficient and fun style to make , it can unfortunately be confusing and distracting to clients who do not fully grasp the idea .
Style 2 : Refined Template
If your client has not worked with many designers or marketing people , or if they are extremely detail - oriented , you may want to take a more formal approach .
In this style , a template is created to showcase the different elements .
An example of this style is below :
A color palette is defined , font treatments such as a heading and subheading are chosen , and items like button styles and photography can also be worked in .
A standardized template will help your client to focus on the featured elements .
I typically create 3 mood boards for any design project .
Depending on the style , I spend 1 to 3 hours on each .
Before starting I come up with a list of adjectives for each board .
An example might be :
Dark , glossy , slick , modern , edgy , hard , aggressive
Soft , muted , round , layered , elegant , realistic
Colorful , rough , sketchy , bright , illustration
These adjectives serve as guidelines as I pull together the elements .
The words ( and boards ) should have strong differences .
Including a wide range of styles is important for getting the most out of this process .
How do I present it ?
Prepare your client by explaining how the mood board fits into your process .
Tell them what you hope to get out of the review and let them know that any and all feedback is welcomed at this point .
When you are presenting , clue your client in to the inspiration behind each of your boards .
Your starter list of adjectives is helpful here .
Remind them that nothing on the boards is set in stone and that they are simply a tool used to focus the design process .
You will find that in most cases a client will know which mood board feels right to them within seconds .
If they need to see a few additional options , making revisions at this stage is quick and painless .
What are the benefits ?
Faster mockup production
Some clients will argue that they do n’t want to pay for mood boards and would rather go straight to mockups , but a few short hours spent up front can save countless hours down the line .
With a visual guide created and a clear vision of where you ’re headed it ’s much easier to jump right in to the visual prototyping process .
There is no blank - canvas syndrome to deal with , and no gnawing feeling that you are wasting your time on a concept they might not like .
Best of all , there are no big surprises .
Since using mood boards I have yet to run into a project that was a complete do - over .
Smoother client buy - in
Additionally , early client participation makes them a bigger part of the project .
When clients feel involved they are more likely to trust you .
Mood boards make it clear that you are listening to them and considering their input .
They also gain insight into the thinking behind your decisions , dispelling the all - too - common notion that designers choose everything on a whim .
Knowing why you picked something will often keep personal preferences ( ie / the client ’s favorite color is purple so she would like to see that as a background ) from creeping in as change requests .
Less frustration , more fun
Mood boards are so much fun , they hardly feel like work .
Designing loosely lets you brainstorm , explore and play with different styles without all the limitations a layout ( and coding realities ) will later impose .
They also keep revision cycles to a minimum , something every designer can appreciate .
Examples
Now that you know why they ’re useful , it ’s time to make them a part of your process .
Not quite ready to jump in ?
Check out a few examples to get your creative juices flowing .
Below , a collage mood board created for an online store selling baby clothing and accessories .
Adjectives they chose to describe their brand include stylish , friendly , and modern .
The collage suggests a blue and brown color scheme , a mix of handwritten and serif fonts , rounded buttons and a few handmade elements .
For comparison , here is an example of a template mood board for the same project :
The template takes a more streamlined approach , dropping the handmade elements but keeping the blue and brown color scheme .
The color palette , patterns , type treatments and photo usage are all more explicit .
If you need more ideas , the Flickr Inspiration Boards group has a great collection from designers of all kinds .
Try using mood boards in your next project .
They ’re a fun , efficient and effective way to communicate big design ideas .

( CNN ) --
The minute news broke of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai , India , social media sites like Twitter were inundated with a huge volume of messages .
With more than 6 million members worldwide , an estimated 80 messages , or " tweets , " were being sent to Twitter.com via SMS every five seconds , providing eyewitness accounts and updates .
Many
Twitter users also sent pleas for blood donors to make their way to specific hospitals in Mumbai where doctors were faced with low stocks and rising casualties .
Others sent information about helplines and contact numbers for those who had friends and relatives caught up in the attacks .
Tweeters were also mobilized to help with transcribing a list of the dead and injured from hospitals , which were quickly posted online .
As Twitter user " naomieve " wrote : " Mumbai is not a city under attack as much as it is a social media experiment in action . "
Neha Viswanathan , a former regional editor for Southeast Asia and a volunteer at Global Voices , told CNN , " Even before I actually heard of it on the news I saw stuff about this on Twitter .
" People were sending in messages about what they were hearing .
There were at least five or six blogs from people who were trapped , or who were very close to what happened . "
One tweet from " Dupree " appeared to be coming from inside one of the hotels : " Mumbai terrorists are asking hotel reception for rooms of American citizens and holding them hostage on one floor . "
A group of Mumbai - based bloggers turned their Metroblog into a news wire service , while the blog MumbaiHelp offered to help users get through to their family and friends in the city , or to get information about them , and has had a number of successes .
Flickr also proved a useful source of haunting images chronicling the aftermath of the attacks .
Journalist Vinukumar Ranganathan 's stream of photos were published by CNN and other major broadcasters .

Share your photos , videos and stories
A Google Map showing the key locations and buildings with links to news stories and eyewitness accounts , and CNN's iReporters flooded the site with their videos and images of the terror attacks .

Tell your story , send your photos
However , as is the case with such widespread dissemination of information , a vast number of the posts on Twitter amounted to unsubstantiated rumors and wild inaccuracies .
For example , a rumor that the Indian government was asking tweeters to stop live updates to avoid compromising its security efforts was published and republished on the site .
This was seemingly given credence by at least one major news
Web site , which posted the tweet on its live update .
It read simply : " Indian government asks for live Twitter updates from Mumbai to cease immediately .
ALL LIVE UPDATES - PLEASE STOP TWEETING . "
Then it was suggested via Twitter that terrorists were using the medium to gain information about what Indian security forces were doing , which led to numerous abusive postings urging the terrorists to " die , die , die , if you 're reading this . "
As blogger Tim Mallon put it , " I started to see and ( sic ) ugly side to Twitter , far from being a crowd - sourced version of the news it was actually an incoherent , rumour - fueled mob operating in a mad echo chamber of tweets , re-tweets and re-re - tweets .
" During the hour or so I followed on Twitter there were wildly differing estimates of the numbers killed and injured - ranging up to 1,000 . "
What is clear that although Twitter remains a useful tool for mobilizing efforts and gaining eyewitness accounts during a disaster , the sourcing of most of the news cannot be trusted .
A quick trawl through the enormous numbers of tweets showed that most were sourced from mainstream media .
Someone tweets a news headline , their friends see it and retweet , prompting an endless circle of recycled information .

phpBB is a fantastic bulletin board system .
We use it at Resolver Systems for our forums , and it does a great job .
However , we ’re a Python shop , so we prefer to do our serious web development — for example , the login system that allows our paying customers to download fully - featured unlocked versions of our software — in Django .
We needed to have a single sign - on system for both parts of our website .
Specifically , we wanted people to be able to log in using the Django authentication module , and then to be able to post on the forums without logging in again .
This post is an overview of the code we used ; I ’ve had to extract it from various sources , so it might not be complete — let me know in the comments if anything ’s missing .
I will be uploading something more polished to a Google Code project over the next few days .
[ UPDATE : I ’ve now uploaded all of the code to the Google Code project , so if you want to use it , you should get it from there .
However , the description below may still be of interest , and I ’ll keep it for historical reasons :-) ]
The PHP side
Let ’s consider the PHP code first .
phpBB has “ pluggable ” authentication — that is , you can provide a PHP module containing certain functions , and then in the admin UI tell it to use that module for authentication .
These modules are stored in the subdirectory includes / auth , and the standard installation includes one called auth_apache. php , which allows people using Apache to use HTTP authentication .
Our Django integration is based on this module , so it ’s worth going over the original code before we look at the modified version .
There are four functions in the module :
autologin_apache .
This is called when a user tries to do something that requires a login ( and perhaps at other times too , I ’m not sure ) .
Its job is to check the current session , and determine if the state of that session is such that the user should be autmatically logged in to phpBB .
This is the core of the HTTP authentication : it checks that the current session relates to a user who is logged in HTTP - wise , and then tries to get a user of the same name from the phpBB user database .
If there is such a user , then it returns their details .
If there is not , then it creates one with a default profile .
That last step can be counter - intuitive — what kind of authentication system creates profiles for people it ’s never heard of before ? — but makes sense when you consider that it is only doing this for people who are actually already logged in using the other system that you ’re integrating with .
user_row_apache .
This function just generates a default phpBB profile given a username and a password .
validate_session_apache .
This function checks if the user passed to it matches the one who is logged in HTTP - wise .
init_apache .
This is used when you first switch to using Apache - based authentication , and is just a sanity check to make sure that you ’re logged in ( HTTP - wise ) as a user whose ID matches the user you ’re logged into phpBB as .
This stops you from accidentally switching to using Apache - based authentication when you ’re not logged in using that kind of authentication and being logged out and unable to switch back again .
login_apache .
This is called by the phpBB login page to validate a user .
To be perfectly honest , I ’m not sure why it ’s included in the auth_apache module , because if it ’s correctly configured then anyone who performs an action that would require a login will be handled by autologin_apache , so they ’d never see the login page .
However , for completeness : this page checks that the current session relates to a user who is logged in HTTP - wise , and that the username used for the HTTP auth is the same as the one being used to log in .
If all is OK , and the username does not identify an inactive user , then the function either returns the details of any existing user with the given username , or it creates a new one with a default profile .
From all that , it should be clear that in order to write a Django equivalent to this login system , all we need is a way of finding out from PHP , what the Django username associated with the current session is .
The problem is , of course , that Django and PHP have entirely different session models , so we need to work out some way for them to communicate with each other .
We decided that cookies are the best way to do this .
While the session objects may differ from PHP to Django , they both have access to the same set of cookies .
Obviously , a trivial way for Django to pass the username to PHP would be to have a cookie that contained it .
Almost equally obviously , this would be a terrible idea , because cookies are under the control of the user ’s browser , and you do n’t want people to be able to set the cookie to , say , “ admin ” using their browser ’s options , and then have admin rights on your forums .
However , Django and PHP use cookies for their session management , and Django puts a session ID into the cookie sessionid .
That cookie is a primary key into the django_session database table , so from PHP you can get the cookie , get the session ID , and then get the Django session data .
That ’s almost enough , but not quite .
The problem is that the session data ( which includes a User object , which has a user name ) is pickled — that is , it ’s encoded using Python ’s serialisation system .
This can not be decoded ( as far as I know ) from PHP .
So , in order to get the user name from the Django session ID , we need to store the mapping from session IDs to usernames in the Django database .
This requires a bit of Django coding , so let ’s look at that next .
The Django side
The answers to this Stack Overflow question contain several good ideas on how to get a user ID from a session ID .
The approach we took was to create a new Django model class ( which would map to a table in the database ) called SessionProfile .
In the same way as you might create UserProfile objects to store information about specific users without having to change the built - in User class , this stores information about sessions without needing to change the Session class .
The model code is simple :
class SessionProfile ( models .
Model ) : session = models .
ForeignKey( Session , unique= True ) user = models .
ForeignKey ( User , null=True )
The next step , of course , is to populate it .
As Peter Rowell suggested in the SO post , we decided to use Django middleware .
This is ever - so - slightly more complex :
from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.contrib.sessions.models import Session from resolver.usermanagement.models import SessionProfile class SessionProfileMiddleware ( object ) : def process_response( self , request , response ) : try : # For certain cases ( I think 404 ) the session attribute # wo n't be set if hasattr ( request , " session " ) : session = Session.objects.get ( pk=request.session.session_key ) sessionProfile , _ = SessionProfile.objects.get_or_create ( session=session ) userID = request.session.get (" _auth_user_id " ) if userID : user = User.objects.get ( pk=int(userID ) ) else : user = None sessionProfile.user = user sessionProfile.save ( ) except Session.DoesNotExist : #
If there 's no session associated with the current # request , there 's nothing to do .
pass return response
To configure Django to run this , we put it in the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES , before the normal Django SessionMiddleware
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
= ( ' django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware ' , ' resolver.usermanagement.middleware.SessionProfileMiddleware ' , ' django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware ' , ' django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware ' , ' django.middleware.transaction.TransactionMiddleware ' , )
All this together meant that we had a Django installation that maintained a table that mapped the session ID to the appropriate row in the auth_user table — or to NULL if the session did not have a logged - in user .
So now there was a way to write PHP code that could go from the sessionid cookie to the user name .
The PHP side , continued
From the starting point of the auth_apache module , it was easy to create an auth_resolver module that accessed the Django tables appropriately .
I wo n’t go into how it works in detail — instead , you can download the two files that make it up .
They should be pretty self - explanatory in the light of the auth_resolver description above .
auth_resolver.php , the phpBB authentication plugin .
, the phpBB authentication plugin .
ResolverUser.php , which provides a GetLoggedInUser function that is used by auth_resolver but is also useful elsewhere .
( If you want to use these , strip the “ .txt ” from the end of the filename and give them a “ . php ” extension . )
Once we had uploaded these files , I made sure that we had a user called “ administrator ” on both the Django and the phpBB sides of our site , logged into both systems separately , went to the phpBB administration pages , and set the authentication to auth_resolver .
Now people only need to log in once on our site .
There was just one more change to make ; when a non-logged - in user tries to post on the forums , they are presented with a login form .
With the setup I ’ve described , this would not work , as it would try to log the user in using the login_resolver function from our authentication module , which is dependent on the user already being logged in to Django — which they clearly are not as otherwise they would not have been presented with the login form !
The solution was to change the page .
The form that is shown to the user under these circumstances is defined by the forum ’s current style ( skin ) ; the default style puts it in styles / prosilver / template/login_body.html .
Our current solution has been to simply replace this form with text that links to the Django login page .
In the long run , we will streamline this .
But that ’s a post for another day .
Any comments on the work so far very much welcome !

Update # 2 & 3 : New links added .
Update # 1 : New information included below the cut and some corrections below .
A major environmental disaster occurred yesterday , but few news outlets outside Tennessee appear to be covering it : 2.6 million cubic yards ( about 525 million gallons ) of fly ash sludge poured out from behind an earthen embankment at the Kingston coal plant ( source : The Tennessean ) .
S&R ’s Wendy Redal blogged about the October , 2000 Massey Energy coal slurry flood earlier this month – this ashslide is bigger , and while it ’s more solid , it still covers 400 acres in up to 6 feet of toxic coal ash .
To put this into scale with the Exxon Valdez spill , this coal ash release is presently estimated to be 48 times larger ( in volume ) and as dangerous .
The release is on a tributary of the Tennessee River , which provides water to millions of people in Tennessee , Alabama , and Kentucky before joining up with the Ohio and Mississippi rivers .
Update # 1 : According to the TVA , it ’s not accurate to directly compare the estimated 2.6 million cubic yards of material released with a liquid release like that of the October , 2000 slurry flood because this was more of a landslide / mudslide and has not – yet – affected the water quality of the Emory River ( as of this AM ) .
The TVA is monitoring water quality at 11 locations and the water quality was still within EPA standards for drinking water – except that there ’s now evidence of fish dying downstream .
( Thanks to Bill Kovarik for getting this info from TVA . )
How bad this will be ultimately will be determined by how fast it can be cleaned up , how much of the material ends up in the water supply , etc .
In some ways , the fact it happened during the winter instead of during spring rains is probably a saving grace – the TVA will have more time to clean it up before the water pollution gets really bad .
This quote from the Tennessean puts this into some perspective :
Viewed from above , the scene looked like the aftermath of a tsunami , with swirls of dirtied water stretching for hundreds of acres on the land , and muddied water in the Emory River .
The Emory leads to the Clinch , which flows into the Tennessee .
Workers sampled river water Monday , with results expected back today , but did n’t sample the dunelike drifts of muddy ash .
That could begin today , officials said , and the potential magnitude of the problem could make this a federally declared Superfund site .
That would mean close monitoring and a deep , costly cleanup requiring years of work .
“ We ’ll be sampling for metals in the ground to see what kind of impact that had , ” said Laura Niles , a spokeswoman for the EPA in Atlanta .
“ Hopefully , it wo n’t be as bad as creating a Superfund site , but it depends on what is found . ”
Here ’s a bunch of resources about this story that desperately need to not go unnoticed – please pass them around :

I ’ll have a great deal more to say about this over the next few days , focusing most on the toxic threat of fly ash ( and how it ’s used and abused , and how it ’s radioactive , etc. ) and why combustion byproducts like fly ash are part of the reason why “ clean ” coal is complete and utter bullshit , even if 100 % of the carbon dioxide was capture and sequestered .

In this interview filmed at RubyFringe , Yehuda Katz talks about web framework Merb .
Merb follows a few design principles that distinguish it from Ruby on Rails .
As Yehuda explains , Merb aims to provide a stable public API which can be used , and which is warded off from the actual Merb implementation .
With that , 3rd party plugin providers do n't have to worry about some change in the Merb implementation breaking their code .
Hand in hand with this is a strict documentation for Merb code .
Merb uses documentation conventions to describe the contract of a method , ie .
the expected argument types and return types .
As Yehuda mentions , the conventions resembled the one of the Ruby documentation tool Yard .
Other topics are the perils of Rails ' Module#alias_method_chain ( and why Merb wo n't use it ) and how the Merb team handles Monkey Patching ( Open Classes ) .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Men are happier with money , while women find greater joy in friendships and relationships with their children , co-workers and bosses , a new global survey reveals .
A woman works in Shanghai Stock Exchange room in Shanghai , April 27 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Nir Elias
The online survey of 28,153 people in more than 51 countries by global marketing and information firm Nielsen found that as the world grapples with a recession and financial markets remain volatile , many people are reminding themselves that money ca n’t buy happiness .
The Nielsen Happiness Study found that globally , women are happier than men in 48 of the 51 countries surveyed in April 2008 , and only in Brazil , South Africa and Vietnam were men found to be happier than women .
“ Because they are happier with non-economic factors , women ’s happiness is more recession - proof which might explain why women around the world are happier in general than men are , ” Nielsen Vice President of Consumer Research Bruce Paul said in a statement .
Japanese women reported the greatest difference and are 15 percent happier than Japanese men .
Women are also more optimistic about the future , scoring higher than men on predictions of their happiness in the next six months .
Women were also more content with their sex lives , although men were generally happier with their spouses , the study found .
Japanese and New Zealand women reported the greatest difference in satisfaction with their sex lives .
Men are generally happier with their physical health than women , and this is especially pronounced in South Africa .
Egypt bucks the trend , with women rating their happiness with their health considerably higher than men .
Globally , men rated their happiness with their mental health higher than women .
This was echoed in Belgium , South Korea , Mexico , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Egypt , and Israel .
There are three main drivers of happiness globally , according to the study : personal financial situation , mental health and job / career .
Being satisfied with your partner is also important for happiness .
As well as gauging levels of happiness , the Nielsen survey examined what specific factors contributed to happiness around the world .
“ Happiness is a local and personal matter and Nielsen sought to uncover what specific factors contribute to making people happy in different parts of the world , ” Paul said .
“ Many of the world ’s poorer and emerging markets outranked developed countries for happiness and satisfaction levels in nearly all aspects of their lives . ”
Globally , Lithuanians and Indonesians are most reliant on their personal financial situation and job for happiness , while South Africans and Venezuelans ranked the least dependent on money for their happiness , the survey found .
Nielsen also looked closely at survey results to find out if a nation ’s happiness level was influenced by low income inequality , low corruption or peace .
Surprisingly , markets which performed poorly on these factors were in many cases the happiest nations , Paul said .
“ For consumers in rapidly developing markets , there could be a greater sense of appreciation for things that bring a better life than they had a few years ago . ”
Karen Long , Adams County Clerk Takes Action After Voter Sees Vote Flip Repeatedly to Republican Candidate in State With Long History of E- Voting Failures
Watchdog Group Issues Press Release Calling for No ' Recalibration ' , Immediate Removal , Impounding of Such Machines ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/30/2008 , 11:33 am PT
A county clerk in Colorado has finally done the right thing for the voters by removing a touch - screen voting machine from service , and quarantining it , after it was discovered to be flipping votes from one candidate to another .
The failed machine in this case was a Diebold Accu - Vote , a frequent flipper .
As reported by the Colorado Independent ( Hat-tip VoterAction.org ) ...
An electronic voting machine in Adams County repeatedly failed to accept a vote for a Democratic state Senate candidate — instead registering the vote for her Republican opponent — at an early voting site last week and has been removed from service , the Aurora Sentinel reports Wednesday .
Adams County Clerk and Recorder Karen
Long told the newspaper the error does n’t reflect wider problems in the county ’s voting systems , but the candidate said the incident could lead to a lawsuit .
“ I always just trusted the machines , and it opened my eyes , ” said state Rep. Mary Hodge .
“ The way it works now , I ’m told … is that those votes throw it to Mr. Hadfield that we ’ll probably have a lawsuit and a court decision .
We ’ll have to wait and see . ”
Hodge , the Democratic nominee , faces Republican Robert John Hadfield in the race to represent state Senate District 25 .
...
“ I have quarantined the machine , ” Long told the newspaper .
“ It ’s removed and it ’s sealed up and it ’s in a bag . ”
She said she is awaiting instructions from the secretary of state ’s office .
Long is to be lauded for being the first election official in the country so far during the general election ( that we 're aware of ) to have taken the correct action in such a vote - flipping case .
And now that Hodge 's eyes are " opened " we hope that both she and her Republican opponent , Hadfield will stand up for their voters by signing the StandingForVoters.org " no concessions " pledge immediately !
Late last night VelvetRevolution.us ( a non-partisan , non-profit election watchdog co-founded by The BRAD BLOG ) issued a press release calling on election officials to not recalibrate systems mid-election , but rather remove and impound them , and offer voters paper ballots as needed instead .
The complete press release is posted at the end of this article .
Colorado has a troubling history with electronic voting , even as the Secretary of State found all of the state 's machines to be faulty and easily hackable in late 2007 , but has capitulated to pressure from election officials to allow them to be used by voters again this year anyway ...
Problems Not New to Colorado ...
In another story on the removal of Adams County 's Diebold machine , it was noted that the system was quarantined " as per the Secretary of State 's instructions " .
We 're not sure if those were instructions given only to Long , or if SoS Mike Coffman had issued a directive somewhere on this .
We 'll try to find out .
In any case , we hope other CO officials ( as well as officials in other states where this occurs ) will follow Long 's lead and take the same action she did .
SoS Coffman --- who is overseeing his own election this year in his bid for the U.S. House --- previously decertified all but the Diebold voting systems in his state after an exhaustive court - ordered certification test ( and after it was found that his Congressional campaign shared the same PR outfit with Diebold ) .
Following his decertification last December , which discovered all of the machines used by his state were easily hacked and prone to serious errors , he recertified all of them after receiving pressure from CO county election clerks .
One of those officials , the state 's Election Director Holly Lowder , resigned in disgrace just last month after it was discovered she shared her residence with one of the state 's top election vendors .
Following Similar Failures in Other States , Watchdog Calls for Impounding ...
Previously , after votes were noticed to have flipped during early voting this year on Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) systems in WV , in TN , in TX and other states , election officials have often first ( and completely inappropriately ) blamed the voters , and then instructed poll workers to " recalibrate " the machines .
Calibrating an electronic voting machine mid-election , however , as we 've pointed out repeatedly , is irresponsible and dangerous , and --- as demonstrated by this West Virginia County clerk on video tape --- ineffective , as it often fails to correct the problem at all .
Whether a vote is seen flipping or not on a DRE , it must be noted , there is no way to verify that any vote ever cast on such a system in any election for any candidate or initiative on the ballot has ever been recorded accurately .
That 's a fact whether or not such a system offers a so - called " paper trail " print - out , as even the DREs with such print - outs can be easily and quickly hacked in a way that would be next to impossible to discover as shown in this video demonstration from the state - sponsored computer scientists at the UCSB Computer Security Group .
While we have asked repeatedly for any such evidence to show that any such vote has ever been recorded as per a voter 's intent during an election , no election official , or voting machine company representative has ever been able to offer any .
That 's because none exists .
DRE machines require 100 % faith - based voting , with faith applied solely in the private company who created and programmed the machine , and the election officials who force voters to use them in our public elections .
Moreover , Diebold was forced to admit in August that their GEMS central tabulator system , used with both DRE and paper - based optical - systems in 34 states this year , routinely drops thousands of votes without notifying system administrators .
Our complete special coverage page on DRE Failures 2008 ( General Election Version ) , including what you can do about it , if it happens to you , is right here ...
VR 's press release , issued today , calling for the immediate removal from service and impounding of such machines , is both posted here , and follows in full below ...
Voting Machines Flipping Votes At Many Early Voting Sites :
Where Are The Election Protection Attorneys ?
Non-Profit Election Watchdog Demands Failed Machines
Be Removed from Service , Impounded Velvet Revolution ( " VR " ) , a non-profit dedicated to fair , honest , accurate and transparent elections , today called for elections officials in all states to immediately impound any voting machine that has flipped votes from one candidate to another .
It has been widely reported in the media over the past week of early voting that Direct Recording Election ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting machines made by ES&S , Diebold , Sequoia and Hart InterCivic have been flipping votes , predominantly from Democratic candidates to Republican candidates , but in some reported cases , just the opposite .
( See : https://bradblog.com/?page_id=6577).
These vote flips were first reported in West Virginia and the elections official there quickly ordered the recalibration of some machines , but video has shown that recalibration does not correct the problem and the flips continue .
( See : http://www.velvetrevolut...vote_captures_video.html)
Vote flipping has also now reported to have occurred in Texas , Tennessee , Missouri , Nevada , Colorado , Georgia and elsewhere .
" Machines that flip votes should never be recalibrated , " said Brad Friedman , co-founder of Velvet Revolution .
" Accessing these election - ready machines in this way , when they are most vulnerable to malicious software and manipulation , is wholly inappropriate .
It is outrageous that election officials have ordered such action .
Instead , failing machines must be immediately removed from service , impounded for later inspection , and voters should be given paper ballots to assure their vote may be counted accurately . "
VR also demands that the legal teams associated with the candidates step up and take immediate legal action to quarantine these faulty voting machines .
The Obama campaign has made much of the fact that it has thousands of lawyers on the ground to ensure that this election is fair and everyone 's vote is counted .
" Unfortunately , these lawyers , the lawyers for McCain and the lawyers for the DNC and RNC are AWOL and asleep at the wheel , " continued Friedman .
" We insist that they keep their promise to the voters by demanding that these machines be taken out of service immediately .
We should not have to wait until after the election for a candidate to sue because voters were not allowed to properly register their votes . "

Remember the bewildering story of the smashed Honda Civic with an " AIDS note " in San Francisco ?
Turns out it was true .
But there 's more .
Check out the back story and new pictures below .
To update you on the original story of the note claiming an AIDS - infected suicide jumper , let 's start with the car owners .
Seems the car is owned by couple Mark and Lina who have had one hell of a couple months , starting with the Honda getting broken into in September , a motorcycle getting stolen in October , the Civic getting crushed by a suicidal , drunken AIDS - infected naked guy and insurance covering none of it .
The whole terrible story , along with the timeline are below the gallery .
Mark and Lina 's Story – A Bad Couple of Months
Timeline :
September 13 , 2008 : Mark 's Honda Civic get broken into in Hayes Valley , San Francisco , and the same weekend , two upstairs apartment units get broken into through an open window .
October 10 , 2008 : Mark 's Triumph motorcycle gets stolen from Hayes and Buchanan .
October 24 , 2008 : License plates from said Triumph are recovered in Tenderloin , San Francisco by SFPD .
Both the in the car pulled over by SFPD are on parole for auto theft and get arrested for possessing stolen motorcycle plates .
November 14 , 2008 : Mark 's Honda Civic gets crushed by a guy attempting suicide by jumping off the top of their building .
December 3 , 2008 : Triumph motorcycle is found by CHP in Hayward , completely trashed , being held together by bungee cords and is totally unsalvageable .
Lina 's statement :
" We 'd had a couple of stressful months relative to cars and motorcycles , with the break - in of our car , the break - ins in our apartment building , and then Mark 's bike being stolen .
Needless to say when we walked to our car to drive to a friend 's birthday dinner on Saturday the 14th , we thought someone was playing a joke on us .
When we walked up , there was glass so far away from the car , we thought ‘ Oh my God , did someone break into our car again ?
For what !?
The stereo's already gone !'
Getting closer , it looked like just a lot of glass .
When we got to the car , we realized it was n't just a break - in – then we saw the hood and the now infamous note from our neighbor .
We stood there in shock for a few minutes , and then a couple came out of 600 Fell St. and said ‘ Holy crap dude , is this your car ? "
We just sort of nodded in silence .
The tenant went on to tell us what happened :
The man on the 6th floor who jumped , and yes , who has AIDS , was not altogether sober , and this was n't the first time he 'd attempted suicide .
He had jumped off his 6th floor balcony ( about 80 feet up ) and went through the electrical wires , spraying sparks everywhere , and then landed on our car .
The wires broke his initial fall , and then of course he hit the hood .
And yes , he was naked .
Supposedly , he got off the car by himself and pulled himself to the curb , then passed out .
The last news we heard was that he 's in an induced coma .
So , about the notes : there were two on our car when we got there , one which was a police report with an incident number – I filled out the report and sent it in but have n't heard back yet – and the other , hand - written one , was from our building manager .
The car was left on the street from Saturday , when we found it , until Monday morning , when it was towed .
We had the car towed , got some estimates to fix it and of course the damage was way more than the value of the car .
We talked to our insurance company , which would n't cover anything .
My husband did n't have theft insurance on the motorcycle to boot , so we 're basically S.O.L .
We ended up calling our local news - talk radio station , KGO - AM , to speak with their on - air lawyer Len Tillem about our legal options .
He said that Mark was out of luck unless our insurance covered people falling out of the sky ( or something to that effect ) , that the building can't be held liable and that our insurance policy does n't cover it .
The guy who jumped , no one has been able to figure out whether he 's got insurance coverage , and he's in a medically - induced coma with no family around .
To add insult to injury , when the CHP found the motorcyle , it was towed to a scrap yard in Hayward .
It was a total wreck – looked like it had been dropped on either side , parts missing and other parts being held together by bungee cords , so obviously driving was out of the question , as was repairing it .
So , we made the decision just to let it go .
The real clincher was that we had to pay $ 370 for the towing fee , storage fee and disposal fee .
It 'd have been better for us if CHP just had n't found it !
So , that 's our story for all the people who 've wanted some answers .
We certainly feel terrible for the person who jumped off of their balcony , and all things considered , we 're blessed in our lives .
Here 's hoping that Hayes Valley becomes more secure .
We love the area , but the last couple of months have been trying to say the least !
Anthony successfully navigated the obstacle course of buying an HDTV — turning down bogus pricey add - ons .
But then Sears called him at home , imploring him to buy a warranty because plasma TVs need to be recharged .
WTF ?

A few days after Anthony bought his plasma HDTV and turned down Sears ' $ 300/ 3 year protection plan , a rep called him at home and asked why he chose plasma over LCD .
He told her it was because the TV was cheap .
Advertisement
The rep proceeded to fill his ears with enough BS to power an entire alternative energy economy : Plasmas , she said , needed to be " recharged " every five years , at a cost of $ 500 a pop , so you should buy our three - year warranty .
Compete , utter crap .
Not to mention , that three - year warranty would be , um , expired by then .
My guess is that since he gave a non-technical answer ( " it was cheap " vs. " plasmas have better blacks " ) the rep decided to play on his lack of technical knowledge to try to make the sale .
Thankfully ,
Anthony realized that three is less than five and backed out , though he had to look on the internet to verify that what she told him was a lie .
Always do your homework before you go to the store , because some , though not all , of these people are very much out to screw you .

The draft still wo n’t blow away

Thursday , Jan 15th , 2009
Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) has said that he will most likely reintroduce legislation to reinstate the universal military draft this year .
Asked if he plans to introduce the legislation again in 2009 , Rangel last week said , “ Probably … yes .
I do n’t want to do anything this early to distract from the issue of the economic stimulus . ” according to an article featured in The Hill yesterday .
Rangel will therefore once again push the idea that everyone in America should be forced by law to work for the government for at least two years , either for no pay or for minimal pay .
Rangel last introduced the bill in 2006 immediately after the Democrats won control of Congress .
The bill attracted virtually no support and was passed off as merely a “ political statement ” regarding the Iraq war by leading Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi .
However , Rangel has previously lauded the reality of a military draft , saying that it would bolster U.S. troop levels insufficient to cover potential future action in Iran , North Korea and Iraq .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( Article continues below )
Rangel has consistently pushed for legislation on conscription in the past .
In 2003 , he proposed a measure covering people age 18 to 26 .
This year , he offered a plan to mandate military service for men and women between age 18 and 42 ; it went nowhere in the Republican - led Congress .
We have previously pointed out how Rangel ’s insistent efforts to keep this issue in the body politic is allied to an underlying framework that provides for a rapid and extensive implementation of conscription , be it on the continent or within the 4th Reich of America in the form of Homeland Security Gestapo squads .
The issue came to the fore recently with newly discovered details regarding Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama ’s plans for compulsory community service and a “ national civilian security force ” .

Nintendo Co's
Wii game console is displayed at an electronic shop in Tokyo's Akihabara district January 24 , 2008 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Nintendo Co Ltd ’s
Wii has emerged as one of the few hot products this holiday season , and Wal - Mart Stores Inc will offer “ tens of thousands ” of the hard - to - get video game consoles on its website starting on Monday .
Walmart.com said it will offer the Nintendo Wii console for $ 249.24 , and a “ value bundle , ” which includes the console and other items like an extra set of controllers , for $ 329 , while supplies last .
The Wii has emerged as one of the most sought - after gifts this holiday season , which has otherwise been lamented for a lack of new and hot products .
On Black Friday , the day after Thanksgiving which marks the start of holiday shopping , the Wii was the most searched - for product on the Yahoo Shopping site .
It was also the most popular product on eBay , with 3,171 of the consoles selling for an average price of $ 349 that day .
As of Friday night , the Wii console was sold out on Walmart.com , bestbuy.com and circuitcity.com .
Bestbuy.com listed the sold - out Wii for $ 249.99 .
Walmart.com also said that it will offer , beginning on Monday , certain Wii video games at a price of two for $ 30 , and certain accessories , like the Nintendo Wii Racing Wheel , starting under $ 10 .
Wal - Mart has been gaining market share and clout in the U.S. recession as cash - strapped shoppers seek out its low prices .
On Thursday , it reported a stronger - than - expected 3.4 percent rise in sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year , after it slashed prices on food and toys to lure shoppers .
Walmart.com spokesman Ravi Jariwala said the online retailer has worked with Nintendo closely throughout the year and seen strong sales of Wii products on its website , helping to secure the latest supply of the popular console .
Despite collapsing oil prices in recent months , Exxon Mobil , the world ’s largest publicly traded oil company , still managed to set a record for last year as the most profitable American corporation ever .
Exxon earned $ 45.2 billion in 2008 , beating the record it set in 2007 for most profitable corporation , at $ 40.6 billion .
That came despite a fourth quarter in which income fell 33 percent , owing to the steepest drop ever in oil prices , as the economy went into a tailspin .
After riding a tide of swelling earnings in recent years , the once high - flying oil sector is scrambling to adjust to a sharp downturn .
Oil consumption is falling in all major developed nations as economies shrink and consumers cut back on spending .
As a result , oil prices have dropped more than 70 percent since peaking above $ 145 a barrel in July .
On Friday , they traded at about $ 42 a barrel .

With smartphones successfully commandeering the spotlight from their less capable predecessors this year , AT&T has decided to get serious about bringing some standards to the market .
Competition is heating up , and consumers are demanding more powerful phones with capabilities that extend far beyond the box they ship in .
To help fill demand , AT&T is planning to to standardize low - end devices on a single mobile OS and roll out a line of branded smartphones .
AT&T believes that smartphones will become the majority of devices that connect to its network by 2014 , and it 's probably right .
The smartphone market is seeing strong growth ( though slightly slower this quarter ) , thanks to new efforts like Google 's Android OS and renewed competition from BlackBerry maker RIM .
Apple 's $ 200 and $ 300 iPhones have seen remarkable success , too , recently knocking Motorola 's RAZR from its perch as the best - selling phone in the US ( despite the RAZR 's long - time status as a " free - with - contract " phone ) .
But to avoid running smartphones aground in the same barren , incompatible development landscape that the current dumbphone is stifled by , AT&T wants to gets its OS ducks in a row .
Speaking at the Symbian Partner Event in San Francisco , Roger Smith , director of next generation services , data product realization at AT&T , told an audience that Symbian is " a very credible and likely candidate " for a new line of AT&T - branded smartphones , according to Yahoo News .
While AT&T has every intention of carrying the same smartphones like BlackBerry , iPhone , and Windows Mobile devices it does now , the company wants to simplify its support structure while simultaneously offering devices powered by more standardized and extensible platforms .
Seth Bloom , an AT&T spokesperson , confirmed to Ars Technica that the company " has no plans to standardize on one platform for our smart devices .
But we have said that we see potential benefit in standardizing our low - end devices on a single mobile OS , though we have not finalized our plans to do so . "
AT&T 's announcement is perfectly timed , due to Nokia 's finalized acquisition of the Symbian platform .
Symbian has been used for some time on a variety of popular international phones , including Nokia 's own S60 line and phones from Sony Ericsson .
With this acquisition of the entire platform , though , Nokia plans to open source Symbian , making it a much more service - agnostic choice for AT&T versus Android , Google 's open source mobile phone OS .
Android had developmental help from a variety of hardware manufacturers like Samsung , HTC , and LG , and already offers advanced functionality like the application marketplace .
But Google 's OS has been criticized by some carriers and manufacturers as being too Google - centric , tying too closely into services like Gmail and Google contact syncing .
Symbian probably wo n't be AT&T 's only choice for branded smartphones , though .
" We want to give our wireless customers maximum choice – in innovative devices , applications , operating systems , and more .
One way to maximize customer choice , " Bloom continued , " is to begin to reduce fragmentation in the wireless OS environment .
That is why we are a member of the Symbian Foundation .
That fragmentation puts a heavy burden on wireless carriers , handset makers , and especially apps developers , who have to create for multiple operating systems and sometimes for multiple versions of the same operating system . "
AT&T has not yet announced who would be building its branded phones or how soon any of this brave new standardized world will materialize , but HTC is a likely option among brand - able manufacturers .
The carrier is definitely aiming for using open platforms , though , and has high hopes for the potential that standardized phones can provide for revenue and third - party developers .
Applications will be easier to develop , and AT&T sees a bright future for mobile data services that could even " out - value " the web by harnessing location - based features and advertising .
Instead of trying to wring out more revenue from subscribers during an economic downturn , new applications could facilitate online banking or shopping , with advertising and transaction fees being a source of pie-sliced revenue for all parties involved .
The carrier 's moves to offer a branded line of powerful , extensible smartphones and standardize its low - end devices will likely have repercussions throughout the industry .
Entrenched manufacturers like Motorola and Nokia are scrambling to catch up and compete in the new smartphone market , and if other manufacturers have not already reassessed their software strategies , now is a great time .
Perhaps most importantly from a consumer perspective , multiple strong mobile OS platforms will result in better choices all around .
This gets a 10 for creepy and a 10 for clever .
The creepy part
This is a 240 pencil set made from the carbon of a cremated human .
Each pencil is foil stamped with the name of the deceased .
The clever part
Only one pencil can be removed at a time .
You sharpen the pencil by putting it back in the box .
The shavings then occupy the space of the used pencils .
Over time the pencil box fills with sharpenings — turning the box into a new urn ( it ’s filled with the shavings which are made from the cremation ) .

Sarah Palin Doodles vs. Barack Obama Doodles ( Photos and Video )
Sarah Palin 's doodles , which were scribbled in 1996 when she was running for mayor of Wasilla , and President - elect Barack Obama 's doodles , which were purchased on an Ebay auction in May , 2007 , for $ 2075 , have been analyzed by a graphologist .
And what did the handwriting expert have to say ?
According to graphologist Sheila Kurtz , the Obama doodle shows he is " economical , clear and to the point , " while Palin 's doodle indicates she is " smart , but scattered and all over the place . "
The Palin doodles , a mish mash of campaign slogans written on the back of a budget document , were discovered in a box of odds and ends saved by former colleague and campaign manager Laura Chase .
The Obama doodle depicts Senators Charles Schumer , Harry Reid , Dianne Feinstein and Edward Kennedy .
View Palin and Obama doodle analysis video below .
And in what may prove to be the biggest stimulus - package hurdle of all , news reports suggest that Team Obama is contemplating as much as $ 2 trillion in TARP additions to rescue the banking system in one form or another .
That would be $ 2 trillion on top of the nearly $ 1 trillion stimulus package .
Government spending , deficits , and debt creation of this magnitude is simply unheard of .
So the added TARP money will surely imperil the entire stimulus package as taxpayers around the country begin to digest the enormity of these proposed government actions .
Financing of this type would not only destroy the U.S. fiscal position for years to come , it could destroy the dollar in the process .
What ’s more , the likelihood of massive tax increases -- which at some point will become front and center in this gargantuan funding operation -- would doom the economy for decades .
By the way , Scott Rasmussen ’s latest poll shows that already -- before the new TARP money is included -- public support for the humongous stimulus package has dropped to 42 percent .
It remains to be seen whether Republicans can in fact stop the stimulus package , but that certainly would be a very good idea .
The long - run financial consequences will certainly force higher future tax rates -- a prosperity killer feared by Arthur Laffer .
And while all the social spending gets baked into the long - run budget baseline , the short - run implications of the plan have little economic - growth potential .
Meanwhile , there ’s no shortage of alternative tax proposals that would truly re-ignite the economy .
Former Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush economist Larry Lindsey criticized the Democrat package in Wednesday morning ’s Wall Street Journal , describing it as " heavily weighted toward direct government spending , transfers to state and local governments , and tax changes that have virtually no effect on marginal tax rates . "
Instead , Lindsey proposes a big payroll tax cut that would slice three points off the rate for both employer and employee .
Rush Limbaugh also made an appearance in the Journal .
He has a clever idea to give Obama 54 percent of the $ 900 billion package -- equating that amount to the new president ’s electoral majority -- while 46 percent , which was John McCain ’s electoral tally , would go to a plan that would halve the U.S. corporate tax rate and provide a capital - gains tax holiday for one year , after which the investment tax would drop to 10 percent .
It was Sen. John McCain on Fox News last Sunday who started the stimulus revolt when he said he could n’t support the package and called for less spending along with a large corporate tax cut .
Over in the House , Republican leaders John Boehner and Eric Cantor have successfully launched an opposition drumbeat by attacking congressional Democrats rather than directly hitting President Obama .
Now all eyes will turn to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell to see if he can keep up this drumbeat .
Will commonsense Americans really support a massive overdose of government run amok ?
I seriously doubt it .
This whole story has to be completely rethought .
University of Oxford astrophysicists suggest that the widely accepted theory regarding the existence of dark energy and its role in the accelerated expansion of the universe is wrong .
The alternative explanation they propose puts us in a special place in the universe ; at the center of a void with very low matter density , in direct contradiction of the Copernican Principle .
Supernovae studies should be able to settle the matter .
Portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus
One of the main tenets of cosmology holds that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ; i.e. uniform , with no preferred direction .
This is a rephrasing of the Copernican Principle which postulates that we are not located in a special place in the universe , and in fact that no place in it is special .
Another fundamental assumption is made in regard to the dynamics of the universe , as described by Einstein in his set of equations .
When supernovae data was analyzed in 1998 , two teams of scientists each independently reached the conclusion that the universe ’s expansion is accelerated .
This conclusion was based on the two paradigms previously described .
This acceleration was explained with the existence of a gravitationally repulsive substance , dubbed “ dark energy . ”
Though this substance has yet to be detected , it is widely accepted that it is in fact the cause of the acceleration , and has been incorporated into the standard cosmological model .
If one were to reject the notion of dark energy , the two principles would be subject to question .
This is precisely what three physicists at the University of Oxford are suggesting .
If the Copernican Principle is disregarded and if we are located at the center of a spherical void , the accelerated expansion can be explained without introducing dark energy .
If we are in fact located in such a place , we should be able to detect this by observational methods such as supernovae analysis .
The Oxford team performed such analyses .
Their results are inconclusive , and while they lean lightly in favor of dark energy , they are far from definite .
Additional data is needed , encompassing more supernovae and reaching deeper into space .
Several projects that will yield such data are taking place or are being planned currently .
They will have to be studied carefully and perhaps will be able to determine if the dark energy model is wrong or if we should stick to it a while longer .
Washington
BARACK OBAMA has two attractive ideas for improving post - secondary education  expanding the use of community colleges and tuition tax credits  but he needs to hitch them to a broader platform .
As president , Mr. Obama should use his bully pulpit to undermine the bachelor ’s degree as a job qualification .
Here ’s a suggested battle cry , to be repeated in every speech on the subject : “ It ’s what you can do that should count when you apply for a job , not where you learned to do it . ”
The residential college leading to a bachelor ’s degree at the end of four years works fine for the children of parents who have plenty of money .
It works fine for top students from all backgrounds who are drawn toward academics .
But most 18 - year - olds are not from families with plenty of money , not top students , and not drawn toward academics .
They want to learn how to get a satisfying job that also pays well .
That almost always means education beyond high school , but it need not mean four years on a campus , nor cost a small fortune .
It need not mean getting a bachelor ’s degree .
I am not discounting the merits of a liberal education .
Students at every level should be encouraged to explore subjects that will not be part of their vocation .
It would be even better if more colleges required a rigorous core curriculum for students who seek a traditional bachelor ’s degree .
My beef is not with liberal education , but with the use of the degree as a job qualification .
For most of the nation ’s youths , making the bachelor ’s degree a job qualification means demanding a credential that is beyond their reach .
It is a truth that politicians and educators cannot bring themselves to say out loud :
A large majority of young people do not have the intellectual ability to do genuine college - level work .
Radeon HD 4870 X2 And GeForce 9800 GX2 Compared
In the last direct comparison , the high - end dual - chip models from AMD and Nvidia meet to do battle .
The duel is somewhat unfair because the GeForce 9800 GX2 is no longer more than upper - middle class .
A ( non-existent ) GTX 260 GX2 or GTX 280 GX2 would be the right competitor .
But there is no need for the 9800 GX2 to hide .
With the overclocked quad - core CPU as a base , the Nvidia card demonstrates extremely good performance , and AMD ’s dual - chip response really has to fight .
You might not want to believe it , but it ’s true — the weaker graphics chip of the GeForce 9800 GX2 seems to stress the CPU less , which pushes the frame rate up tremendously .

For all the media reports about a surge in " green jobs , " one place we wo n't likely be seeing them is in the media itself .
The past few weeks and months have been devastating for environmental journalism .
Just after Thanksgiving , Fortune magazine gave layoff notices to Marc Gunther , one of the leading business writers on corporate environmental practices ( whose blogs also appear on GreenBiz.com ) , along with Todd Woody , whose coverage of clean technology has led the pack .
( Gunther has been asked to stick around as a " contributing writer " and again chair next year 's Brainstorm : Green event . )
Over at CNN — which has been pushing hard its new Planet in Peril series -- the network 's entire seven - person environmental team , including stalwarts like veteran anchor Miles O'Brien and pioneering producer Peter Dykstra , was let go .
Even the Weather Channel , which has been hyping its climate change program , Forecast Earth , extinguished the Environmental Unit that produced it .
( It did this , by the way , while turning its normally blue logo green as part of NBC's Green Is Universal promotion . )
It goes on .
In recent months some of the better journalists covering the environment have taken buy - out packages offered by their financially beleaguered employers : Claudia Deutsch at the New York Times , Marla Cone and Janet Wilson at the Los Angeles Times , Ilana Debare at the San Francisco Chronicle , and others .
What 's going on here ?
For starters , the mainstream media business has been tanking along with the rest of the economy .
With ad sales and consumer spending down , bloggers and other so - called " new media " providing low - priced competition , and general panic on Wall Street devaluing media stocks , business reporters are finding themselves a part of the same economic meltdown they 're covering .
Like so many industries , the media business is in the throes of a transformation , with yesterday 's leaders becoming -- well , fish wrap .
But it 's more than that .
Corporate environmental topics have long had a volatile existence within most mainstream media companies .
For years , few newspapers , TV networks , and business magazines would touch stories about companies improving their environmental performance , or at best were ambivalent about them , even when such stories were substantive .
And when these stories were covered , they often were positioned as precious , offbeat stories , novel corporate antics , or shallow efforts to ward off activist or consumer protests .
While some of that may have been accurate -- a lot of companies have done the minimum needed to " green up " their image -- countless stories of companies ' efforts to systematically wring out waste , pollution , and inefficiency , and improve business performance along the way , were dismissed as unworthy of coverage .
When I launched a monthly newsletter , The Green Business Letter , in 1991 , I was one of only a handful of writers covering these topics .
In the mid 1990s , I had the opportunity to lead a panel at the annual conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists , a professional organization .
At the panel -- the group 's first ever on business reporting -- I posed a question couched in the classic terms of " Man bites dog . "
As Wikipedia explains : " The phrase Man bites dog and the related phrase Dog bites man are used to describe a phenomenon in journalism , in which an unusual , infrequent event is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary , everyday occurrence . "
So , I asked my SEJ colleagues , if the headline " Company Pollutes " represented the " Dog bites man " story -- that is , an ordinary , everyday occurrence -- should n't " Company Innovates , Reduces Risks and Improves Environment " be seen as its " Man bites dog " counterpart -- in other words , News ?
My panelists agreed that it should be , but the reality was that reporters were n't typically lauded for telling good - news corporate stories .
Their reward system was based on slaying dragons -- that is , bringing big , powerful entities to their knees .
Things have changed somewhat since then -- stories of proactive corporate environmental initiatives are now regular media fare -- but as I 've noted earlier this year , mainstream business writers still seem ill - informed and overly cynical about company efforts to be greener .
Like the preponderance of their readers , editors and reporters seem to start with the assumption that most environmental activities undertaken by companies , especially large companies , are done primarily for P.R. reasons .
True , healthy skepticism is the currency of a good journalist , but undying cynicism is more the norm when it comes to environmental business reporting .
The recent spate of downsizings of writers , editors , and producers covering environmental issues will only exacerbate this , relegating green business coverage to reporters with less knowledge , context , and historical perspective on the transformation taking place in business .
I hear from such reporters every week : general - assignment reporters from newspapers and broadcast stations around the U.S. , niche trade magazines , and others seeking comment or context on a story they 're covering .
I can tell you unequivocally that the nature of their questions reveals a high degree of ignorance .
I 'm happy to bring them up to speed , but it 's a slog .
The timing of the recent media layoffs is all the more troublesome given everything that 's about to happen : a new administration and Congress with a big appetite for environmental regulation , green jobs , renewable energy , and carbon management -- with the potential of countless billions of dollars , and millions more in lobbying , devoted to such efforts .
The automotive industry -- bailout or not -- is undergoing a revolution , a phase - out of the hundred - year - old gas - powered internal combustion engine in favor of electricity - powered ones -- creating the need for a new , smarter energy grid that will have vast ripple effects throughout the economy .
Wal - Mart and other large players are driving their suppliers harder than ever before to reduce packaging , improve energy efficiency , and eliminate toxic ingredients in their products .
The construction industry is undergoing a green revolution .
Food growers and producers are seeing the beginning of an antiglobalization backlash , and a relocalization of some farming and food processing .
It goes on from there .
Who will be there to cover it all ?
Who will bring the deep knowledge and big- picture perspective necessary to create informed stories , not just sound - bite " content . "
Will the less - experienced reporters and editors be overly enthusiastic or hopelessly cynical ?
Yes , of course , there are niche publications covering green business ( including , of course , GreenBiz.com and its constellation of sites , of which I am executive editor ) .
And there remain several strong ( for now ) environmental reporting teams at the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , BusinessWeek , Fast Company , and a handful of other mainstream media .
But even on their best days , their combined reach includes only a small fraction of the audience -- business people , activists , regulators , policymakers , investors , business students , and others -- that need to understand the trends and developments in the greening of mainstream business .
As we enter a new year , a new political era , and , arguably , a new environmental ethic , we 'll need a more informed society than ever before .
We 'll see how it goes .
Today , I heard an astonishing story while moderating a panel discussion at the Vancouver Public Library on media democracy .
A member of the panel , Linda Solomon , claimed that she " got serious " about the Vancouver Observer , an on - line publication , as a result of an odd exchange with the editor - in - chief of the Vancouver Sun .
Solomon is an experienced U.S. journalist who has written for the Los Angeles Times and the International Herald Tribune , among other publications .
She moved to Vancouver two years ago , and later decided to submit a commentary to the metropolitan daily paper dealing with Cambie Street .
Solomon told the audience that she later saw a lead editorial in the same paper that resembled her piece .
She conveyed her objections to the Vancouver Sun , and subsequently received an angry call from the editor - in - chief ( Patricia Graham ) .
According to Solomon , the Vancouver Sun 's editor - in - chief demanded an apology .
Solomon said she was concerned about being sued , and emphasized that she did say she was sorry .
" They did not plagiarize , " Solomon assured the audience at the Vancouver Public Library .
Solomon alleged that she was then told that she will never write for CanWest , which owns the Vancouver Sun , the Province , the National Post , the Vancouver Courier , the North Shore News , and scores of other publications across the country .
" That 's when I got serious about the Vancouver Observer , " Solomon said .

Ever since the early 1970s , whenever downstate Assemblymen rattled sabers and proposed radical anti-gun or anti-hunting legislation , we could count on the conservative Senate Republican majority to block it .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
That was then .
The scene changed dramatically on Nov. 4 .
Now the outrageous stuff coming out of the Assembly has some credence on the other side of the aisle .
The Democrats — and that means the New York City mentality — have the majority in both houses .
Except for four swing votes , they have pretty much carte blanche .
That ’s why the fact that the Assembly has bought into a national crusade known as the Ammunition Accountability
Act is suddenly a legitimate threat .
New York , Pennsylvania and 16 other states have already enacted legislation that would mandate the engraving of a unique serial number on the base of each handgun and “ assault weapon ” bullet , and an identical number on the cartridge ’s case .
The act calls for dealers of this “ encoded ammunition ” to record the purchaser ’s name , birthdate , drivers license number , etc .
All non-encoded ammunition must be disposed of prior to Jan. 1 , 2011 .
The database and other expenses involved would be paid for by a special tax of a half - cent per round of ammunition sold .

Is anyone surprised that a rescue package will eventually be implemented for the US Auto industry ?
What is the alternative ?
Millions unemployed now !
This will be another futile exercise of throwing good money after bad .
The US auto industry is hemorrhaging from everywhere ; they burn through cash like cheap Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœoilÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Management and Unions continue to be a drag on the industry , so why postpone the inevitable again !!
The US $ is mixed in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 8 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœvolatileÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Global fundamentals remain weak as investors continue to liquidate their holdings and seek risk adverse opportunities .
The quarter from hell continues its one dimensional direction and offering little hope to equity investors in the short term .
Yesterdays US unemployment claims surged by +27 k to 542 k , w/w , printing the highest level since 1992 .
The total number of people staying on benefits from the previous week rose to the most since Dec. 1982 .
The Philly Fed index faired no better , falling to a 19 - year low this month .
This suggests that the ISM manufacturing index could fall even further after hitting a 26 - year low last month .
Digging deeper , the worrisome aspect of the report is that we are now seeing a decline in prices .
The report showed a shift in prices paid and prices received from last month , from positive single digits to negative double - digit territory , suggesting that the manufacturing sector is finally seeing prices decline .
Prices Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœpaidÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ fell from +7.2 in Oct. to - 30.7 in Nov. while prices Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœreceivedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ dropped from +5.3 to - 15.5 as manufacturers are being forced to lower prices in the face of weaker demand .
With that new orders dropped to - 31.4 while shipments remained at - 18.8 , both remaining in contraction territory .
Inventories also continued to fall while the employment component deteriorated further to - 25.2 , along with the average workweek , suggesting we will see another decline in manufacturing employment in Nov. ( this will not surprise anyone ) .
Looking ahead 6 - months , the general business activity index fell to - 10.4 as the economic outlook remains bleak .
New orders and shipments are also expected to continue to contract , along with employees , average workweek and inventories .
It seems that pink slips will be the order of the day .
SNB delivered their second rate cut this month , following the Nov 6th 50 bps move .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 100 bp ease was taken on the basis of a more favorable outlook for inflation .
Falling oil and raw material prices imply that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœprice stability will be restored sooner than expected , and inflation is likely to fall below 2 % as early as the end of this yearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Moreover , Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœinternational economic conditions have worsened appreciably bringing a higher risk of a marked slowdown in SwitzerlandÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Earlier this month the SNB said that growth Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcould be negative next yearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Their next official meeting is scheduled for Dec. 11th .
Given the bank ’s aggressive response to the deteriorating economic scenario , another easing move could be expected .
With respect to the Fed , some analysts are calling for benchmark borrowing cost to hit 0 % by Feb .

The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD + 1.18 % and AUD + 2.49 % .
Risk aversion trading strategies and weak commodity prices continue to impede any advance for the loonie at the moment .
The currency remains under pressure as commodities come under assault as the reality of a deeper recession takes hold .
The loonie this quarter alone has lost 17 % to its southern neighbor as investors seek sanctuary in the greenback .
The black stuff accounts for approximately 10 % of all of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s export revenues .
Mathematically and technically the loonie has further to fall .

Traders have priced in another 50 bp ease next month , this will push borrowing costs below the psychological 2 % mark as further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the banks 2 % inflation target over the medium term ( 2.25 % ) .
Traders continue to be better buyers of USDÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s on pullbacks .
The AUD $ is heading for another weekly loss vs. the USD as global equities slump to a decade low , convincing investors to sell higher yielding assets .
In the O/N session , the RBA intervened in the market and purchased its own currency as it approached a five - year low against the greenback ( 0.6010 ) .
For now traders continue to be better sellers on rallies ( 0.6265 ) .
Crude is higher O/N ( $ 50.20 up +78 c ) .
Crude prices managed to fall below $ 50 a barrel yesterday , the first time in 24 - months on the back of a deepening global recession that is expected to reduce global energy demand further .
Even analysts that were bullish less than two months ago ( 2009 target of $ 150 a barrel ) have aggressively revised next years targets to $ 80 .
Already oil has lost close to $ 100 from its record high prints witnessed at the beginning of the summer .
Crudes continuing slide will add to concern that the global economy faces deflation , threatening investment in oil and gas production projects around the world .
Technically we overshot prices on the way up ( Chinese Olympics ) and we will definitely overshoot on the way down ( some analysts are looking for $ 40 a barrel 1st Q 2009 ) .
Fear is destroying future demand at the moment .
This weeks IEA report showed that inventories climbed more than forecasted as fuel demand dropped .
Stocks climbed + 1.6 m barrels to 313.5 m w/w vs. an expected jump of +1 m barrels .
Not surprising , US fuel demand over the past month has averaged + 19.1 m barrels a day , that is down - 7 % from a year ago ( where is the cold weather ) .
This is obviously worrying times for OPEC , technically the market is hell bent on a sub $ 50 print on the back of deterioration in demand and negative consumer confidence in the global economy ( to date , OPEC has lost $ 700 b in revenue from falling prices ) .
Gas inventories rose +539 k barrels to 198.6 m w/w. Yesterdays US fundamental data has done little to support the black stuff .
Speculation that the recession will further curb demand will help send prices lower .
To date , crude prices are down 65 % from their summer highs and down 45 % y/y .
This scenario will back OPEC further into a corner .
They have already cut production quotas last month , and every time they cut production they are building up spare capacity .
Similar to the last cut , there is also a risk that they may make further cuts ( rumored for next month ) and prices still will not rebound .
The erosion of future demand continues to be a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbigÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ question mark for global economies .
Gold has advanced as traders speculate that the Fed will lower interest rates soon to stimulate the economy , thus boosting the appeal of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative investment ( $ 758 ) .
The Nikkei closed 7,910 up +207 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,287 up +67 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,941 up +66 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 17 bp yesterday ( 3.08 % ) and backed up 10 bp O/N as global equities rallied ( 3.18 % ) .
Treasury yields managed to print record lows , forcing 2 - year notes below the 1 % mark for the first time as investors pared equity positions and sought the sanctuary of Government debt .
Traders once again raised their bets that Bernanke and Co. will cut interest rates next month to boost the US economy ( 1.00 % ) .
After the SNB actions yesterday there must be a strong possibility that the Fed will go inter-meeting with 2 - year notes trading at theses levels .

Something I ’ve noticed over the years is the number of players displaying dreadlocks or long curls out from underneath the helmet .
So long is the hair that it covers their names most of the time and even sometimes , the top of their numbers .
Some players claim it makes them tougher , some even go as far - fetched as to say it teaches them patience .
After all , it takes FOREVER to grow out your locks .
Others , like Troy Polamalu on the left , do it to pay homage to his Samoan Heritage .
My claim as to why players grow out their hair ?
It ’s to make it easier for others to tackle them by - so rule # 1 of Tackling 101 is to GRAB THEM DREADLOCKS !
Some NFL names that have or had stylish dreadlocks on the battlefield ?
How about Dolphins ’ Ricky Williams , Steelers ’ Troy Polamalu , Cowboys ’ Adam “ Pac - Man ” Jones , Titans ’ Reynaldo Hill , Redskins ’ Chris Horton , etc .
Notice how the names I mentioned play DEFENSE .
Some pot -smoking offense idiots out there , like Ricky Williams , are too smart to understand they are actually hurting their offensive capabilities by giving tacklers an easy way to pull them down by .
Just ask Titans LB , Keith Bulluck ,
“ If I see a guy running with the ball and he has long hair , I ’ll tackle him by it , sure . ”
Bulluck who sported an Afro in his college days continued on to say ,
“ If a guy wants to wear it that long , he can be tackled by it .
I ’ll pull it on purpose . ”
Taking Bulluck ’s advice to heart was Louisville defender Travis Norton , a fellow dreadlock’r .
During Rutgers ’ Jourdan Brooks ’ 62 - yard run in the first half , Norton , who makes an outstanding effort to show he treats others the way he wants to be treated , stops Brooks from getting a touchdown by yanking him to the ground by his dreadlocks !
After Brooks trotted back to the sidelines , television cameras caught a strand of his dreadlock on the field .
“ I ’d have to say on a scale of one to 10 , an eight .
No , nine , ” Brooks said describing the pain of having one of his dreadlocks pulled out .
“ It hurt pretty bad .
I never felt any pain like that .
But I ’m alright . ”
You see , Brooks did n’t care about his dreadlock being yanked off because he got a nice SportsCenter moment that makes him a household name and a butt of a few jokes for the time being .
Asked if he was upset about being tackled by his frolicking locks , Brooks responded “ I was upset that he tackled me , I wanted to score there . ”
Now that ’s the tough guy spirit !
See this classic dreadlock moment
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors shook an already embattled auto industry Friday as it reported a huge quarterly loss that was much worse than expected and warned it is in danger of running out of cash in the coming months .
The nation 's largest automaker reported that it lost $ 4.2 billion , or $ 7.35 a share , excluding special items .
That 's up from the loss $ 1.6 billion or $ 2.86 a share it reported a year earlier and was far worse than the forecast of analysts surveyed by earnings tracker Thomson Reuters , which had forecast a loss of $ 3.70 a share .
But the most shocking news came in its statements about its cash position .
GM said it had burned through $ 6.9 billion during the quarter and warned that it " will approach the minimum amount necessary to operate its business " during the current quarter .
In addition , the company said that in the first half of next year its " estimated liquidity will fall significantly short " of what it needs to continue operating .
It said the only thing that would save it would be a significant improvement in economic and automotive industry conditions , help from the federal government , better access to capital markets or some combination of those options .
The report was by far the most grim assessment by a company that has insisted it is not considering filing for bankruptcy court protection .
While the release did not mention the threat of bankruptcy , the outlook appeared to raise the possibility of such a dramatic step .
In response to questions on a conference call after the report , CEO Rick Wagoner said he would not speculate on whether GM would need to file for bankruptcy protections .
" We 're convinced the consequences of bankruptcy would be dire and extend far beyond General Motors , " Wagoner said .
" We need to find a way to get through this and that 's our focus . "
Shares of GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) fell 9 % Friday to $ 4.36 , a nearly 60 - year low .
Industry experts said the incredibly weak October U.S. auto sales that GM and the rest of the industry reported Monday , coupled with Friday 's report , mean that bankruptcy for GM is a very real risk .
" I think we should be worried [ about a bankruptcy ] right now , " said Robert Schulz , Standard & Poor 's senior auto credit analyst .
" We were worried before and the relative level of worry is now heightened . "
S&P cut GM 's credit rating deeper into junk bond status to a rating of CCC +
Friday afternoon , not far above the D rating that indicates default by a company .
Shelly Lombard , senior high yield analyst at Gimme Credit , an independent research firm , estimates that GM will need to get between $ 10 billion and $ 15 billion in federal assistance in order to avoid bankruptcy by 2010 and that the chance of bankruptcy without help is probably 80 % to 90 % .
" They did n't want to speak the B word .
It does n't sound like they have a lot of options if the government does n't step forward , " she said , adding that aid for the auto industry that has already been approved by Congress amounted to " bringing a Band - Aid to a train wreck . "
Both Schulz and Lombard also said that not even a federal bailout may be able to save either GM or Ford in the long - term considering the problems facing the industry .
" To the extent that they do receive some assistance , it 's more buying time rather than a fundamental solution , " said Schulz .
Still , experts agreed Congress will need to take swift action to make any difference for the embattled industry .
" This is not something that can go on and be dealt with in the next year , it needs to be dealt with in the next few weeks , " said Dave Cole , chairman of Michigan think - tank the Center for Automotive Research .
" When your cash is gone , you 're gone . "
One possible endgame scenario reported recently involved a corporate tie - up between GM and Chrysler .
Wagoner , without mentioning Chrysler by name , said that GM had ended talks about a possible merger with a Detroit rival to concentrate on the cash crisis it now faces .
" While it 's fair to say we conclude this acquisition could have provided significant benefits , we 've concluded at this particular time that it 's important we put 100 % of our efforts on the immediate liquidity challenges , " said Wagoner .
Chrysler issued a statement of its own after GM 's report .
CEO Robert Nardelli did n't comment about the merger talks but said Chrysler would keep looking at various options to end its ongoing losses .
" As an independent company , we will continue to explore multiple strategic alliances or partnerships as we investigate growth opportunities around the world that would aid in our return to profitability , " he said .
Seeking cash , cutting costs
GM announced a series of steps Friday designed to help it improve its cash reserves by $ 5 billion .
Those steps included cutting another 10 % of salaried employment costs , on top of the 20 % cut in those costs already planned .
In addition to expected staffing reductions , those white collar workers will not get their typical incentive pay next year .
The company will also cut capital spending plans by $ 2.4 billion in 2009 , pushing back development plans for some new models .
But it warned that even those steps would not be enough unless conditions improve .
It did not announce any plans for additional plant closings or hourly staff cuts in its statement , however .
The company is clearly pinning much of its hopes of weathering the current downturn on an industry bailout from Washington .
" The company has engaged in discussions with various U.S. federal government agencies and congressional leaders about the ... the need for immediate government funding support given the economic and credit crisis and its impact on the industry , including consumers , dealers , suppliers and manufacturers , " according to a company announcement .
Wagoner joined the chief executives of Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) , privately - held Chrysler LLC , as well as the president of the United Auto Workers union Thursday afternoon in meetings with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , to seek support for a wide - ranging bailout package .
Both congressional leaders voiced support for additional help for the sector following their meetings .
Among the topics discussed were a $ 25 billion loan to fund union - controlled trust funds that would be set up in the coming year to cover the health care costs of retirees and their family members .
Shifting about $ 100 billion of those costs from the automakers ' balance sheet to the trust funds was a key concession the companies won from the UAW in the 2007 labor deals .
The discussions also touched on whether the government would allow the automakers to tap the $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street firms and banks that was enacted last month .
Treasury has so far rejected auto industry inquiries about accessing that pool of money .
The automakers also renewed their pre-election request to double the $ 25 billion low - interest loan program approved by Congress to help automakers convert operations to make more fuel - efficient vehicles and meet the demands of car buyers and new federal rules .
But Wagoner said just doubling the money available under that program wo n't solve the immediate cash crisis facing the industry .
And for the first time , he put a dollar amount on the cash that automakers are looking for from the federal government right now .
" In the meeting yesterday we talked near - term liquidity support for the industry in the range of $ 25 billion , " he said .
" No one said yes or no to that number . "
Years of losses
The company 's problems have been building for many years .
It has not made money on its core North American auto operations since 2004 , and since that time it has run up $ 72 billion in net losses , including this latest period .
The company did see a one - time $ 1.7 billion gain from a change in accounting for its obligation to pay for health care for retirees and their family .
That allowed it to post a net loss of $ 2.5 billion , or $ 4.45 a share , an improvement from the net loss of $ 42.5 billion , or $ 75.12 a share a year ago when it was hit by huge special charges .
Much of the net losses in recent years have been due to non-cash charges , such as the ones a year ago .
But even excluding those kinds of special charges , GM 's core auto operations in North America have lost nearly $ 18 billion over the course of the last 15 quarters .
GM 's announcement came on the same day that Ford Motor reported a $ 3 billion loss in the period , excluding special items .
Even Japanese rival Toyota Motor ( TM ) , which has a much better cash position coming into this crisis , announced Thursday that its third quarter earnings had plunged nearly 70 % , as it slashed its full fiscal - year outlook by 50 % .
I ’ve had lots of requests for a Ruby version to follow up my Latent Semantic Analysis in Python article .
So I ’ve rewritten the code and article for Ruby .
I wrote LSA from scratch this time and test driven so it has some subtle differences from the Python version .
What is LSA ?
Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) is a mathematical method that tries to bring out latent relationships within a collection of documents .
Rather than looking at each document isolated from the others it looks at all the documents as a whole and the terms within them to identify relationships .
An example of LSA : Using a search engine search for “ ruby ” .
Documents are returned which do not contain the search term “ ruby ” but contains terms like “ rails ” .
LSA has identified a latent relationship , “ ruby ” is semantically close to “ rails ” .
How does it work ?
Given a set of word documents , each word in those documents represents a point in the semantic space .
LSA uses a mathematical technique called Singular value decomposition to take the documents / words represented as a matrix and produce a reduced approximation of this matrix .
In doing this it reduces the overall noise in the semantic space bringing words together .
Hence after applying LSA some words share similar points in the semantic space , they are semantically similar .
These groups of semantically similar words form concepts and those concepts in turn relate to documents .
Term a <----------->
Term b
<----------->
Concept d <--------->
Document e Term c
<----------->
Background Reading on LSA
There are some very good papers which describe LSA in detail :
An introduction to LSA : http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/dp1.LSAintro.pdf

LSA Algorithm
This is an implementation of LSA in Ruby ( v1.8.7 ) .
I made use of the linalg project which while not as mature as Python ’s SciPy it does the job .
Installing linalg can be rather challenging as it relies on LAPACK which in turn relies on some Fortran code .
1 Create the term - document matrix
We take a set of documents and map them to a vector space matrix .
Each column represents a document and each row represents a term .
Document n Document n+1 term n [ 1 0 ] term n+1 [ 0 1 ]
Read more about the Vector Space Model at Wikipedia .
We use the DMatrix class from Linalg to represent our term - document matrix .
This is like the Ruby standard library Matrix class but with some powerful matrix functions builtin .
2 tf-idf Transform
tf =>
Term frequency
idf =>
Inverse document frequency .
Apply the tf - idf transform to the term - document matrix .
This generally tends to help improve results with LSA .
Github source file : tf_idf_transform.rb
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 def self .
transform ( matrix ) number_of_documents = matrix .
num_columns @@number_of_documents_with_term = [ ] matrix .
columns .
each_with_index do | document , column_index | document_term_total = document .
rows .
inject ( 0 . 0 ) { | word_sum , word_count | word_sum + word_count .
to_f } document .
rows .
each_with_index do | term_weight , row_index | unless term_weight .
to_f == 0 . 0 matrix [ row_index , column_index ] = ( term_weight / document_term_total ) * Math .
log (( number_of_documents / number_of_documents_with_term ( row_index , matrix ) . to_f ) . abs ) end end end matrix end
3 Latent Semantic transform
Github source file : lsa_transform.rb
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 def transform ( matrix , number_of_dimensions_to_reduce = 1 ) columns = matrix .
num_columns if dimensions <= columns : # Its a valid reduction u , sigma , vt = matrix .
singular_value_decomposition sigma_prime = reduce_dimensions ( number_of_dimensions_to_reduce , sigma ) matrix_prime = u * sigma_prime * vt else raise Exception , " dimension reduction cannot be greater than %s " % columns end matrix_prime end
The LSA transform consists of 3 stages .
Lets take a closer look at these 3 stages :
1. Singular Value Decomposition
SVD : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition
Linalg ’s DMatrix has a singular_value_decomposition method which saves us a lot of work !
1 u , sigma , vt = matrix .
singular_value_decomposition
2. Reduce the dimensions of Sigma
We generally delete the smallest coefficients in the diagonal matrix Sigma to produce Sigma ’ .
1 2 3 4 5 6 def reduce_dimensions ( number_of_dimensions_to_reduce , matrix ) for diagonal_index in dimensions_to_be_reduced ( matrix , number_of_dimensions_to_reduce ) matrix [ diagonal_index , diagonal_index ] = 0 end matrix end
The reduction of the dimensions of Sigma combines some dimensions such that they are on more than one term .
The number of coefficients deleted can depend of the corpus used .
It should be large enough to fit the real structure in the data , but small enough such that noise or unimportant details are not modelled .
The real difficulty and weakness of LSA is knowing how many dimensions to remove .
There is no exact method of finding the right dimensions .
Approaches which are used are L2 - norm or Frobenius norm .
3. Calculate the Product with New Sigma ’
Finally we calculate :
1 matrix_prime = u * sigma_prime * vt
LSA In Action – rSemantic Gem
First install the rsemantic gem from Github
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com sudo gem install josephwilk - rsemantic
Then we can run an example :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 require ' rubygems ' require ' semantic ' D1 = " The cat in the hat disabled " D2 = " A cat is a fine pet ponies . "
D3 = " Dogs and cats make good pets " D4 = " I have n't got a hat . " #verbose mode so it shows us all the different stages search = Semantic : : Search . new ( [ D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 ] , : verbose => true )
We start with out Model - Term frequency matrix with is generated from creating a Vector Space Search with four documents ( D1 - D4 ) :
D1 D2 D3 D4 hat [ +1.00 +0.00 +0.00 +1.00 ] dog [ +0.00 +0.00 +1.00 +0.00 ] cat [ +1.00 +1.00 +1.00 +0.00 ] make [ +0.00 +0.00 +1.00 +0.00 ] good [ +0.00 +0.00 +1.00 +0.00 ] pet [ +0.00 +1.00 +1.00 +0.00 ] fine [ +0.00 +1.00 +0.00 +0.00 ] poni [ +0.00 +1.00 +0.00 +0.00 ] disabl [ +1.00 +0.00 +0.00 +0.00 ]
Apply tf - idf transform :
D1 D2 D3 D4 hat [ +0.23 +0.00 +0.00 +0.69 ] dog [ +0.00 +0.00 +0.28 +0.00 ] cat [ +0.10 +0.07 +0.06 +0.00 ] make [ +0.00 +0.00 +0.28 +0.00 ] good [ +0.00 +0.00 +0.28 +0.00 ] pet [ +0.00 +0.17 +0.14 +0.00 ] fine [ +0.00 +0.35 +0.00 +0.00 ] poni [ +0.00 +0.35 +0.00 +0.00 ] disabl [ +0.46 +0.00 +0.00 < span style= " color : # ff0000 ; " >+0.00 </ span > ]
Perform SVD – Reduce Sigmas dimensions ( removing the 2 smallest coefficients )
D1 D2 D3 D4 hat [ +0.34 - 0.01 - 0.01 +0.63 ] dog [ +0.01 - 0.00 +0.28 - 0.01 ] cat [ +0.03 +0.08 +0.06 +0.04 ] make [ +0.01 - 0.00 +0.28 - 0.01 ] good [ +0.01 - 0.00 +0.28 - 0.01 ] pet [ +0.01 +0.17 +0.14 - 0.01 ] fine [ +0.02 +0.35 - 0.00 - 0.01 ] poni [ +0.02 +0.35 - 0.00 - 0.01 ] disabl [ +0.11 +0.02 +0.02 < span style= " color : # ff0000 ; " >+0.19</span > ]
Note the Word ‘ disabl ’ despite not being in D4 now has a weighting in that document .
Dependencies
Linalg is dependent on LAPACK which can be a challenge to install .

Problems
LSA assumes the Normal distribution where the Poisson distribution has actually been observed .

Carter Oosterhouse HOT New Face of Nautica Voyage
We are trying to dig up some dirt onthe latest face of Nautica Voyage fragrance .
This gorgeous man appeared at Macy 's over the weekend in Pembrooke Pines , Florida for an autograph signing session .
The 32 year old was born in Traverse , Michigan .
Carter 's big break came in 2003 when he joined the cast of TLC's Trading Spaces and since has moved on to other projects with HGTV and the DIY networks , most involving home improvement and construction .
Early this year Oosterhouse and Nicole Facciuto began hosting a show called Red Hot and Green for HGTV .
The pair show home owners how to be more eco-friendly and incorporate it into their homes .
The hottie was named People magazine 's Sexiest Man on TV .
He keeps a pretty tight lid on his love life .
If a love match is n't made between Shemar Moore , who recently revealed to Ellen DeGeneres that he has a crush on Jennifer Aniston , Carter should give her a call because they would be one HOT couple .
More photos of Carter below .

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer , Frosty the Snowman , Fred Claus … there are many classic heartwarming tales for the Christmas season .
This is not one of them .
A fantastical tale , new from Laserpony Studios , which is a name I just made up to refer to joint ventures between Emmy and Myself .
Yes , I probably should have asked before I did that , and especially before I bought team jackets .
Read on !
I am not ashamed to admit that Emmy ’s half of this story blew mine out of the water .
I was continually impressed by what she brought to the table .

The Los Angeles Zoo ’s controversial $ 42 - million Pachyderm Forest development , which would house their lone asian elephant named Billy , has attracted a number of celebrity endorsements , including Guns n’ Roses ’ guitarist Slash .
[ social_buttons ]
But today we learned that the animal rights side of the table , which wants to send Billy to the Performing Animal Welfare Society to spend his days with other elephants , has some heavyweight celebrity backing of their own : long - time animal activist and television personality Bob Barker says he will donate $ 1.5 million to help move Billy to the sanctuary .
“ The thousands of Angelenos who agonized over Billy ’s tragic life at the Los Angeles Zoo will rejoice to learn that now Billy will have the opportunity to roam over countless acres at the PAWS sanctuary , living the life that nature intended for him , ” Barker wrote in a letter last week to Los Angeles City Councilman Tony Cardenas , who supports a move to the sanctuary .
The zoo has already spent $ 12 million on the elephant exhibit , which has been stalled pending further approval from the LA city council , scheduled to meet this Wednesday .
If you live in Los Angeles , make sure to contact your city councilperson to express your concern .
Barker has a history of supporting animal rights activism and is famous for closing every epsiode of The Price is Right with the line “ Bob Barker reminding you : help control the pet population .
Have your pet spayed or neutered .
Goodbye , everybody ! ”
In 2007 , Barker donated $ 300,000 to move an elephant from the LA Zoo to the same sanctuary .

When the journalist Michael Crowley accused him of becoming one of the experts he so despised in his books , Crichton retaliated by including in his dyspeptic 15th novel , Next ( 2006 ) , a character called Mick Crowley , a political columnist and closet paedophile accused of raping his two - year - old nephew .
The real Crowley , who had railed against Crichton 's " breathless , pot - boiler prose " , was not the only critic irritated by Crichton 's two - dimensional page - turners .
Another complained that to call his characters cardboard " would be to endow them with a misleading sense of profundity " .
Crichton himself would swat away such swipes with a flick of his cheque - book , for his polemical tales earned him a fortune in book sales – reckoned in 2006 to exceed 150 million – and a further fortune , many times over , in film rights and screenplays , all written by himself .
The Richmond , B.C. owner of one of the Internet 's most popular sites for downloading everything from music to porn is pre-emptively asking the Supreme Court of British Columbia to rule on whether he is violating the Copyright Act .
Gary Fung , 25 , runs the IsoHunt.com search engine for BitTorrent files , which are commonly used to download and upload virtually every type of copyrighted material , including music , movies , computer software and e-books .
The site currently links to more than 1.5 million files online , such as the latest chart - topping CDs , video games , DVDs and even movies currently in theatres .
Isohunt.com regularly cracks the Top 200 list of the web 's most popular sites , according to analysts at Alexa.com .
" It serves a need that had not been served before , especially with the emergence of BitTorrent becoming a dominant ( downloading ) protocol , " Fung said of the site 's popularity .
Lawsuit launched
Fung has been named in a lawsuit launched in 2006 by the Motion Picture Association of America .
After receiving letters last May from the Canadian Recording Industry Association demanding he take down links to copyrighted material , Fung decided he would ask the courts to rule on whether his site breaks Canadian law .
" We filed the court documents because we were threatened by CRIA .
Essentially they 're saying that all we do is infringe on their clients ' copyrights , " he said .
The letters Fung received argued his site is " responsible for causing , authorizing and contributing to a staggering amount of illegal music downloading , uploading and file sharing . "
The letters also state Fung could be responsible for copyright infringement damages of up to $ 20,000 per song .
But Fung insists his search - engine website does n't break any laws since it simply links to copyrighted material online but does n't host any of it .
He notes that Google can also be easily used to find BitTorrent files .
" IsoHunt does not consider that its operations ... infringe or violate in any way the Copyright Act and therefore seeks the protection of ... ( the B.C. court ) in the form of declaratory relief in relation to clarification of its legal rights in respect of its operation , " Fung states in his petition to the court .
IsoHunt.com has a policy of taking down links to files when contacted by copyright owners and has removed more than 50,000 links since 2004 , Fung said .
It 's similar to the policy that was imposed upon the makers of the Napster downloading software when they were sued for copyright infringement , Fung said .
He added that he invited CRIA to send in requests to remove links but the association " has refused to do that . "
CRIA said it would not comment on the case .
Michael Geist , a copyright expert at the University of Ottawa , said IsoHunt.com 's take - down policy is similar to what most BitTorrent download sites do in an attempt to avoid legal action .
" Many , many sites argue that there 's simply too much content posted ( on their sites ) to actively monitor so they 're entitled to presume their service is being used lawfully " until a copyright holder complains , he said .
" And that 's when their potential liability kicks in if they take no steps to address it . "
Wide effects
The case could have a broad impact and affect a variety of Canadian websites , and not just BitTorrent download sites , Geist said .
" The interesting question is how will the court characterize ( Fung 's arguments ) , because the broader legal implications for copyright and for many parties -- search engines and the like -- could be affected by the outcome of this case . "
Fung said he might have to take down his site if the B.C. court case goes against him .
Donations from the site 's users and advertising revenue are paying his legal bills , he said .
" If we lost the case , it 'd depend on what the judgment is .
If it involves damages we can't pay , then I 'll have to shut down the site , " he said .
With a report from The Canadian Press
A spokesman for the Association of Midland Goldfish Keepers said : " Fish can survive quite a while out of the water , as long as their gills remain moist , allowing them to breathe .
But this is the longest I 've heard of a goldfish staying alive .
It 's quite astonishing . "
( Adds San Francisco quotes , dateline )
SAN FRANCISCO , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - San Francisco Bay Area cities promised to build the electric car capital of the United States , announcing a plan on Thursday to work with start - up Better Place to put battery - powered autos on the road in 2012 .
Mayors of San Francisco , Silicon Valley capital San Jose , Oakland and other cities in the region said they would offer incentives and standardize infrastructure with Better Place , a start - up that aims to offer electric cars as a service , like a cell phone , at prices similar or below standard cars .
The San Francisco Bay Area has the reputation as one of the most liberal and environmentally active parts of the country , and as the economic downturn sweeps through the tech sector it is looking to clean technology for a new source of jobs .
“ I ’m a guy driving a hybrid , and I do n’t feel particularly good about it , ” San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom told a news conference , adding that all - electric cars would be a “ game - changer ” for cutting carbon emissions which cause global warming .
Nissan Motor Co. Ltd 7201.T and Renault RENA .
PA have signed on with other Better Place projects .
Better Place is developing networks in Denmark , Israel , and Australia .
Better Place Chief Executive Shai Agassi in an interview said the network to support the cars with charging stations would cost about $ 1 billion with a quarter of that needed for a test phase in 2010 - 2011 .
“ We ’ve got a year - and - a - half to bring the capital in , ” he said , acknowledging the tough economic environment and arguing that the network would be a good investment .
He told reporters that he hoped the U.S. " Big Three " automakers , GM GM.N , Ford Motor Co F.N and Chrysler , would join the plan .

" So do n't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear "

Bob Dylan as one of the greatest singers ever ?
I know from many a heated discussion that this confuses , confounds and perplexes a lot of people .
And even enrages a few others .
But , as I 've argued for years now , particularly in my earlier piece The BOB ON BOB Rave ( " This Old Man " ) , there 's just no denying the greatness of Dylan as a singer .
That 's right , contrary to popular perception , Bob is indeed one of the greatest singers of all time .
And now I 've got a major music magazine backing me up on this .
Rolling Stone , that is , which just came out with an issue dedicated to The 100 Greatest Rock ' n ' Roll Singers of All Time , featuring Dylan at # 7 .
That 's right , number seven , right behind Aretha Franklin ( # 1 ) , Ray Charles ( # 2 ) , Elvis Presley ( # 3 ) , Sam Cooke ( # 4 ) , John Lennon ( # 5 ) and Marvin Gaye ( # 6 ) .
You can argue that such lists are perhaps a bit silly , but , the fact of the matter is , people like lists and since this list now exists I 'd say the only question is whether Bob should have actually appeared a bit closer to the top .
Truly Great Singing
And to those who do n't think Dylan belongs on this list at all , due to some misguided , and completely cliched , idea about him being " a great songwriter but not a very good singer " , I say that you simply do n't get what singing is all about .
Great singing is n't about hitting all the notes perfectly .
Any kid in any high school choir can do that .
No , great singing is about being expressive and making every phrase your own ... and almost no one does that better than Bob .
Not only did he revolutionize popular singing from the mid-sixties onward , he also showed the world just how to bite into every last phrase ; every last word ; even , sometimes , every last syllable .
It 's not a voice for the opera , nor is it a voice for jazz , and it 's certainly not a voice for whispering sweet nothings , but it is , unquestionably , a voice of rock ' n ' roll brilliance .
Somewhat Nasal
Now , I fully admit , when you 're used to crooners and balladeers your first encounter with Bob 's unique - and rather nasal - vocalizing may seem somewhat strange .
And it 's true that live in concert these days it may not always be the sweetest instrument .
But on album , particularly his classic recordings from the '60s and ' 70s , the man is one of the all - time great vocalists .
Period .
Try imaging someone else singing the songs on Highway 61 Revisited or Blood On The Tracks , two of the greatest albums of all time .
" Like A Rolling Stone " , " Desolation Row " , " Tangled Up In Blue " , these are n't some of the greatest songs ever performed despite the vocals .
No , these are some of the greatest songs of all time largely because of the vocals !
Perfectly Put
As Bono so perfectly puts it in his write - up in the new issue of Rolling Stone :
Dylan did with singing what Brando did with acting .
He busted through the artifice to get to the art .
Both of them tore down the prissy rules laid down by the schoolmarms of their craft , broke through the fourth wall , got in the audience 's face and said , " I dare you to think I 'm kidding . "
In other words , those who think Dylan can't sing are akin to those who thought Marlon Brando , possibly the greatest actor of all time , " mumbled " and " sulked " on screen .
I 'm talking about the people who longed for the " brilliance " of the unintentionally - comical , completely - unrealistic over - acting of the 1930s and ' 40s ( think Jimmy Stewart before he became James ) .
Or , to put it another way , Dylan detractors probably think Julie Andrews , Doris Day , Celine Dion and Jessica Simpson are all amazing singers .
Again , my only problem with Rolling Stone 's list is that I 'd have to insist on placing Bob even higher .
Certainly above John Lennon .
And I 'd also say that Otis Redding most definitely deserves to be in the top 5 , along with Bob , and not right behind him in the eighth spot .
There 's lots more to argue about concerning this list , such as the bizarre exclusion of Eddie Vedder , even more bizarre inclusion of Karen Carpenter ( at 94 ) , not to mention the ridiculous order that many others appear ( John Fogerty way back at 72 ??!! ) .
I wo n't get into all of that , however .
Instead I 'm just going to leave you with my own personal list of the Top 20 Greatest Singers of All Time , excluding all the jazz greats , such as Billie Holliday , Nina Simone , Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald , since jazz , like opera , is a whole other medium .
Likewise , I 'm leaving all the great rappers , from Chuck D to Eminem to Tupac to Jay - Z to Andre 3000 , for a future list of their own .
My list would include ( in no particular order ) the following people .
Because when it comes to beautiful , expressive , wholly original and extraordinarily distinctive rock / soul / R&B singing straight from the heart , no one does it better for me than these 20 musical geniuses :
My List of The Top 20 Greatest Singers of All Time :
- Bob Dylan
- Otis Redding
- Aretha Franklin
- Neil Young
- Stevie Wonder
- Sam Cooke
- John Fogerty
- Marvin Gaye
- Prince
- Van Morrison
- Joni Mitchell
- Al Green
- Ray Charles
- Johnny Cash
- Rod Stewart ( first four albums , as well as with The Faces )
- John Lennon
- Bob Marley
- Elvis Presley
- Roy Orbison
- Joe Strummer
Honorable mentions : Little Richard , Bruce Springsteen , Patti Smith , Lucinda Williams , Elvis Costello , Tom Waits , James Brown , Etta James , Sinead O'Connor , Willie Nelson , Mick Jagger , Levi Stubbs , Smokey Robinson , Jeff Buckley , Janis Joplin , Aaron Neville , Solomon Burke , Michael Stipe , Bono , Hank Williams , Toots Hibbert , Paul McCartney , Roger Daltrey , Levon Helm and Rick Danko .
And if I was forced to declare a Top Four I 'd have to go with Bob , Otis , Aretha and Marvin .
Yeah , that 's right , one skinny white Jewish kid and 3 of the most powerful black vocalists to have ever recorded .
And , damn right , the skinny white guy 100 % belongs there .

Now that you 've read what I have to say on this matter , check out what Bruce Springsteen had to say back in 1988 :
“ The first time I heard Bob Dylan I was in the car with my mother listening to WMCA , and on came that snare shot that sounded like somebody had kicked open the door to your mind : “ Like A Rolling Stone . ”
My Mother — she was no stiff with rock and roll , she liked the music–sat there for a minute , and then looked at me and said , ‘ that guy ca n ’t sing . ’
But I knew she was wrong .
I sat there and I did n’t say nothing but I knew I was listening to the toughest voice that I had ever heard .
It was lean and it sounded simultaneously young and adult . ”

I had the opportunity , last year , to talk with the team behind AppJet .
They ’re building something quite cool : A simple platform for developing reusable server - side applications written completely in JavaScript .
They ’ve come a long way since I originally wrote about them late last year .
They now even provide a copy of their server - side software along with the full source .
This , together with Aptana ’s Jaxer , means that there is , at least , two high - powered , Open Source , JavaScript server platforms .
EtherPad is something new altogether .
Building upon their existing platform , and adding in Comet streaming , they ’ve constructed a completely real - time , multi-user , text and JavaScript editor .
I use two editors in my day - to - day work : vim and SubEthaEdit ( in fact I ’m writing this blog post in SubEthaEdit , at the moment ) – and I can say pretty definitively that EtherPad is just like SubEthaEdit .
I had the opportunity to use it last week with four people all simultaneously editing a document .
It has the characteristic SubEthaEdit feature :
All changes , by any user , occur in near - real - time and are highlighted with that user ’s chosen color .
Some may wonder how this is different from Google Docs .
Let me just say that SubEthaEdit and EtherPad are in a completely different league from Google Docs : I ’ve used all three pieces of software for multiple - editing a document and the responsiveness that you get from SubEthaEdit / EtherPad makes for an unparalleled experience .
It ’s really common to see users start chat discussions within a document simply because it ’s so easy to see their response and get a discussion going .
EtherPad does have one major distinction from SubEthaEdit , though :
The ability to save and restore page revisions .
At any point you can hit a large ‘ Save Now ’ button on the page to tag a revision – and then go back and restore from it at any point .
In many ways this makes the software more like a real - time , multi-user editable , Wiki .
The most exciting thing for me though , and a point which I think is unparalleled , the entire application is built using JavaScript from the bottom up .
The server code is in JavaScript , the database is in JavaScript , and the frontend is in JavaScript – it ’s a complete JavaScript stack .
The AppJet team plans on releasing this new server - side software ( similar to their previous release but with the addition of Comet functionality and other pieces ) completely Open Source as well .
I look forward to being able to give it a spin when the time comes .
It 's common to compare text editors and say that one is better or worse than another .
But after a certain point this is wrong .
Editors are often not better or worse but different than each other , each better at specific things .
Such differences mean that there is no absolute scale of better and worse , and indeed that the question of which is a better editor in general is meaningless .
Let me illustrate this using the differences between the three editors that I use most frequently :
vi is the best sysadmin editor , but it has distinct limits .
For example , vi is somewhere between so - so and terrible at editing multiple files at once .
( I inexplicably skipped this vi limitation before , perhaps because it is so much a part of vi that I never think about it , much like a fish in water . )
is the best sysadmin editor , but it has distinct limits .
For example , is somewhere between so - so and terrible at editing multiple files at once .
Rob Pike 's sam is the best graphical editor and the best editor for certain sorts of mass structured changes ( within certain limits it has the best search and replace going , especially across multiple files ) .
But it basically requires graphics and has nothing like smart indenting or the like .
GNU Emacs is the best code editor , due to things like its freakishly superintelligent smart indenting and other extensions , but it is not suitable as a sysadmin editor and it is not as good a graphical editor as sam .
Looking at this it is hopefully clear how absurd it would be for me to claim that any of these editors was better or worse than any other one .
They are all good editors , and they are all different tools that fit different situations best .
Note that a lot of this involves personal taste issues .
For example , how sam works is very much to my tastes , but probably inspires violent loathing in some people .
Good editors have ( for lack of a better description ) an aesthetic , and either you like that aesthetic or you do n't ( although , like music , you may find that an aesthetic grows on you over time ; vi 's aesthetic certainly has grown on me ) .
Sidebar : on IDEs and my editor list
If I did anything with Java or other highly structured languages , I expect that I would add Eclipse or some similarly smart IDE to this list ; as it is I work in Python and C , neither of which are very amenable to such things .
( And in the brief time I tried Eclipse , it had a distressing tendency to want to run a ' project ' , not just edit files for me .
As a sysadmin , I can't make an IDE ' project ' out of every package that I need to modify a bit . )
Iceland privatized its banking system in 1997 following policies inspired by Milton Friedman under the leadership of then Prime Minister David Oddsson , a process that has been heavily criticized for literally giving the banks to the friends and members of the Independents Party and the Progressive Party .
In retrospect this is nothing new ; these same parties have through the last century shared evenly the wealth and resources of our small country .
Since 1997 , the banking system has grown more then anyone could have imagined .
In the end it was 10 times the size of Iceland ’s Gross Domestic Product .
No one seemed to notice when the bankers went on a shopping spree , buying property and corporations all over Europe .
The media , the president and the parliamentarians were all cheering them on , and anyone who dared to call out against the madness was instantly ridiculed by the same people .
When Robert Wade , Professor of London School of Economics warned our government in early 2008 of the dangers ahead , our PM claimed Wade ’s article was no more relevant then a opinion letter in the Icelandic tabloid DV .
These are the answers the Icelandic public has grown used to from our leaders : pure arrogance .
In a speech on Monday , Mr. Wade described how the government planned to turn Iceland into an international banking center , a plot doomed to fail in his opinion , a plot the Icelandic public was widely unaware of .
But there might be hope for Iceland .
There are grass - root movements forming ; people are calling for a new constitution and a new social democratic system .
Today , activism is flourishing in Iceland ; the number of groups , movements and demonstrations has never been greater .
Hopefully , the days of financial capitalism are over and we can focus on creating real value , producing and manufacturing .
Meanwhile the Social Democrats are determined to use the recent economic crisis to get Iceland into the Eurozone .
In the view of Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir ( Chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance ) , it is the only way .
The times when a small currency like the Icelandic Krona could keep things floating are gone and will never return .
Even more people see the EU as a change of moving from the old political system which has been heavily infected with nepotism and corruption , a system that has largely been mistaken for a Scandinavian welfare state .
We have been Americanized under a neoliberal , unregulated monetary system that has crashed .
It is time to build a new system , a new Iceland .
Days before leaving office , Bush 's lawyer told Rove not to turn over any documents John Byrne
Published : Friday January 30 , 2009
Print This Email This Four days before leaving office , and ten days before House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) subpoenaed him to testify , President Bush 's White House Counsel instructed Karl Rove not to appear before Congress or turn over any documents relating to his time at the White House .
The letter , on White House stationery , was addressed to Rove 's D.C. lawyer , Robert Luskin , and addressed questions of whether the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff was obligated to appear before Congress relating to the firing of nine US Attorneys .
" Please advise Mr. Rove ( i ) that the President continues to direct him not to provide information ( whether in the form of testimony or documents ) to the Congress in this matter ... and not to appear before Congress in this matter , " then - White House Counsel Fred Fielding wrote .
The Jan. 16 , 2009 letter was acquired by Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff and printed online Thursday evening .
At its heart , Fielding 's letter reflects President George W. Bush 's decision to continue to argue that " [ t ] he President and his immediate advisors are absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion by a congressional committee , " even after leaving office , citing a 2007 memorandum the Justice Department prepared .
Ironically , the memo was prepared by the very department that Congress is trying to garner information about .
Rove 's immunity , Fielding says , thus " arises from the President 's position as head of the executive branch and from Mr. Rove 's position as a senior advisor to the President . "
A similar letter was sent to the attorney for former White House Counsel Harriet Miers telling her not to appear at a scheduled deposition with the House Judiciary Committee .
Miers , the Bush White House argues , also has " absolute immunity " as a presidential advisor .
The trouble for Rove and Miers -- and ultimately President Bush -- is that the Administration is losing the battle in court .
After Rove refused to show up for a subpoena the Judiciary Committee issued last year , the House of Representatives ' lawyers sued to compel testimony , asserting that immunity should not apply in Rove and Miers ' case .
A federal judge agreed .
The case is now in appeal with a District of Columbia court .
Reached by Isikoff Wednesday afternoon , Fielding purportedly declined to comment , but an aide told Newsweek that Bush had to assert executive privilege before leaving office .
John Conyers , the Judiciary Committee 's ebullient Democratic chair , decided not to wait for the court to rule .
Invoking President Barack Obama , he issued a fresh subpoena to Rove on Monday .
" Mr. Rove has previously refused to appear in response to a Judiciary Committee subpoena , claiming that even former presidential advisers cannot be compelled to testify before Congress , " Conyers ' office wrote in a release .
" That ' absolute immunity ' position was supported by then - President Bush , but it has been rejected by U.S. District Judge John Bates and President Obama has previously dismissed the claim as ' completely misguided . ' "
Conyers ' new subpoena calls on Rove to appear at deposition next Monday , Feb .
2 . Specifically , it enjoins him " to testify regarding his role in the Bush Administrations politicization of the Department of Justice , including the US Attorney firings and the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman . "
There 's a delicate dance behind Conyers ' words -- one which was also conjured by Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin .
That 's the effort to involve President Obama , whose Administration would normally now be the arbiter of whether Rove is granted executive privilege .
Luskin said Tuesday , " It 's generally agreed that former presidents retain executive privilege as to matters occurring during their term .
We 'll solicit the views of the new White House counsel and , if there is a disagreement , assume that the matter will be resolved among the courts , the president and the former president . "
Absent a court order upholding President Bush 's claim of " absolute immunity , " it 's Obama who would decide if he'd extend the executive umbrella to Rove .
While Obama does n't appear to have interest in protecting Rove specifically , retaining executive privilege -- and concurring with President Bush 's interpretation -- could help Obama protect himself down the road .
Obama 's Justice Department must file position papers in the case Congress filed to dismiss Bush 's immunity claim by Feb. 18 ; this is expected to give insight into the new Administration 's feelings , and may shine light onto Obama 's opinion of investigations into Bush officials ' activities in general .
Regardless of Bush 's lawyer 's position , Conyers does n't appear to be backing down .
 I have said many times that I will carry this investigation forward to its conclusion , whether in Congress or in court , and todays action is an important step along the way ,  Conyers said in a release earlier this week .
 Change has come to Washington , and I hope Karl Rove is ready for it .
After two years of stonewalling , it s time for him to talk . 
Experts told Isikoff that exerting privilege beyond one 's own presidency is unprecedented , as did Rove 's lawyer .
" We 're in uncharted territory , " Luskin remarked , adding that Rove has " no personal objection " to testifying .
Reporter in CIA leak case sees ' accommodation ' Matt Cooper , the then - TIME reporter who was leaked CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson 's name by Rove , wrote Thursday that Rove will likely find some accommodation that allows him to answer at least limited questions .
" My source predicted that in the end there probably will be some kind of accommodation with Rove answering questions on some topics and not on others rather than a showdown that drags on endlessly , " Cooper wrote , speaking of a Washington , D.C. attorney .
Cooper also added that Rove 's attorney may have erred by seeking an opinion from Obama 's counsel .
" The first interesting point the person raised is that Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , may have made a tactical mistake in writing to White House Counsel Greg Craig for an opinion , " Cooper wrote .
" ' Be careful what you ask for , ' the source said .
After all , Craig could come up with a rationale for Rove testifying .
And why rush to Craig at all when you might prevail in the courts ?
True , the courts have been loathe to offer hard and fast rules in these cases but it would seem worth pursuing such a legal avenue before going to the Democratic White House for solace . "
Karl Rove has been subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee , but will he get out of it again ?
Can former President Bush still invoke executive privilege for Karl Rove ?

Israel and Judaism
The Long — and Largely Untold — History Of Jewish Opposition to Zionism
By Allan C. Brownfeld
WHILE MANY in Israel and in Jewish communities here and in other countries now promote the idea that Zionism and Judaism are , in effect , the same , and that opposition to Zionism constitutes “ anti-Semitism , ” the historical — largely untold — fact is that , for most of its history , Zionism has been a decidedly minority movement among Jews throughout the world .
Since its inception as a political movement in 1897 , both Reform and Orthodox Jews have rejected Zionism ’s basic premise of creating a Jewish state in Palestine and having Jews either emigrate to it or , at the very least , view it as “ central ” to their Jewish identity .
An overwhelming majority of Orthodox Jews , unwilling to accept the restoration of a Jewish state in Palestine by means other than divine intervention , considered Zionism a false messianic movement .
Most Jewish liberals and socialists , having accepted the ideals of the Enlightenment , with its emphasis in optimism , reason and progress , rejected Zionism as a reactionary philosophy .
Acculturated Jews in Western and Central Europe who regarded themselves simply as members of a religious community , rejected the notion that their nationality was not English , French or German — but “ Jewish . ”
Reform Judaism ’s position was quite contrary to that promulgated by Zionism .
The most articulate spokesman for the German Reform movement , the distinguished rabbi and scholar Abraham Geiger ( 1810 - 1874 ) , argued that Judaism developed through an evolutionary process that had begun with God ’s revelation to the Hebrew prophets .
That revelation was progressive , with new truth becoming available to every generation .
According to Geiger , the underlying and unchangeable essence of Judaism was its morality , and the core of Judaism was ethical monotheism .
He considered the Jewish people a religious community , destined to carry on the mission to “ serve as a light to the nations , ” to bear witness to God and His moral law .
The dispersion of the Jews was not a punishment for their sins , in Geiger ’s view , but a part of God ’s plan whereby they were to disseminate the universal message of ethical monotheism throughout the world .
Indeed , in a Reform prayerbook he edited in 1854 Geiger deleted all prayers about a return to Zion .
American Reform Judaism , in the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform , rejected Jewish nationalism .
Its fifth paragraph declared : “ We consider ourselves no longer a nation but a religious community . ”
On March 4 , 1919 Julius Kahn , a Jewish congressman from San Fransisco , delivered to President Woodrow Wilson a statement endorsed by 299 prominent Jewish Americans denouncing the Zionists for attempting to segregate Jews and reverse the historic trend toward emancipation .
It objected to the creation of a distinctly Jewish state in Palestine because such a political entity would be contrary “ to the principles of democracy . ”
On April 20 , 1922 , Rabbi David Philipson , testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee , rejected the characterization of Palestine “ as the national home of the Jewish people . ”
He insisted that , “ No land can be spoken of as the national home of the Jewish people , as Jews are nationals of many lands . ”
An important new book , A Threat From Within : A Century of Jewish Opposition to Zionism ( available from the AET Book Club ) by Professor Yakov M. Rabkin , professor of history at the University of Montreal , sheds significant light on Jewish religious opposition to Zionism .
After completing his university education , Dr. Rabkin studied Judaism with rabbis in Montreal , Paris and Jerusalem .
He brings a lifetime of study and experience to his subject .
Noting that “ the rejection of Zionism is often interpreted as an act of treachery toward the Jewish people , ” Rabkin explains that “ ’ Zionism ’ was an invention of intellectuals and assimilated Jews ... who turned their back on the rabbis and aspired to modernity , seeking desperately for a remedy for their existential anxiety . ”
Zionism gained support in areas where social and political conditions were unfavorable to Jews , particularly within the Russian Empire .
Indeed , Rabkin argues , Zionism has far more in common with the emerging nationalisms which swept Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries than with anything to be found in Jewish tradition .
Many today forget the fact that , as Rabkin writes , “ Zionism constitutes the most radical revolution in Jewish history .
Opposition to this nationalist conceptualization of the Jew and of Jewish history was as intense as it was immediate .
Even those rabbis who at first encouraged settlement in Palestine in the closing decades of the 19th century felt obliged to turn against Zionism .
What made the Jews unique , they declared , was neither the territory of Eretz Israel nor the Hebrew language , but the Torah and the practice of mitzvahs .
The pious Jews of Palestine — the only kind before Zionist settlement — enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy granted by the sultan .
They had never contemplated national status , a concept as foreign to the Palestinian Jews as it was to the Ottoman authorities in Istanbul . ”
In the early 20th century , the reaction to Zionism among both Orthodox and Reform Jews was overwhelming .
The French rabbis were unanimous .
Zionism was “ narrow - minded and reactionary . ”
They refused to recognize Jews as a separate political nation .
“ We , the French Israelites , have a fatherland and we intend to keep it . ”
Israel , the state , rather than God , has become the object of worship for many Jews at the present time , Rabkin notes .
Indeed , Zionism not only has changed Jewish life , but has shifted the meaning of the word “ Israel . ”
According to Rabbi Jacob Neusner , an American academic and one of the most prolific interpreters of Judaism , “ The word ” ˜Israel ’ today generally refers to the overseas political nation , the State of Israel .
When people say , ” ˜I am going to Israel , ’ they mean a trip to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem ... [ But ] the prayers that Judaism teaches , all use the word ” ˜Israel ’ to mean ” ˜the holy community . ’ ”
In his book , Transformation , Rabbi Israel Domb writes : “ It manifestly is absurd to believe that we have been waiting for 2000 years in so much anguish and with such high hopes and with so many heartfelt prayers merely in order to finish up by playing the same role in the world as an Albania or Honduras .
Is it not the height of futility , to believe that all the streams of blood and tears , to which we ourselves can bear witness in our own time apart from the testimony of our ancestors , should have been fated to the acquisition of this kind of nationhood which the Rumanians or Czechs , for instance , have achieved to a greater extent of success without all these preparations . ”
Professor Rabkin points out in A Threat From Within that many positions taken by anti-Zionists are close to those of the Israeli “ peace camp . ”
For example , a Neturei Karta document asserts : “ The Zionist movement was not only a heretical departure from Judaism ... It was monstrously blind to the indigenous inhabitants of the Holy Land .
In the 1890s , less than 5 % of the Holy Land ’s population was Jewish , yet Theodor Herzl ... described his movement as that of ” ˜a people without a land for a land without a people ’... They have dispossessed thousands ... and plunged the region into its never - ending spiral of bloodshed . ”
No one who reads Yakov Rabkin ’s thoroughly researched book will ever again believe that Zionism and Judaism are the same , or that Zionism enjoys the level of support among Jews in the United States and elsewhere in the world which it claims .

A few nights ago John McCain treated us all to a masterful concession speech .
He was gracious , articulate , noble – he said all the right things and struck all the right chords as the nation and his party look toward the future in the wake of an epic statement on the part of the American electorate .
If you ’re like me , you ’re probably wondering : where the hell was this guy for the last several months ?
I always marvel at the civility of concession speeches .
Your opponent spends months degrading your character , questioning the legitimacy of your parentage , slandering you , your momma , your horse and everyone you ever passed in the street , fabricating the most staggering and colorful lies imaginable , and then when the votes are in he extends his hand like you ’d been trading good - natured barbs over the monthly potluck in the church fellowship hall .
You – the slanderee – then take the opportunity to tell us all what a great guy your opponent is and how goddamned lucky we are to have such a great fucking American in our midst .
This sort of civility is probably preferable to dragging his punk ass into the parking lot and administering the righteous nard - stomping he deserves , I suppose .
I mean , sure , it always makes for fun TV when WrestleMania breaks out on the floor of Parliament in Southeast Goatfuckistan , but in the grand scheme of things that ’s not how lasting democratic traditions are forged .
Still – you have to be kidding , right ?
The candidates may feel bound by a code of etiquette that would chafe the nipples off of Louis Quatorze , but there ’s no reason for us to canonize St. McCain just yet .
The man ran what was arguably the dirtiest , most hateful campaign in recent presidential history , and while we do n’t have much of a record of racist campaigns per se ( lacking , as we do , any meaningful history of non-white presidential candidates ) , his electioneering certainly set a daunting standard for those who will find themselves up against minority candidates in the future .
McCain was not worthy of Obama ’s graciousness and his own remarks forged new frontiers in hypocrisy .
The fact is that McCain ’s carefully crafted and meticulously fluffed image – the hard - charging , America - first , convention - be - damned maverick – was always a fiction .
We should not allow our intelligence to be further insulted by suggestions that this now - thoroughly - discredited relic of a dead age has some honorable and critical role to play in helping us dig out of the hole he and his cronies spent the last quarter of a century or more digging us into .
I know America is big on forgiveness – a little too big , for my taste .
But in this case , can we at least withhold absolution until he repents ?
A few pretty words should n’t distract us from the fact that , politically speaking , John McCain is holding a blood - soaked chainsaw and standing amidst a pile of body parts .
McCain was n’t the only dirty campaigner out there , either .
Voters in Colorado ’s 4th District called home Marilyn Musgrave , one of the vilest weasels to ever slither into DC .
Musgrave ’s campaign made sure that no lie went untold , and if you want a sense for how appalling her ads were , understand that she lost by 12 % in a district that would sooner vote for bin Laden than a Democrat .
Then there ’s Elizabeth Dole , who ’d better hope that there ’s no god .
Or that if there is , He ’s nothing like the one she professes to believe in .
Otherwise , she ’s gonna have some ‘ splainin ’ to do come Judgment Day .
I have n’t checked to see if the Guinness Book tracks world records for bearing false witness , but if they do , Liddy just blowed the former holder ’s doors off .
She told the citizens of North Carolina that a Sunday School teacher was part of some kind of shadowy conspiracy of godlessness and in doing so depicted a guy who taught college courses in Biblical Studies as one of the cabalists .
A note , Liddy – next time you sell your soul , you might make sure you get something more for it than an embarrassing , very public ass - whipping .
I ’d like to point out that in this election we saw some prominent cases of dirty tricks not paying off .
Obama took the high road and McCain took the sewage ditch running alongside the low road , and for once the nobler route paid off .
But I ’m not so stupid as to expect those gearing up for 2010 to conclude that filthy campaigning does n’t pay .
More likely they ’ll convince themselves that McCain ( and Musgrave and Dole and all the other 2008 losers ) simply did n’t play dirty enough .
Which brings me to Obama ’s desire to forge a new , post - partisan spirit of political togetherness .
I respect his sense that America has been too divided – my colleague Dr. Slammy has carped on this subject a time or two , in fact – but I think he needs to carefully consider the specific character of the unity we ’re pursuing .
For starters , I think Sen. Obama needs to step away from the nation ’s euphoric post-election fuzzies and understand that he has a mandate here .
You ’ll recall that in 2004 George Bush banked in a half - courter at the buzzer and interpreted the “ lowest electoral vote count for an incumbent president ’s re-election since 1916 ” as some kind of big honking license to do what the fuck ever he felt like doing .
( And by all means , click that link and draw your own conclusions about the math skills of America ’s media hacks . )
If 286 electoral votes is a mandate , then what happened Tuesday must be approaching King - Hell Emperor of the Whole Damned World territory .
Instead , we ’re hearing a lot of happy talk about reaching across the aisle , something that seems likely to benefit the very elements that America so soundly rejected at the polls .
Sen .
Obama , I ’d advise you , were I one of your advisors , to remember what you have seen and heard from across the aisle over the last few months .
Specifically :
You ’re not an American .
You ’re a terrorist .
So is your wife .
Your preacher hates America .
And by the way , since you ’re a Muslim he must not be your real preacher .
You launched your campaign in the living room of a known terrorist .
Shall I continue ?
You want to be a uniter ( not a divider ) , but let ’s be clear about unity .
Unity is , in and of itself , of limited value .
Lemmings are marvelously unified as they run over the cliff , and if I recall correctly , Congress was strikingly unified in supporting Bush ’s invasion of Iraq .
So make sure that you ’re inviting the good folks on the other side of the aisle to your party – our party .
They ’re already looking for ways of kneecapping you and playing your inexperience to their advantage .
Your good faith commitment to bipartisanship , if you lose sight of who elected you and why , may lead to some huge Republican celebrations four years from now .
So , please – let ’s be careful that in reaching across the aisle you do n’t get caught up in a grand reach - around , okay ?
Transcript :
On Tuesday , Americans stood in lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen .
It didnt matter who they were or where they came from ; what they looked like or what party they belonged to they came out and cast their ballot because they believed that in this country , our destiny is not written for us , but by us .
We should all take pride in the fact that we once again displayed for the world the power of our democracy , and reaffirmed the great American ideal that this is a nation where anything is possible .
This week , I spoke with President Bush , who graciously offered his full support and assistance in this period of transition .
Michelle and I look forward to meeting with him and the First Lady on Monday to begin that process .
This speaks to a fundamental recognition that here in America we can compete vigorously in elections and challenge each others ideas , yet come together in service of a common purpose once the voting is done .
And that is particularly important at a moment when we face the most serious challenges of our lifetime .
Yesterday , we woke to more sobering news about the state of our economy .
The 240,000 jobs lost in October marks the 10th consecutive month that our economy has shed jobs .
In total , weve lost nearly 1.2 million jobs this year , and more than 10 million Americans are now unemployed .
Tens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes .
Their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime , and we must act swiftly to resolve them .
In the wake of these disturbing reports , I met with members of my Transition Economic Advisory Board , who will help guide the work of my transition team in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis .
While we must recognize that we only have one President at a time and that President Bush is the leader of our government , I want to ensure that we hit the ground running on January 20th because we dont have a moment to lose .
We discussed several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus in the days and weeks ahead to ease the credit crisis , help hardworking families , and restore growth and prosperity .
First , we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provides relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear .
Then , well address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on other sectors of our economy , and ensure that the rescue plan that passed Congress is working to stabilize financial markets while protecting taxpayers , helping homeowners , and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance .
Finally , we will move forward with a set of policies that will grow our middle - class and strengthen our economy in the long - term .
We cant afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that I identified during the campaign , including clean energy , health care , education and tax relief for middle class families .
Let me close by saying I do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead .
Weve taken some major actions to date , and we will need further actions during this transition and subsequent months .
Some of those choices will be difficult , but America is a strong and resilient country .
I know that we will succeed if we put aside partisanship and work together as one nation .
And that is what I intend to do .
ONE way of helping to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is to pump the gas into underground caverns or old oil fields .
But there is also a rock that is happy to gobble it up , and according to the latest research its appetite for the greenhouse gas is not only massive but could also be increased by a little human intervention .
The rock is peridotite , which is one of the main rocks in the upper mantle , an area that provides a girth below the Earth 's crust .
The rock occurs some 20 km or more down , although in areas where plate tectonics have forced up some of the mantle , peridotite reaches the surface .
This happens in part of the Omani desert which Peter Kelemen and Juerg Matter , both from Columbia University , New York , have studied for years .
Geologists have long known that when peridotite is exposed to the air it can react quickly with carbon dioxide to form carbonates like limestone or marble .
Some people have looked at the idea of grinding up peridotite and using it to soak up emissions from power stations , but the process turns out to be expensive , partly because of the costs of transporting all the rock .
The transportation would also create emissions .
In Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Messrs Kelemen and Matter suggest an alternative : pumping the gas from places where it is produced and into underground strata of peridotite .
The team has shown that the Omani peridotite absorbs tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide a year , far more than anyone had thought .
By drilling and fracturing the rock they believe they can start a process to increase the absorption rate by 100,000 times or more .
They estimate this would allow the Omani outcrop , which extends down some 5 km , alone to absorb some 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year , which is a substantial part of the annual 30 billion or so tonnes of the gas that humans send into the atmosphere , mostly by burning fossil fuels .
With such rocks situated in an area of the world where an increasing amount of energy is produced and consumed , it potentially provides a convenient carbon sink for the region 's energy industry , say the researchers .
Peridotite can also be found at the surface in other parts of the world , including some Pacific islands , along the coasts of Greece and Croatia , and in smaller deposits in America .
Nor is it the only rock with carbon - eating potential .
The researchers are now looking at volcanic basalt in a new project in Iceland .

“ I HAVEN’T paid an electricity bill since 1970 , ” says Richard Perez with noticeable glee .
He can afford to be smug .
While most of us fretted over soaring utility bills this year , he barely noticed .
Nor is he particularly concerned about forecast price hikes of 30 to 50 per cent in 2009 .
Perez , a renewable - energy researcher at the University at Albany , State University of New York , lives “ off - grid ” – unconnected to the power grid and the water , gas and sewerage supplies that most of us rely on .
He generates his own electricity , sources his own water and manages his own waste disposal – and prefers it that way .
“ There are times when the grid blacks out , ” he says .
“ I like the security of having my own electricity company . ”
Perez is not alone .
Once the preserve of mavericks , hippies and survivalists , there are now approximately 200,000 off - grid households in the US , a figure that Perez says has been increasing by a third every year for the past decade .
In addition , nearly 30,000 grid- connected US households supplement their supply with renewables , according to the non-profit Interstate Renewable Energy Council .
In the UK there are around 40,000 off - grid homes : the number has also risen in recent years due to escalating house prices and now to more expensive home loans , both of which have driven buyers far from conventional utility networks in search of properties they can afford .
For people who live off - grid , self - sufficiency means guilt - free energy consumption and peace of mind .
“ It feels brilliant to use clean , free energy that ’s not from fossil …
Anger is growing that the attacks were not prevented The US warned India about a possible threat at least a month before last week 's Mumbai attacks , US media have quoted unnamed officials as saying .
The Director of National Intelligence , Mike McConnell , has meanwhile implied he suspects the Pakistan - based group Lashkar - e - Toiba was responsible .
Islamabad has denied Indian allegations that the attackers , who killed almost 200 people , had Pakistani links .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due in Delhi to discuss the crisis .
She has urged India and Pakistan to remain in contact and work together to find those behind the " horrible attack " .
Ms Rice said all parties should " co-operate fully , and Pakistan in particular needs to co-operate fully and transparently " .
Seaborne attack On Tuesday , a US official told the Associated Press that the Indian authorities had been told of an apparent plot to launch an attack on Mumbai from the sea .
Security remains tight in many parts of Mumbai following last week 's attacks Mumbai police chief Hassan Gafoor later appeared to confirm the report by saying that there had been a known threat to at least some of the locations targeted , including the Taj Mahal Palace hotel .
Security authorities had " had an alert that hotels like Taj could be exposed to such danger " , he told a news conference .
ABC
News also quoted Indian officials as saying that after receiving the US warning , they also intercepted a satellite phone message on 18 November warning of a seaborne attack on Mumbai .
The city had been on high alert , but security measures at the targeted hotels had recently been relaxed , the US television network said .
ABC also reported that the Indian authorities had seized a mobile phone SIM card belonging to the attackers , which they said had led to a " treasure trove " of contacts and information .
One of the gunmen , named as Azam Amir Qasab , survived and is in police custody .
Police have said he is " certainly " from Pakistan .
LASHKAR-E-TOIBA
Jihadi organisation based in Pakistan Formed towards the end of the Afghan war against the Soviets Blamed for hundreds of attacks in the region since 1990 Listed as a " terrorist group " by the US and UK
Profile : Lashkar - e- Toiba A Pakistan militant link ?
Sir Mark Tully on Mumbai
The Indian media have said he is linked to the militant group Lashkar - e - Toiba , but the group has denied responsibility .
Although he did not mention Lashkar - e - Toiba by name , the US Director of National Intelligence said the militant group the US suspects carried out the Mumbai attacks was the same one that was behind the train blasts in the city in July 2006 that killed 186 people .
" The same group that we believe is responsible for Mumbai had a similar attack in 2006 attack on a train and killed a similar number of people , " Mr McConnell said in a speech at at Harvard University .
" Go back to 2001 and it was an attack on the parliament . "
Lashkar - e- Toiba was blamed by the Indian government for the 2006 train bombings , along with the Students ' Islamic Movement of India ( Simi ) , and for the parliament attack , in which 12 people died .
' Resolve ' Correspondents say the alleged US intelligence warning is likely to add to growing public anger that they were not prevented .
India 's home minister and the chief and deputy chief ministers of Maharashtra state have all resigned .

Advertisement Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Suresh Mehta said on Tuesday that failures needed to be " taken stock of " , but he added that the government 's response was " going to be quite adequate " .
Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said a military response was not under consideration but that if Pakistan did not act the bilateral peace process would be at risk .
India has also asked Islamabad to hand over 20 fugitives from Indian law it believes are hiding in Pakistan .
It is not clear what , if any , links those on the list had to the Mumbai attacks .
Indian media reports say the names include alleged underworld don Dawood Ibrahim , wanted in connection with bombings in Mumbai in 1993 , and Muslim cleric Maulana Masood Azhar who was freed from jail in India in exchange for passengers on a hijacked plane in 1999 .
Islamabad has not responded directly to the request but on Tuesday offered India a joint investigation into the attacks .

In the last days before Israel imposed a unilateral cease - fire in Gaza to avoid embarrassing the incoming Obama administration , it upped its assault , driving its troops deeper into Gaza City , intensifying its artillery bombardment , and creating thousands more displaced people .
Israel ’s military strategy in Gaza , even in what its officials were calling the “ final act , " followed a blueprint laid down during the Lebanon war more than two years ago .
Then , Israel destroyed much of Lebanon ’s infrastructure in a month of intensive air strikes .
Even in the war ’s last few hours , as a cease - fire was being finalized , Israel fired more than a million cluster bombs over south Lebanon , apparently in the hope that the area could be made as uninhabitable as possible .
Similarly , Israel ’s destruction of Gaza continued with unrelenting vigor to the very last moment , even though according to reports in the Israeli media the air force exhausted what it called its “ bank of Hamas targets ” in the first few days of fighting .
The military sidestepped the problem by widening its definition of Hamas - affiliated buildings .
Or as one senior official explained : “ There are many aspects of Hamas , and we are trying to hit the whole spectrum because everything is connected and everything supports terrorism against Israel . ”
That included mosques , universities , most government buildings , the courts , 25 schools , 20 ambulances , and several hospitals , as well as bridges , roads , 10 electricity - generating stations , sewage lines , and 1,500 factories , workshops , and shops .
Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah estimate the damage so far at $ 1.9 billion , pointing out that at least 21,000 residential apartment buildings need repairing or rebuilding , forcing 100,000 Palestinians into refugeedom once again .
In addition , 80 percent of all agricultural infrastructure and crops were destroyed .
The PA has described its estimate as “ conservative . "
None of this will be regretted by Israel .
In fact the general devastation , far from being unfortunate collateral damage , has been the offensive ’s unstated goal .
Israel has sought the political , as well as military , emasculation of Hamas through the widespread destruction of Gaza ’s infrastructure and economy .
This is known as the “ Dahiya Doctrine , " named after a suburb of Beirut that was almost leveled during Israel ’s attack on Lebanon in summer 2006 .
The doctrine was encapsulated in a phrase used by Dan Halutz , Israel ’s chief of staff , at the time .
He said Lebanon ’s bombardment would “ turn back the clock 20 years . "
The commanding officer in Israel ’s south , Yoav Galant , echoed those sentiments on the Gaza offensive ’s first day : the aim , he said , was to “ send Gaza decades into the past . "
Beyond these soundbites , Gadi Eisenkot , the head of Israel ’s northern command , clarified in October the practical aspects of the strategy : “ What happened in the Dahiya quarter of Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from which Israel is fired on .
We will apply disproportionate force on it and cause great damage and destruction there .
From our standpoint , these are not civilian villages , they are military bases .
This is not a recommendation .
This is a plan . ”
In the interview , Gen . Eisenkot was discussing the next round of hostilities with Hezbollah .
However , the doctrine was intended for use in Gaza , too .
Gabriel Siboni , a colonel in the reserves , set out the new “ security concept ” in an article published by Tel Aviv University ’s Institute of National Security Studies two months before the assault on Gaza .
Conventional military strategies for waging war against states and armies , he wrote , could not defeat sub-national resistance movements , such as Hezbollah and Hamas , that have deep roots in the local population .
The goal instead was to use “ disproportionate force , " thereby “ inflicting damage and meting out punishment to an extent that will demand long and expensive reconstruction processes . "
Col .
Siboni identified the chief target of Israel ’s rampages as “ decision makers and the power elite , " including “ economic interests and the centers of civilian power that support the [ enemy ] organization . "
The best Israel could hope for against Hamas and Hezbollah , Col. Siboni conceded , was a cease - fire on improved terms for Israel and delaying the next confrontation by leaving “ the enemy floundering in expensive , long - term processes of reconstruction . "
In the case of Gaza ’s lengthy reconstruction , however , Israel says it hopes not to repeat the mistakes of Lebanon .
Then , Hezbollah , aided by Iranian funds , further bolstered its reputation among the local population by quickly moving to finance the rebuilding of Lebanese homes destroyed by Israel .
According to the Israeli media , the foreign ministry has already assembled a task force for “ the day after ” to ensure neither Hamas nor Iran take the credit for Gaza ’s reconstruction .
Israel wants all aid to be be channeled either through the Palestinian Authority or international bodies .
Sealing off Gaza , by preventing smuggling through tunnels under the border with Egypt , is an integral part of this strategy .
Much to Israel ’s satisfaction , the rebuilding of Gaza is likely to be even slower than might have been expected .
Diplomats point out that , even if Western aid flows to the Palestinian Authority , it will make little effect if Israel maintains the blockade , curbing imports of steel , cement , and money .
And international donors are already reported to be tired of funding building projects in Gaza only to see them destroyed by Israel a short time later .
With more than a hint of exasperation , Norway ’s foreign minister , Jonas Gahr Stoere , summed up the general view of donors last week : “ Shall we give once more for the construction of something which is being destroyed , reconstructed , and destroyed ? ”

Film taken with a thermal - imaging camera revealed the stinky trick used by the carrion flower

You would think a flower that resembles a 3 - metre phallus would have no problems attracting attention , especially if it also stinks like a rotting corpse .
But for the carrion flower , which has the world ’s largest flowering head , getting noticed by flesh - eating insect pollinators in its jungle home requires yet another amazing adaptation – and one that only came to light thanks to a serendipitous TV recording .
“ The film crew was using very strong backlighting and suddenly we saw smoke rising up along the flower ’s central column .
We thought the plant was on fire , ” says Wilhelm Barthlott from the University of Bonn in Germany .

The ‘ smoke ’ turned out to be steam that is puffed out in regular pulses , coinciding with waves of carrion scent .
“ We had wondered before why one moment the flower would stink like a dead donkey , and a little while later there would be hardly any smell .
It never occurred to us that there was cyclic odour production . ”
Hot rod
Intrigued by the stink rhythm , Barthlott and his team hypothesised that the carrion flower , which is also known as the titan arum , uses heat to pump hot clouds of stench into the night sky .
They filmed three blossoms with infrared cameras and sure enough found that waves of heat travel up the flower until the tip reaches an impressive 36 °C and steam is released .
Related flowers that also emit carcass smell were already known to get hot – probably to further attract the carrion beetles and flesh - eating flies by simulating the body temperature of a freshly deceased animal .
But the rhythmic steam production has another function , the researchers say .
Amorphophallus titanium ( translation : “ giant misshapen penis ” ) grows in clearings in the Sumatran forest .
This presents that plant with a problem .
Smell trap
At night , a layer of cooler air forms beneath the tree canopy that could prevent the plant ’s smell from rising and being dispersed on the breeze .
By growing so tall and shooting out hot steam , the carrion flower overcomes this stratification .
The warm scent rises and gets distributed widely above the crowns of the trees , attracting pollinating insects from far and wide .
“ This explains why the flower is so big , ” says Barthlott .
“ It ’s literally like a torch in the rainforest that blasts carrion smell into the sky . ”
He suggests that the enormous energetic expense of the tall growth and the heat production is the reason why the bloom famously only lasts for two nights – anything more would be too costly .
But two nights of a stink this strong is plenty of time to attract insects , he says .

Hey there guys , and Happy Fourth of July !
We ’ve just crossed the mid way point of 2008 , and as I ’m accustomed to doing I thought I ’d throw together a mid-year report of the 10 best and the 10 worst movies of the year to date .
The worst thing …
AND the best thing about these lists is that no one totally agrees with them , which opens up tons of room for discussion on the year so far .
So without further a due I present to you TMB ’s best films of 2008 so far :
# 1 – WALL-E
Without question the best film of 2008 thus far , and barring an AMAZING 2nd half to the 2008 film season the Oscars will make fools of themselves if this is n’t at least nominated for best picture .
Not only the best picture of the year so far , but also the best film Pixar has ever made … and that ’s saying something .
Brilliant movie on every level .
# 2 – IN BRUGES
The most surprising film of 2008 so far to me .
The 3 main cast members ( Colin Farrell , Brendan Gleeson , Ralph Fiennes ) are all beyond brilliant .
The film is funny , exciting … and who knew that Colin Farrell could be such a great actor when he puts his mind to it ?
The film has a “ Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ” sort of feel to it , but it ’s very much its own movie .
# 3 – WANTED I suspected this film would surprise a lot of people , but I did n’t anticipate it surprising me as much as it did .
This film is just over the top insanity and adrenaline inducing fun from start to finish .
Never thought I could buy James McAvoy as an action hero … but I guess I was wrong about that .
Oh , and I ’ve never seen Angelina look sexier in any role before either .
# 4 – THE DARK KNIGHT
There is such a huge amount of hype surrounding this film , and at the same time right now a huge amount of unrealistic over - exaggeration ( in my opinion ) going on about how good this film is .
No , this film is not the best thing since sliced bread , but make no mistake about it , it ’s a FANTASTIC movie .
I believe it exceeds Batman Begins and Heath Ledger legitimately deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as The Joker .
No one will be disappointed .
# 5 – IRON MAN
I was not at all looking forward to this flick in the least when it was first announced .
I even thought doing a movie on Iron Man in general was a bad idea .
But after seeing the trailer at Comic Con last year , I started getting interested , and the movie delivers .
Exactly what a summer super hero movie should be .
Holy crap did Robert Downey Jr. knock it out of the park .
He was the perfect Tony Stark .
# 6 – SON OF RAMBOW
A movie that was a hit on the film festival circuit , but sadly never found a serious audience in its theatrical run .
This is a beautiful movie that I lament more of you did n’t get a chance to see .
A wonderful look at innocent in a world of filled with a lot of beautiful that only innocent eyes seem really capable of seeing .
The kids in this flick were great too .
Touching , funny … and you even might learn something watching it .
# 7 – FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL
After “ The 40 Year Old Virgin ” , this is , in my opinion , the funniest and best Apatow related movie they ’ve ever done .
On the surface a formulaic comedy that somehow also manages to generate a ton of heart with a very symapthetic lead character you just ca n’t help but cheer for .
It lacks a little of the hidden deeper stuff found in Virgin , but a wonderful and enjoyable film nonetheless .
# 8 – DEFINITELY , MAYBE
There is definitely an anti-romantic comedy bias out there … because … well … most romantic comedies suck .
This one however , rules … so much so that I hesitate to call it a romantic comedy , but I guess that ’s what it is .
Best Ryan Reynolds performance I ’ve ever seen him give , terrific female supporting cast and a legitimately interesting story told in a pretty unique way .
Trust me guys … it ’s worth checking out .
# 9 – THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES
Going into The Spiderwick Chronicles I was expecting a cookies cutter film in the same vein as all the new little fantasy family films that seem to be popular to produce these days .
Surprisingly , Spiderwick turns out to be more than just that .
The movie makes you feel awe and wonder with the world in which it takes place with a FANTASTIC performance by my favorite child actor Freddie Highmore .
# 10 – SMART PEOPLE
Thomas Haden Church absolutely kills me in this movie .
His interactions with Juno ’s Ellen page are the highlight of the movie for me … but it ’s also a great character driven movie .
The life of the main character ( Denis Quaid ) is n’t the life the majority of us lead … but I think on many levels there are a lot of us who can identify and relate with what he ’s experiencing on a general level … we ’re all holding our own lives back , paralyzed by fear of taking a chance … damn I loved this flick .
AND NOW FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION , I PRESENT TO YOU , SADLY , THE WORST FILMS OF 2008 SO FAR
# 1 – MEET THE SPARTANS
I throw up just a little everytime I have to even type the title .
Check out Doug Nagy ’s famous video review of it here .
# 2 – THE LOVE GURU
Should have just called it “ Austin Powers 4 With A Different Accent And Without The Humor ” .
Myers … what happened to you dude ?
# 3 – WITLESS PROTECTION
Come on , the movie stars Larry the Cable Guy … what were you expecting ?
The title of this movie should have stopped after the first word .
# 4 – OVER HER DEAD BODY
Turns out Eva Longoria actually can’t act or attract an audience and just fluked out with Housewives .
Wow this movie SUCKED !
Why did Paul Rudd agree to be in this ?
# 5 – DRILLBIT TAYLOR
I guess not everything Seth Rogen writes is gold … sometimes it ’s pure shit … especially when he just rips off his own Super Bad characters .
# 6 – PROM NIGHT
See that look on the girl ’s face in the poster ?
Yeah , that was most of us after realizing we paid money to see it .
# 7 – YOU DON’T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN
Title should have been “ You Should n’t Go See The Zohan ”
# 8 – FOOLS GOLD
Just because the duo worked in “ how to lose a guy ” , does n’t mean you can just put them in anything piece of garbage .
# 9 – SPEED RACER
Apparently the Matrix brothers went to the “ George Lucas School of Post Phantom Menace Film Making ” and figured flashy visual effects would cover a horrible piece of crap movie .
# 10 – THE EYE
Do yourself a favor and just stick to the original Asian version .
SHOCKING NEWS !!!!
Jessica Alba ca n’t act !
Who would have thought ?
So there you have it .
Head into the comments section and discuss the list , what you would have taken off , and what you would have added .
Have fun , and enjoy the fireworks tonight !
Magnesium : Survival Mineral for a Stress - Filled World
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi

These are troubling times economically .
Some people may find they withstand the stress that comes with financial pressures while others have difficulty coping .
But just how do you handle the news that $ 14.8 trillion in U.S. home mortgages are outstanding — 40 % more than the entire national debt ?!
This is an unavoidable economic nightmare .
According to a recently published survey of 1137 employed U.S. adults ( ComPsych Corp - Reuters Oct. 27 , 2008 ) , most Americans are losing sleep over news of a declining economy , increased cost of food and energy , rising unemployment , mortgage foreclosures and plunging home values .
The study said 9 of 10 respondents were losing sleep over economic turmoil .
Based upon evidence published over many years , it is not surprising to learn that prolonged economic prosperity and declining unemployment , over at least a decade , is a fundamental feature of declining mortality rates .
This has been the experience of most the Baby Boomers who were born after the Great Depression of the 1930’s .
The nightmare that may not go away
The opposite is true in more stressful economic times .
A prolonged economic decline raises mortality rates .
We may not wake up from this economic nightmare anytime soon .
Professor Andrew Clare of the Cass Business School in Britain says home prices are not likely to return to peak levels till 2023 .
[ www.money.co.uk Oct. 15 , 2008 ]
Regardless of whether Professor Clare is correct in his estimation of when home values will rebound , it appears many people are in for a prolonged period of economic stress .
Will chronic worry induce health problems which then impair the ability to survive , economically and physically ?
People often attribute a prolonged illness to a period of emotional or financial stress .
There is some truth to this belief .
There are physiological linkages to economic stress and unemployment evidenced by weakened immunity , sleep disturbance , and even sudden - death heart attacks .
One study shows that chronically unemployed workers exhibited lower NK ( natural - killer ) cell counts ( a type of white blood cell that kills invading germs and cancer cells ) compared to testing periods after they were employed .
Employment brought about a 44 — 72 % recovery of immune function .
[ Psychosomatic Medicine 69 : 225—34 , 2007 ]
In 1971 researcher M. Harvey Brenner PhD unequivocally showed declining rates of employment were followed by striking increases in heart disease mortality rates .
The following chart shows declining employment produced up to a 10 - fold relative increase in heart disease mortality .
[ Journal American Public Health Assn 61 : 606— 11 , 1971 ; International Journal Epidemiology 34 : 1214 — 21 , 2005 ]
Dr. Brenner has also conducted studies showing that in a declining economy where unemployment rates are high , a segment of people may reach for alcoholic spirits to deal with anxiety .
In good economic times , wine and beer consumption is higher .
[ The American Journal of Public Health December 1975 , Vol. 65 .
No. 12 ]
To make matters worse , not only do people under economic stress sometimes turn to over - consumption of alcohol , alcohol itself depletes the body of magnesium , an essential mineral the body needs to deal with mental or emotional stress .
[ Magnesium Trace Elements 10 : 263—68 , 1991 — 92 ]
A circuitous syndrome
The vicious circle of economic stress , lack of sleep , diminished immunity and magnesium depletion is evident upon an examination of the medical literature .
Animals placed on a magnesium deficient diet will commonly develop disorganized sleep and periods of wakefulness .
[ Neuropsychobiology 27 : 237—45 , 1993 ]
Sleep problems occur more frequently as adults age , making it increasingly difficult to deal with stress .
Studies show magnesium supplementation partially reverses age - related sleep abnormalities .
[ Pharmacopsychiatry 35 : 135—43 , 2002 ]
Chronic mental or physical stress may serve as a trigger for a heart attack or a stroke .
A study of college students who were sleep deprived while studying for final exams found that stress cut the concentration of magnesium in red blood cells in half and impaired the ability of blood vessels to widen ( dilate ) to control blood pressure .
[ Clinical Cardiology 27 : 223— 27 , 2004 ]
Lack of sleep can lead to chronic fatigue which is associated with sudden - death heart attack .
Chronically sleep - deprived adults commonly develop magnesium shortages which are also associated with a tendency for blood cells to clot , which is what causes strokes and heart attacks .
[ Clinical Cardiology 20 : 265—68 , 1997 ]
Magnesium to the rescue
Magnesium levels can often define how the human body responds to stress .
Over a decade ago Dr. Mildred Seelig described how stress triggers release of hormones from the adrenal glands that liberate stored fats and sugars into the blood circulation .
Higher - than - normal circulating levels of cholesterol and blood sugar are characteristic of chronically - stressed modern humans .
Dr. Seelig noted that high intake of fat and calcium ( western diets are rich in dairy calcium ) intensifies magnesium deficiency , especially under stress .
Ditto for birth control pills , estrogen replacement or water pills ( diuretics ) .
A high calcium / low magnesium state increases the release of stress hormones from the adrenal glands , which further depletes magnesium from the heart muscle and favors the development of blood clots which cause sudden mortal heart attacks .
[ Journal American College Nutrition 13 : 429 — 46 , 1994 ]
Americans typically consume 3 - to - 5 times more calcium ( 800 — 1200 milligrams ) than magnesium ( 175—250 milligrams ) .
While green leafy vegetables , chocolate and nuts provide magnesium , the diet cannot easily make up for this shortage .
Magnesium supplementation in humans has been reported to reduce the occurrence of irregular heart beat , heart pain , nervousness , sleep disorders and irritability .
[ Annals Academy Medicine Stetin ( Poland ) 2002 ; 48:85 —97 ]
Magnesium supplementation in the form of magnesium taurate or glycinate has been shown to improve cases of anxiety , insomnia , fatigue and even mental depression .
[ Medical Hypotheses 67 : 362—70 , 2006 ]
Which form of magnesium is best ?
Magnesium oxide is the most common and economical form of magnesium sold as a dietary supplement but only about 4 % of magnesium oxide is absorbed and it will not raise blood levels .
[ Magnesium Research 14 : 257— 62 ]
It is a wonder why mag oxide is even sold in stores .
Magnesium taurate , glycinate , citrate , gluconate are better absorbed forms .
[ Magnesium Research 18 : 215 — 23 , 2005 ]
Magnesium citrate does not need stomach acid for absorption and therefore can be taken in between meals or at bedtime and serves as an excellent alkalinizer for adults who experience acid heartburn at bedtime .
[ Magnesium Research 16:183—91 , 2003 ]
Common magnesium dosage for adults is 200— 400 milligrams per day .
Taking too much magnesium will induce loose stool .
Vitamin C , vitamin B5 , folic acid , fish oil and the amino acid taurine are other good anti-stress companions with magnesium .
Vitamin D and vitamin B6 improve utilization of magnesium .

After more than two decades apart , legendary stoner - comedy trailblazers Cheech & Chong are seeing double once again
When a mixed - race Calgary R & B band took a floater out of town in the early 1960s — run out by the mayor , no less , because of an overly rambunctious show at a local legion hall — it wound up in Vancouver , leaving this city with sole claim to the biggest stoner comedy act in show - business history .
By all accounts , the Calgary Shades were a tight band .
“ It was one of the best bands around , ” says Tommy Chong , the half - Chinese , half - Scottish guitarist for the Shades .
Chong would spend the next 10 years in the Lower Mainland , and would eventually meet Cheech Marin , the yang to his comedic yin .
“ The only trouble was we were limited .
And we never had proper management . ”
¦We were the Stones without an education , you know ? ”
Georgia Straight editor Charlie Smith discusses why the Straight ran a cover story on Cheech and Chong .
Chong was a decent musician , though .
In Vancouver he met a 16 - year - old kid , Henry Young , who had recently been given the boot from high school for riding his mufflerless Harley down the hall .
Young , who was just learning guitar , had a job at a garage , where he ’d park his hog .
Chong would walk by and admire it , and the two became friends .
“ I used to fix his car for him , and he showed me some hot guitar licks and that kind of stuff , ” Young says on the phone from his home in North Van .
“ As I plodded along , he gave me the odd gig here and there , subbing for him . ”
He must have been a decent teacher , because Young became a full - time musician and went on to play with jazz great Nina Simone on and off for 25 years .
Young , who eventually lived with Chong for a time , remembers Chong as more of a Casanova than a court jester in the early days .
“ You know something ?
To tell you the truth , he never was really that funny , ” he says .
“ Tommy was more or less a lady ’s man .
He was very good - looking , very charming . ” ¦I guess when he smoked dope , he was like a total different person .
And I guess he ’d seen his calling , which was to do the comedy thing . ”
Chong ’s wife , Shelby , a standup comic in her own right , is not as charitable in her description of the young musician .
Ten years his junior , the teenaged Shelby Fiddis lived next door to Chong and his first wife on East 15th Avenue .
“ He was married and bought a house with his wife , ” she says on the phone from Nevada the day Cheech and Chong were to be roasted at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival .
“ That ’s how I met him .
It ’s kind of a sick story .
Actually , Tommy was an old pervert in those days .
There you go .
He was very cool and wore suits , kept his hair back , wore tons of cologne .
He owned a club .
For him , it was love at first sight .
For me , it was like , ” ˜You know what ?
You ’re married .
I ’ll be your friend . ’
All my friends were little East 15th girls .
He ’d get us in the club for free .
So that ’s how it all started . ”
His Lothario reputation and musicianship notwithstanding , there was a hint about his future forte .
When Young was living with the Chong family , Chong would dictate what was on the tube .
“ He used to say , ” ˜ Oh , no , you ca n’t watch wrestling .
You gotta watch Dick Van Dyke , ’ ” Young remembers .
“ He was a fan of Dick Van Dyke .
He loved , loved Dick Van Dyke and that kind of stuff . ”
Chong went on to play in Big Daddy and the Bachelors , which morphed into Four Niggers and a Chink ( under pressure , the band was renamed Four Ns and a C. )
In the mid-60s , Chong became part of the legendary Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers — house band at the Elegant Parlour , an after - hours bistro run by Chong — which eventually signed with Motown Records .
In 1968 , he got into the comedy game by way of a topless improv troupe , City Works , that he formed at the Shanghai Junk , a Main and Pender strip joint managed by his brother .
Chong and first comedy partner David Graham , both longhaired hippies , were looking for a shorthaired straight man .
Enter Rich “ Cheech ” Marin , an American who was both writing for a Vancouver rock ’n ’ roll magazine called Poppin and delivering carpets .
The pair immediately hit it off and Marin was hired to join City Works .
Comedy and strippers ?
What could be better ?
“ Oh , man , it was so much fun you could n’t believe it ! ” Marin recalls .
“ We did n’t get discovered by anything other than perverts , but it was unbelievable . ”
Tommy Chong ’s wife , Shelby , reunited the team through a deception or two .
Tommy Chong ’s wife , Shelby , reunited the team through a deception or two .
When the troupe broke up , Chong and Marin stayed together .
Chong loved Marin ’s attitude more than anything else .
It was , for lack of a better description , American .
Chong always had a big dream of making it in show business .
He got a taste of it when Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers reached number 29 on the U.S. pop charts with a tune cowritten by Chong called “ Does Your Mama Know About Me ” ( which could easily have been about his relationship with Fiddis , because , she says , “ My mom did not have a clue , until he got famous , then she was like , ” ˜I like him now ’ ” ) .
But by then the band was no longer in business .
Comedy — not to mention THC — was in his blood now .
“ Canadians are weird , ” Chong says , talking to the Straight while driving with Marin from Portland to Eugene , Oregon , as part of their Cheech & Chong Light Up America and Canada tour , which hits the Queen Elizabeth Theatre on December 5 .
“ Canadians , they get too comfortable .
They do n’t want to move .
That ’s why bands break up — because you get good enough but no one wants to go down to the States ; no one wants to cut the record .
They ’re just content where they ’re at .
Cheech was from the States .
And I had a big urge to make it big time .
And I knew if you were going to make it big time , you had to go down to the States . ”
¦Cheech was the only one who still wanted to do it . ”
Chong thought music still might be his ticket to fame .
He and Marin put a band together , “ but our comedy was so strong that we never got around to playing any music , ” he says .
So after all of two shows as a duo in Vancouver , Cheech and Chong headed south with “ stars in our eyes and holes in our pockets ” , according to Marin .
It was a bold move , to be sure .
In 1969 , comedy was n’t yet booming , and drug humour certainly was n’t in the mainstream .
As big a fan as Shelby was , she could n’t see the success coming .
“ A Mexican and a hippie ? ” she asks .
“ Who ’d ever think ?
That ’s incredible when you think about it . ”
But it makes perfect sense in hindsight .
Although hip and sick comedy had taken hold through the old - school masters , there had yet to be comics speaking to the stoned generation .
The comedy team was embraced by their fans , grateful to see anyone reflecting their own lifestyles .
“ The audience said , ” ˜Hey , we got our own culture ; now we have our own comedians — our very own , ’ ” Chong says .
“ We were n’t comedians doing stoner material ; we were stoners being comedians . ”
While Vancouver supplied the drug references , Los Angeles allowed them to develop the other key aspect of their act .
“ We had pot material , ” Marin explains .
“ We did n’t have that whole Chicano element , because up in Vancouver there were n’t any Chicanos .
So in L.A. we started incorporating that into it , and it was great .
And all of a sudden the pot element really caught on . ”
But Cheech & Chong did n’t abandon its home town .
According to Chong , the duo developed some memorable bits at Oil Can Harry ’s , the Thurlow Street club that ran from 1966 to 1977 .
And at the peak of their career , when films came calling in 1978 , they made their celluloid arch nemesis an incompetent boob of a cop by the name of Sgt. Stedenko , a nod to Abe Snidanko , the legendary Vancouver RCMP narc .
The original movie trailer for Cheech and Chong 's 1978 hit , Up in Smoke .
“ Vancouver was very racist , very , very racist , ” Chong says .
“ And they had these cops imported from Ireland and Scotland . ”
¦They had a right - wing approach to everything .
Like , I had friends do time — a year in jail — for selling a dime bag of weed .
That kind of thing .
And Snidanko , the guy that ’s in Up In Smoke , he was head of the narcs in Vancouver and he was always trying to bust us for smoking pot or anything .
That ’s why I made him famous . ”
But fame had its drawbacks .
“ When he got famous , he got shipped off to Turkey for 17 years .
Then he came back and he was on the force for a while , and then they finally retired him .
The narcs here called me down in L.A. and had me autograph a poster and send it up for his retirement present , ” Chong says with a laugh .
Cheech & Chong broke up in 1985 .
Like an old married couple , they eventually wore each other down .
In interviews they gave individually , it seemed like they might never get back together .
In 2006 , Marin told the Straight : “ It ’s two real strong personalities that clash .
If we ever want to do anything else , we have to figure out a way around that clash .
But at some point , it ’s just not worth the trouble . ”
Today Chong says , “ We were working too hard .
That ’s a catch - 22 , you know ?
You ’ve got a lot of money but you got no time to enjoy it .
And so you have to break up the band or break up the comedy team or whatever .
Then you have too much time and not enough money . ”
Tommy Chong interviewed on MSNBC in June 2007 about Paris Hilton arrest 's for drunk driving .
" Not exactly what you expected , was it ? "
Now , thanks to a whole bunch of money and some nifty shenanigans from Shelby and their son Paris , Cheech & Chong are back .
There had been plans to reunite in the past few years , but the two would always start bickering and nothing would happen .
“ We sort of took over Tommy ’s e-mails and I had my son answer [ Marin ] without him knowing it , ” Shelby explains .
“ Tommy had written this kinda not really nasty e-mail , but saying some things that if you were the least bit sensitive , you ’d get upset .
So I said , ” ˜Paris , forget it .
Erase it . ’
He said , ” ˜You ’re kidding , Mom . ’
I said , ” ˜Yes !
Just do it . ’
So we did it .
And the next thing you know , Cheech wrote him a nice e-mail back . ”
And , of course , the money eased any potential conflict .
“ It ’s twice the fun for half the work .
I love it , ” Chong says .
“ We spread out the work and we get paid a lot of money .
It ’s great ; it ’s win - win all the way . ”
They also reached deep to find what drew them together in the first place .
“ We decided not to argue any more , ” Marin says .
“ Things that went on , went on , and let ’s see what we can do in the future .
And there was enough money there . ”
He laughs .
“ We both realized that we each had half of a treasure map and we could not access the treasure without putting those two halves together . ”
So on September 5 , Cheech & Chong made their triumphant return , after more than two decades apart .
According to Marin , the first time back on - stage , in Ottawa , was incredible .
“ It was great !
It was like we had never left .
Like we ’d been off weeks , not 30 years . ”
The tour , which Marin wanted to call Catch Them Before They Croak , keeps on rolling until March .
A movie is also in the works .
But will they be at each other ’s throats before then ?
“ No , not at all , ” Shelby insists .
“ They love each other and they ’re so happy . ”
And she is taking no credit for getting the act back together .
“ It was meant to happen , ” Shelby says .
“ They both wanted to .
They just needed a little nudging here and there .
You know how that happens .
They have that magic .
And who knows what that is ?
Who knows ?
When they get together , it ’s just magic . ”

Before I wrote the latest version of the Mythosa PDF ( well , version 1.0 at least ) , I was trying to determine a new format that was both useful and practical .
Generally , campaign books follow a fairly standard design that we ’re all pretty familiar with by now : some sort of summary introduction ( sometimes with a bit of fiction that is usually terrible ) , then an extensive chapter on the world ’s history that will mostly be ignored , a chapter that goes into way more detail than necessary on the political entities of the world , another one fleshing out the religions , and then others that vary but cover things like whyelves are different , and what the various organizations and factions are , possibly a bunch of new mechanical elements ( for games like D&D or Pathfinder this would include new monsters , new magic items , new spells , new feats , etc . ) .
Now , let me make it clear that I ’m a fan of campaign setttings ; I love reading up on n …
Vid The US Missile Defence Agency and American aerospace behemoth Lockheed is chuffed to announce that they have carried out successful hover tests of a Multiple Kill Vehicle space interceptor system this week .
Here 's a vid of the test , courtesy of the missile - defence people and YouTube ( remember you need Flash and a multimedia - friendly sysadmin to view these ) :
The test took place at the National Hover Test Facility at Edwards Air Force Base in California .
To give an idea of scale , the module is rising to approximately 7 metres ( 23 feet ) in the video , according to Lockheed .
The idea of the multiple kill vehicle is to allow a single missile - defence interceptor rocket to take out several objects in space , rather than just one .
An enemy ballistic missile can easily throw a whole volley of stuff at the USA - such a " threat cluster " might easily include multiple nuclear warheads as well as decoys designed to frustrate the defences .
Not even America can afford to fire an interceptor rocket at every single object deploying from an enemy missile .
This is a major criticism levelled at the entire missile defence programme : that it can never realistically defend against missiles equipped with decoys and / or multiple warheads .
Hence the multiple kill vehicle concept , which would let one interceptor hit more than one target .
The MKV tested this week is the " L " version from Lockheed ( there is also a parallel " R " job being built at Raytheon , on the theory that if one design does n't work the other might * ) .
The MKV-L uses a central command vehicle equipped with a telescope for scanning the threat cluster , which carries its swarm of smaller kill vehicles into action .
Like the existing one - shot kill modules it works essentially by holding itself exactly in the path of the oncoming warheads and decoys , destroying them using their own kinetic energy .
Any machine which is going to be able to get in the way of a nuclear warhead barrelling around the planet at thousands of miles per hour should be more than capable of hovering with some precision under its own power inside the atmosphere , and as the vid makes clear the MKV - L carrier can do this at least .
According to the MDA it also " recognised and tracked a surrogate target " and transmitted video and flight telemetry during the test .
Both the MKV-L and the parallel MKV- R will need to jump over plenty more hurdles before becoming operational , however .
The obstacles will probably be political and financial as much as technical .
There is a strong body of scepticism in America regarding the desirability and feasibility of the entire Missile Defence effort , and the agency 's friends fear that the new president may severely cut its funds - or perhaps even shut it down altogether .
Even if the MDA survives , the big ground - based midcourse interceptor rockets which are to be first to carry the MKV smartswarms may not - the GBIs are one of the agency 's lamer ducks , along with the jumbo - jet laser cannon .
However , both Raytheon and Lockheed envisage putting their MKVs into the more popular Standard SM - 3 naval space interceptor at some stage , so the kit might survive even in the event of a missile - defence cuts bloodbath .
For now , though , only Barack Obama could really tell you more . ®
* And also the theory that everyone deserves some of the pork .
The proponents of Prop 8 usurped the role of the Legislature by putting the right for same - sex couples to marry directly on the ballot .
Two Equality California - sponsored resolutions will make it official state policy , when they are approved by the Legislature , that Prop 8 should be overturned .
Write your legislators now to urge them to support the invalidation of Prop 8 and vote for SR 7 ( Leno ) and AR 5 ( Ammiano ) .
Prop 8 eliminates the fundamental right to marry and allows a slim majority to take away the equal protections of a minority , which violates one of the founding principles of our Constitution .
The resolutions state the measure should have been approved by a two - thirds vote in the Legislature before going to voters .

A little while back , NVIDIA brought us the news that Mirror 's Edge for the PC would feature PhysX support and include some neat effects physics .
Effects physics , as you may recall , is the physical simulation of things that do n't impact gameplay but simply enhance the visual impact of a game .
This can range from particle systems to persistent debris enhanced destructibility or more accurate simulation of fluids , smoke or other volumetric effects .
The impact is in immersiveness but it does n't bring game changing aspects of hardware accelerated physics to the table quite yet .
And we have n't seen anything , until Mirror 's Edge , that looked promising in terms of adding anything really compelling to a game .
The previous video we posted showed some nice potential , but we still have n't gotten the opportunity to play with it ourselves and really feel the difference .
We requested a side - by - side video hoping to get a better handle on what , exactly , is improved in Mirror 's Edge .
NVIDIA delivered .
Here 's the original video of Mirror 's Edge we posted .
Here is the side by side video showing better what DICE has added to Mirror 's Edge for the PC with PhysX .
Please note that the makers of the video ( not us ) slowed down the game during some effects to better show them off .
The slow downs are not performance related issues .
Also , the video is best viewed in full screen mode ( the button in the bottom right corner ) .
The effects in there can be simulated on either a CPU or an NVIDIA GPU .
The advantage to the GPU is performance and NVIDIA indicates that even an Intel Core i7 processor will have a tough time without GPU support .
So these effects are n't anything we 've never seen before , but it certainly looks like there is just a lot more of it in Mirror 's Edge ( and not in that really bad too many particles / too much debris sort of way ) .
The glass breaking itself honestly looks the same ( or close enough ) to us , but the persistent particles are where it 's at .
Having a little debris stick around and be affected by the character is a nice touch .
The cloth , plastic and tarp effects are what look like the real icing on the cake in the game though .
The complete absence of the cloth objects when physics is disabled makes an already sparse looking world look pretty empty by comparison .
We still want to really get our hands on the game to see if it feels worth it , but from this video , we can at least say that there is more positive visual impact in Mirror 's Edge than any major title that has used PhysX to date .
NVIDIA is really trying to get developers to build something compelling out of PhysX , and Mirror 's Edge has potential .
We are anxious to see if the follow through is there .
Extending this story is the fact that today NVIDIA is announcing that EA and 2 K games have both licensed PhysX and will be working with NVIDIA to include the technology in future titles they publish .
All EA and 2 K development studios will now have license to develop with PhysX for all platforms .
This means Mirror 's Edge may not be the only EA title going forward to get the PhysX treatment , and 2 K will bring PhysX to the table with Borderlands ( which is being developed by Gearbox ) .
It 's no secret that NVIDIA wants effects physics and PhysX specifically to become the next big thing .
The fact that this game enables all the effects to be run on any hardware at whatever performance it can manage is a very good move .
Only enabling the effects with PhysX hardware present is n't the way to get more developers to adopt the technology .
If other publishers and developers start to pick up and extend this technique of including effects physics , we could start seeing physics hardware start to live up to its potential .
It may be until we have a physics API that is hardware accelerated on all platforms before we really see ubiquitous use in games , but at least NVIDIA and some game developers our there are doing what they can to move the industry forward in the meantime .
That does n't mean we 'll blindly be happy with the way developers use the technology , or that we 'll talk about PhysX as a must have feature until there are games that make it true .
But moving forward is always a chicken and egg problem and we are happy to see NVIDIA staying behind hardware accelerated physics DICE actually trying to do something interesting with it .
" We do not ask for , or want your love , " Ernest Michel , honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors , said in a statement .
His parents died at Auschwitz .
The church says it has honored the agreement .
Members will not perform baptisms or other rites for Holocaust victims , except in cases when they have living descendants who are Mormon .
Holocaust survivors walked away from talks with the Mormon church on Monday regarding posthumous baptism of Jews killed in Nazi concentration camps , insisting that Mormons have repeatedly violated a 13 - year - old moratorium on the rite .
Bridging a Jewish - Mormon rift ;
Grandpa 's baptism opens door
Published : September 21 , 2008
Grandpa 's arms always offered the warmest embrace .
But he had an iron fist when it came to being Jewish .
Having watched his parents shun his brother Al for marrying a non-Jew , Grandpa did n't marry my Christian grandmother until she had converted to Judaism .
Later , my grandfather insisted that a rabbi marry my mom and dad .
And he boycotted his sons ' weddings when they both married Catholics .
So imagine the shock when I learned that my late grandfather had been posthumously baptized a Mormon .
The news revealed nothing about my grandfather .
After all , the baptism was n't his idea .
Instead , it opened my eyes to the role of free will in the belief system of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , commonly called the Mormon Church .
And it gave me a new perspective on a dilemma that generations ago nearly tore my family apart .
For years , the " Mormon side " of the family had been no more than shadowy characters in our genealogical soap opera .
The " Mormon cousins , " as they came to be known , were the descendants of my great - uncle Al , who for years supposedly did not speak to his family because of the Christian woman he chose to be his wife .
The whole saga served as a cautionary tale for many of us about placing religious allegiance above family .
Moral of the story : Family came first .
Eventually , my great - grandfather made amends with his son Al .
But this was late in life , and by this time even my great - uncle had become a grandfather himself .
There was something else : Uncle Al had found Mormonism .
And so , another faith entered the clan , a faith that valued family and welcomed new converts with open arms .
When I finally met my great - uncle and cousins four years ago , I knew we were related just from the same quirky sense of humor we shared .
We had the same family stories , too , even some of the same photos in the family albums .
And it was while flipping through those albums filled with family trees that I learned the news .
Next to the names of my grandmother and grandfather were dates of their births , their deaths and their baptisms .
My cousins do n't archive family history for only sentimental reasons .
They do so for a theological purpose .
The Mormon Church calls on its members to pour their energies into the salvation of all people -- including those no longer on earth .
To make sure every human being has a chance to reunite with God and family in heaven , Mormons baptize the dead by proxy , a practice my cousin describes as a sacred " power of attorney . "
Mormons trace their unique custom of baptizing the dead to the New Testament .
In one of his letters to the Corinthians , the Apostle Paul wrote : " Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ?
Why are they then baptized for the dead ? "
The verse confuses a lot of Catholics and Protestants .
But for Mormons it makes perfect sense .
They believe Christianity 's intent was restored through their church in 1830 .
They also believe God would not deny that good news to previous generations .
So to be fair , everyone should get another chance in the next life to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ , and that offer is proffered through baptism .
My cousins say they have lost count of how many posthumous baptisms they have performed , estimating the number to be in the hundreds .
The church tracks them in the International Genealogical Index , a database of more than 700 million names that includes celebrities , popes and dictators .
It also lists Holocaust victims , which has led to no shortage of tension between Mormons and Jews .
In 1995 , Mormons responded to protests from the Jewish community by promising to stop posthumously baptizing Jews without the consent of their family members .
In 2004 , the church promised to remove the names of Holocaust victims who had been added to the index without consent from their relatives .
For many Jews , posthumous baptisms evoke thousands of forced conversions during pogroms and the Holocaust .
It 's one thing to offer prayers for someone .
It 's quite another to seemingly seal their fate without consent .
But Mormons contend that proxy baptism does n't automatically make a person Mormon .
As my cousins explained , the baptisms simply give my grandparents a choice .
Choice is a central tenet to the Mormon faith .
They believe God chose to send his spiritual children to earth to exercise free will by enduring the test of mortality .
That freedom or ability to choose does not end when people die .
Even if people in the spirit world no longer have flesh and blood , they still possess the same ego , personality and intellect , which means Grandma and Grandpa " can turn up their noses at this if they want , " my cousin said .
Because Mormons believe baptism and other sacred rites are required to enter the kingdom of heaven , they perform the rites by proxy " just in case . "
I imagined my grandfather downright mad at the arrogance of presuming he would abandon what he had devoted his life to preserving .
But when I told my mother about the baptism and braced myself for a flood of emotions , she surprised me .
" Mom and Dad felt that any blessings bestowed upon them ... long distance could n't hurt a thing , " she said .
Turns out , according to my cousins , my grandfather remained close to his brother regardless of the family tumult .
He lent his brother the car and cash he needed to marry .
And he helped put some of Al 's grandchildren through medical school .
No matter how stubborn my grandfather continued to be with his own children , he always regretted the way his brother had been treated and tried to make up for it until his dying day .
My cousin said the baptism was done out of love , as a way to honor my grandparents .
" It is the epitome of not forgetting somebody , " he said .
It does come down to choice .
We have the freedom to choose whether religion will unite us or divide us .
In the past , my family chose to let it divide .
Faced with this revelation , I now realize how torn they must have been .
Still , I choose to learn from that mistake and appreciate my cousins ' gesture .
Heeding that lesson , to me , is the epitome of not forgetting .
WASHINGTON  The Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki on Friday appeared to be on the verge of an agreement that would spell out the conditions under which American troops would remain in Iraq and a timeline for their eventual departure .
Simultaneous activity in Washington and Baghdad signalled that an accord was near on a security arrangement , formally called a status of forces agreement , to govern the conduct of American forces in Iraq for the remainder of their time there .
Aides to leading members of Congress were being briefed at the White House , while Mr. Maliki was briefing his council on national security in Baghdad .
Moreover , a news briefing has been scheduled for Saturday in Baghdad , a sign that the executive branches of the United States and Iraq have ironed out their differences on an eventual American withdrawal .
“ So we are getting closer to having this agreement worked out , ” President Bush ’s spokeswoman , Dana Perino , said at a Friday news briefing .
“ So we anticipate being able to hopefully have something soon .
But I will stress to you , it ’s not finalized yet . ”
An Open Letter to Senator Obama and the Democratic Leadership : On Election Night , DO NOT CONCEDE !
" Eight years is too much " is how Barack Obama explained why we must win the coming election and begin to restore America .
But , even if we receive the most votes , will we win the election ?
DO NOT CONCEDE !
Both of the last two elections were conceded by the Democratic presidential candidate .
The 2004 election was handed to George Bush while votes were still being counted in closely - fought Ohio .
While the 2000 election was contested to the Supreme Court , it too was ultimately conceded to Bush " for the good of the country . "
Some good .

WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton has offered to submit future charitable and business activities to strict ethics reviews if his wife , New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton , were nominated as secretary of state , according to Democrats familiar with the deliberations .
He has also agreed for the first time to disclose many of the previous donors to his efforts .
Mrs. Clinton is on a short list of names for secretary of state .
A small team of aides to President - elect Barack Obama and the Clintons has been negotiating for the past two days in Washington , say people involved in the talks .
The goal is to try to overcome concerns that the former president 's global business and philanthropic activities could appear to pose conflicts of interest between the Obama administration 's foreign policy and the private financial interests of the family of the country 's top diplomat .
Under the emerging agreement , Mr. Clinton would disclose the identities of all new donors to his charitable foundation .
He would also make public " major " past contributors -- a term that has yet to be defined .
The cloak of secrecy over the former president 's foreign financial ties stirred widespread criticism when his wife was running for president .
Mr. Clinton would also seek clearance from two separate entities -- the White House counsel and the State Department 's ethics chief -- on all donations to his charitable foundation , the William J. Clinton Foundation , which includes his presidential library and the Clinton Global Initiative .
He would follow the same procedure before agreeing to any paid speeches , according to people close to the talks .
Additionally , Mr. Clinton would step away from his foundation 's daily operations -- all significant concessions for his wife , one person added .
" Bill Clinton will not be the obstacle to whether Hillary gets this job or not , " said one Democrat familiar with the situation .
Another person added : " He 's willing to be as transparent as the Obama world wants . "
The next time a loved one brandishes a virtual shotgun in their favorite video game , take heart .
That look of glee , says a new study , likely stems from the healthy pleasure of mastering a challenge rather than from a disturbing craving for carnage .
Research to be published online January 16 in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin shows that , contrary to popular belief , violence does not make video games more enjoyable .
The study by investigators at the University of Rochester and Immersyve Inc. , a player - experience research firm , found that for many people , gore actually detracts from a game 's " fun factor , " decreasing players ' interest and desire to purchase a game .
When designing the next generation of video games , added the authors , developers should remember : blood does not help the bottom line .
" For the vast majority of players , even those who regularly play and enjoy violent games , violence was not a plus , " explained Andrew Przybylski , a University graduate student and lead author of the study .
" Violent content was only preferred by a small subgroup of people that generally report being more aggressive , " added Przybylski , however , even these hostile players did not report increased pleasure when playing more gruesome games .
Through two online surveys and four experimental studies , the researchers showed that people stayed glued to games mainly for the feelings of challenge and autonomy they experience while playing .
Both seasoned video gamers and novices preferred games where they could conquer obstacles , feel effective , and have lots of choices about their strategies and actions .
These elements , said coauthor Richard Ryan , a motivational psychologist at the University , represent " the core reasons that people find games so entertaining and compelling .
Conflict and war are a common and powerful context for providing these experiences , but it is the need satisfaction in the gameplay that matters more than the violent content itself . "
Scott Rigby , president of Immersyve and a co-investigator in the study , said the findings should be of practical help to the game development industry .
" Much of the debate about game violence has pitted the assumed commercial value of violence against social concern about the harm it may cause , " explained Rigby .
" Our study shows that the violence may not be the real value component , freeing developers to design away from violence while at the same time broadening their market . "
To assess players ' experiences on a wide variety of games , the authors conducted two survey studies involving 2,670 frequent video game players .
Participants rated their current favorite games based on statements like " When moving through the game world , I feel as if I am actually there " and " I would buy a sequel to this game . "
The surveys focused on players ' needs satisfaction , immersion , and enjoyment , based on a psychometric model developed by Immersyve called the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction ( PENS ) .
Respondents were 89 percent male and between 18 and 39 years of old .
Four additional experimental studies involving more than 300 undergraduates allowed the investigators to study the effects of violence under controlled conditions .
In three of the tests , researchers modified the video programs to create violent or non-violent formats of the same game .
One study used the commercially available game Half - Life 2 and assigned subjects to play either a bloody battle against computer - controlled adversaries or a low violence alternative , in which the robots were tagged and teleported serenely back to base .
Another study using House of the Dead III varied the gore level from no blood to realistic wounds and graphic violence .
A fourth experimental study took a closer look at subjects ' aggressive tendencies .
Using a 29 - item scale , including such statement as " Given enough provocation , I may hit another person " and " I sometimes feel like a powder keg ready to explode , " the study measured participants ' hostility before having them play the bloodier version of House of the Dead III .
Across all of the studies and both surveys , added violent content added little and in come cases detracted from the enjoyment reported by players .
Violent content was preferred , though not enjoyed more , by a small subgroup of people who scored high in aggression traits .
" Video games , " concluded the authors , " are enjoyable , immersive , and motivating insofar as they offer opportunities for psychological need satisfaction , specifically experiences of competence and autonomy , to which violent content per se is largely unrelated . "
This same research team has been studying the factors that motivate people to play games of all types , both as casual players or intense long - term fans .
" Initially , many games are perceived as being fun , " Rigby says .
" Much of our work is focused on understanding when games reach to deeper levels of satisfaction that often sustain engagement over time , and to identify both the healthy and unhealthy aspects of that play . "

Tamil Tiger rebels have been blamed for the attack
Officials in Sri Lanka say at least two people , including a policeman , have been killed in a bomb attack in the eastern town of Batticaloa .
A police spokesman told the BBC that the bomb was planted on a bicycle parked close to the main police station in the town centre .
Six civilians , including three school children , were among the injured .
The authorities blamed Tamil Tiger rebels for the incident .
There has been no reaction from the rebels .
The rebels have recently suffered a series of military defeats at the hands of government troops .
Boat attack
Wednesday morning 's blast killed a policeman and a civilian , the army said .
It also injured one police officer , four school children and six others , according to military spokesman Brig Udaya Nanayakkara .
The attack came a day after the Sri Lankan navy said it had destroyed four Tamil Tiger military boats in a sea battle off the country 's north - eastern coast .
A pro-rebel website said the Tigers attacked a Sri Lankan convoy and destroyed a navy attack craft .
The Tamil Tigers have been fighting for a separate homeland for 25 years .
At least 70,000 people have been killed in the insurgency .
The rebels had established a de facto state squeezed between government - controlled Jaffna in the north and the rest of the country .
But the latest military offensive has forced the rebels to give up much of their territory .
Max Butler had an audacious plan to rule the black market in stolen credit cards .
But angry hackers and pesky Feds had other ideas .
Spread Photo : Mark King ; Mugshot of Max Butler : Courtesy Santa Clara County SheriffThe heat in Max Butler 's safe house was nearly unbearable .
It was the equipment 's fault .
Butler had crammed several servers and laptops into the studio apartment high above San Francisco 's Tenderloin neighborhood , and the mass of processors and displays produced a swelter that pulsed through the room .
Butler brought in some fans , but they did n't provide much relief .
The electric bill was so high that the apartment manager suspected Butler of operating a hydroponic dope farm .
But if Butler was going to control the online underworld , he was going to have to take the heat .
For nearly two decades , he had honed his skills as a hacker .
He had swiped free calls from local telephone companies and sneaked onto the machines of the US Air Force .
Now , in August 2006 , he was about to pull off his most audacious gambit yet , taking over the online black markets where cybercriminals bought and sold everything from stolen identities to counterfeiting equipment .
Together , these sites accounted for millions of dollars in commerce every year , and Butler had a plan to take control of it all .
Settling into his chair and resting his fingers on his keyboard like a concert pianist , Butler began his attack .
Most illegal online loot was fenced through four so - called carder sites — marketplaces for online criminals to buy and sell credit card numbers , Social Security numbers , and other purloined data .
One by one , Butler took them down .
( This story , like the rest of this article , has been reconstructed using court documents and conversations with friends and associates ; Butler declined to be interviewed . )
First , he breached their defenses , tricking their SQL database servers into running his own commands or simply slipping in with a hacked password .
Once inside , he sucked out their content , including the logins , passwords , and email addresses of everyone who bought and sold through the sites .
And then he decimated them , wiping out the databases with the ease of an arsonist flicking a match .
He worked for two straight days ; when he tired , he crashed out on the apartment 's foldaway bed for an hour or two , then got up and went back at it .
Butler sent an email under the handle Iceman to all the thieves whose accounts he had usurped .
Whether they liked it or not , he wrote , they were now members of his own site , CardersMarket.com .
In one bold stroke , Butler had erected one of the largest criminal marketplaces the Internet had ever seen , 6,000 users strong .
The takeover was all business .
The stolen - data market had become fractured across too many sites , and they were pocked with snitches and security holes .
By taking control of the entire underworld , Butler had created a marketplace he could trust .
Even more important , it satisfied his competitive urge .
Offline , Butler was a gentle giant with a generous nature and hippie sensibilities .
But in the privacy of his hidden redoubt , Iceman pursued his online enterprise with ruthless zeal .
He was n't after money , not really .
He just wanted to prove that he was smarter , bolder , and tougher than everyone else .
The hostile takeover was Butler 's crowning achievement , but it also marked the beginning of his downfall .
His actions made him a target of law enforcement , to whom he represented the epitome of a new kind of computer criminal : mercenary cybercrooks who were emerging as a far greater Internet scourge than recreational hackers .
The growth of carder forums allowed thieves around the world to purchase data , equipment , and services .
Since 2005 , hackers and corrupt insiders have stolen more than 140 million records from US banks and other companies , accounting for some $ 67 billion in losses each year , according to the FBI .
In 2002 , FBI director Robert Mueller listed cybercrime as one of the bureau 's top priorities , below only terrorism and foreign espionage .
Butler 's power grab planted him directly in the Feds ' kill zone .
In the days to come , his vanquished competitors raged against the forced merger , fought to regain their users , and staged limp counterattacks .
If Butler was at all intimidated by the forces mobilized against him , he did n't show it .
" Basically , " he wrote later , the consolidation " was long overdue . "
He was fearless and doomed , just as he had always been .
From the start , Max Butler , now 36 , struggled to find his place in the world .
The older of two children , he grew up in Meridian , Idaho , a computer geek in a rural town where rodeo champions got all the girls .
When he was 14 , his parents divorced .
Butler found a community in the local BBS scene .
Computers provided an alternate reality , a place where every problem could be solved by will , guile , or reason .
Hacking was even more exciting , adding an adventuresome , competitive dimension .
By high school , friends say , Butler was dabbling in computer and phone hacking , carting printouts of the hacker zine Phrack to class and phreaking free phone calls .
Max ButlerHe was also developing an aggressive streak .
A fit 6 ' 5 " , he was one of the few geeks who could stand up to the cowboy - hatted bullies who taunted his friends at every corner .
But he was n't just pugnacious ; he was troubled .
In his junior year , he broke into his high school , scrawled messages on the chalkboards , and sprayed a fire extinguisher in the halls before plundering the supply closet in the chemistry lab ; psychiatrists later diagnosed him with bipolar disorder .
In 1990 , his freshman year of college , his girlfriend of eight months told him she wanted to see other people .
Butler took the breakup badly , phoning her repeatedly and hinting at suicide .
When she visited him at his mother 's house to talk him down , he put his hands around her throat and said he would kill her .
Butler was charged with assault with a deadly weapon — his hands .
In 1991 , a jury found him guilty , and he received a harsh five - year sentence .
Butler emerged from prison in 1995 and tried to start over .
He eventually took a new name — Max Vision — and moved to the Bay Area , where a few fellow Idaho geeks had coalesced after college .
The group rented a mansion overlooking Half Moon Bay , a sleepy town on the Pacific 20 miles from Silicon Valley , where the dotcom economy was swelling to ripeness .
They transformed the house into a geek paradise , pimping it out with high - performance game machines and strewing Cat 5 cable through the halls .
When the sun went down , Butler celebrated his freedom at all - night raves in San Francisco .
At one , he met a cute college student named Kimi Winters and invited her to a party at the house the next night .
Six months later , they were married .
Now in his mid-twenties and thinking about settling down , Butler started a consulting business , renting himself out as a hacker for hire .
He earned more than $ 100 an hour performing penetration tests for corporate clients while also volunteering his whitehat skills for the FBI 's San Francisco office .
But it was n't enough .
For a real hacker , sniffing out a system 's defenses with the owner 's consent is like watching porn when you could be having sex .
And so , friends say , he spent his off - hours traipsing through private networks — the very kind of trespasses he spent his days defending clients against .
In spring 1998 , his double life collapsed .
Internet experts had found a security hole in the ubiquitous BIND name server daemon .
If left unpatched , the hole would allow attackers to seize control of hundreds of thousands of machines .
Butler took it upon himself to break into federal sites and fix the error .
While he was at it , though , he installed a small backdoor , leaving himself an entryway into government and military networks around the country .
Pop-ups informed Butler every time his backdoor finished installing , and soon his computer screen exploded with alerts : military bases , nuclear laboratories , the US Departments of Commerce , Transportation , and the Interior , even the National Institutes of Health .
Then , a few weeks later , there was a knock at the door .
It was the same FBI agents he'd been helping as a volunteer , accompanied by a young Air Force investigator who had traced Butler through his pop-up notifications .
Three years after he had emerged from jail with an opportunity to reboot his life , Butler was headed back inside .
In May 2001 , he was sentenced to 18 months in Taft federal prison .
Two months later , Winters told him over the phone that she wanted a divorce .
She 'd met someone else .
" I do n't know if you even think about the future anymore , " she said .
Butler shouted and pleaded .
In search of closure , his wife traveled to Taft , 300 miles southeast of San Francisco .
When Butler was brought in , he fruitlessly appealed to her to change her mind .
He did think of the future , he told her , and he'd been making plans .
" I 've been talking to some people , " he said , lowering his voice .
" People I think I could work with . "
Jeff Norminton was finishing an 11 - month stint at Taft for wire fraud when he met Butler .
He was struck by the affable geek 's obvious talent .
The duo took daily walks in the yard , an associate says , fantasizing about working together when they got out .
Butler could crack brokerage houses , where they 'd tap into trading accounts and drain them into off - shore banks .
One big haul and they'd have enough cash for the rest of their lives .
( Norminton declined to comment for this article . )
It 's the kind of talk hackers routinely indulge in when they hit the joint and mix with career criminals for the first time .
After they get out , the schemes are usually forgotten .
So it was for Butler , initially .
In 2002 , he was released from Taft to a halfway house in Oakland .
Ordered to get a job or go back to prison , Butler offered his services at discount prices .
" The last half - dozen employers I have had paid me at least $ 100 / hr for my time , " he wrote on a computer security job board .
" Now I am only asking for $ 6.75 . "
A Berkeley company answered his plea , and Butler moved in with his new girlfriend , Charity Majors — a sysadmin at a porn site who painted her fingernails the color of Skittles and wore contact lenses that tinted her eyes an impossible emerald .
The combination of low salary and expensive new apartment left him gasping for cash .
When Norminton called to continue their prison - yard planning , Butler listened .
Norminton wanted to hook Butler up with one of his associates .
Christopher Aragon had recently run an Orange County leasing company , had access to cash and , just as important , had a good reputation in the criminal underworld ; when he was 18 , he had driven the getaway car in a trio of Colorado bank robberies .
He served eight and a half years and never snitched .
Christopher AragonNorminton invited Aragon to San Francisco , where they met with Butler at a North Beach coffee shop .
" This is the guy who 's going to help fund our expedition , " Norminton told Butler with a grin .
The three talked for hours — Aragon and Butler were both vegetarians and shared Age of Aquarius philosophies — then headed to a nearby Holiday Inn , where Butler performed a demo , staging some rudimentary hacks .
Aragon was impressed .
Butler gave him a shopping list of equipment he'd need to get started , including a new laptop , military - grade crypto , and an antenna .
Butler had gotten out of jail just in time for the cybercrime gold rush .
In 2002 , the first generation of carder forums was infusing the underground with an entrepreneurial esprit de corps never before seen .
For the first time , an identity thief in Denver could buy stolen credit card numbers from a hacker in Moscow , send them to Shanghai to be turned into counterfeit cards , then pick up a fake driver 's license from a forger in Ukraine before hitting the mall .
But hacking from home was for idiots and teenagers ; it was too easy for law enforcement to trace an IP address and subpoena the ISP for the location .
So , according to Aragon , once a month he and Butler headed to downtown San Francisco , where the pair would check into a hotel — the Hilton , Westin , W , Hyatt — for up to a week at a time .
They would sneak Butler 's antenna into the room and mount it on a tripod duct - taped to the floor near the window .
Butler would putter for a while to locate a high - speed wireless connection with a strong signal that he could hop onto and use anonymously .
If he came up dry , Aragon ran down to the front desk to ask for a different room , explaining that he could n't get a cell phone signal or was too afraid of heights to remain on the 20th floor .
Aragon remembers that Butler , rusty from his time in prison , started by attacking easy targets : other hackers , a breed that had evolved as all teeth and no shell .
He lurked in online chat rooms , sniffing out the most vulnerable cybercrooks and tapping into their systems .
He vacuumed up everything — stolen identity information , passwords , PINs .
The most valuable goods were " dumps , " the magnetic - stripe data on the backs of credit cards , filched primarily by corrupt restaurant wait staff and gas station attendants wielding pocket - size skimmers .
Stealing credit card numbers was a way to dupe lenders without directly harming innocent consumers , who are n't held liable for fraud — an added benefit for the humanist Butler .
When Butler scored dumps , Aragon went to work , hurriedly stamping out bogus plastics using an embosser , a card printer , a heat foil press , and an MSR206 magstripe writer .
The cards entered Aragon 's assembly line as white plastic and emerged as near - perfect full - color forgeries , complete with holograms .
As soon as the ink was dry , Aragon and his friends went shopping for luxury items that could be easily fenced .
Timing was key ; they had to grab the freshest dumps , press them in plastic , and buy as much as they could before the crooks who had purchased or stolen the numbers maxed them out first .
After months of ripping off crooks , Butler started knocking over primary sources .
According to court documents , he picked his targets from the FDIC's Web site , choosing small regional banks and credit unions that could n't afford top - notch security and pulling down virgin card numbers .
He sold the goods to Aragon — for $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 a month — who , back in Orange County , hired a shadow staff : an assistant to help with card - printing and programming and pretty young women to shop at high - end department stores with his plastic .
Their job was to snap up designer handbags , jeans , shoes , and watches for resale on eBay in exchange for a percentage of the profits .
The work was easy to love ; the first time a new hire swiped one of Aragon 's cards and saw approved flicker on the PIN pad , she was hooked .
By late 2003 , Aragon 's enterprise was paying his rent and sending his oldest son to private school .
But as the money poured in , the onetime bank robber found less - wholesome uses for it .
Some members of the Orange County crew liked to party , Aragon says , and cocaine , ecstasy , and pot beckoned .
Aragon began vanishing with his comely employees for weekend bacchanals in Vegas .
( Butler preferred an ascetic lifestyle ; a big - screen TV was his only indulgence . )
Charity Majors and MaxSuccess introduced fractures into Butler and Aragon 's friendship .
Butler worried that his partner 's drug use would make him reckless , and he began pestering Aragon for a larger share of the profits .
In April 2004 , Aragon tried to pass a few suspicious cards at the front desk of the San Francisco W Hotel .
That slipup earned him an arrest , three years ' probation , and a lifetime ban from the W .
It was the kind of bullshit bust that happened to Aragon 's staff all the time — a local police matter with no serious follow - up investigation — but to Butler , it was unforgivably sloppy .
He started looking for other buyers for his wares .
For most cybercrooks , that would mean creating an account on Shadowcrew , a 4,000 - member carder site .
Butler logged in — as Iceman — but soon grew suspicious .
One of the site 's admins , who went by Cumbajohny , was encouraging members to use an invitation - only virtual private network to evade surveillance .
This gave Cumbajohny an exclusive peephole into members ' activities .
The offer apparently spooked Butler , who kept his distance .
Sure enough , four months later Cumbajohny was exposed as a snitch when the Secret Service rounded up 28 Shadowcrew members and shuttered the site .
Operation Firewall , as it was dubbed , was the largest - ever law enforcement operation against the computer underground .
US attorney general John Ashcroft declared the sting the first major victory in a war against carders .
Butler 's prudence had kept him safe .
Even though new online forums popped up , he decided to build his own , CardersMarket .
He incorporated the standard features : Vendors submitted their product to an approved reviewer , who ran test transactions .
Fake IDs or bogus plastics were scrutinized for fuzzy logos , missing microprint , and signature panels that could n't take ballpoint .
Buyers were rated on each transaction .
And vendors who did n't deliver what they promised saw the epithet " ripper " branded across their profile — the equivalent of a single - star review on eBay .
Butler assembled a team of handpicked admins — trusted forum capos with the power to delete posts , ban users , and appoint reviewers .
One of them , Gollumfun , had survived Operation Firewall and enjoyed a sterling reputation in the underworld .
Another , Zebra , was a teenager from New York who Butler thought could become a partner some day .
Butler also gave Aragon admin status — presumably a salve for the sting of Butler 's mercantile infidelity .
His dependence on admins may have been necessary , but it was increasingly risky .
In May 2000 , the US Sentencing Commission had changed the penalties for possession of stolen credit cards .
Previously , sentencing guidelines had punished thieves in proportion to how much money they stole .
That worked great with low - level credit card cashers but not at the top of the distribution chain , where kingpins sit on thousands of untapped accounts .
Letting them off the hook was like granting probation to a drug lord because his bricks of heroin had n't yet found their way into a junkie 's veins .
Under the new rule , every stolen card number , used or not , was valued at sentencing at an arbitrary minimum of $ 500 .
Get caught with 1,000 numbers — an afternoon 's work for a decent vendor — and you might as well have transferred $ 500,000 in cash , a crime worth about 10 years in the joint .
Byte for byte , stolen cards now carried more prison time than child porn .
CardersMarket was an instant success .
Butler ran the site under his Iceman identity and created two more usernames — Digits and Darkest — behind which he sold goods , Feds say .
Butler expanded from banks to credit card transaction processing centers , as well as small restaurants and retailers , where he became an expert at smuggling sniffers onto point - of - sale terminals .
He distributed price lists to potential buyers : $ 12 for Visa Classic , $ 19.50 for Visa Gold , $ 16.50 for MasterCard , $ 36 for American Express .
Inquire for volume discounts .
Within a year , CardersMarket had signed up 1,500 buyers , sellers , and scenesters , as many as any of its rival sites .
Butler wanted more .
A fluent Russian speaker — a young Mongolian immigrant named Tsengeltsetseg Tsetsendelger — was brought in to help snag users from Russian and Ukrainian forums .
As the operation grew , Aragon worried that Butler was losing focus on the ultimate goal , the big score that could catapult them both out of the crime business for good .
But while Aragon craved a return to life as a legitimate entrepreneur , he saw Butler indulging his aggressive tendencies .
Butler was n't looking to escape the criminal underworld — he had new plans to rule it .
Butler spent months plotting to infiltrate and overtake his four competitors , culminating in the two - day hackfest in his overheated safe house high above the Tenderloin .
The sites blinked out of existence , their thousands of forum posts later rematerializing on CardersMarket .
Iceman now had upwards of 6,000 users on his site , making it by far the biggest carder site on the Internet .
To cope with the inevitable backlash and the increased workload , Butler relied on a new admin , Th3C0 rrupted0ne — a well - regarded hacker who had helped run some of the sites Butler absorbed .
But not all ruffled feathers were so easily smoothed .
CardersMarket banned David " El Mariachi " Thomas , a former FBI operative , from the site .
The blackballing sent Thomas into a rage .
On public forums , he accused Iceman of working with law enforcement , calling him " Officer Ice " and " a fucking piece of shit on my shoes " and threatened to put a contract out on Iceman 's life .
The scuffle exposed a side of Butler that nobody had seen since Idaho .
" You better pray to your god that I am never outed , " he responded .
" Because not only will you look like even more of a jackass than you already do , but then I will have no inhibition about coming over and wringing your snitch punk neck . "
Thomas was n't the only one gunning for Iceman .
In October 2006 , a USA Today reporter contacted Butler for a story about the CardersMarket takeover and the fear that the consolidation could spark a new wave of cybercrime .
Butler , as Iceman , told him that CardersMarket was just a service he offered to the public , like craigslist .
" You do n't see me ... engaging in any commerce . "
Butler 's comments did n't make it into the piece , but Aragon was apoplectic when he heard about them .
He had watched as Butler burned hours squabbling with critics in the underground and pulling unprofitable , altruistic hacks like razing a kid - porn site .
Now he was giving press interviews ?
" You 've lost your fucking mind , " Aragon told him .
On September 29 , 2006 , some 500 employees of Capital One received an email from a reporter for Lending News named Gordon Reily , seeking an interview about " the recent leak of customer records from Capital One . "
In the email , Reily said he got their name from a report that ran in Financial Edge and included a link to the original article .
When the recipients clicked on the link — as about 125 of them did — they were sent to a blank page .
While they puzzled over the empty site , a hidden payload rocketed through Capital One 's firewall and onto their machines .
In reality , there 'd been no data leak at the fifth - largest US credit card issuer ; but Reily — or someone using that name — was working on making one happen .
When Capital
One security officials learned about the scam , they called the FBI , which referred it to the National Cyber - Forensics and Training Alliance .
Founded in 2002 , the nonprofit NCFTA acts as a Justice League for hacking , pulling FBI specialists and security personnel from banks and technology companies to share best practices and intelligence .
The FBI agents were n't surprised to find that financialedgenews.com had been registered under an alias .
But when they investigated the account records , they discovered it had been registered from the same account as another site they 'd been watching : CardersMarket.com .
The Feds had some history with Iceman , the mysterious founder of CardersMarket .
In 2006 , one of their agents , after months of work , had won a coveted admin spot on DarkMarket under the alias Master Splynter .
The government was preparing a massive sting — its biggest since Operation Firewall — through the site when , out of nowhere , Iceman shut it down and absorbed its members into CardersMarket .
Not only that , he had traced Splynter 's IP address to NCFTA offices and was telling everyone in the underground about the embryonic sting .
Now the Capital One attack implied that Iceman was n't just hosting a scurrilous Web site for cyberthieves .
He seemed to be a thief himself , and a sneaky one at that .
Butler acted as if he knew the Feds were after him .
In November 2006 , he declared Iceman 's retirement and let it be known that he had handed control of CardersMarket to Th3C0 rrupted0ne , then secluded himself .
Soon he took back the site under another handle , Aphex .
He boosted his physical security , switching safe houses to become a moving target .
But the Feds were working on a secret asset : Jonathan " Zebra " Giannone , the promising young hacker who had served as one of CardersMarket 's first admins .
Zebra had made a fatal mistake in June 2005 , when he sold 21 Bank of America platinum card numbers to Gollumfun for $ 600 .
Unbeknownst to Zebra , Gollumfun — whose real name was Brett Shannon Johnson — had recently been popped passing counterfeit checks in Charleston and agreed to serve as an undercover informant ; he'd been working out of the Secret Service 's Columbia office .
Butler had sniffed out the rat quickly and banned him , but not in time to save Zebra .
On March 8 , 2007 , the kid was found guilty of wire fraud and identity theft .
Brett Shannon JohnsonZebra was summoned from his cell in the Lexington County jail in South Carolina a week after his trial .
He instantly recognized the Secret Service agents : Bobby Kirby and Brad Smith had been Gollumfun 's handlers .
" We want to know who this guy Iceman is , " one of them demanded .
The agents called Zebra 's lawyer , who consented to an interview in the hope of winning leniency for his client .
In a series of meetings over the next three weeks , authorities say , Zebra told them everything he knew : Iceman lived in San Francisco , did a brisk business in dumps , sometimes used the alias Digits to sell his goods , and , most crucially , had a partner named Christopher Aragon .
The Secret Service did n't know much about Aragon , but the FBI had a file on him .
Back in 2005 , Jeff Norminton had been nabbed on a new fraud charge in Orange County .
While locked up , he willingly told the FBI all about Aragon and his partner Max Butler .
Investigators never acted on the information .
Now all the Feds had to do was get enough solid evidence on Aragon for a search warrant .
A month later , someone else beat them to it .
On Saturday , May 12 , Aragon was busted by the local police at a Bloomingdale 's 20 miles from his house in Capistrano Beach , California , along with an associate who was buying handbags with his fake cards .
The detectives got a search warrant for his home and a nearby warehouse and collected hundreds of cards , a computer , counterfeiting gear , and tasting portions of cocaine , pot , and ecstasy .
Using Aragon 's meticulous business records as a road map , they swept up his cashers and other confederates , making seven more arrests , including Aragon 's wife , Clara , who had been fencing handbags on eBay .
His mother took custody of the two boys , now 6 and 9 .
Aragon 's arrest appeared to frighten Butler .
He deleted Aragon 's CardersMarket account , ditched his cell phone , and found yet another safe house — the Oakwood Geary Courtyard , a corporate apartment building back in San Francisco 's Tenderloin district .
On June 7 , Butler checked out a red Mustang from his neighborhood Zipcar , loaded it with a computer and bag , and drove to the Oakwood .
He did n't notice the Secret Service agents watching from the street as he moved in .
__A month later , __Butler jolted awake , shot upright in bed , and blinked fretfully into the darkness of his apartment .
It was his girlfriend , Charity Majors ; she had crawled into bed next to him , trying in vain not to wake him .
Butler was growing more tense every day ; he had stopped exercising , and his health was suffering .
" Sweetie , you can't keep doing this , " Majors murmured . " You 're losing focus on who you are and what you 're doing . "
" You 're right , " he said .
" I 'm done . "
It was time to get out .
Butler 's supervised release was over , and getting a job would be easier now without his probation officer looking over his shoulder .
But he could n't bring himself to just abandon CardersMarket , and he did n't trust any of his remaining admins to take the reins .
Even Th3C0 rrupted0ne , who was devoting 14 hours a day to the site , sometimes behaved suspiciously .
Butler did n't know it , but he was running out of time .
In July and August , the Secret Service interviewed Tsetsendelger , his former Russian interpreter , who was on probation after getting caught with Aragon - produced gift cards at an Apple store in Emeryville , California .
Meanwhile the FBI won a secret court order that allowed agents to monitor the IP addresses of visitors to CardersMarket 's server .
It was the modern equivalent of taking down license plate numbers outside a mob hangout , and the Feds knew it was no coincidence that several traced back to broadband subscribers living within a block of the Oakwood .
Butler was accessing his neighbors '
Wi - Fi , they figured .
Post Street Towers , Max's San Francisco Safe House
Photo : Mark KingOn Wednesday , September 5 , Butler dropped Majors off at the post office and directed his cabdriver to the Oakwood .
He rode to the fourth floor , unlocked the door , and crashed out on the bed for an uneasy slumber .
At about 2 pm , the front door flew open and a half - dozen Secret Service agents rushed the room , guns drawn .
They handcuffed Butler and transported him to the nearby federal building for questioning .
Two of the agents were dispatched to Majors ' apartment .
They told her what happened and took her to say good - bye to Butler .
" I 'm sorry , " he told her when she walked in .
" You were right . "
Months later , Aragon 's lawyer gave him some bad news .
The Secret Service had cracked Butler 's crypto and knew more about the hacker than Aragon did — which meant Aragon would probably never be offered a deal , even if he wanted one .
Even more troubling , the lawyer said Butler had about 1 million credit card numbers on his hard drive .
Aragon was shocked .
All those years they 'd spent searching for one big score , and Butler was sitting on enough dumps to set them up for life .
Butler never said a word to Aragon .
Aragon 's anger faded as he realized the implications for Butler .
A million dumps ; the sentencing equivalent of a $ 500 million heist .
Butler was potentially looking at the first life sentence in US hacking history .
" I could n't figure it out ; what is this guy doing ?
Why does n't he just go get a job ?
Then it dawned on me , many years later : Max just likes to hack . "
Christopher Aragon is in a jail - issue V - neck at the Orange County Central Men's Jail , a grim lockup in the flat , sun-baked center of Santa Ana , California .
He 's been studying the Bhagavad Gita and reflecting on his life , his friendship with Butler , and the choices that have brought him to the precipice of a final plunge into the justice system .
Seven members of Aragon 's old crew have pleaded guilty and received sentences ranging from a few months to seven years .
His wife is about to finish her time .
Aragon is alone :
His bank robbery arrest as a young man and a related conviction for stealing a getaway car count against him under California 's Three Strikes law .
He 's awaiting trial and , if convicted , could face 25 years to life .
Across the country in a holding facility near Pittsburgh , Max Butler has it even worse .
He has spent a year in prison awaiting trial .
The only deal prosecutors have offered is 30 years instead of life .
His lawyer tried to get Butler released on bail , but the judge refused after the Feds speculated that Butler was sitting on vast stores of hidden cash and could easily use his contacts to disappear with a new name .
To prove he was a flight risk , they played their trump card : messages between Butler and a Secret Service informant who had infiltrated CardersMarket .
In them , Butler revealed the steps he took to cover his tracks after Aragon 's arrest — showing his ability to assume fake identities and evade law enforcement .
The name was blacked out , but the messages left little doubt as to the snitch 's identity .
Th3C0 rrupted0ne 's handle , it turns out , may have had dual meaning .
To his friends , Butler seems at peace with his confinement , as if he feels he deserves to be in jail for a while .
He speaks daily with Majors , in long conversations more intimate than any they had while he was immersed in his double life .
And he has made some like - minded acquaintances in the joint .
They 've started a Dungeons & Dragons campaign together .
But this time , he is n't thinking about what he 's going to do when he gets out of prison .
Finally , it seems like Max Butler has nothing left to prove .

The Seven Best Capers of 2008
Their deployment as a makeshift missile robbed President George Bush of his dignity and landed their owner in jail .
But the world 's most notorious pair of shoes have yielded an unexpected bonanza for a Turkish shoemaker .
Ramazan Baydan , owner of the Istanbul - based Baydan Shoe Company , has been swamped with orders from across the world , after insisting that his company produced the black leather shoes which the Iraqi journalist Muntazar al - Zaidi threw at Bush during a press conference in Baghdad last Sunday .
Baydan has recruited an extra 100 staff to meet orders for 300,000 pairs of Model 271 - more than four times the shoe 's normal annual sale - following an outpouring of support for Zaidi 's act , which was intended as a protest , but led to his arrest by Iraqi security forces .
Orders have come mainly from the US and Britain , and from neighbouring Muslim countries , he said .
Around 120,000 pairs have been ordered from Iraq , while a US company has placed a request for 18,000 .
A British firm is understood to have offered to serve as European distributor for the shoes , which have been on the market since 1999 and sell at around £ 28 in Turkey .
A sharp rise in orders has been recorded in Syria , Egypt and Iran , where the main shoemaker 's federation has offered to provide Zaidi and his family with a lifetime 's supply of shoes .
To meet the mood of the marketplace , Baydan is planning to rename the model " the Bush Shoe " or " Bye - Bye Bush " .
" We 've been selling these shoes for years but , thanks to Bush , orders are flying in like crazy .
We 've even hired an agency to look at television advertising , " he said .
Zaidi has been in custody since the shoe - throwing incident , amid claims that he has been badly beaten .
He faces a possible jail sentence for insulting a foreign leader , but has reportedly apologised and requested a pardon from Iraq 's prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki .

From politics to the workplace , from the petty grievances of neighbors to the heady disputes of presidents and prime ministers , all too often the game is zero sum .
My gain is at your loss , throwing me under the bus is how you overcome .
But it does n't have to be that way .
We can get to yes by uncovering common interests instead of exploiting each others weak spots .
The people you think are in your way do n't need to be jumped on , rolled over , kneed in the face , or have fireballs hurled at them .
Because some ways of winning cause us to lose a little bit of ourselves with the victory , and eventually you 'll have won too much to have anything left to lose .
Hackers have found a way to circumvent controls in the Google Android operating system used on T - Mobile 's G1 mobile phone , allowing them to get around restrictions created by the phone 's designers .
The hack gives G1 users a way to read data on parts of the phone that are normally walled off and could be used to install new programs , or even a new operating system , on the mobile phone .
Currently , programs for the open - source Android operating system must be written in Java , rather than other popular programming languages such as C or C ++.
Details on how to gain superuser " root " access to the phone were posted Tuesday to an Android development forum .
Step - by - step instructions have also been published online .
According to posters on the discussion board , the hack should be attempted only by technically sophisticated users because a misstep could render the G1 phone inoperable .
Developers were able to hack the phone thanks to a bug in the Android operating system , Google said Wednesday .
" We 've been notified of this issue and have developed a fix , " the company said .
" We 're currently working with our partners to push the fix out and updating the open source code base to reflect these changes . "
Android is Google 's answer to Apple 's iPhone .
One difference , however , is that Google makes only the phone 's software .
The G1 itself is made by Taiwan 's HTC , and Google is lining up handset makers to build other Android systems .
T- Mobile is the first service provider to sell an Android phone ; its G1 went on sale in late October .
The iPhone was similarly unlocked after its June 2007 introduction , through a process known as " jailbreaking . "

UNCASVILLE - Leave it to Billy Corgan to get in the way of a good time .
The Smashing Pumpkins 20th Anniversary tour came to Mohegan Sun on Sunday night and Corgan 's self - indulgent , over - bloated approach to making noise had at least a few thousand fans , perhaps former fans now , raining a chorus of " boos " down on the stage .
The band , consisting of original members Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlain , which is also the core of Corgan 's side project Zwan , devoted three hours of precious , un-recoverable time to creating a cacophonous audio collage .
Entertainment could be had , however , by simply catching the gaze of one of the thousands of dumbfounded looks that were being cast toward the casino stage as Corgan single - handedly dismantled the mystique of this once - famous band .
The appropriate look of horror was magnified at times , particularly when Corgan attempted a thrash - metal cover of Simon and Garfunkel 's " Sound of Silence . "
Perhaps it was the extended - bridge recitation of an adapted " Little Red Riding Hood , " that made that concert moment memorable .
There was the ill - advised acoustic cover of Fleetwood Mac 's " Landslide , " which Corgan sang with the sugar -y seriousness of an amateur talent - show hopeful , a silly enough rendering to have warranted an introduction by Chuck Barris .
That was topped by the 12 minute molar extrusion of " United States , " when Corgan tried to get the crowd to clap along , giving up quickly when it became obvious that a collective beat was nowhere to be found .
Whatever collective consciousness the metal - leaning dream - pop , art / alt rock purveyor was shooting for during the evening 's set was missed wide to the right .
Corgan seemed to be the only one on the building who found the performance even slightly amusing .
" I 'm sure you are wondering what the hell 's going on up here , " said Corgan ( and that was before " Landslide . " )
" We share your sentiment . "
The onstage ensemble backing Corgan consisted of bass , drums , and a second guitar , with the occasional appearance of keyboards , violin , and a horn section .
Amplified feedback was also a prominent player in the mix .
For most of the evening the stage was backlit , with the faces of the players visible in passing when a wayward strobe allowed .
During the aforementioned " United States , " Corgan 's shadow suggested he used his teeth to play part of the " Star Spangled Banner " guitar solo .
There were palatable moments , like " I of the Morning , " and the pop-centered metal of " Mayonnaise . "
The stretch of " Zero , " " Bodies , " and " Cherub Rock , " almost saved the evening , but Corgan put an exclamation point on the madness with a 25 minute encore of Pink Floyd 's " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun , " that included a kettle drum performance that was one bucket of paint away from being a Blue Man Group parody .
Around 750 people commented on the online preview of the Real World Haskell book .
As described by one of its co-authors , John Goerzen , in a recent interview to O’Reilly , the book introduces Haskell with real code , real examples and tips to exploit in a business environment .
In his interview , Goerzen explains why , in his opinion , this language is worth learning ; he provides insights into its specificities and addresses some issues that may be a source of reluctance .
John Goerzen admits that Haskell requires a lot of re-learning of basics and identifies purity and laziness as the biggest mind - shifts for people coming from imperative and / or object oriented programming .
He highlights that in Haskell , “ the things that can possibly change the state of the world are tightly isolated ” and “ marked with the type system ” .
This helps avoiding an important number of implementation bugs since impure elements of code are statically typed and errors can be indentified at a compile time , which differentiates Haskell from languages like Python .
Purity also facilitates testing , for instance through QuickCheck , especially if the program is structured around a lot of small functions combined together .
Another central notion in Haskell is laziness .
While asked as to “ where does laziness help real world programs ? ”
John Goerzen stresses how it relates to I/O :
If I write a little filter or parser program in Haskell , I do n't have to really worry about the details of reading the input line - by - line or block - by - block because I can just use getContents and then I can string together a whole bunch of functions .
I like writing Unix filters in Haskell . [ … ]
Once you have the laziness on the input , you have the laziness on the output because printing something does n't require it all to be evaluated all at once . [ … ]
You wind up with a program that is a very simple design because you 're not having to deal with buffering or iterating over lines or what not and yet , runs in constant space .
John Goerzen also talks about benefits of Haskell in terms of expressiveness , achieved by pattern matching and the fact that functions can express things in succinct but readable way making it easier to state a problem and , then , “ to reason about the logic ” that is clearly identifiable .
Moreover , as highlighted by the interviewer , one can “ build a vocabulary of functions or words and then you write your solution in the language of that vocabulary ” .
Haskell , indeed , manipulates “ functions as easily as Perl manipulates strings ” , says Goerzen .
However , some features of this language may be a source of reluctance for people coming from OO or / and imperative programming .
The recursive approach , for example , “ can be a little bit scary ” since “ incrementing a variable is a pretty cheap operation ” in languages like C. Nevertheless , Goerzen asserts that , even though “ higher level languages tend to not be quite as fast as C ” , GHC compiler that rewrites from recursion into iteration , “ is pretty efficient at optimizing what you express in recursive terms into a format that 's fairly efficient for the CPU . ”
One can also believe that laziness trades “ the ability to reason about types and purity and such for the inability to reason about time and space complexity ” .
John Goerzen prefers to put it into perspective :
[ It is ] just like if I 'm looking at a program in whatever other language […] that tries to read in an entire file all at once and then process it . [ … ]
You 'd open a file ; you could call read , and it could read an entire file for you into memory if you like .
Some people would do this expecting that maybe they 're only dealing with files that are 100 K or something .
You try to give them a file that 's 2 gig and that approach does n't quite work anymore .
Based on his experience , John also refutes the belief that that Haskell IO system is poor and difficult to learn .
According to him , the thing that scares probably most in Haskell are monads but he stresses that one “ can write a perfectly good Haskell program that deals with IO without having to be terribly bothered by what monads are or what they do ” .
To use the IO monad , one does not have to understand monads but can simply consider it as “ this kind of box that separates out the pure from the impure code ” .
More generally speaking , John Goerzen believes that even though there is “ a little bit of a learning curve on what are things called in Haskell ” , learning is facilitated because “ the types of functions tell you an awful lot about what they do ” .
Discovering Haskell is , according to him , a “ mind - opening experience ” and even if this language is not going to become the next big thing , “ it 's something that 's different and interesting and worth learning some about anyhow . ”
Emanuel treads lightly on union bill during CEO gathering Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Labor counting on Obama support Incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel tread lightly before a room full of CEOs when the subject turned to a union organizing bill that President - elect Barack Obama championed on the campaign trail .
Asked about the Employee Free Choice
Act at a gathering of business executives Tuesday , Emanuel punted -- " Let me take your question and go somewhere else , " he said , according to the Wall Street Journal , which sponsored the CEO Council .
Obama co-sponsored the legislation , also known as " card check , " in the Senate , and he promised to make passage of it a top priority during his administration .
Labor unions do n't seem worried that he 'll back away from that promise , even in light of Emanuel 's hesitance .
" Rahm was certainly playing to his audience , " Michael Whitney , a spokesman for the Service Employees International Union , told RAW STORY .
" He did n't want to jump head first into the viper pit . "
Emanuel " declined to say " whether the White House would support the legislation , according to a follow - up report in the Journal , and instead talked about the need to improve conditions for middle class workers .
Whenever Obama or Democrats are speaking to audiences comprised of non-CEOs , their support for the legislation could n't be clearer .
The issues page on Obama 's transition Web site promises he will sign EFCA into law .
" Ultimately the pres is the deciding factor on this , " Josh Goldstein , a spokesman for American Rights at Work , told RAW STORY .
" And he is clearly not shying away from this issue . "
The SEIU has created a video of Obama 's statements in favor of unions and is confident that Obama will stick with his support .
" We need to show Congress and show the American people that passing Employee Free Choice is really part of an economic recovery program to help rebuild the middle class , " Whitney said .
" And we think Obama recognizes that as well . "
The bill passed the House when it came to a vote last year but fell short of the necessary 60 votes to stave off a Republican filibuster in the Senate .
Chances for EFCA have improved this time around and may hinge on the outcome in yet - to - be - decided Senate races in Minnesota and Georgia .
All Democrats and one Republican supported the measure in 2007 , giving it 52 supporters .
( Sen. Tim Johnson ( D - SD ) supported the bill but missed the vote because he was recovering from a stroke . )
Democrats have flipped at least six Senate seats , bringing their total to 58 .
Assuming Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) remains supportive of the measure , Democrats just need Al Franken to prevail in a Minnesota recount or Jim Martin to win next month 's re-vote in Georgia and victory for the union organizing bill will be virtually assured .
" Those two senate races could basically lift any barrier , " Goldstein said .
The card check legislation would require employers to negotiate a union contract if a majority of their workers sign cards indicating they want a union to form .
Workers wishing to form a union are currently required to participate in secret - ballot elections , and there are no federal protections if a majority decide they want to unionize .
Businesses say card check allows union organizers to pressure workers into signing the cards , while labor groups say the current system allows corporations to retaliate against workers who try to organize unions .
During the campaign , pro-business groups ran advertisements against Democratic candidates aimed at raising voter fears about the card check bill .
The advertisements appear to have been ineffective , but the fight to block card check will continue to be one of businesses ' biggest priorities next year .
" President - elect Obama needs to think about how much political capital he wants to put behind this , " Glenn Spencer , a Chamber of Commerce executive who is leading the fight to kill the measure , told the Los Angeles Times .
If it is passed in Obama 's first 100 days , Spencer said , it is " going to look like a special - interest payback . "
Backers of card check recognize that it may not be the No. 1 item on the president - elect 's agenda , but they expect it wo n't be completely pushed aside .
Whether Obama is able to forge some kind of agreement between the two divergent views remains to be seen .
" The aspirations behind card check -- I know this is a tough issue , " Emanuel told the CEOs , according to a partial transcript of his remarks .
" And President Obama has been clear in the campaign .
It 's touching , and dealing with , those who have fell behind even though they are working harder .
They 're working harder , earning less and paying more .
And that 's just not good politics , good economics or good for our society .
And you would n't come up with these principles if you did n't think that . "
Analysis
Jon Danielsson
Economist , Financial Markets Group , London School of Economics
The first industrialised country to request assistance from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in over 30 years is Iceland .
The crisis will hurt ordinary Icelandic households .
The reason is that Iceland was hit by the deepest and most rapid financial crisis in peacetime history .
At the moment , the Icelandic economy has come to a standstill , it is almost impossible to transfer foreign currency between Iceland and abroad , which is a calamity for a country that is almost entirely dependent on imports and exports .
Exporters cannot bring export earnings into Iceland , and it is very difficult to obtain foreign currency to purchase necessities .
The key factor in Iceland 's failure has been the monetary policy pursued by its central bank , in particular inflation targeting , similar to the UK .
This means the central bank targets inflation , raises interest rates if inflation is above the target , and lowers them if inflation is below target .
Such a policy has a sound foundation in economic theory and is often appropriate for large countries .
In the case of Iceland , it was disastrous .
Financial bubble
Throughout the period of inflation targeting , inflation was above its target rate , resulting in interest rates exceeding at times 15 % .
In a small economy like Iceland high interest rates both encourage domestic firms and households to borrow in foreign currency , and also attract currency speculators .
Given the damaging role of high interest rates in events leading up to the crisis , it is very unfortunate that the IMF has insisted on a high interest policy
This brought large inflows of foreign currency , leading to sharp exchange rate increases , giving the Icelanders an illusion of wealth .
The speculators and borrowers profited from the interest rate difference between Iceland and abroad as well as the exchange rate appreciation .
These effects encouraged economic growth and inflation , further leading the central bank to raise interest rates .
The end result is a bubble caused by the interaction between domestic interest rates and inflows of foreign currency .
The exchange rate was increasingly out of touch with economic fundamentals , with a rapid depreciation of the currency inevitable .
This should have been clear to the central bank , which wasted several good opportunities to prevent exchange rate appreciations and build up reserves .
Given the damaging role of high interest rates in events leading up to the crisis , it is very unfortunate that as a part of their conditions , the IMF has insisted on a high interest policy .
Indeed , it is the very same policy that has caused considerable damage in previous IMF rescues , such as in the Asian crisis .
Independent bank ?
Adding to this is the peculiar governance structure of the Central Bank of Iceland .
Uniquely , it does not have one but three governors .
The Icelandic authorities do not seem to have appreciated the seriousness of the situation , not communicated appropriately with their international counterparts , leading to an atmosphere of mistrust
Extra help for Icesave customers Councils ' Iceland deposits fears Icelandic bank savers bailed out One or more of those has generally been a former politician .
Consequently , the governance of the central bank has always been perceived to be closely tied to the central government , raising doubts about its independence .
Currently , the chairman of the board of governors is a former long - standing prime minister .
Such a governance structure carries with it unfortunate consequences that become especially visible in the financial crisis .
By choosing governors based on their political background rather than economic or financial expertise , the central bank may be perceived to be ill - equipped to deal with an economy in crisis .
Oversized banking sector
The second factor in the implosion of the Icelandic economy this week has been the size of its banking sector .
Before the crisis , the Icelandic banks had foreign assets worth around 10 times the Icelandic GDP , with debts to match .
Iceland 's prime minister Geir Haarde has been under the spotlight this week .
In normal economic circumstances this is not a cause for worry , so long as the banks are prudently run .
Indeed , the Icelandic banks were better capitalized and with a lower exposure to high risk assets than many of their European counterparts .
In this crisis , the strength of a bank 's balance sheet is of little consequence .
What matters is the explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the state to the banks to back up their assets and provide liquidity .
Therefore , the size of the state relative to the size of the banks becomes the crucial factor .
The relative size of the Icelandic banking system means that the government was in no position to guarantee the banks , unlike in other European countries .
This effect was further escalated and the collapse brought forward by the failure of the central bank to extend its foreign currency reserves .
' Pariah status '
The final collapse was brought on by the bankruptcy of the entire Icelandic banking system .
We may never know if the collapse of the banks was inevitable , but the manner in which they went into bankruptcy turned out to be extremely damaging to the Icelandic economy , and indeed damaging to the economy of the United Kingdom and other European countries .
The Icelandic authorities do not seem to have appreciated the seriousness of the situation , not communicated appropriately with their international counterparts , leading to an atmosphere of mistrust .
The UK authorities exasperated with responses from Iceland seem to have overreacted , using antiterrorist laws to take over Icelandic assets , and causing the bankruptcy of the remaining Icelandic bank .
Ultimately , this led to Iceland getting a pariah status in the financial system .
The original cause of the Icelandic crisis was a combination of inappropriate monetary policy and an outsized banking system .
Throughout this year , the Icelandic currency has been falling due to the currency speculators running for shelter .
This has caused doubts about the Icelandic economy and its banking sector .
What eventually tipped the balance was the current extreme global financial uncertainty , the mishandling of the crisis by the Icelandic authorities and the overreaction of the UK authorities .
The real tragedy in the crisis is the impact on Icelandic households ; they are seeing payments on loans increased by up to 50 % , and inflation which may reach 30 % or more this year , with salaries frozen and mass layoffs .
Fortunately , the long - run macroeconomic potential is good .
Iceland is a natural resource - based economy , with plenty of untapped natural resources and well educated workforce .
The long - run economic outlook is therefore favourable .

Asian workers accuse KBR subcontractor of holding them hostage Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008

This A Kuwaiti subcontractor to American defense contractor KBR is under fire after it was discovered that about a thousand men were confined to windowless warehouses in Baghdad with no money or work .
The men , who hail from Bangladesh , India , Nepal and Sri Lanka , staged a protest of their living conditions on Tuesday .
They were brought to Iraq by Najlaa International Catering Services on promises of jobs , paying middlemen over $ 2,000 a head and sometimes taking out loans to do so , in hopes of earning $ 600 - $ 800 a month .
Instead , said two Sri Lankan men , the jobs never materialized , and cramped living quarters , 12 toilets to share and meager meals instead awaited as families back home went broke and fell apart .
Najlaa contended , on questioning , that it was taking care of the men's basic needs while they wait for jobs to open up , but said that it would send them home with back pay instead .
Some of the men told McClatchy that Najlaa was holding their passports , which is a violation of the United States ' 2006 instructions to contractors .
The living conditions , as well , appear to violate guidelines meant to deter human trafficking and abuse by recruiters and guarantee each person in such a situation at least 50 square feet of living space .
" When KBR becomes aware of potential violations of international laws regarding trafficking in persons , we work , within our authority , to remediate the problem and report the matter to proper authorities , " KBR said in a statement .
" KBR then works with authorities to rectify the matter . "

So the other day I was going on how the USS Kelvin had just started following me on Twitter to promote their trivia contest for Star Trek XI ( which is sponsored by Intel and Lenovo ) and of course I had to lament that while the contest was cool and all — what was really needed was a Trek themed laptop .
So it was with much pleasure today that I found out that not only is this the case , but the sweet folks at contest just sent me a sneak preview photo of the laptop itself .
For now my guess is for now that this goodie is just a sweepstakes prize , but man would I love to see something like this for sale in the stores …

Long before I became obsessed with politics , when I was in high school , I was afforded the opportunity to be a student poll worker .
The requirements were quite simple -- 17 years old , a certain GPA , and an ok from my parents and my high school principal .
I remember how excited I was -- and not just because being a poll worker meant a day off from school .
I got to go downtown for training , and the day before election day , I went to sleep early because I had to be up at 5 A.M .
When I woke up on Election Day , it was still dark outside as I bundled up and walked the block to the church which would serve as my Big Adventure for the next 15 hours or so .
I was struck when walked in by the fact that I was the youngest person in the room .
Not surprising , given that the average age of a poll worker is 72 .
Younger campaign workers would stroll in a couple hours , but in those quiet hours before the polls opened , in a church basement in Chicago , it was one 17 - year - old Catholic school girl in a room of cotton - haired women , anxious to teach me about the process .
And teach me they did .
They slapped a Republican ID sticker on me ( it felt like a scarlet letter , but I was told that there had to be an even split between Democrats and Republicans and I drew the unlucky straw ) .
They showed me how to set up the voting booths .
Where to place the voter 's rights posters .
How to verify that someone is registered to vote .
And when everything was set up , every neat stack of colored ballots in its place , every binder opened up to page 1 and every folder chair set up in a tidy line along the wall , we sat down , and waited .
Nearly a decade ago , the voters were not lining up to vote .
Not like in 2004 , when there was a line formed before our precinct even opened .
Rather , democracy was a steady trickle of voters shuffling in from the rain .
I saw my neighbors , my friend 's parents , family and friends .
And I saw as each took their ballot and stepped into their booth to vote .
Some voted quickly , others took quite a while .
And as I handed out " I voted ! " receipts ( it 's always the glorious tasks that are dolled out to the young kids ) , I reflected on how individual the process really was .
That it all came down to individual neighborhoods , individual precincts , and the individual whose legs peer out from the voting booth as they exercise their right to be heard .
I received a check for my day 's worth of service - - a paltry amount , to be sure , but the day 's worth was n't measured by the number of dollars but by the awesome experience of being a tiny cog in this grand machine of democracy .
Today 's action item is signing up poll workers .
Maybe you want to try it out .
Or maybe your son or daughter is interested .
It 's a great way to get involved , not just because we need more poll workers , but because we need people who are skilled enough to deal with new voting technologies and new voting rules .
Here is some good information from the Election Assistance Commission :
What is a Poll Worker ?
Poll Workers are the people who ensure the conduct of fair and accurate elections .
They prepare the precinct by setting up voting equipment , greeting voters , verify registrations and providing voters with appropriate ballots .
At the end of the day , Poll Workers close the precinct and prepare election materials for delivery or actually deliver the material to the Elections office . [...]
What should I expect if I am a selected as a Poll Worker ?
If selected as a Poll Worker you should expect to attend a training session that typically lasts a couple of hours .
If you are not going to be working at your own polling place you should expect to request an absentee ballot .
Plan to go to sleep early on Monday November 1st because typically you will have to be at the polls on Tuesday , November 2nd , before it opens ( sometimes as early as 5:30 a.m. ) and stay until after it closes ( often after 7:00 p.m. ) .
Contact your local Secretary of State to determine deadlines for applications and other requirements .
You can see a brief overview of requirements here ( PDF ) .

As we ’ve been hinting at all week , Home 1.0 is now available for existing beta testers .
We could n’t get past the “ initialising ” screen , presumably it ’s busy with lots of people trying to get on ( great stress test indication ) so we ’ll check later .
It ’s worth mentioning that Home is now a proper part of the XMB , next to the Store , as can be seen in our photograph above .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
So , get on , download the client ( still about 80 MB ) and see if you can connect up .
If we ever get as far as the EULA we ’ll be able to see if we can finally talk about Home .
If not , well , we ’re sure the open beta is n’t far away .
A 40 - year - old Zimbabwean primary school teacher in a high - density area of the capital , Harare , tells the BBC News website why he is not reporting for duty at the start of the new academic year - which has already been delayed by two weeks .
It 's not possible for us to go back to work .
A week ago we got paid and the amount we found in our accounts was 30 trillion Zimbabwe dollars for the month .
On that day it was equivalent to US$ 3 ( £ 2.15 ) , but three days later , because of inflation , it was worth only US $ 1 ( 71 p ) - and you can't really do anything with a dollar .
I survive like the rest of the Zimbabweans survive - vending
My colleagues who travel to work need US $ 2 a day , as a one - way journey costs the equivalent of US $ 1 .
Actually , none of the teachers left at my school have reported to work since 2 September , when we resolved we had to be paid an amount that was reasonable .
We are on strike , although it 's more that we do n't have the capacity to go to work without money for transport and proper food .
Sadly , the more than 1,000 children at the school stopped turning up at the beginning of October after they realised the teachers were not coming back .
I survive like the rest of the Zimbabweans survive - vending .
We sell anything we can lay our hands on .
Forty years in Zimbabwe 's schools I go into town and buy a 20kg bag of maize meal , which costs about US $ 7 .
Then I come back to the high - density area and repack it into between 12 and 15 packs and resell them for US $ 1 because many families can only afford enough to cook one meal .
That 's how I 'm making a living now .
I 've got a young brother who has a better - paying job ; in fact he gets part of his salary in foreign currency - so sometimes he 's the one who gives me some groceries .
Exodus Sometimes parents are also willing to pay for tuition for their children .
I charge about US $ 3 a head for this - at the moment I have about three kids whom I teach so that 's about US$ 9 a week .
It is true to say some female teachers have really turned wild
Since last year , I have also been teaching my two children - who are of primary - school age .
My wife was retrenched from a catering company , so to make money now she prepares food at home and then goes into town and sells the lunches to clients .
Some of my colleagues do cross - border trading ; they go into South Africa , they buy some goods and bring them back home and resell them .
Others have totally gone to South Africa and they are doing different kinds of jobs there .
One teacher is selling newspapers in Johannesburg ; one is working in a restaurant in Cape Town and the third one is just doing some clerical work for a company in Cape Town .
I wanted to leave too when the crisis here started around the year 2000 .
But after some of my friends had left , I realised they could n't make a decent living - 200 to 300 rand ( US$ 20 - US$ 30 ; £ 14 - £ 21 ) a month for selling papers is inadequate to provide for a family .
Classroom vandalised
It is true to say some female teachers have really turned wild .
School attendance fell to 20 % by the end of last year
They go into town dressed up and in the evenings in the night clubs look for rich clients - probably the money - changers , who can afford to buy their bodies .
It 's really happening .
I first got a second job around 2002 when our incomes became inadequate - then I started to give extra lessons after school .
Then around 2007 it got really bad .
We were involved in a lot of strikes and that 's when I decided to start the vending , taking the odd day off to trade until stopping completely in September .
When I started work in 1991 , we could afford most of the things on a teacher 's salary .
The number of children in the class has remained almost the same , but what has changed in the 17 years is that classroom materials are no longer being provided and the equipment has become dilapidated .
For example , I went to my school last week to check on how things were and one of the auxiliary staff was telling me that one of the classrooms had been broken into .
Some furniture was stolen and the stationery as well .
Total collapse
Under normal circumstances , the school is supposed to employ 31 teachers , but due to migration , we were down to 21 in September and of them only about 14 were qualified teachers .
I miss teaching very much because it is my calling
I have been informed by one of the parents who is on my school 's committee that they are contemplating raising foreign currency so that teachers can be paid from the parents ' pockets .
But I do n't see how that can be practised because most of the parents are poor .
Unless something is done in terms of the political settlement - if the political leaders agreed and then things stabilised and there was a common focus - I do n't see how these things can be solved .
The school system is in total collapse and in order for things to work again probably a unity government is needed so that things can be put in place .
I miss teaching very much because it is my calling .
I miss that feeling of pride I feel when students do well in life .
Also I like sports very much and I used to go with children for sports and basketball .
I 'm no longer involved in that and that too I miss very much .
It is very depressing indeed .

William Balfour Confesses to Girlfriend
The only suspect in the triple murder of singer and actress 's mother , brother and nephew , continues to be held on a probation violation .
A decision is expected today by the Illinois Prisoner Review Board on whether he violated the terms of his parole .
He has yet to be charged with murder .
A recent turn of events was reported by the Chicago Tribune , who claim that Balfour 's girlfriend told police that William admitted to her that he was at the home where the murders and abduction took place the day of the crime and that he was indeed involved in the murders .
This alleged confession may be what prosecutors have needed in order to bring charges against Balfour .
It seems unlikely they will turn him loose , no matter what the parole board decides .
Let justice be served !
A Monday update to Apple 's Leopard operating system is causing a host of problems for users , ranging from broken Bluetooth connections and no sound to large popping noises during boot - up and dead USB ports .
A Monday update to Apple 's Leopard operating system is causing a host of problems for users , ranging from broken Bluetooth connections and no sound to large popping noises during boot - up and dead USB ports .
The OS X 10.5.6 update is supposed to improve a number of features , including synching between the address book and the iPhone , roaming capabilities of AirPort connections on Intel - based Macs , an encryption alert that appeared in the chat window of iChat , and improvements to gaming performance .
It is also supposed to prevent Mail from quitting , fix an issue that allows junk mail to remain in the inbox , and improve MobileMe synching time .
The update also addresses an issue that prevents parentally - controlled accounts from accessing the iTunes Store , and improves compatibility with Web proxy servers in Safari .
Many users , however , are reporting on the Apple forums that after the initial installation , their Macs remain frozen on " configuring setup . "
Others who have made it through the installation process found that their devices no longer recognize the mouse , sync with Bluetooth , open Suitcase Version 2 , or connect to the AirPort wireless network , among other issues .
" Post 10.5.6
I get a loud pop during the very end of the grey startup screen or right after the time verbose mode goes to a blue screen , " one user wrote on the Apple forums .
" The latest version of Leopard ( 10.5.6 ) downloaded automatically via Software Update , " wrote another user known as Davald .
" However , when I attempted to install , the process hangs on ' configuring setup . ' "
After 15 minutes , Davald did a forced restart , which returned his MacBook Pro to 10.5.5 .
Another user found that after he typed his password , the screen went blue , and then returned him to the login screen .
Some people found workarounds , like installing the regular update instead of the combo update from the Apple download page or removing update files , but there does not seem to be one solution that works for all users .
Some users are having no issues with the update at all .
Some lashed out at Apple .
" This is why I decided to cross-over to ' The Darkside ' and purchase a Dell , " wrote someone who identified himself as Gabriel Cobos1 .
" Once upon a time , nothing was better than an Apple .
Then I bought a new [ MacBook Pro ] ... actually two of them , and all of them died , trying to do what I do with simple ease with my homebuilt PC's . "

The Recording Industry Association of America is clearing the air over its comments that it has not initiated litigation in months against alleged copyright scofflaws .
On Friday , the RIAA announced it was abandoning its legal strategy of suing individuals for copyright infringement , and said it had not sued anybody for months .
Ray Beckerman , an attorney the RIAA has declared as " vexatious , " posted Friday on his blog — Recording Industry vs. The People — that dozens of RIAA lawsuits have been filed within the past couple of weeks .
Cara Duckworth , an RIAA spokeswoman , e-mailed Threat Level in a bid to clear the air .
She wrote that any suits recently filed were already in the " pipeline " for months .
" We are not initiating any new lawsuits and have not since August .
Any lawsuit that has been filed since then is a named lawsuit or those for which we 've received identifying information about the ISP ( or issued the subpoena for ) .
Simply put , we are continuing those that have already been in the pipeline but nothing new has been initiated since August , " Duckworth said .
She added that some lawsuits are moving forward " because settlement discussions that began before then fell through . "
Beckerman , in a telephone interview , said it 's a matter of interpretation as to how to define a new case .
" If they are saying they are not new cases , that 's their definition of a new case . "
The RIAA has sued more than 30,000 individuals the past few years , and has settled most of the cases out of court for a few thousand dollars .
Under the RIAA 's new strategy , internet service providers will notify ( .pdf ) alleged copyright infringers detected by the RIAA that they need to cease their alleged infringement of the industry 's music .

Video on Youku .
Many Chinese media reported the United States presidential election results announcing Obama ’s win and many Chinese people talked about it .
The above video of Obama ’s victory speech has Chinese subtitles added by the group of people who are known for translating episodes of Prison Break , and it is considered to be a good translation .
Many Chinese were moved by Obama ’s speech but of course not everyone agrees or thinks the same way .
Although there are over 1400 Chinese comments right now just on Youku and many more on many other BBS forums , here are just a few :
Comments on Youku :
I support Obama , his eloquence is so much better than Bush ’s , and hopefully he will not be like Bush ’s government , bringing humanity into another period of financial crisis !
A peace - bringing president .
His has Chinese relatives , so he will be good towards our China .
I hope him taking office can make relations between China and the United States like China and Pakistan .
Then we would be brothers !!
I can only say , this kind of country [ America ] is very difficult to surpass .
So touching !
I approve !
I continuously supported him and he did not let me down !
So much personal charm !
I hope he can really help bring change to America , and also peacefully coexist with China , giving the world positive change !
Yes !
We can !
I envy them living in a democratic and free country .
Obama fully deserves [ the presidency ] .
He has such incredible charisma .
Yes , we can .
Such high character .
So good .
When can China be like this ?
I love America .
I am so fond of America .
Maybe Obama ’s election victory will write America ’s modern history , hopefully he can make America , make the world more peaceful .
However , it is too early to have conclusions right now and no matter what , history is impartial .
However , I think he will make the right decisions !
Now there is hope for a Chinese to become president next time .
Obama ’s speaking is so much better than the Texas accent of Little Bush .
His spech was very wonderful .
Fuck , I want to join America after listening to that .
I really hope he will be a lousy president …
If he is not , I really hoped McCain would be elected …
Ai…surpassing America wil now take a few more years –
I am really against those people who talk about how America will treat China in the future .
That president is good , that is bad , does this matter really matter much to us ?
Regarding Obama , we are moved not because of how Obama will treat China in the future , we are moved because he has become president , and found a dream , telling us that we can also be like this .
This is the reason we are moved .
Right now , our country ’s biggest problem is not on the outside , it is ourselves .
We hope we can have a good job , hope we can have enough medical care , hope our parents have what they need when they get older and that our children can enjoy equal eduation .
We hope our lives will change for the better .
If American needs friends , China is a dependable / reliable friend .
If the United States treats us as enemies , China will be a very competent enemy .
Respecting our opponent , China is a mature enough and strong country .
I am a professor at Korea ’s Seoul University , I think you are all very immature .
After many levels of research , Obama is our Korea ’s descendant !!!
America , a superpower , at present the world ’s strongest .
It does not use economy and military to suppress you , that would be impossible .
Yes , they can .
Black people do not care about anything and would definitely choose their own black candidate .
The reason is very simple , our black brothers would definitely want benefits for our black people .
This gap is not to say something that can be undone just by saying a few words .
The speech also quickly captured the female voters .
I do not know how he will be towards China … just talk ?
Hitler also got the citizen ’s crazy support .
I get angry when I see this kind of mentality .
Sure , his speaking is not bad , but should you not think about which country you belong to ?
Hearing this kind of speech , seeing another country ’s citizens moved / touched , what should we do ?
We should work hard for our country , defeat / beat America , and support our own country , right ?
So “ niu “ … his speech made me cry .
I remember back when I was in school , the teacher said to us , Hitler ’s speeches were also very good .
Those rich women were all crying as they donated money to him , allowing him to use the money for the military .
Ai~ !
Of course , I am not a Nazi , I condemn Nazis .
I just suddenly thought of this .
There is no other meaning / reason / intent .
In the the future , all of America ’s white doctors [ doctorates ] will be exchanged with black doctors , black doctors will research rap and hip hop , there will be graffiti everywhere on the streets , and black police that open fire and kill white people will be innocent .
It does not matter who becomes president ~ we are only a peaceful people .
Our hope is not how great the president is , it is not how much land and profit he brings us .
Our hope is for world peace , for the peaceful and happy life that peace brings us , without countries cursing each other angrily , without distorted discrimination because of hate , without news of war and casualties , and will not be invaded because of another country , forced to watch innocent people miserably die for others .
That kind of dull but diligent life of developing is what us little ordinary people long for in our hearts .
Such a “ niubi ” president … hahahaha , good .
Too charming … just watching his family was moving beyond compare .
Obama !
I support .
“ 路漫漫其修远兮 ” [ referring to the Chinese subtitle for something Obama said about one having a long way to go but should take one step at a time ] this sentence was probably deduced by the translator .
This translation is too “ niu “ !!!
Translated so well , I have downloaded it to diligently study [ the English ] .
Too “ TM ” inspirational , this speech .
My blood boiled .
Not bad , as long as you treat China relations better in the future .
Otherwise , you are done for .
Lofty China must rise up .
No matter how stirring Obama ’s speech is , it still cannot stop America from losing its superpower position .
The 21st century must be China ’s century .
Yes , we can ~ ~ ~so wonderful , truly unexpected .
A 47 - year - old black man that is this impressive , America does not overlook talent .
I approve ~ ~~
I do not know why there are this many Chinese who support Obama .
After he takes office , it will only be even more disadvantageous for China .
No need to say anything , financial crisis , two big wars… , how he will go down in history [ good or bad , famous or infamous ] we need only wait and see .
My dream is to join “ Youyou bird ” [ the group that provided the Chinese subtitles ] , which is also my motivation for learning English .
This is the difference between China and America , the president is someone they themselves elected , so how can they not be excited ?
Moreover , they are hoping Obama can be like Roosevelt and alleviate the financial crisis .
Yes , we can !
This phrase is too classic !
He is too appealing .
Any country ’s citizens hearing their own country ’s leader making a speech like this would be profoundly conquered / won over .
I do not know if it sounds good or not .
I do not know if it is touching or not .
But I watched it many times .
Bush , goodbye …
He annotated a true American dream !
Maybe from one side , it explains why American was able to become the only superpower .
There is still much we need to catch up with and surpass .
I really do not understand what is up with everyone .
Are you all that envious of America ’s leader ?
We also have a good chairman and a good premier .
He [ Obama ] is very outstanding , but our chairman and premier are even more outstanding .
When the big [ Sichuan ] earthquake happened , all of the nation ’s cars honked their horns , and the sirens / alarms sounded at the same time , and everyone around Beijing stood crying and cheering China “ jia you “ … could it be that everyone forgot ?
Besides , it is only in the midst of danger that America unites like this , just like the premier said : “ Much distress resurrects a nation ! ”
When watching them say “ yes , we can ” together , I was really touched , and even had some tears .
So well - said .
I think other than watching his speeches , we should look at the analyses in the newspapers , and then come back to discuss whether him being president will be good or bad for China .
There are some things where only listening to one side is very …
Congratulations to the new American President , Barak Obama .
Her immediate challenge is to start new movies while honoring a thicket of remaining commitments to Paramount , which will distribute films that have already been made , like “ The Soloist ” and “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , ” and still has the right to be involved with dozens of projects it acquired when it bought the company .
Mr. Geffen ’s departure originally was planned more than a year ago , after he negotiated new terms with Paramount .
He had a right to make an early exit from the studio if he chose  and Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Snider were entitled to leave behind him .
What Mr. Geffen did after negotiating the deal , Mr. Spielberg said , caught him by surprise : He told Mr. Spielberg that he did , in fact , intend to leave .
And he expected Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Snider to do the same .
“ Where do we go ? ” Mr. Spielberg now recalls asking .
“ Do n’t worry , I will handle all of that , ” Mr. Geffen said .
In any case , Mr. Geffen appears to have orphaned a small corps of associates who had come to view him as the central support for their own hopes and dreams .
In describing Mr. Geffen ’s role at DreamWorks , Mr. Spielberg likened it to a family relationship .
“ Jeffrey and I were like the kids , ” he said , while Mr. Geffen built the house and saw that the bills were paid .
Mr. Geffen ’s legacy has included the sale of his record company to MCA ; MCA ’s eventual sale to the Japanese electronics giant Matsushita ; a behind - the - scenes war on the once - powerful agent Michael S. Ovitz ; and the highly public separation of the DreamWorks principals from Paramount after friction with that company ’s chairman , Brad Grey .
As a talent manager and record executive , Mr. Geffen helped build the careers of artists like Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell .
Though he personally produced only a handful of movies , including “ Interview With the Vampire ” in 1994 , he was closely involved with many others , including “ Risky Business ” and “ Dreamgirls . ”
By his own recollection , Mr. Spielberg was initially reluctant to join in creating the original DreamWorks studio , which was conceived by Mr. Katzenberg shortly after he was fired as chairman of the Walt Disney Company ’s studio operation in 1994 .
But Mr. Katzenberg begged for a meeting , and asked to bring a friend .
The friend was Mr. Geffen , who not only did all the talking , but insisted to Mr. Spielberg : “ I am representing your best interests . ”
This shop is inspired by my desire to not only uplift black professionals , but to acknowledge them in the workforce as our way to shift the narrative !
We must unite , Black Professionals !
During World War
Two , many individuals from many countries risked their lives to save various minorities , especially Jews , from the horrors of the Holocaust .
This list commemorates 10 of them .
All these individuals were made ‘ Righteous Among the Nations ’ by the Israeli government in honor of what they had done .
10 Feng - Shan Ho
Feng - Shan
Ho was a Chinese diplomat who saved approximately 2,000 Jews during the early years of World War II .
Ho was consul - general of the Chinese embassy in Vienna during the Austrian annexation .
After the “ Kristallnacht ” in 1938 , the situation for the almost 200,000 Austrian Jews got rapidly more difficult , but in order to leave the country they had to provide proof of emigration , usually a visa from a foreign nation or a valid boat ticket .
This , however , was difficult and the Evian Conference , in 1938 , where 32 countries had failed to take a stand against Nazi Germany , made this even more complicated .
Acting against orders of his superior , Ho , for humanitarian reasons , started to issue visas to Shanghai .
He continued to issue these visas until he was ordered to return to China in May 1940 .
After the war , Ho settled in San Francisco where he died in 1997 .
He was made ‘ Righteous Among the Nations ’ in 2001 for his efforts to save thousands of Austrian Jews .
9 Irena Sendler
Irena Sendler was a Polish Catholic social worker .
During World War II , she was a member of the Polish Underground and the ?egota Polish anti-Holocaust resistance in Warsaw .
She helped save 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto by providing them with false documents and sheltering them in individual and group children ’s homes outside the ghetto .
As an employee of the Social Welfare Department , she had a special permit to enter the Warsaw Ghetto , to check for signs of typhus , something the Nazis feared would spread beyond the ghetto .
During these visits , she wore a Star of David as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish people and so as not to call attention to herself .
She cooperated with the Children ’s Section of the Municipal Administration , linked with the RGO ( Central Welfare Council ) , a Polish relief organization tolerated under German supervision .
She organized the smuggling of Jewish children from the ghetto , carrying them out in boxes , suitcases and trolleys .
Under the pretext of conducting inspections of sanitary conditions during a typhoid outbreak , Sendler visited the ghetto and smuggled out babies and small children in ambulances and trams , sometimes disguising them as packages .
Despite being tortured and imprisoned by the Nazis , Sendler continued to do all she could to help Jewish children in Warsaw .
In 1965 she was made ‘ Righteous Among the Nations ’ , and died in 2008 .
8 Hugh O’Flaherty
Hugh O’Flaherty was an Irish Catholic priest who saved about 4,000 Allied soldiers and Jews in Rome during World War II .
O’Flaherty used his status as a priest and his protection by the Vatican to conceal 4000 escapees – Allied soldiers and Jews – in flats , farms and convents .
Despite the Nazis desperately wanting to stop his actions , his protection by the Vatican prevented them officially arresting him .
He survived an assassination attempt and , along with the Catholic Church , saved the majority of Jews in Rome .
He died in 1963 .
7 Giorgio Perlasca
Giorgio Perlasca was an Italian who helped save thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust by issuing them fake passports to travel to neutral countries .
Despite fighting alongside Franco in the Spanish Civil War , Perlasca became disillusioned with Fascism and escaped from Italy to the Spanish embassy in Budapest in 1944 , where he became a Spanish citizen on account of his war experience .
While there he worked with Spanish diplomat Angel Sanz Briz in creating fake passports to smuggle Jews out of the country .
When Sanz Briz was removed from his post , Perlasca pretended to be his substitute so that he could continue printing false passports .
He also personally sheltered thousands of Hungarian Jews while they were waiting for their passports .
It is estimated he saved over 5,000 Jews from the Holocaust .
After the war , he returned to Italy where he lived in obscurity until he was contacted in 1987 by a group of Hungarian Jews he had rescued , and his remarkable story became public .
He died in 1992 .
6 Chiune Sugihara
Chiune Sugihara was a Japanese diplomat , serving as Vice Consul for the Japanese Empire in Lithuania .
Soon after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union , he helped an estimated 6,000 Jews leave the country by issuing transit visas to Jewish refugees so that they could travel to Japan .
Most of the Jews who escaped were refugees from Poland or residents of Lithuania .
From July 31 to August 28 1940 , Sugihara began to grant visas on his own initiative .
Many times he ignored the requirements and arranged the Jews with a ten - day visa to transit through Japan , in direct violation of his orders .
Given his inferior post and the culture of the Japanese Foreign Service bureaucracy , this was an extraordinary act of disobedience .
He spoke to Soviet officials who agreed to let the Jews travel through the country via the Trans - Siberian railway at five times the standard ticket price .
Sugihara continued to hand - write visas ( reportedly spending 18 – 20 hours a day on them , producing a normal month ’s worth of visas each day ) until September 4 , when he had to leave his post before the consulate was closed .
By that time he had granted thousands of visas to Jews , many of them heads of household who could take their families with them .
According to witnesses , he was still writing visas while in transit in hotel and after boarding the train , throwing visas into the crowd of desperate refugees out the train ’s window even as the train pulled out .
Sugihara returned to Japan where he lived in obscurity until he was made ‘ Righteous Among the Nations ’ by Israel in 1985 .
He died the following year .
5 Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz
Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz was a German member of the Nazi party who worked as a special envoy to Nazi occupied Denmark .
Although Danish Jews were initially treated quite favourably by the Nazis , by 1943 it was planned that they would be rounded up and deported to concentration camps .
Risking his career , Duckwitz made a secret visit to neutral Sweden where he convinced Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson to allow Danish Jewish refugees to escape to Sweden .
He then went to Denmark and notified Danish politician Hans Hedtoft about the deportation .
Hedtoft warned senior rabbis in the country , and in the following two months , over 6,000 Jews were ferried secretly to Sweden in boats .
After his actions , Duckwitz returned to his duties as a Nazi official , refusing to reveal what he had done in case of losing his job or worse .
After the war , he continued working as West Germany ’s ambassador to Denmark .
He died in 1973 .
Due to his actions , it is estimated that around 99 % of Denmark ’s Jews survived the Holocaust .
4 Frank Foley
Frank Foley was a British secret service agent estimated to have saved 10,000 Jews from the Holocaust .
In his role as passport control officer he helped thousands of Jews escape from Nazi Germany .
At the 1961 trial of former ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann , he was described as a “ Scarlet Pimpernel ” for the way he risked his own life to save Jews threatened with death by the Nazis .
Despite having no diplomatic immunity and being liable to arrest at any time , Foley would bend the rules when stamping passports and issuing visas , to allow Jews to escape “ legally ” to Britain or Palestine , which was then controlled by the British .
Sometimes he went further , going into internment camps to get Jews out , hiding them in his home , and helping them get forged passports .
He died in 1958 .
3 Aristides de Sousa Mendes
Aristides de Sousa Mendes was a Portuguese Diplomat who ignored and defied the orders of his own government for the safety of war refugees fleeing from invading German military forces in the early years of World War II .
Between the June 16 and June 23 1940 , he frantically issued Portuguese visas free of charge , to over 30,000 refugees seeking to escape the Nazi terror , 12,000 of whom were Jews .
De Sousa Mendes worked in the Portuguese consulate in Bordeaux , France , where despite explicit orders not to give visas to “ foreigners of indefinite or contested nationality ; the stateless ; or Jews expelled from their countries of origin ” .
De Sousa Mendes sporadically began printing Portuguese visas illegally as early as 1939 , but it was n’t until mid June 1940 , when Portugal ’s status was expected to change from ‘ neutral ’ to ‘ non- belligerent ’ which would make Portugal more allied to Nazi Germany .
Between June 16 and June 23 , de Sousa Mendes began frantically issuing visas , along with his friend , the Rabbi Chaim Kruger , to refugees waiting in line .
De Sousa Mendes travelled to the border town of Irun on June 23 , where he personally raised the gate to allow disputed passages into Spain to occur .
It was at this point that Ambassador Teotónio Pereira arrived at Irun , declared Sousa Mendes mentally incompetent and invalidated all further visas .
An Associated Press story the next day reported that some 10,000 persons attempting to cross over into Spain were excluded because authorities no longer granted recognition to their visas .
As de Sousa Mendes continued the flow of visas , Dictator Salazar sent a telegram on June 24 recalling him to Portugal , an order he received upon returning to Bordeaux on June 26 but followed only slowly , not arriving in Portugal until July 8 .
Along the way he issued Portuguese passports to refugees now trapped in occupied France , saving them by preventing their deportation to concentration camps .
After the war , de Sousa Mendes lived in destitute poverty , dying in 1954 .
2 Dimitar Peshev
Dimitar Peshev was the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Bulgaria and Minister of Justice during World War II .
He rebelled against the pro-Nazi cabinet and prevented the deportation of Bulgaria ’s 48,000 Jews .
Bulgaria was a strong supporter of the Holocaust , rounding up thousands of Jews in occupied Thrace and Macedonia to be deported to death camps .
However , when it came to its own Jewish citizens , the government faced strong opposition from Peshev and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church .
Although Peshev had been involved in various anti-Semitic legislation that had passed in Bulgaria during the early years of the War , the decision by the government to deport Bulgaria ’s 48,000 Jews on March 8 1943 was too much for Peshev .
After being informed of the deportation , Peshev tried several times to see Prime Minister Bogdan Filov but the prime minister refused .
Next , he went to see Interior Minister Petur Gabrovski insisting that he cancel the deportations .
After much persuasion , Gabrovski finally called the governor of Kyustendil and instructed him to stop preparations for the Jewish deportations .
By 5:30 p.m. on March 9 , the order had been cancelled .
After the war , Peshev was charged with anti-Semitism and anti-Communism by the Soviet courts , and sentenced to death .
However , after outcry from the Jewish community , his sentence was commuted to 15 years imprisonment , though released after just one year .
His deeds went unrecognised after the war , as he lived in poverty in Bulgaria .
It was not until 1973 when he was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations .
He died the same year .
1 Raoul Wallenberg
Raoul Wallenberg was a Swedish humanitarian who worked in Budapest , Hungary during World War II to rescue Jews from the Holocaust .
Between July and December of 1944 he issued fake passports and housed several thousand Jews , saving an estimated 100,000 people from the Nazis .
On July 9 1944 , Wallenberg travelled to Budapest as the First Secretary to the Swedish legation in Budapest .
Together with fellow Swedish diplomat Per Anger he issued “ protective passports ” which identified the bearers as Swedish subjects awaiting repatriation and prevented their deportation .
Although not legally valid , these documents looked official and were generally accepted by German and Hungarian authorities , who sometimes were also bribed .
Wallenberg rented thirty - two buildings in Budapest , and declared them to be extraterritorial , protected by diplomatic immunity .
He put up signs such as “ The Swedish Library ” and “ The Swedish Research Institute ” on their doors and hung oversize Swedish flags on the front of the buildings to bolster the deception .
The buildings eventually housed almost 10,000 people .
Wallenberg started sleeping in a different house each night , to avoid being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann .
Two days before the Russians occupied Budapest , Wallenberg negotiated with both Eichmann and General Gerhard Schmidthuber , the commander of the German army in Hungary .
Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded them to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over .
People saved by Wallenberg include biochemist Lars Ernster , who was housed in the Swedish embassy , and Tom Lantos , the only Holocaust survivor to serve in the United States House of Representatives , who lived in one of the Swedish protective houses .
After the war , Wallenberg was captured and imprisoned by the Soviets , and died in prison in 1947 , though the date and circumstances of his death remain disputed .
+ Pope Pius XII
On April 28 , 1935 , four years before the War even started , Pacelli ( soon to become Pope Pius XII ) gave a speech that aroused the attention of the world press .
Speaking to an audience of 250,000 pilgrims in Lourdes , France , the future Pius XII stated that the Nazis “ are in reality only miserable plagiarists who dress up old errors with new tinsel .
It does not make any difference whether they flock to the banners of social revolution , whether they are guided by a false concept of the world and of life , or whether they are possessed by the superstition of a race and blood cult . ”
During the war ( when Pacelli had become Pope ) he spoke out strongly in defense of the Jews with the first mass arrests in 1943 , and L’Osservatore Romano carried an article protesting the internment of Jews and the confiscation of their property .
The Fascist press came to call the Vatican paper ‘ a mouthpiece of the Jews . ’
Prior to the Nazi invasion , the Pope had been working hard to get Jews out of Italy by emigration ; he now was forced to turn his attention to finding them hiding places : “ [ t ] he Pope sent out the order that religious buildings were to give refuge to Jews , even at the price of great personal sacrifice on the part of their occupants ; he released monasteries and convents from the cloister rule forbidding entry into these religious houses to all but a few specified outsiders , so that they could be used as hiding places .
Thousands of Jews — the figures run from 4,000 to 7,000 — were hidden , fed , clothed , and bedded in the 180 known places of refuge in Vatican City , churches and basilicas , Church administrative buildings , and parish houses .
Unknown numbers of Jews were sheltered in Castel Gandolfo , the site of the Pope ’s summer residence , private homes , hospitals , and nursing institutions ; and the Pope took personal responsibility for the care of the children of Jews deported from Italy . ”

Each one tried to focus the world 's attention on the world 's most heinous crime : genocide .
Each time , they were shunned , ignored or told it was someone else 's problem .
To understand why , CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe , Africa and Asia for a two - hour documentary , " Scream Bloody Murder . "
Having reported on mass atrocities around the world , this time Amanpour traced the personal accounts of those who tried to stop the slaughter .
The yearlong CNN investigation found that instead of using a U.N. treaty outlawing genocide as a springboard to action , political leaders have invoked reason after reason to make intervention seem unnecessary , pointless and even counter - productive .

December marks the 60th anniversary of the U.N. 's Genocide Convention , when -- in the aftermath of the Holocaust -- the nations of the world pledged to prevent and punish future attempts to eliminate ethnic , religious and national groups .
Read the 1948 Genocide Convention ( pdf )
" The Genocide Convention should have stopped genocide , but it didn't , " said Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel .
Intervention is a daunting challenge , he believes , because of a tendency to minimize accounts from refugees and victims .
" It 's better not to believe , because if you believe , you do n't sleep nights .
And how can you eat ?
How can you drink a glass of wine when you know ? "

1970s : Cambodia
Father François Ponchaud was a Catholic missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge guerillas -- communist revolutionaries -- seized power in 1975 .
They expelled all foreigners from the country .
But working from France , Ponchaud gathered refugee accounts and monitored radio broadcasts to document the slave labor , torture and executions the Khmer Rouge were using to kill one - fourth of Cambodia 's population .
He published his findings in a major French newspaper and wrote a book , " Year Zero . "
But even so , Ponchaud tells Amanpour , " No one believed us . "
Watch a behind - the - scenes look at the making of ' Scream Bloody Murder ' »
1980s : Iraq
CNN found that intervention is often weighed against political and economic costs .
Declassified U.S. government documents show that while Saddam Hussein was gassing Iraqi Kurds , the U.S. opposed punishing Iraq with a trade embargo because it was cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. farm exports .
According to Peter Galbraith , then an idealistic Senate staffer determined to stop Hussein from committing genocide , the Reagan administration " got carried away with their own propaganda .
They began to believe that Saddam Hussein could be a reliable partner . "
Read once - secret U.S. documents
1990s : Bosnia
Even extensive news coverage may not lead to intervention .
During the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s , the media reported on the Bosnian Serbs ' ethnic cleansing of Muslims : the siege of Sarajevo , the concentration camps , the use of rape as a weapon of war .
It was like watching " a color remake of the black - and - white scenes we 'd seen in World War II , " said U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke , whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power .
Holbrooke was an early advocate for a U.S. - led military operation against the Bosnian Serbs .
" I took a stand that I believed was correct , " he told Amanpour .
" I did n't think it was so controversial . "
But it would take three years -- and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica -- for Holbrooke to make his case within the Clinton administration .
1994 : Rwanda
In Rwanda , where Hutu soldiers and militias massacred their Tutsi countrymen , the Clinton administration tried to avoid characterizing the ethnic slaughter as genocide .
According to an internal memo , the State Department worried that under the 1948 Genocide Convention , using the term " genocide " could force the U.S. " to actually ' do something . ' "
The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda , Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire , begged for additional troops .
Instead of reinforcements , Dallaire got an order to withdraw completely .
He would not leave Rwanda .
" I refused a legal order , " he told Amanpour , " but it was immoral . "
His tiny U.N. force was not enough to stop the slaughter of more than 800,000 people .
2003 : Darfur
Some human rights advocates consider Darfur , the western region of Sudan , to be the scene of the first genocide of the 21st century .
The atrocities in Darfur grow out of a civil war between rebels from Sudan 's African tribes and the country 's Arab - led government .
In 2003 , when the rebels attacked government outposts in Darfur , a U.N. human rights monitor warned that in the " escalating conflict , " Sudan 's government may be " engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur . "
At the time , world attention was on Iraq , where the United States was fighting to overthrow Saddam Hussein .
The early warning on Darfur " disappeared into a big hole , " according to Mukesh Kapila , then the U.N. 's top official in Sudan .
Even when the U.N. Security Council put Darfur on its agenda , it took more than three years to authorize a robust peacekeeping force .
" There was no lack of information , " says activist Eric Reeves .
" There was a lack of will to stop genocide . "
In July , the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court accused Sudan 's president of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , charges Sudan denies .
Read the ICC prosecutor 's charges ( pdf )
How will history judge the world 's response to Darfur ?
" It will applaud the young people ... who believe in solidarity , " says Wiesel .
" It will certainly criticize the leaders of the world . "
And the next time somebody screams bloody murder to stop a genocide , will anyone listen ?

Advertisement Three Chinese naval ships have set sail for waters off Somalia to protect Chinese vessels from pirate attacks .
Two destroyers and a supply ship left the port of Sanya on Hainan island to join warships from other nations already patrolling the area .
It will be the Chinese navy 's first operation beyond the Pacific .
There have been more than 100 pirate attacks this year off Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's busiest sea lanes .
On Thursday , the German navy said it had foiled an attempt by pirates to hijack an Egyptian cargo vessel off Somalia .
Six Somali pirates were captured by sailors of the frigate Karlsruhe in the Gulf of Aden .
However , the pirates were immediately released on the orders of the German government , officials told the BBC .
Japan 's prime minister also indicated that his country was considering sending ships to help combat piracy .
" Each nation is taking measures .
So , Japan should also take its own steps , " Taro Aso said .
' International scourge '
The commander of China 's South Sea Fleet , Rear Adm Du Jingchen , said his personnel were prepared for a complicated and long - term mission .
" Acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and coastal waters off Somalia have been increasingly rampant since the beginning of this year , posing a severe danger to the safety of ships and members from many countries , including China , " China 's Defence Ministry spokesman Huang Xueping said .
" Apart from this , pirates have also been threatening ships delivering humanitarian relief items to Somalia by international organisations .
Piracy has become an international scourge . "
The Chinese military says there have been seven attacks this year on Chinese vessels in the area .
It says its forces will board and inspect suspected pirate ships , try to rescue those who are attacked and mount a vigorous defence if they themselves come under attack .
However , defence ministry officials insist that China 's doctrine of non-interference in other nations ' affairs has not changed , the BBC's Chris Hogg in Beijing says .
The Chinese will work with other members of the international task force in the area .
China has no bases in the region so keeping its forces well supplied during what is expected to be a lengthy deployment is a major challenge , our correspondent adds .

6.037 - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs [ 2019 ]
NOTE : This class is not currently being offered .
Below you 'll find a snapshot of this page from the end of the IAP 2019 session .
Feel free to use the materials here to self - study .
Introduction
This fast - paced course covers the material in the classic book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs — a class previously known at MIT as 6.001 .
It uses Scheme to introduce students to principles of computation , and to teach thought patterns for computer science .
Students are taught to apply structural , procedural , and meta-linguistic abstraction to solve computational problems .
Five projects will be assigned and graded .
Prerequisites : some programming experience ; high confusion threshold .
This class is not meant as an introduction to programming ; some programming experience is assumed .
If you have little to no experience with programming , we suggest 6.145 , 6.178 , or other non-credit offerings listed in the IAP guide .
6.037 focuses on higher - level concepts and abstraction in Scheme , an interesting but esoteric language which is infrequently seen in the wild ;
The language is light on practicality , but lends itself well to discussing computational theory .
The class attempts to cram the entire material of a semester - long MIT course into eight two - hour lectures , with accompanying individual weekly projects , and as such is rather information - dense .
Your tour guides for this adventure are : Mike Phillips , Benjamin Barenblat , Leon Shen , Ben Vandiver , and Arthur Migdal .
To contact them , you can email 6.001 - zombies at the obvious domain .

While these people are too numerous to list here , there are definitely some names we would be remiss to omit :
My own view is that the American conservative movement 's embrace or defense of torture was the moment its intellectual collapse became irrecoverable .
When conservatism abandoned core values of American decency in favor of pure force , exemplified by torture techniques designed by Communists and Nazis , then it ceased to be conservative in the sense that Burke or Hayek or Oakeshott or Kirk would begin to understand .
And watching the intellectual dishonesty of the right on this issue in the last few years has been a watershed for me .
It has been , in my judgment , one long , awful surrender of truth to power .
Take a moment with me to review what one leading light of the Republican blogosphere wrote when the Abu Ghraib scandal first hit the news in the spring of 2004 .
Here 's Glenn Reynolds :
Of course , it 's not the same as Saddam 's torture -- which was a matter of top - down policy , not the result of assholes who deserve jail or execution , and will probably get one or both .
As with other reported misbehavior , it should be dealt with very , very harshly .
But those who would -- as Senator Kerry did after Vietnam -- make such behavior emblematic of our effort , instead of recognizing it as an abandonment of our principles -- are mere opportunists .
But what if the perpetrators of those acts actually were the president and vice - president , men whom Reynolds chose to endorse in 2004 ?
What if , in Reynolds ' terms , the torture at Abu Ghraib was indeed " top - down policy " ?
This is now factually indisputable , according to the bipartisan Senate report issued last week .
So why are those responsible not subject to " jail or execution " or both ?
Why , since the evidence of Bush 's authorization of these war crimes , has Reynolds abandoned his view that such behavior should be " dealt with very , very harshly " ?
Perhaps Reynolds has discovered something since Abu Ghraib that has led him to change his mind and now allows him to endorse the very methods he once denounced .
We can all change our minds in the face of new data .
But does n't he owe his readers an explanation for why what he once found worthy of the death penalty is now something he actually favors ?
It could n't be that he changed his mind as soon as he realized president Bush authorized it , could it ?
If the president does it , it 's not illegal ?

Entrapment ?
Five convicted in Ft. Dix plot Nick Juliano

Five men whom attorneys said paid FBI informants prodded into exploring their deepest fantasies about waging jihad on America were convicted in federal court Monday of conspiring to kill US soldiers but acquitted on attempted murder charges .
The men allegedly planned to attack Fort Dix in New Jersey , although defense lawyers argued that they never intended to carry out the plot and were drawn into making incriminating statements by the informants , one of whom was an illegal immigrant on probation for bank fraud and another who was paid $ 150,000 to secretly record the men .
The verdict was met with intense skepticism in the Muslim community .
" Many people in the Muslim community will see this as a case of entrapment , " Jim Sues , executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , told the Associated Press .
Sues attended five days of testimony during the trial .
" From what I saw , there was a significant role played by the government informant . "
Like many of the government 's highly touted terror cases pursued with much headline - grabbing vigor since 9/11 , the Fort Dix plot seemed more aspirational than operational .
A clear - eyed consideration of the alleged plot suggests there was never much chance of it going off successfully .
The men hoped to storm a heavily fortified army base armed only with a half - dozen assault rifles , killing as many soldiers as possible before escaping in a getaway car parked a quarter - mile away .
Clearly , this was not even in the same universe as the elaborately planned , meticulously coordinated hijacking the government failed to stop seven years ago .
The Associated Press provides more background on the conviction .
During the eight - week trial , the government relied heavily on information gathered by the informants , who infiltrated the group and secretly recorded hundreds of conversations .
Prosecutors said the men bought several assault rifles supplied by the FBI and that they trekked to Pennsylvania 's Pocono Mountains to practice their shooting .
The government also presented dozens of jihadist speeches and videos that the men supposedly used as inspiration .
Convicted were : Jordanian - born cab driver Mohamad Shnewer ; Turkish - born convenience store clerk Serdar Tatar ; and brothers Dritan , Eljvir and Shain Duka , ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia , who had a roofing business .
A blogger at FireDogLake 's emptywheel notes the difficulty inherent in assessing such cases .
" It is hard to know the validity of prosecutions like this one with the tattered reputation of the Bush Department of Justice .
The habitual practice of oppressive and deceptive prosecutions , and flat out dishonesty , especially on terrorism cases , leaves even jury verdicts open to question , " writes bmaz .
" January 20 , 2009 cannot come soon enough . "
The government has not been as successful in securing convictions of other groups of Muslims cajoled into hatching plots against America .
Federal prosecutors are trying for a third time to convict six Florida men accused of hatching an improbable scheme to bomb the Sears Tower .
Another perhaps overstated case alleging a plot to blow up fuel tanks at JFK Airport in New York has yet to go to trial .
Australia is facing its worst drought in a century
Australia 's driest state has decided to buy in water supplies amid fears it will run out next year .
South Australia said it had spent tens of millions of dollars to ensure Adelaide , Australia 's fifth - largest city , and the state had enough water .
State Premier Mike Rann described it as a " prudent and sensible " measure .
Drought has become a regular occurrence in South Australia , which already receives the least rainfall of any Australian state .
Lack of rainfall and a sharp reduction in the amount of water flowing into the Murray River meant the state could not guarantee water levels for 2009 .
The state 's water security minister , Karlene Maywald , said she had purchased 61 billion gallons ( 231 gigalitres ) of extra water for 2009 .
Some of it has come from shared water resources with New South Wales and Victoria states , while the rest was purchased on the water trading market , she said .
Water levels in the vitally important Murray Darling basin - which produces 40 % of the country 's fruit , vegetables and grain - have fallen to critically low levels .
Ms Maywald said the region had sufficient water needs for this year , but had not yet accumulated enough for 2009 - 10 .
" So we 've made a decision to go into the market and purchase water on the temporary market , " she said .
Mr Rann defended his minister 's move .
" We 've been buying water for years , but this is water that 's being bought as back - up water for critical human needs , " he was quoted by ABC News as saying .
" I think what she 's done is absolutely prudent and sensible in the worst drought in a thousand years according to the scientific experts . "
One of the misconceptions about cloud storage is that it is only useful for storing files .
This assumption comes from the popularity of file ...
Nothing is more annoying than getting prank phone calls , calls from telemarketers , and calls from President - elect Barack Obama .
Barack Obama ?
No time for you
Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen received a phone call from Obama yesterday to wish her congratulations on her re-election and to convey other political - type niceties -- like the importance of working together .
Problem was , she did n't believe it was him .
She thought it was one of those wacky radio station stunts wherein a DJ gets you to believe he is someone famous .
You know , like when Sarah Palin was spoofed into thinking she was talking to French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Determined not to be " Palin-ized , " Ros-Lehtinen hung up on him .
Strike two
So Obama 's head honcho Rahm Emanuel got involved and called her back .
She promptly hung up on him too .
'' I thought it was one of the radio stations in South Florida playing an incredible , elaborate , terrific prank on me , '' Ros-Lehtinen told the Miami Herald .
`` They got Fidel Castro to go along .
They 've gotten Hugo Chavez and others to fall for their tricks .
I said , ' Oh , no , I wo n't be punked ' . ''
Third time 's the charm
It finally took Representative Howard Berman to get involved before she would believe Obama wanted to talk to her .
Berman called his colleague , but she was wary of him too .
In fact , she demanded that Berman share a private joke they share to convince her that Berman was actually Berman .
No details of the private joke has emerged but that top - secret intelligence was enough for Ros-Lehtinen to believe that this was all for real .
She then told Berman to tell Obama to try again .
``I know this sounds very presumptuous , but please tell President - elect Obama he can call me now and I will take his call , " she said .
A big laugh
How'd the call go ?
She said the two of them had fun when they finally connected .
" He was having a good laugh , " she told CNN .
" He said Michelle will get a kick out of this .
Because she likes to pinch my ego -- bring it down a notch . "
She said he later told her lightheartedly that he would always remember her for the incident .
" Trust me , Ileana , " she recounted him saying .
" You will always be remembered by me , because I have made many of these calls and never once has anyone ever hung up on me .
And never once has anyone hung up on me twice . "
Note : I meant to post this some weeks ago , but the bailout derailed that plan .
While it pertains to the just - past election , it ’s still relevant .
The absurdity that Ron Paul is a defender of liberty should now be at an end , given his endorsement of the worst possible candidate for president , Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin .
The Constitution Party seeks to impose Biblical law on America .
I was going to quote some relevant sections of their platform , but the Preamble says it all :
The Constitution Party gratefully acknowledges the blessing of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as Creator , Preserver and Ruler of the Universe and of these United States .
We hereby appeal to Him for mercy , aid , comfort , guidance and the protection of His Providence as we work to restore and preserve these United States .
This great nation was founded , not by religionists , but by Christians ; not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ .
For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been and are afforded asylum , prosperity , and freedom of worship here .
The goal of the Constitution Party is to restore American jurisprudence to its Biblical foundations and to limit the federal government to its Constitutional boundaries .
Let ’s consider what that would mean in practice .
On abortion :
The pre-born child , whose life begins at fertilization , is a human being created in God ’s image .
The first duty of the law is to prevent the shedding of innocent blood .
It is , therefore , the duty of all civil governments to secure and to safeguard the lives of the pre-born . …
We affirm the God - given legal personhood of all unborn human beings , without exception .
As to matters of rape and incest , it is unconscionable to take the life of an innocent child for the crimes of his father .
No government may legalize the taking of the unalienable right to life without justification , including the life of the pre-born ; abortion may not be declared lawful by any institution of state or local government – legislative , judicial , or executive .
The right to life should not be made dependent upon a vote of a majority of any legislative body .
…
In addition , we oppose the funding and legalization of bio-research involving human embryonic or pre-embryonic cells .
Finally , we also oppose all government “ legalization ” of euthanasia , infanticide and suicide .
On drugs :
The Constitution Party will uphold the right of states and localities to restrict access to drugs and to enforce such restrictions .
We support legislation to stop the flow of illegal drugs into these United States from foreign sources .
As a matter of self - defense , retaliatory policies including embargoes , sanctions , and tariffs , should be considered .
On marriage :
The law of our Creator defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman .
The marriage covenant is the foundation of the family , and the family is fundamental in the maintenance of a stable , healthy and prosperous social order .
No government may legitimately authorize or define marriage or family relations contrary to what God has instituted .
…
Finally , we oppose any legal recognition of homosexual unions . …
We affirm the value of the father and the mother in the home , and we oppose efforts to legalize adoption of children by homosexual singles or couples .
Gambling :
Gambling promotes an increase in crime , destruction of family values , and a decline in the moral fiber of our country .
We are opposed to government sponsorship , involvement in , or promotion of gambling , such as lotteries , or subsidization of Native American casinos in the name of economic development .
We call for the repeal of federal legislation that usurps state and local authority regarding authorization and regulation of tribal casinos in the states .
On immigration :
We favor a moratorium on immigration to these United States , except in extreme hardship cases or in other individual special circumstances , until the availability of all federal subsidies and assistance be discontinued , and proper security procedures have been instituted to protect against terrorist infiltration .
On the judiciary :
We commend Former Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court for his defense of the display of the Ten Commandments , and condemn those who persecuted him and removed him from office for his morally and legally just stand .
On statehood :
We acknowledge that each state ’s membership in the Union is voluntary .
By endorsing a candidate from the Constitution Party , Ron Paul has clearly shown that he ’s no friend of liberty .
Instead , he ’s endorsed a theocratic government in which Christians would force everyone to comply with the demands of their faith at the point of a gun .
The fact that Ron Paul is still regarded as a defender of liberty within libertarian circles shows — yet again — the effects of rejecting any philosophical foundation for liberty .
The word “ liberty ” loses all of its meaning , such that statists ( and kooks ) of all stripes are regarded as pro-liberty friends and allies .
Schizophrenia may blur the boundary between internal and external realities by over - activating a brain system that is involved in self - reflection , and thus causing an exaggerated focus on self , a new MIT and Harvard brain imaging study has found .
The traditional view of schizophrenia is that the disturbed thoughts , perceptions and emotions that characterize the disease are caused by disconnections among the brain regions that control these different functions .
But this study , appearing Jan. 19 in the advance online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that schizophrenia also involves an excess of connectivity between the so - called default brain regions , which are involved in self - reflection and become active when we are thinking about nothing in particular , or thinking about ourselves .
" People normally suppress this default system when they perform challenging tasks , but we found that patients with schizophrenia do n't do this , " said John D. Gabrieli , a professor in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT and one of the study 's 13 authors .
" We think this could help to explain the cognitive and psychological symptoms of schizophrenia . "
Gabrieli added that he hopes the research might lead to ways of predicting or monitoring individual patients ' response to treatments for this mental illness , which occurs in about 1 percent of the population .
Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component , and first - degree relatives of patients ( who share half their genes ) are 10 times more likely to develop the disease than the general population .
The identities of these genes and how they affect the brain are largely unknown .
The researchers thus studied three carefully matched groups of 13 subjects each : schizophrenia patients , nonpsychotic first - degree relatives of patients and healthy controls .
They selected patients who were recently diagnosed , so that differences in prior treatment or psychotic episodes would not bias the results .
The subjects were scanned by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) while resting and while performing easy or hard memory tasks .
The behavioral and clinical testing were performed by Larry J. Seidman and colleagues at Harvard Medical School , and the imaging data were analyzed by first author Susan Whitfield - Gabrieli , a research scientist at the MIT Martinos Imaging Center at the McGovern Institute .
The researchers were especially interested in the default system , a network of brain regions whose activity is suppressed when people perform demanding mental tasks .
This network includes the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex , regions that are associated with self - reflection and autobiographical memories and which become connected into a synchronously active network when the mind is allowed to wander .
Whitfield - Gabrieli found that in the schizophrenia patients , the default system was both hyperactive and hyperconnected during rest , and it remained so as they performed the memory tasks .
In other words , the patients were less able than healthy control subjects to suppress the activity of this network during the task .
Interestingly , the less the suppression and the greater the connectivity , the worse they performed on the hard memory task , and the more severe their clinical symptoms .
" We think this may reflect an inability of people with schizophrenia to direct mental resources away from internal thoughts and feelings and toward the external world in order to perform difficult tasks , " Whitfield - Gabrieli explained .
The hyperactive default system could also help to explain hallucinations and paranoia by making neutral external stimuli seem inappropriately self - relevant .
For instance , if brain regions whose activity normally signifies self - focus are active while listening to a voice on television , the person may perceive that the voice is speaking directly to them .
The default system is also overactive , though to a lesser extent , in first - degree relatives of schizophrenia patients who did not themselves have the disease .
This suggests that overactivation of the default system may be linked to the genetic cause of the disease rather than its consequences .
The default system is a hot topic in brain imaging , according to John Gabrieli , partly because it is easy to measure and because it is affected in different ways by different disorders .

Over the Thanksgiving weekend , in addition to spending lots of quality time with friends and family , I also had the opportunity to learn about the Tibetan Buddhist concept of the Rainbow Body .
At first , I scoffed at the story as it was told of people who attain such enlightenment that their body dissipates into the light , becoming a rainbow itself , only to leave behind the dead bodily components like hair and nails .
Apparently , there are tales of individuals having achieved Rainbow Body throughout history , the most recent recorded case being Ayu Khandro in 1953 .
Ayu was a life - long student of Buddhism .
As a child she was drawn to the religion , but was forced into an arranged marriage by her family .
An illness befell her just a few years after the wedding .
Conveniently enough , a Buddhist teacher told her husband that if she was n’t allowed to return to her spiritual study , Ayu would die .
Thankfully , Ayu had an understanding husband , and Ayu was allowed to go back to her studies .
Ayu Khandro survived her illness going on to study and teach for many years , and became well known as a living female Buddha .
When she died she was 115 years old .
Ayu ’s is a wonderful life story .
However , a little digging finds that her corporeal body did not turn into light of all colors at the end of her life .
Her body remained for two months before being cremated .
It may be debatable as to whether or not she reached a transcendent mental state .
We ca n’t know what happened to her spirit at the point of her death .
Some will say that she simply died .
Others will believe that having lived a saint ’s life , she went to heaven .
Still others will believe that her consciousness transferred to an energetic essence .
Regardless of the belief , she did not physically disappear .
In this case , it seems the symbolism of the Rainbow Body became concrete .
Whether it was purposeful misrepresentation or a result of human interpretation , the result is that people now take the story literally .
I wonder how often this happens that philosophical symbolism , like this transition from life to leaving the body and joining the rainbow light of Nirvana , becomes real in peoples ’ minds .
How many stories in the bible or any other historical text are symbolic in nature when written or spoken , but turned to truth somewhere down the road ?
We have no way of knowing what comes after death , what lies beyond our universe , or even where our universe came from .
If stories like these are meant to give people hope that this life is not all there is , they ca n’t be all that bad .
It ’s when they are misrepresented and then mistaken for truth that they stop being as culturally useful .
I do n’t necessarily subscribe to Buddhist or any other religious thinking , but I do appreciate the symbolism and the stories .
The story of the Rainbow Body has a certain appeal .
When you stop to think about it , who would n’t want to turn into a rainbow instead of heading off to heaven or hell at the end of life ?
I find it a particularly satisfying ending .
The price of food ’s been going up , up , up .
I watched my normally cheap veggie - protein , quinoa , double in cost overnight .
Hey , that ’s one of my staples !
It ’s already rough enough when you insist on shopping at the organic grocery , but even bargain shoppers are feeling the pinch .
Do n’t believe it ’s bad ?
This just in : the number of food - stamp users has hit 31.6 million people – that ’s 1 in 10 Americans .
Take a moment and think about that .
That means 1 in 10 Americans now have income levels far enough below the poverty line to qualify for food stamps .
Ouch .
I guess it ’s just one more inspiration to push people to try and grow their own food .
It ’s not going to be a case of Victory Gardens like in WWII or urban gardening chic – we ’ll be doing it out of necessity if this keeps up .
Personal sustainability is going to get , well , personal !
We think of food as being a third world problem .
But it may in fact be a global problem .
How are you coping with high food prices ?
Have your shopping habits changed ?

Oh in that case …
“ I ’m frustrated by what ’s going on , ” said Dave Leatherby , owner of the Leatherby Family Creamery in Sacramento , commenting on the protests and court battles .
“ Let ’s move on .
I always told my children that once a rule was made , you have to abide by it .
I think it should be the same in this circumstance . ”
Leatherby and his family donated about $ 20,000 for the passage of Proposition 8 .
A devout Catholic and father of 10 , Leatherby supported the measure for religious reasons .
He said his business has been targeted by bloggers as a result , and that he is particularly confused because his business has participated in the annual gay pride Rainbow Festival .
IT sounds like a plot straight out of a science - fiction novel by Michael Crichton .
Toiletry companies formulate new cutting - edge creams and lotions that contain tiny components designed to work more effectively .
But those minuscule building blocks have an unexpected drawback : the ability to penetrate the skin , swarm through the body and overwhelm organs like the liver .
Humans have long lived in dread of such nightmare scenarios in which swarms of creatures attack .
Alfred Hitchcock envisioned menacing flocks in “ The Birds . ”
In the 1990 film “ Arachnophobia ” a killer spider arrives in the United States , where it attacks and multiplies .
And now comes nanophobia , the fear that tiny components engineered on the nanoscale  that is , 100 nanometers or less  could run amok inside the body .
A human hair , for example , is 50,000 to 100,000 nanometers in diameter .
A nanoparticle of titanium dioxide in a sunscreen could be as small as 15 nanometers .
( One nanometer equals a billionth of a meter . )
“ The smaller a particle , the further it can travel through tissue , along airways or in blood vessels , ” said Dr. Adnan Nasir , a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
“ Especially if the nanoparticles are indestructible and accumulate and are not metabolized , if you accumulate them in the organs , the organs could fail . ”
A Toothbrush - The Life Saving Medical Device Sitting On Your Sink
Hospital - borne infections are a serious risk of a long - term hospital stay , and ventilator - associated pneumonia ( VAP ) , a lung infection that develops in about 15 % of all people who are ventilated , is among the most dangerous .
With weakened immune systems and a higher resistance to antibiotics , patients who rely on a mechanical ventilator can easily develop serious infections — as 26,000 Americans do every year .
Thanks to a proven new clinical approach developed by Tel Aviv University nurses , though , there is a new tool for stopping the onset of VAP in hospitals .
This new high - tech tool ?
An ordinary toothbrush .
Three Times a Day Keeps Pneumonia Away
" Pneumonia is a big problem in hospitals everywhere , even in the developed world , " says Nurse Ofra Raanan , the chief researcher in the new study and a lecturer at Tel Aviv University 's Department of Nursing .
" Patients who are intubated can be contaminated with pneumonia only 2 or 3 days after the tube is put in place .
But pneumonia can be effectively prevented if the right measures are taken . "
Raanan , who works at the Sheba Academic School of Nursing at The Chaim Sheba Medical Center , collaborated with a team of nurses at major medical centers around Israel .
The nurses found that if patients –– even unconscious ones –– have their teeth brushed three times a day , the onset of pneumonia can be reduced by as much as 50 % .
A Pioneering Study with Measurable Effects
It 's difficult to quantify the effects precisely , the researchers say .
" While the research shows a definite improvement in reducing the incidence of hospital - borne pneumonia , it 's hard to say by exactly how much toothbrushing prevents VAP , " says Raanan , but the published evidence shows a direct correlation for intubated patients .
" Sometimes , however , doctors and nurses do everything right and the patient still gets pneumonia .
But this approach will certainly improve the odds for survival . "
Normally , the teeth and oral cavity in a healthy mouth maintain a colony of otherwise harmless bacteria .
Infection takes root when a breathing tube allows free passage of the " good " bacteria into the lower parts of the lung .
The bacteria travel in small water droplets through the tube and colonize the lung .
Once there , the bacteria take advantage of a patient 's weakened immune system and multiply .
A regular toothbrushing kills the growth and subsequent spread of the bacterium that leads to VAP .
Augmenting the Preventative Routine
There are additional steps for preventing the onset of VAP .
Today , nurses typically use a mechanical suction device to remove secretions from the mouth and throat .
They also put patients in a seated position and change the position every few hours .
Toothbrushing , say Tel Aviv University nurses , should be added to the routine .
Although nurses in some American hospitals already practice toothbrushing on ventilated patients , these new results may convince medical centers around the world to invest more resources in this routine practice , thereby saving lives .
On Sunday , WaPo ran an article about visiting Oscar Zero , a missile silo in North Dakota .
( See the State Historical Society of North Dakota website and an article in the Bismarck Tribune . )
You ca n’t actually visit it yet .
And the article does n’t contain any actual details about the visit — it is largely an exercise in navel gazing , with the Cold War - threat of apocalypse serving as a starting point for the author to discuss a book he read about the end of the world ( Thomas Homer - Dixon , The Upside Down : Catastrophe , Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization ) , an early 1990s visit to the Fulda Gap and his shrinking 401 ( K ) .
Yawn .
Come to think of it , here is the full - text of the article without the narcissistic passages :
Take a slow , loud elevator cage down into the depths of Oscar Zero , as it is called — the launch control center for what used to be a bevy of Minuteman III nuclear missiles aimed at the late , great Soviet Union — and return with us now to those days of the Cold War when , unlike today , even when things were bleak , they were at least clear .
“ In the movie ‘ WarGames , ’ we were the first to go , ” Delore Zimmerman , a Grand Forks economic development specialist , recalls cheerfully .
When you ’re surrounded by 150 Minuteman III silos , with 400 - plus warheads , spread out geometrically across eight very large counties from the Canadian border to Interstate 94 , you have an extremely clear idea of what the end of the world looks like .
Kind of consoling , actually , in its lack of ambiguity .
[ snip , ponderous thoughts about the perilous state of the world ]
After a while , you think about this at the bottom of Oscar Zero .
Its portion of the actual missile fields that made North Dakota one of the world ’s great nuclear powers has been gone for a decade , destroyed as part of an agreement between the United States and Russia .
Oscar Zero , however , has been preserved in the hope that the State Historical Society will one day be able to reopen it as a museum .
Such an attraction is seen as an economic development opportunity , bringing in tourists .
Oscar Zero is not yet open to the public , but if you ’ve got friends in the economic development community , it ’s possible to find someone with a key who will show you around .
That would be John Clark , a Cooperstown native who maintains the place just as it was on July 17 , 1997 , the day the nuclear warriors stood down .
When Clark was in the Air Force , he served as a “ nuclear weapons specialist . ”
He would test the cone - shaped warheads electronically to make sure they would work .
You ask him if that was spooky .
More in hindsight than at the time , he says .
The command post deep underground is in a concrete pod perhaps 30 feet high and 50 feet long .
You enter it through a tunnel sealed by a three - foot - thick blast door .
The floor on which you stand , gazing at the desks full of ancient electronics , is suspended from the top of the pod by giant shock absorbers about 2 feet across and 20 feet long .
The chair on which you sit to look at the “ status alert ” display board — which includes lights labeled “ Enabled , ” “ Lch in process ” and “ Missile away ” — is similar to an airline pilot ’s captain ’s chair .
It has a four - point seat belt that comes over your shoulders .
Oscar Zero is majorly prepared for the ground to move beneath your feet .

Mr. Blagojevich , a two - term Democrat who was arrested last week on federal charges of conspiracy and soliciting bribes and accused , among other things , of trying to sell the Senate seat , did not appear before the impeachment inquiry committee .

But his team of lawyers , including Edward Genson , a fiery criminal defense lawyer well - known in Illinois after more than four decades in Chicago courtrooms , made its first appearance here , describing the lawmakers ’ efforts as a “ real witch hunt ” and offering a series of pointed objections about the state ’s vague standards for impeachment , the lawmakers ’ use of the federal criminal complaint against the governor as evidence in their inquiry , and at least three lawmakers he said could not be fair .
“ This is Alice in Wonderland , ” Mr. Genson announced at one point , in a series of contentious , snippy exchanges in the public hearings at the Capitol .
“ I think it ’s unfair to put in hearsay , ” he said at another point , referring to the 78 - page criminal complaint against Mr. Blagojevich , which lawmakers heard read aloud much of the day .
“ I think it ’s unfair to put in anonymous people .
I think it ’s unfair to deprive him of confrontation .
I think it ’s unfair to do all those things . ”
The day ’s events seemed to mark the first upbeat developments for Mr. Blagojevich in what has been an avalanche of accusations and criticisms against him for more than a week .
It was enough , it seemed , that a lighthearted Mr. Blagojevich , who had until now been avoiding reporters and the public , invited a Chicago Tribune photographer to join him on his jog ( offering his commentary on the head - clearing benefits of running ) , and suggested that he will soon tell his story  as early , Mr. Genson said , as Friday .
Already , Mr. Genson provided one insight into Mr. Blagojevich ’s thinking : the governor will not now , he said , try to appoint someone to fill Mr. Obama ’s Senate seat .
“ Harry Reid said they ’re not going to accept anybody he picks , ” Mr. Genson said of Mr. Blagojevich .
“ Why would he do that ? ”
Raymond Woods is allowed in church to attend a service or by invitation A 52 - year - old man has been banned from any place of worship across England and Wales after a series of public order offences at churches in Surrey .
Police said Raymond Woods , of no fixed abode , stole money and other items , caused criminal damage and intimidated parishioners in Godalming .
Magistrates in Guildford granted a four - year Asbo on Friday which bans Woods from places of worship .
He is allowed in church to attend a service , or by official invitation .
The order states the invitation must be from a church representative .
Other offences by Woods included being abusive to the public and intimidating shopkeepers in Godalming town centre , Surrey Police said .
Woods has caused no end of misery
Jo Grimshaw
He also targeted people in the doctor 's surgery , supermarket , bank and railway station .
Jo Grimshaw , anti-social behaviour manager for the force , said Woods had been " verbally warned on many occasions " but had " continued to behave in an offensive manner " and had not taken up the help he had been offered .
She said : " Woods has caused no end of misery to local Godalming shopkeepers , residents and parishioners and Surrey Police will not tolerate such anti-social behaviour . "
She said she hoped the Asbo would end the " suffering he has caused " and urged people to report Woods if he breaks any of the conditions .
Under the Asbo , which is in place until 13 November 2012 , Woods is banned from part of Godalming town centre unless he is travelling by train , bus or taxi .
He is also banned from behaviour " likely to cause alarm , harassment or distress " .

What are these ?

Dear Cecil :
What causes a person to shiver uncontrollably following urination ( i.e. , " piss shiver " ) ?
My friends and I have wrestled with this for years even to the point of consulting medical authorities ( they did n't know either ) .
We currently have two theories .
One is the Rapid Heat Loss
Theory which states that an uncontrollable shiver passes over the body following the rapid loss of several ounces of 98.6 degree liquid .
This theory seems to have good face validity but as far as we can tell females do not experience piss shiver , which puts a hole in that idea .
Our second theory is the Mini-Orgasm Theory , which states that a man 's penis is used for two major activities : urination and sexual activity .
When a man urinates , the two functions cross briefly and he experiences a mini-orgasm that causes his body to shiver uncontrollably .
Is either one of these correct , or is there a third theory we have n't thought of ?
Pleae help , Cecil .
Patrick Cormack , Dallas , Texas
Cecil replies :
I know I promised I would n’t answer this disgusting question , but my will is weak .
Besides , the subject has been debated on alt .
fan.cecil - adams off and on for weeks , and even though no firm conclusions have been arrived at ( par for the course on the net ) , the least I can do is give an interim report .
We ’ve made progress on one front : someone came up with an impressive - sounding name .
Peter H. M. Brooks proposes post - micturition convulsion syndrome , or PMCS .
Sure beats “ piss shiver . ”
Maybe now we can apply for a big federal grant .
The following key facts have also been unearthed :
Women — some , anyway — also experience PCMS .
That ’s it .
Theory productivity has been a little better .
Here ’s what we ’ve got so far :
Heat loss due to several ounces of warm fluid leaving the body .
Maybe , but then why do n’t we experience it during defecation , vomiting , etc . ?
Heat loss due to exposure of the nether regions .
Not likely ; as one netter points out , babies snugly clothed in diapers may be observed to experience PMCS .
It ’s caused by the passage of spermatozoa into the urinary canal .
Guess that explains why it happens to women .
It dates back to pre-civilization days when men had n’t learned to do their own shaking .
Attributed to George Carlin .
What a comedian .
It ’s all the fault of the parasympathetic nervous system .
The parasympathetic nervous system is up there with the Babylonians as the default explanation for anything you ca n’t think of a good reason for ( e.g. , photic sneeze reflex , closing your eyes when you sneeze ) , but I throw it in for the sake of completeness .
Your mini-orgasm theory sounds like a baroque version of this .
End of transmission .
Lame , I know , but what are you going to do ?
Cecil ca n’t figure out everything .
I ’d convene a special session of the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board , but they ’re still sleeping it off from our last symposium .
Contributions from the Teeming Millions cordially invited .

The car could be sold in Australia from as little as $ 20,000 within three years , although this is not yet confirmed .
The Japanese maker fired the first shot on the eve of the 2009 Detroit motor show , revealing its surprise future model in the hometown of North America ’s three biggest car makers .
It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the Toyota FT - EV , writes PAUL GOVER from Detroit .
The plug - in concept car is a seismic shift by the world 's largest carmaker and the next step from its ambitious move into the hybrid world .
Read more here ...
Toyota ’s announcement came as General Motors , Ford and Chrysler continue their fight for survival and calls for assistance from the US Government , and as the global economic crisis tightens its grip on the car industry .
The concept car is called the FT - EV and is based on a model called the iQ , which recently went on sale in Japan .
The tiny Toyota is bigger than a Smart city car but smaller than most other hatchbacks and can be fully recharged in a little more than seven hours .
It is due to go into production in Japan in 2012 and it could be on sale in Australia soon after .
“ We are certainly looking at , ” said Toyota Australia ’s product planning manager Peter Evans .
“ It ’s a fascinating vehicle .
It is definitely one of our priorities for the Australian market .
I think you will start to see a major shift towards these sorts of vehicles from 2012 and beyond . ”
Toyota would not speculate on the retail price of its new electric car so far out from launch , but a similarly - sized petrol - powered hatchback costs about $ 15,000 , and an electric motor and battery pack would likely add about $ 5000 to the cost of the car , say industry analysts , bringing the total close to $ 20,000 .
Significantly , on battery power alone the tiny Toyota will travel almost 20 km further than the Chevrolet Volt electric car to be made by General Motors .
However , the Toyota must be recharged after 80 km , whereas the Volt has a petrol generator which extends total driving range up to 1000km .
The Toyota electric car is a tiny four - seater hatchback whereas the Volt is about the size of a Holden Astra sedan .
Both cars are due in Australia about the same time – by the end of 2012 – if all goes to plan .
A spokesman for Toyota in North America said last year ’s spike in the price of petrol was no accident , and worse is to come .
In a statement issued to media , Irv Miller , Toyota Motor Sales group vice president , environmental and public affairs , said : “ [ The spike in the price of oil ] was a brief glimpse of our future .
We must address the inevitability of peak oil by developing vehicles powered by alternatives to liquid - oil fuel , as well as new concepts , like the iQ , that are lighter in weight and smaller in size .
This kind of vehicle , electrified or not , is where our industry must focus its creativity . ”
The comments echo those made by the boss of General Motors , Rick Wagoner , at last year ’s Detroit motor show .
In his address to media he said : “ There is no doubt demand for oil is outpacing supply at a rapid pace , and has been for some time now .
As a business necessity and an obligation to society we need to develop alternative sources of propulsion . ”
Mr Wagoner cited US Department of Energy figures which show the world is consuming roughly 1000 barrels of oil every second of the day , and yet demand for oil is likely to increase by 70 per cent over the next 20 years .
Last year , Toyota announced it planned to sell one million petrol - electric hybrids annually from 2010 , starting with at least 10 new hybrid vehicles .
Toyota is also trialing a large number of plug - in hybrid vehicles with fleet customers later this year , deploying across North America 500 Prius cars adapted with plug - in technology and using lithium - ion batteries .
Battery technology has been one of the biggest hurdles for electric cars because they are sensitive to extreme temperatures , are heavy and bulky to accommodate and costly and time - consuming to produce .

The poll was conducted online and by phone and text message
The former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin may have killed millions of his own people but this weekend he could be chosen by Russians as their greatest - ever countryman .
Inspired by the British competition 100 Greatest Britons , one of Russia 's biggest television stations Rossiya has been conducting a nationwide poll for much of this year .
From an original list of 500 candidates now there are just 12 names left from which viewers can select their all - time hero .
The winner will be announced on Sunday .
More than 3.5 million people have already voted and Stalin - born an ethnic Georgian - has been riding high for many months .
In the summer he held the number one slot but was knocked down several places after the producer of the show appealed to viewers to vote for someone else .
Amongst the others on the list are Ivan the Terrible , Lenin , Catherine the Great and Alexander Pushkin .
Mistakes ' forgiven '
The fact that Stalin has been doing so well comes as no surprise to members of the Communist Party , which remains one of the biggest political parties in the country .
TOP FIVE CHOICES IN POLL Pyotr Stolypin , pre-Revolutionary statesman - 426,300 Alexander Nevsky , medieval warrior prince - 418,200 Alexander Pushkin , poet - 397,100 votes Joseph Stalin , Soviet dictator - 397,000 Vladimir Lenin , Revolutionary leader - 342,400 data correct as of 1400 GMT 27 December " Stalin made Russia a superpower and was one of the founders of the coalition against Hitler in World War II , " says Sergei Malinkovich , leader of the St Petersburg Communist Party .
" In all opinion polls he comes out on top as the most popular figure .
Nobody else comes close .
So for his service to this country we can forgive his mistakes . "
Not only is Mr Malinkovich prepared to forgive Stalin's " mistakes " , he also wants the man who is regarded as one of the most bloodthirsty tyrants of the 20th Century to be made a saint .
As I was interviewing him , he held a small neatly framed icon of Stalin 's face .
Last month an Orthodox priest also displayed an icon of Stalin in his church near St Petersburg .
Although he was eventually forced to remove it , he vowed he would not be silenced and went on to describe Stalin as his " father " .
Many in Russia do still revere Stalin for his role during World War II when the Soviet Union defeated the forces of Nazi Germany .
But now there is a much broader campaign to rehabilitate Stalin and it seems to be coming from the highest levels of government .
Archives seized
The primary evidence comes in the form of a new manual for history teachers in the country 's schools , which says Stalin acted " entirely rationally " .
Stalin 's profile on the poll 's website does not shy away from his crimes " [ The initiative ] came from the very top , " says the editor of the manual , historian Alexander Danilov .
" I believe it was the idea of former president , now prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
" It fits completely with the political course we have had for the last eight years , which is dedicated to the unity of society . "
But the campaign goes further than reinterpreting history for schoolchildren .
It is also physical .
Earlier this month , riot police raided the St Petersburg office of one of Russia 's best - known human rights organisations , Memorial .
Claiming a possible link with an " extremist " article published in a local newspaper , the police took away 12 computer hard - drives containing the entire digital archive of the atrocities committed under Stalin .
Memorial 's St Petersburg office specialises in researching the crimes committed by the Soviet regime .
" It 's a huge blow to our organisation , " says Irina Flige , the office director .
" This was 20 years ' work .
We 'd been making a universally accessible database with hundreds of thousands of names .
" Maybe this was a warning to scare us ? "
Irina
Flige believes they were targeted because they are now on the wrong side of a new ideological divide .
New nationalism
The new ideology is " Putinism " which , she says , has evolved over the past two years and is based on a strident form of nationalism .
What we have now [ in Russia ] effectively is the KGB in power
Orlando Figes
British historian
It seems Russians are to be proud of their history , not ashamed , and so those investigating and cataloguing the atrocities of the past are no longer welcome .
" The official line now is that Stalin and the Soviet regime were successful in creating a great country , " says Irina Flige .
" And if the terror of Stalin is justified , then the government today can do what it wants to achieve its aims . "
The outrage at what has happened to the Memorial archive spreads beyond Russia 's borders .
The British historian Orlando Figes worked with Memorial when he was researching his latest book The Whisperers : Private Lives in Stalin 's Russia .
" By conservative estimates 25 million people were repressed in the Soviet Union [ under Stalin ] between 1928 and 1953 , " he says .
" That means people executed , arrested and sent to prison camps or turned into slave labourers or deported .
" Virtually every family was affected by repression . "
" What we have now [ in Russia ] effectively is the KGB in power , " he adds .
" Opposition forces and awkward historians reminding the Russian population of what the KGB did 50 years ago is inconvenient for these people . "
So it seems whoever is voted the country 's greatest citizen on Sunday , it is Joseph Stalin who is the biggest winner this year as he is rehabilitated in Russia 's brave new world .

DETROIT  Automakers said Monday that they were working toward President Obama ’s goal of reducing fuel consumption , but rapid imposition of stricter emissions standards could force them to drastically cut production of larger , more profitable vehicles , adding to their financial duress .
Mr. Obama ordered the government on Monday to reconsider whether California and other states could regulate vehicle emissions to help control greenhouse gas emissions , a reversal of a position taken by the Bush administration .
The announcement came as General Motors and Chrysler are borrowing billions of dollars from the government to avoid bankruptcy , and as Toyota prepares to report its first operating loss in 70 years .
Shortly after the president spoke , General Motors said it would cut 2,000 jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio because of slow sales .
The California regulations , if enacted today , “ would basically kill the industry , ” said David E. Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research , an independent research organization in Ann Arbor , Mich .
“ It would have a devastating effect on everybody , and not just the domestics . ”

Recently laid off ?
Do n't despair .
The job of a lifetime awaits you on a windswept island lost in time .
Or at least lost in the fog .
A Richmond nonprofit is looking for a couple to serve as lighthouse keepers on East Brother Island , a 1 - acre rock in San Pablo Bay .
The winning applicants will keep tabs on the flashing Fresnel light and a pair of foghorns , and will run the inn housed in the 1874 lighthouse , which still has a functioning Coast Guard light .
" We 've loved it out here , " said outgoing lighthouse keeper Elan Stewart , 30 , who 's held the job for the past three years with his wife , Katy , 32 .
" It 's definitely isolated but it 's pretty easy to get to the city , so we get the best of both worlds . "
The Stewarts , their two dogs and their 11 - month - old son plan to move to Tacoma , Wash . , to be closer to family .
" We 'd probably stay forever if we could figure out how to get a pizza delivered , " said Katy .
" But it 's been great .
I love the independence of it .
And the view , of course .
And the neighbors . "
The nearest neighbor is the harbormaster at Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor , a 20 - minute boat ride around the point and into the harbor .
Nonhuman neighbors include seals , sea lions , pelicans , cormorants , seagulls and the occasional lost turkey .
Life has n't changed much on East Brother since the first lighthouse keepers moved in 134 years ago .
The light flashes .
The ships pass .
The fog rolls in , and the horn blasts .
Twice , boats have rammed the island .
Once , Elan rescued a flailing swimmer .
Power comes from a mix of solar panels , propane and an underwater electric cable from the shore .
A tiny septic system handles waste .
Water comes from a 70,000 - gallon cistern that collects rainfall .
Supplies are so scarce that guests - even those paying $ 415 a night - are not allowed showers unless they stay a second night .
Four afternoons a week , guests arrive , enjoy Champagne and a four - course dinner , then spend the night in the picturesque , three - story Victorian lighthouse .
The Stewarts spend most of their time cooking , cleaning and handling the inn's paperwork .
But when the guests are gone , life on East Brother quickly reverts to a timeless tranquility .
With no television reception and limited electrical power , the only sounds are the squawking gulls , waves slapping the rocky shore and the foghorn , which beeps every 20 seconds , 24 hours a day , from Oct. 1 through April 1 .
" You can get there quickly , but once you 're there , you 're in a different world , " said Richmond City Councilman Tom Butt , president of the East Brother Light Station board .
" It 's just the birds , boats , ships and fog .
You just get transported to another era . "
The lighthouse was built by the U.S. Lighthouse Service to guide boats between San Francisco Bay and Mare Island and the delta .
All the original structures are still in use : the lighthouse , a cottage for the innkeepers and a small building that houses the original foghorn , a deafening , low - pitched diaphone powered by an air compressor .
After the U.S. Coast Guard , which absorbed the Lighthouse Service in the 1930s , automated the light and installed a modern foghorn around 1970 , the island had no need for lighthouse keepers .
East Brother sat uninhabited for about a decade , except for periodic visits from carousing teenagers .
In 1980 , a group of preservationists got permission from the Coast Guard , which owns the island , to renovate the lighthouse and take over its maintenance .
The group was led by Oakland mechanical engineer Walter Fanning , whose grandparents had been lighthouse keepers on East Brother decades earlier .
Income from the bed - and - breakfast pays for the island maintenance and supports the lighthouse keepers , who earn between $ 70,000 and $ 100,000 , plus room and board .
The island is now on the state and federal lists of historic places .
Pat Diamond was the first lighthouse keeper after it reopened as a bed - and - breakfast nearly 30 years ago .
" We had some crazy nights out there , " said Diamond , who 's now a mom of twin 9 - year - olds in Los Altos .
" Not much is printable .
I was single and in my 20s , let me put it that way . "
Diamond initially took the job with a boyfriend , " but he went a little haywire " and her next co-keeper was Fanning , who at the time was in his 70s .
They made an odd pair but managed to keep the operation afloat , she said .
Then , as now , there 's not much to do when the guests are gone .
One can watch the birds land on West Brother , a treeless outcropping about 100 yards away , or wave to sailors as they glide by .
Or one can blast the old foghorn .
According to local legend , those who enjoy a romantic interlude on the island sound the foghorn to celebrate .
Otherwise , it 's just the wind , the seagulls , the fog and history .
" It was like nothing I 've experienced before or since , " Diamond said .
" It was hard work running the inn , and it was hard being so isolated , but I felt very lucky to be able to do it .
You really are a part of history . "
A pro-Israel rally in Malmo , Sweden was torn apart Sunday by pro-Palestinian residents who arrived on the scene with eggs , bottles , and tear gas grenades which they threw at Israel 's supporters .
Police dispersed the entire crowd .
Hundreds of people took part in the rally in support of Israel , which was held at the city 's main square .
Elad Meier , a Bnei Akiva and Jewish Agency envoy to Sweden said it was organized by a committee of volunteers from the Jewish community and outside of it .

Protestors carried signs that said ' Stop eight years of Qassams ' and ' Peace for children in Israel and Gaza ' .
The organizers received a police permit for the demonstration .
However , a number of pro-Palestinian protestors who did not have a permit to demonstrate took to the streets in retaliation to the approved rally .
They were not dispersed by police despite lacking a permit .
" At some point , about a half an hour after the protest began , pro-Palestinian protestors began to throw eggs , bottles , and even a tear gas grenade , " Meier recounted .
He added that the lawless protestors disconnected the speakers brought to the square by the Jewish community while its leader was speaking .
The act brought the pro-Israel rally to an end , as others could not speak .
At this point , Meier said , police stepped in and asked the unruly protestors to leave .
Officers then proceeded to clear the square of all present , including those who had received permission to demonstrate .
The pro-Israel protestors were angered by the police 's conduct and lodged an official complaint stating that only those who had protested without a permit should have been dispersed .
Obama will be sworn in as the 44th American president and first African - American president in Washington on Tuesday .
But those who simply cannot wait can already see what the theme park describes as a " pre-enactment " .
