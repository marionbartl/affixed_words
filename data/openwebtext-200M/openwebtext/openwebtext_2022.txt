While various conservative poobahs threaten to move to Idaho if Huckabee or McCain gets the nomination , the silent majority of conservative voters seem to like these candidates .
Huckabee has done very well among evangelical voters while loudly deviating from conservative economic orthodoxy .
John McCain leads among Republicans nationally .
He has a 71 percent favorable rating and a 23 percent unfavorable rating .
He has a 63 percent favorability rating among Huckabee supporters , 66 percent favorability among Romney supporters and 81 percent favorability among supporters of Rudy Giuliani .
These are much higher second choice ratings than any other candidate .
McCain ’s winning coalition in South Carolina was pretty broad .
He lost among the extremely conservative but won among the somewhat conservative and the moderates .
He lost among those who go to church more than once a week , but won among weekly churchgoers .
He won among those who strongly support the Bush administration and among those who are angry at the Bush administration , among those who strongly support the war and among those who strongly oppose it .
He won every income group over $ 30,000 .
Even among people who want to deport every immigrant , McCain only lost to Huckabee by 34 percent to 26 percent .
The fact is , this has been a bad year for the conservative establishment .
Fred Thompson was supposed to embody the party line , but he has fizzled ( despite being a good campaigner the past month ) .
Rudy Giuliani proposes deep tax cuts that do not seem to excite .
Mitt Romney ran as the movement candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and grossly underperformed .
Now he ’s running as a nonideological business pragmatist for the exurban office parks , and his campaign has possibilities .
The lesson is not that the conservative establishment is headed for the ash heap .
The lesson is that the Republican Party , even in its shrunken state , is diverse .
Regular Republican voters do n’t seem to mind independent thinking .
There ’s room for moderates as well as orthodox conservatives .
Limbaugh , Grover Norquist and James Dobson have influence , but they are not arbiters of conservative doctrine .
In his South Carolina victory speech , McCain defined a more inclusive conservatism : “ We want government to do its job , not your job ; to do it better and to do it with less of your money ; to defend our nation ’s security wisely and effectively , because the cost of our defense is so dear to us ; to respect our values because they are the true source of our strength ; to enforce the rule of law that is the first defense of freedom ; to keep the promises it makes to us and not make promises it will not keep . ”
And McCain ’s success has raised an astonishing specter : Republicans may actually have a shot at winning this year .
Our next celebration will be a virtual event on Saturday October 3 and Sunday October 4 , 2020 .
We ’re planning to have live - streamed talks , so if you have an idea for a talk , submit a talk proposal !
A thing that we ’ve loved about past Roguelike Celebrations is hosting activities that are n’t exactly “ talks ” , such as live speedruns , procedurally - generated comedy shows , and interactive live games .
As we move virtual , we ’d love to see even more things like this !
If you ’d like to present any sort of live activity that is n’t necessarily a “ talk ” , the CFP is also the right place for that !

We ’re also working to expand our celebration beyond just live talks and performances .
We do n’t know yet what that will look like , but we ’re thinking about things like commissioning articles for a roguelike zine , running a shop full of community - made swag , or hosting more experimental interactive experiences .

Panic Attack

Kmart has decided not to carry Blu-ray players due to their high prices , instead focusing solely on HD DVD this holiday .
While it may no longer be the bastion of discount stores it once was , Kmart 's move highlights the problems facing Sony 's format as HD DVD continues to get cheaper .
The HD DVD Promotions Group said that Kmart 's decision to go exclusive was n't related to an end - cap purchase ( where vendors can buy specific shelf space and lock out competitors ) , but rather because the cost of Blu-ray players are more tailored to home theater enthusiasts .
HD DVD meanwhile , will have players under $ 200 , with even deeper discounts after Thanksgiving .
As previously reported by BetaNews , both Wal - Mart and Circuit City began offering the Toshiba A2 player for just under $ 200 .
The A2 only offers 1080 i output , but most new televisions can do 1080i - to - 1080 p conversions better than players anyway , and firmware upgrades keep it as up to date as current Toshiba HD DVD players .

Amazon.com has followed suit by also offering the A2 for $ 197 , and other retailers are expected to make the same price drop from the player 's original $ 299 price point .
Best Buy is now selling the A2 for $ 179 .
However , it 's not clear how long A2 stock will last , as it has been replaced by Toshiba 's A3 player .
Buy.com , meanwhile , has an impressive deal on the HD DVD add - on for Microsoft 's Xbox 360 .
Normally retailing for $ 179 , Buy.com is offering a bundle priced at $ 164 which includes Season 1 of Heroes on HD DVD , which normally costs at least $ 70 on its own .
Surprisingly , Sears may have the best deal of the season , although it only lasts for part of the day after Thanksgiving .
Shoppers can pick up the new Toshiba A3 for just $ 169 .
The offer includes 7 free HD DVD movies , with 2 in the box and 5 available through a mail - in offer .
But there 's still quite a bit of uncertainty when it comes to high - definition DVDs , and consumers may be leery about picking a side even with such deals .
In addition , HD DVD and Blu-ray discs are still quite a bit more expensive than standard DVDs at retail , although online stores such as Amazon offer slightly lower prices on movies .
Obama responds to the new smear campaign against him quite deftly .
CNN and the AP should be ashamed of themselves .
I did n't know lapel pins were so important to national security .
Glenn Greenwald explains how easy it was for Obama to handle this nonsense :
Far more notable is Barack Obama 's response to these depressingly familiar attacks .
In response , he 's not scurrying around slapping flags all over himself or belting out the National Anthem , nor is he apologizing for not wearing lapels , nor is he defensively trying to prove that -- just like his Republican accusers -- he , too , is a patriot , honestly .
He 's not on the defensive at all .
Instead , he 's swatting away these slurs with the dismissive contempt they deserve , and then eagerly and aggressively engaging the debate on offense because he 's confident , rather than insecure , about his position
" A party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed , or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning , or are not fulfilling the veterans ' benefits that these troops need when they come home , or are undermining our Constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary ?
" That is a debate I am very happy to have .
We 'll see what the American people think is the true definition of patriotism . "
Jane Hamsher writes :
It 's incredible that a news source which purports to be legitimate would embrace and perpetuate this kind of stuff ; common sense dictates that it should stay where it was birthed , in the right wing sewer .
Nevertheless , we 're in a rather fluid time , when the boundaries are being established about what is going to be regarded as acceptable for the rest of the race , so it 's time to come down hard and set the limits .
Go over and " Send a letter here .
We can't put up with these ridiculous right wing hack attacks by our media against Democratic candidates ...

One of the many contributing factors driving the U.S. economy 's sharp downturn is the anger of foreign consumers boycotting American brands over the Iraq war .
It 's not just many of the 1.5 billion Muslim consumers , either , that have quit buying Made in America .
It 's people from France to Brazil to Canada to India , and it is a trend that began even before Bush invaded Iraq -- remember those angry millions the world over that took to the streets urging him not to start it ?
When foreigners , who once valued American craftsmanship , stop buying U.S. products , it 's got to worsen the balance of trade .
And that can translate into layoffs , into closed factories , into reduced consumer spending .
The Census Bureau is reporting the trade deficit in goods and services was a whopping $ 63 billion in October -- and that 's a factor in the current meltdown .
Last July Reuters reported foreigners still have " a ferocious appetite for American goods and services " and noted U.S. multinationals were posting record earnings .
Those profits might have been better , though , if not for the anti-war mood .
Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute noted as early as Oct. , 2004 , that Pew Global Attitude Project polls showed " the war in Iraq has undermined America 's credibility abroad " and " Anti-American sentiment is spreading around the world . "
A Pew follow - up poll last June , " documented wide anti-American sentiment since the survey was launched in 2002 and found those attitudes deepening this year , " Reuters reported .
" The United States ' favorable ratings declined in 26 of 33 countries for which a comparison was available , with negative views particularly strong in the Middle East . "
Reuters quoted Joseph Quinlan , chief market strategist at Bank of America Corp. saying : " Anti-Americanism has rarely been as prevalent and widespread as in the past five years .
These circumstances have led many , ourselves included , to worry about a possible boycott or backlash against U.S. goods and services . "
That " possible boycott " actually got underway even before the first U.S. bomb fell on Iraq on March 18 , 2003 .
As BBC reported from Thiruvananthapuram , India , earlier that month , social activists planned to boycott in " a last bid to prevent the unjust aggression on millions of innocent people . "
And in Brazil , federal deputy Chico Alencar said if the U.S. made a unilateral attack on Iraq " we will boycott . "
Once Bush invaded , a rash of anti-U.S. product protests broke out that covered the globe :
� Protesters staged a die - in at a display of Coca - Cola products in Anglet , France .
� Ten restaurants in Hamburg , Germany , banned Cokes , Marloboro cigarettes , and American Express cards , USA Today reported .
� Leo Burnett ad agency poll of the Asia - Pacific region found one in four have avoided buying American brands .
� Right after the attack , members of the Indian Parliament " immediately demanded a countrywide boycott of American goods , particularly ubiquitous American brands like Coca - Cola , Pepsi and McDonald's , as well as British - owned Lever soap ... and in several Pakistani cities ... religious groups issued regular boycott calls , " The Nation magazine reported .
� On March 25th , 2003 , Reuters reported " Consumer fury seems to be on the rise .
Demonstrators in Paris smashed windows of a McDonald 's restaurant last week , forcing police in riot gear to move in to protect staff and customers ...
The attackers sprayed obscenities and � boycott ' on the windows . "
� By December , 2004 , Jim Lobe could write on AntiWar .
Com , a survey by Seattle - based Global Market Insite found " brands closely identified with the U.S. , such as Marlboro cigarettes , American Online , McDonald 's , American Airlines , and Exxon - Mobil , are particularly at risk . "
And 20 percent of respondents in Europe and Canada said they consciously avoided buying U.S. products as a protest against those policies .
� And About.com : advertising , a part of The New York Times company , reported , " Fliers are being circulated in places like Egypt , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Tunisia , Morocco and Algeria , all calling for a full ban on anything U.S. - related . "
In Ecuador , a protester burned a Ronald McDonald figurine and in Korea a demonstrator wearing a George Bush mask and armed with a gun climbed McDonald 's golden arches .
At Harvard , international marketing authority John Quelch said , " Never before have global concerns about American foreign policy so threatened to change consumer behavior . "
He added , according to an article in the July 17th , 2003 , British Independent , " We are not speaking here of the frivolous grandstanding associated with temporary boycotts by a student minority .
We are witnessing the emergence of a consumer lifestyle with broad international appeal that is grounded in a rejection of American capitalism , American foreign policy and Brand America . "
When will those in the executive suites recognize that , apart from the firms pigging out at the Pentagon trough , making a stupid war of aggression is bad for the rest of Corporate America , not only for humans ?
The caterpillars of the silkworm moth are the remarkable creatures responsible for making the threads from which man manufactures shiny , beautiful silk cloth .
Today , almost all silk is cultivated on silk farms in Japan , China , and other countries of the Far East , where mulberry trees grow , since it is the leaves of this tree which are fed to the caterpillars .
The large white female silkworm moth lays her eggs ( from 300 to 500 ) on special paper set out by the silk farmer .
These eggs are examined and tested carefully to be certain that the worms inside are not diseased .
Then they are put into an incubator for about 20 days , where the warmth causes them to hatch .
When the tiny silkworm hatches , it is fed every two or three hours , night and day , for four to five weeks , with fresh mulberry leaves .
At the end of that time , the silkworm is fully grown and stops eating .
It is now ready to spin its outer wrapping , a cocoon .
The worm first attaches itself onto a twig or piece of straw the farmer has placed near it .
It does this by giving off a fluid that is manufactured in its glands .
As the fluid hits the air , it hardens into silk threads , which the worm winds around and around the twig or straw .
The threads are held together by a gum , which the worm also gives off .
The worm continues winding its thread , now enclosing its own body inside a cocoon .
After three days , the cocoon is completed .
To prevent the worm ’s changing into a moth and breaking out of the cocoon , thereby bursting its long silk thread , the farmer puts the cocoon into an oven .
The heat kills the worm and permits workers to unwind the long silk threads .
Several are unwound together , and the thicker threads are twisted into bundles , ready to be shipped to a mill for manufacturing into silk cloth .
The secret of silk - making was so closely guarded by the Chinese for 3,000 years that anyone revealing the truth about the silkworm was put to death as a traitor .
Toshiba has developed a new class of micro size Nuclear Reactors that is designed to power individual apartment buildings or city blocks .
The new reactor , which is only 20 feet by 6 feet , could change everything for small remote communities , small businesses or even a group of neighbors who are fed up with the power companies and want more control over their energy needs .
The 200 kilowatt Toshiba designed reactor is engineered to be fail - safe and totally automatic and will not overheat .
Unlike traditional nuclear reactors the new micro reactor uses no control rods to initiate the reaction .
The new revolutionary technology uses reservoirs of liquid lithium - 6 , an isotope that is effective at absorbing neutrons .
The Lithium - 6 reservoirs are connected to a vertical tube that fits into the reactor core .
The whole whole process is self sustaining and can last for up to 40 years , producing electricity for only 5 cents per kilowatt hour , about half the cost of grid energy .
One of the hotly contested campus file - sharing cases involves 17 University of Oregon students , which has seen the Attorney General of Oregon stepping in on the university 's behalf to contest the RIAA 's " unduly burdensome " subpoenas .
As expected , the RIAA opposed the AG 's attempt to quash the subpoenas , and the state has now submitted a reply in support of its motion to quash in which it calls into question the RIAA 's litigation tactics and seeks to conduct discovery of its own into the RIAA 's investigative tactics .
The AG 's motion makes a number of points about the RIAA 's tactics and suggests that some of them may be illegal under Oregon law .
SafeNet , which hunts for copyright infringers on P2P networks is not licensed to conduct investigations in the state of Oregon , as the AG believes is necessary under state law .
Oregon's AG is also suspicious about what kind of information SafeNet and the RIAA may have already gathered on the Does in question .
According to the motion , the RIAA refused to answer interrogatories on whether its investigators had engaged in data mining to obtain " personal and confidential information " on the users , including user names , passwords , search histories , credit card numbers , and e-mail addresses .
The AG wants to be able to engage in discovery to determine " precisely how invasive Plaintiffs ' investigation was . "
The AG also calls the RIAA 's evidence into question , noting that the RIAA 's motion seeking ex parte discovery contains " broad representations to create the impression they had sufficient information to warrant extraordinary relief . "
Those representations include a declaration by the RIAA 's usual expert witness , Carlos Linares , who the AG points out played no role in the current case and has no firsthand information about any copyright infringement that may have occurred .
" Plaintiffs have shown only a potential for illegal file sharing ; they have not shown that any infringing activity took place , " argues the AG .
In its reply to the motion to quash , the RIAA pointed out that the AG 's office had also represented Portland State University in a 2004 file - sharing case , and that the school readily gave the labels the requested information .
The labels argued that Portland State 's compliance three years ago calls into question the University of Oregon 's assertion that the subpoenas put an undue burden on the school .
In response , the AG points out that schools are separate entities that do not coordinate their actions .
The University of Oregon wants to be able to conduct some discovery of its own before any information is released .
" Because Plaintiffs routinely obtain ex parte discovery in their John Doe infringement suits , as they themselves have pointed out , their factual assertions supporting their good cause argument are never challenged by an adverse party and their investigative methods remain free of scrutiny , " argues the AG 's motion .
" Plaintiffs may be spying on students who use the University 's computer system and may be accessing much more than IP addresses . "
The University wants to take depositions from the investigators and ask the RIAA a few questions of its own .
The University 's proposed interrogatories are likely to go over like a lead balloon with the RIAA .
Number two asks the labels to " Describe with particularity the economic damage , if any , that the RIAA suffered as a result of the unlawful conduct of each Doe Defendant . "
Those figures should include the date the damaged occurred , the amount , the entity suffering the damage , and how the damage was caused .
The question of actual damages has been raised in other cases , and , earlier this week , a federal judge in New York ordered the RIAA to divulge its actual per-download expenses .
Yesterday , reports surfaced that EMI was considering cutting its funding to the RIAA and IFPI , and we believe the costs — financial and otherwise — of the ongoing legal campaign against P2P users may be a factor .
Prosecuting the case against these 17 Does is going to get very expensive for the RIAA , especially if the judge approves the University 's motion to conduct discovery of its own .
Wendy Seltzer , former EFF attorney and founder of the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse , gave a talk at Cornell University in September in which she exhorted universities to stand up to " copyright bullies . "
The University of Oregon is doing exactly that , and if other colleges take a similar stance , it 's going to make the RIAA 's legal campaign against college students even more troublesome than it has already proven .
Further reading
From 1972 through 1980 , I was a Department of Commerce , Economic Development Administration employee as an Economic Development Specialist .
In life , we find natural fits and that was mine .
I was really good at it ; and received numerous regional and national accolades for my proficiency .
With that as a basis for my stated opinion I am compelled to comment on this public drive by President Bush and the Democrats to place a band - aid on the American economy .
Understanding the Economic " drivers " of America has led us to fifty years of a few positive experiences and a whole lot of politicized negatives .
The President and Speaker both understand that over 57 % of all voters were neither voters nor spenders in 1988 , when most of the underlying bad policy began to drive down our economic principles and ability to heal ourselves through true supply and demand – free market principles .
The Bush / Pelosi package of tax rebates that is already awash in the political news hour is NOT an economic stimulus package , because it again applies remedies in places that do not stimulate re-growth .
Tax cuts will always be disproportional to the pain index and those that feel the pain the most .
The Reagan theory is that tax cuts stimulus should be " trickle down " driven - and maintain the fairness concept that those that pay , should be rebated .
When in truth , if tax collection was truly fairness driven , that logic might apply , but since tax policy is vastly skewed the logic is false .
One can not credibly use such logic , without fairness across the board .
Yet , Nancy Pelosi and others have already jumped on this bandwagon because they have also allowed the non-sense notion that consumer spending drives the American economy to rule economic policy .
I do n’t want to jump too hard on Ronald Reagan to those that were born after his presidency and have been driven to idolize him .
His economic policy was actually that of David Stockman .
It was called supply - side economics .
The name implied that the policies to realign and accumulate wealth and investment would be realized through inertia within job and economic investment within America .
What actually happened was the newly acquired and concentrated wealth was far more fluid and mobile ; less controllable ; and more greed influenced than idealistically intended .
More investment dollars were exported to develop burgeoning and in some cases , third - World economic investment because you could simply get more bang for the buck , more return on investment in those underdeveloped economies ; with less competition and less risk .
This unbridled and uncontrolled policy , instead created a runaway competition to export industrial capacity to lower labor cost areas , for example .
The patriotic zeal that was envisioned and skillfully communicated as only Reagan could do had been hijacked by personal and corporate zeal .
The negative stigma of investing overseas first , rather than in America first was never checked post - Reagan and still undermines the true American economy .
So when I hear the phrase that America ’s economy has become service based , I recognize this reality as a result of poor economic policy that still has not been reversed .
This is also using economic terms to people who do n’t want to understand economic principles as a cover for bad decision making in the past .
Economic principles are not easily understood because they are not tangible ; yet are as basic and painful as reconciling and balancing the family checkbook .
When I hear the new mantra that this is now a consumer spending based economy , I cringe for numerous reasons .
First , consumers can not spend money they can not earn .
And without jobs that provide more than bare necessities , disposable income does not provide the ability to spend .
No amount of handout changes that truth .
This notion is purely a political and journalistic cover for poor policy of building economies world wide first and America last .
Globalization is the next generation sham principle of that same failed policy .
While we can not isolate from the World and its economy , we can not export our ability to be self - sustaining .
Within all of this foundation of principle , I hope to comment using the inconsistencies of political speak of both parties as headed by both Bush and Pelosi and explain why this notion of tax rebates is a new round of poor economic policy .
Stimulus as a means of Recovery
Stimulating consumer spending as an economic stimulus is pure hogwash .
It has no real effect .
Giving the average American a fifty dollar bill will not change anything .
It , in fact , is an inflationary action and the inflationary impacts will far outstrip the true value of that $ 50 average rebate .
Yet the direct cost would initially be $ 15 billion dollars and indirectly cost nearer seven times that amount .
It does n't alter the continuous rise in costs - true inflation as opposed to inflation as measured by the revised , revised statistics of today .
When we measured inflation in the 1970s , we truly measured inflation .
I 've kept an inflation barometer based upon the formulas we used to measure inflation before Reagan began to gerrymander the numbers for political gain , since he was unable to truly solve the problems of inflation and falling productivity within the US .
The headlines of 1977 were prime interest rates of 17 % and true inflation over 11 % .
By 1981 , the numbers had fallen only slightly .
Using the same formulas , the second quarter of 2007 would have yielded a true inflation rate of 9.3 % ; while the Congress and President only quoted a 2.3 % cost of living rate for social security recipients .
This was not by accident .
In fact , it was a continuation of bad policy ; reflected by gerrymandered numbers with intent to use social security recipients to help balance a staggering budget .
The measures of economic strength / weakness applied by most economists working within the banking industry include the “ net cost ” of money .
Simply stated , this is the prime interest rate less the true inflation rate .
This determines the true worth of investment .
Do the comparisons to determine whether this is a good time to invest and then factor in the housing meltdowns that still have not been fully realized .
Again , we are dealing with several factors of which only the tip of the iceberg is yet seen , on some .

Robert Samuelson says there 's something wrong with the markets that determine pay on Wall Street that causes pay to be too high and encourages excessive risk - taking :
Capitalism 's Enemies Within , by Robert J. Samuelson , Commentary , Washington Post : Amid the mayhem on world financial markets , it is becoming clear that capitalism 's most dangerous enemies are capitalists .
No one can have watched the " subprime mortgage " debacle without noticing the absurd contrast between the magnitude of the failure and the lavish rewards heaped on those who presided over it .
At Merrill Lynch and Citigroup , large losses on subprime securities cost chief executives their jobs -- and they left with multimillion - dollar pay packages .
Stanley O'Neal , the ex-head of Merrill , received an estimated $ 161 million .
Everyday Americans will conclude ( rightly ) that this brand of capitalism is rigged in favor of the privileged few .
...
If you leave your company a shambles -- with losses to be absorbed by lower - level employees , some of whom will be fired , and shareholders -- do you deserve a gold - plated send - off ?
Still , the more serious problem transcends the high pay itself and goes to the wider consequences for the economy .
Wall Street 's pay practices perversely encourage extreme risk - taking that can destabilize the economy .
Subprime mortgage losses may simply be chapter one .
...
If banks and investment houses sustain more losses , the nation 's credit system will be further wounded and so will the economy .
... By " Wall Street , " I mean all the commercial banks , investment banks , mutual funds , hedge funds and the like ... , but particularly investment banks .
Pay is eye - popping .
In 2007 , Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive of Goldman Sachs , received compensation estimated at $ 68 million .
...
Just why investment bankers and traders out - earn , say , doctors or computer engineers is a question I 've never heard convincingly answered .
Are they smarter ?
Unlikely .
Do they contribute more to the economy ?
Questionable .
True , Wall Street often performs a vital function .
...
But Wall Street also frequently misallocates capital and credit .
The " tech bubble " of the late 1990s was one episode .
Now we have subprime mortgages .
Why ?
Well , the herd mentality of financial crazes has a long history .
But compensation practices skewed so heavily toward bonuses based on annual profits make matters worse .
...
To be fair , the real estate bubble had many causes , including low interest rates , the political popularity of homeownership and the ( mistaken ) belief that housing prices could never fall .
This may explain why , so far , the backlash against Wall Street has been muted .
But if the subprime failure turns out to be a preamble to a larger financial breakdown , flowing from the creation of new securities that offered short - term trading possibilities but whose long - run risks were underestimated , then the mood could turn uglier .
Indeed , many Americans may conclude that capitalism has run amok .
When I hear about inequality widening , the ultimatum game experiments where people are willing to do things that do not appear to be in their economic interest in order to punish unfairness sometimes come to mind .
There is some tipping point - I do n't know where it is - but there does come a point where the perception of unfairness causes people to demand change , and they may be willing to do things that appear to be economically irrational in order to bring that change about .
Often , it is the threat of taking action , not the action itself , that promotes changes that reduce inequality .
On a smaller scale , we see this when workers go out on strike and appear willing to pay a far higher cost than any gain they might eventually reap in order to ensure that pay is fair according to their perceptions of what fair means .
And often the threat of a strike is enough to change the outcome of negotiations over who gets what share of the profits , the strike itself is not necessary .
Was the Great Depression such an event , a time where people came to believe that the system did not treat the typical household fairly , and thus demanded change ?
Some of the policies that came out of the Great Depression to alleviate inequality may have been an attempt to stave off more drastic change - it was either give in to the demand for a reduction in inequality within the capitalist system itself or , some feared anyway , face the possibility the capitalist system itself would be fundamentally altered or even replaced .
If we have a hard landing , a true hard landing where significant numbers of people are thrown out of work for a substantial period of time while those who were rewarded in recent years do not face similar hardship , will that trigger change ?
I think it might , though it 's not exactly comfortable to think that something like universal health care has a better chance of being enacted if we have a severe recession that causes people to demand change , any change that benefits the working class , than if times remain relatively good .
But hopefully I 'm wrong about that and we 'll get the needed change in healthcare and other areas without having to suffer through a long , deep , recession first .
Copowi !
Kablooey !
An ISP dons superhero tights
How much would you pay for an Internet connection from an ISP that guarantees a neutral network , bills itself as a " social enterprise " instead of a traditional business , and sends free Ubuntu CDs to every new customer ?
In the US , the battle over network neutrality has captured the public imagination in a way that it has yet to do in Europe or Australia .
Debates over network neutrality occur in the media and in Washington , but new ISP Copowi wants to give customers a way to vote with their dollars as well .
When it opened its doors for business two weeks ago , Copowi billed itself as the country 's first ISP to guarantee network neutrality , and it now hopes to prove to other ISPs that the issue matters enough to consumers to provide a competitive advantage , even if prices are higher ( and they are ) .
Copowi already offers service in 12 Western states , but " absolutely " wants to go national — even international .
Copowi senior partner George Matafonov tells
Ars that he sees no reason why the company could n't eventually expand into Australia , Canada , and the UK .
But for now , with a few hundred subscribers , selling service in Australia looks a long way off .
I spoke to Matafonov ( an Australian himself ) about Copowi 's business model , its challenges , and whether it will really remain neutral if a handful of peer - to - peer users start slurping up most of the available bandwidth .
Your gateway to a neutral ' Net
Copowi's main pitch is a fully neutral network , which it defines as one that provides " equal access to all web sites and online services . "
The idea is that usage will be unrestricted and traffic will not be shaped , throttled , or prioritized .
According to Matafonov , the major telecommunications companies want to " privatize the Internet " because greater control leads to greater profits .
The eventual outcome could become something more like cable television than like the open Internet we know now , and Copowi strongly supports SavetheInternet.com 's campaign to preserve an open ' Net .
George Matafonov
But Copowi does n't own any " last - mile " lines to people 's homes , which means that it needs to lease DSL lines from local telcos out west in order to offer service ( interesting side note : although companies like Verizon and AT&T scoffed at the idea of offering part of the 700MHz band as a " wholesale - only " license , both firms run thriving wholesale businesses of their own already ) .
This puts Copowi at the mercy of the telcos that it leases lines from and means it has only limited control over its network neutrality guarantee .
Matafonov says that Copowi has had no problem in its negotiations yet , though .
The telcos have so far been happy to provide unregulated access if Copowi is willing to pay for the bandwidth .
Because of this , and because telco wholesalers rarely resell lines at competitive prices ( they do n't want to create their own competition ) , Copowi 's service runs toward the pricey side of the broadband spectrum .
Users in Colorado , for example , will have to cough up a staggering $ 33.95 a month for a 256 Kbps DSL connection — expensive by any standard ( except perhaps in Kazakhstan ) .
Copowi's higher - end plans are actually far more competitive when it comes to price .
A 1.5 Mbps connection is still not cheap at $ 49.95 per month , but a 7 M bps link is n't a bad deal at $ 59.95 a month .

Ars Technica
The results are now in from a thorough , $ 1.9 million test of the voting machines that Ohio has used in elections over the past few years , and they paint about as awful a picture of the state 's electoral apparatus as one would expect given the steady stream of grim news out of counties like Cuyahoga .
The two private - sector and three academic research teams that carried out the Evaluation & Validation of Election - Related Equipment , Standards & Testing ( EVEREST ) study of Ohio 's e=voting systems did not mince words in the 86 - page Executive report that they released this past Friday ( or , if words were minced , then one can imagine that the unminced version was n't family - friendly ) :
" The findings of the various scientists engaged by Project EVEREST are disturbing .
These findings do not lend themselves to sustained or increased confidence in Ohio 's voting systems . "
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a woman whose recent and spectacular bungling of a Cuyahoga County recount gives ample reason to doubt her commitment to fair and accurate elections , did n't even bother trying to sugarcoat this report .
" To put it in every - day terms , the tools needed to compromise an accurate vote count could be as simple as tampering with the paper audit trail connector or using a magnet and a personal digital assistant , " Brunner said in a statement .
Note that Brunner here is describing machines that have been in use in Ohio since before the 2004 presidential election .
This is n't some glimpse of how bad things might be in November 2008 .
It 's a look at how bad they 've been all along .
Brunner went on to make the following unintentionally funny remark , which was presumably intended to inject a note of confidence into the release of a report that could almost have been titled , Barn Door Left Open ; Whereabouts of Horse In Doubt : " It 's a testament to our state 's boards of elections officials that elections on the new HAVA mandated voting systems have gone as smoothly as they have in light of these findings . "
E-voting in Ohio has gone " smoothly " ?
Really ?!
Speaking of damage control attempts , however feeble , Premier released this press statement in response to Friday 's report that contains plenty to chuckle at .
I thought this gem was particularly priceless :
" It is important to note that there has not been a single documented case of a successful attack against an electronic voting system , in Ohio or anywhere in the United States . "
Given the magnitude of the vulnerabilities that the report details in Premier 's systems and the impossibility of conducting a meaningful audit with those systems , this is sort of like a blind and deaf person saying , " Despite my habit of cleaning my first - floor apartment in the nude with all of the street - facing windows open , I have no documented evidence that anyone has ever seen me naked . "
Almost 1,000 pages of bad news
The voting systems investigated in the study came from ES&S , Hart Intercivic , and Premier Election Systems ( formerly Diebold ) .
The researchers evaluated individual components , whole systems , and elections procedures , and the list of detailed reports on each vendor 's systems that they produced described technical and procedural problems with almost every aspect of each system .
Like so many of their kind that litter my hard drive after years of e-voting coverage , the EVEREST reports list of page after page of flaws , vulnerabilities , and bone - headed design decisions , many of which would boggle my mind were it not already completely boggled out on this topic by said prior coverage .
Ultimately , the voting systems got failing grades in the following main areas tested , according to the " Findings " section of the executive report :
Insufficient Security :
The voting systems uniformly " failed to adequately address important threats against election data and processes , " including a " failure to adequately defend an election from insiders , to prevent virally infected software ... and to ensure cast votes are appropriately protected and accurately counted . "
Security Technology :
The voting systems allow the " pervasive mis-application of security technology , " including failure to follow " standard and well - known practices for the use of cryptography , key and password management , and security hardware . "
Auditing :
The voting systems exhibit " a visible lack of trustworthy auditing capability , " resulting in difficulty discovering when a security attack occurs or how to isolate or recover from an attack when detected .
Software Maintenance : The voting systems ' software maintenance practices are " deeply flawed , " leading to " fragile software in which exploitable crashes , lockups , and failures are common in normal use . "
The EVEREST executive report 's conclusions summarize the findings as follows :
Unfortunately , the findings in this study indicate that the computer - based voting systems in use in Ohio do not meet computer industry security standards and are susceptible to breaches of security that may jeopardize the integrity of the voting process .
Such safeguards were neither required by federal regulatory authorities , nor voluntarily applied to their systems by voting machine companies , as these products were certified for use in federal and state elections .
In lieu of my typical bullet list of outrageous report highlights — obvious admin passwords , a complete lack of encryption on critical files , a reliance on easily manipulated " security tape " to prevent tampering , the ease with which anyone can boot some of the machines into admin mode , and other typical problems that were there in spades in this report — I 'll just highlight one critical flaw in an optical scan machine of the type that everyone wants to replace the touchscreens with .

It ’s 1965 and you ’re a 26 - year - old white guy .
You have a factory job , or maybe you work for an insurance broker .
Either way , you ’re married , probably have been for a few years now ; you met your wife in high school , where she was in your sister ’s class .
You ’ve already got one kid , with another on the way .
For now , you ’re renting an apartment in your parents ’ two - family house , but you ’re saving up for a three - bedroom ranch house in the next town .
Yup , you ’re an adult !
Now meet the twenty - first - century you , also 26 .
You ’ve finished college and work in a cubicle in a large Chicago financial - services firm .
You live in an apartment with a few single guy friends .
In your spare time , you play basketball with your buddies , download the latest indie songs from iTunes , have some fun with the Xbox 360 , take a leisurely shower , massage some product into your hair and face — and then it ’s off to bars and parties , where you meet , and often bed , girls of widely varied hues and sizes .
They come from everywhere : California , Tokyo , Alaska , Australia .
Wife ?
Kids ?
House ?
Are you kidding ?
Not so long ago , the average mid-twentysomething had achieved most of adulthood ’s milestones — high school degree , financial independence , marriage , and children .
These days , he lingers — happily — in a new hybrid state of semi-hormonal adolescence and responsible self - reliance .
Decades in unfolding , this limbo may not seem like news to many , but in fact it is to the early twenty - first century what adolescence was to the early twentieth : a momentous sociological development of profound economic and cultural import .
Some call this new period “ emerging adulthood , ” others “ extended adolescence ” ; David Brooks recently took a stab with the “ Odyssey Years , ” a “ decade of wandering . ”
But while we grapple with the name , it ’s time to state what is now obvious to legions of frustrated young women : the limbo does n’t bring out the best in young men .
With women , you could argue that adulthood is in fact emergent .
Single women in their twenties and early thirties are joining an international New Girl Order , hyperachieving in both school and an increasingly female - friendly workplace , while packing leisure hours with shopping , traveling , and dining with friends [ see “ The New Girl Order , ” Autumn 2007 ] .
Single Young Males , or SYMs , by contrast , often seem to hang out in a playground of drinking , hooking up , playing Halo 3 , and , in many cases , underachieving .
With them , adulthood looks as though it ’s receding .
Freud famously asked : “ What do women want ? ” Notice that he did n’t ask what men wanted — perhaps he thought that he ’d figured that one out .
But that ’s a question that ad people , media execs , and cultural entrepreneurs have pondered a lot in recent years .
They ’re particularly interested in single young men , for two reasons : there are a lot more of them than before ; and they tend to have some extra change .
Consider : in 1970 , 69 percent of 25 - year - old and 85 percent of 30 - year - old white men were married ; in 2000 , only 33 percent and 58 percent were , respectively .
And the percentage of young guys tying the knot is declining as you read this .
Census Bureau data show that the median age of marriage among men rose from 26.8 in 2000 to 27.5 in 2006 — a dramatic demographic shift for such a short time period .
That adds up to tens of millions more young men blissfully free of mortgages , wives , and child - care bills .
Historically , marketers have found this group an “ elusive audience ” — the phrase is permanently affixed to “ men between 18 and 34 ” in adspeak — largely immune to the pleasures of magazines and television , as well as to shopping expeditions for the products advertised there .
But by the mid-1990s , as SYM ranks swelled , marketers began to get their number .
One signal moment came in April 1997 , when Maxim , a popular British “ lad magazine , ” hit American shores .
Maxim strove to be the anti-Playboy - and - Esquire ; bad - boy owner Felix Dennis sniffed at celebrity publishers with their tired formulas .
Instead , he later observed , the magazine ’s creators adopted the “ astonishing methodology of asking our readers what they wanted . . . and then supplying it . ”
And what did those readers — male , unmarried , median age 26 , median household income $ 60,000 or so — want ?
As the philosophers would say , duh .
Maxim plastered covers and features with pouty - lipped , tousled - haired pinups in lacy underwear and , in case that did n’t do the trick , block - lettered promises of sex !
lust !
naughty !
And it worked .
More than any men ’s magazine before or since , Maxim grabbed that elusive 18 - to 34 - year - old single - college - educated - guy market , and soon boasted about 2.5 million readers — more than GQ , Esquire , and Men ’s Journal combined .
Victoria ’s Secret cover art does n’t fully explain the SYM ’s attraction to Maxim .
After all , plenty of down - market venues had the sort of bodacious covers bound to trigger the young male ’s reptilian brain .
No , what set Maxim apart from other men ’s mags was its voice .
It was the sound of guys hanging around the Animal House living room — where put - downs are high - fived ; gadgets are cool ; rock stars , sports heroes , and cyborg battles are awesome ; jobs and Joni Mitchell suck ; and babes are simply hot — or not .
“ Are there any cool jobs related to beer ? ” a reader ’s letter asks in a recent issue .
Answer : brand manager , beer tester , and brewmaster .
Maxim asked the SYM what he wanted and learned that he did n’t want to grow up .
Whatever else you might say about Playboy or Esquire , they tried to project the image of a cultured and au courant fellow ; as Hefner famously — and from today ’s cultural vantage point , risibly — wrote in an early Playboy , his ideal reader enjoyed “ inviting a female acquaintance in for a quiet discussion of Picasso , Nietzsche , jazz , sex . ”
Hearing this , the Maxim dude would want to hurl .
He ’d like to forget that he ever went to school .
Maxim happily obliges .
The editors try to keep readers ’ minds from wandering with articles like “ Confessions of a Strip Club Bouncer . ”
But they rely heavily on picture - laden features promoting the latest skateboards , video games , camcorders , and other tech products , along with an occasional Q - and - A with , say , Kid Rock — all with the bare minimum of print required to distinguish a magazine from a shopping catalog or pinup calendar .
Playboy ’s philosophy may not have been Aristotle , but it was an attempt , of sorts , to define the good life .
The Maxim reader prefers lists , which make up in brevity what they lose in thought : “ Ten Greatest Video Game Heroes of All Time , ” “ The Five Unsexiest Women Alive , ” “ Sixteen People Who Look Like They Absolutely Reek , ” and so on .
Still , Maxim is far from dumb , as its self - mockery proves .
The Maxim child - man prides himself on his lack of pretense , his unapologetic guyness .
The magazine ’s subtext seems to be : “ We ’re just a bunch of horny , insensitive guys — so what ? ”
What else to make of an article entitled “ How to Make Your Girlfriend Think Her Cat ’s Death Was an Accident ” ?
“ The only thing worse than a show about doctors is a show about sappy chick doctors we ’re forced to watch or else our girlfriends wo n’t have sex with us , ” the editors grumble about the popular ( with women ) Grey ’s Anatomy .
The Maxim child - man voice has gone mainstream , which may explain why the magazine ’s sales were flat enough for Dennis to sell it last summer .
You ’re that 26 - year - old who wants sophomoric fun and macho action ?
Now the culture has a groaning table of entertainment with your name on it .
Start with the many movies available in every guy - friendly genre : sci-fi flicks like Transformers , action and crime movies like American Gangster , comedies like Superbad , and the seemingly endless line of films starring Adam Sandler , Jim Carrey , and the “ Frat Pack , ” as USA Today dubbed the group of young male comedians that includes Will Ferrell , Ben Stiller , Vince Vaughn , Owen and Luke Wilson , Jack Black , and Steve Carell .
With a talent for crude physical comedy , gleeful juvenility , and self - humiliation , the Frat Packers are the child - man counterparts to the more conventional leads , like George Clooney and Brad Pitt , whom women and Esquire editors love .
In Old School ( 2003 ) , three guys in their thirties decide to start a college fraternity .
Frank the Tank ( the moniker refers to his capacity for alcohol ) , played by Ferrell , flashes his saggy white derriere streaking through the college town ; the scene is a child - man classic .
In 2005 ’s The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , Carell plays a middle - aged nerd with a large action - figure collection but no action .
In one guy - favorite scene , a beautician painfully waxes Carell ’s hirsute chest ; as Carell pointed out later , this was a “ guy thing , this sadistic nature that men have to see other men in non-life - threatening pain . ”
Even though the networks must be more restrained , television also has plenty of “ stupid fun ” ( as Maxim calls a regular feature ) , gross - out humor , and even low - level sadism for child - man viewers .
This state of affairs is newer than you might think .
Apart from sports programming and The Simpsons , which came along in the early 1990s , there was n’t a lot to make young men pick up the remote .
Most prime - time television appealed to women and families , whose sensibilities were as alien to dudes as finger bowls .
Today , the child - man can find entire networks devoted to his interests : Spike TV runs wrestling matches , Star Trek reruns , and the high - tech detective drama CSI ; Blackbelt TV broadcasts martial arts around the clock ; sci-fi is everywhere .
Several years ago , the Cartoon Network spied the potential in the child - man market , too , and introduced Adult Swim , late - night programming with “ adult ” cartoons like Family Guy and Futurama , a cult favorite co-created by Matt Groening of The Simpsons fame .
Adult Swim has cut into the male Letterman and Leno audience , luring gold - plated advertisers Saab , Apple , and Taco Bell ; child - men , it should come as no surprise , eat lots of fast food .
One can also lay the success of cable giant Comedy Central at the child - man ’s sneakered foot .
In its early - nineties infancy , Comedy Central had old movie comedies , some stand - up acts , and few viewers .
The next several years brought some buzz with shows like Politically Incorrect .
But it was in 1997 — the same year that Maxim arrived in America — that the network struck gold with a cartoon series starring a group of foul - mouthed eight - year - old boys .
With its cutting subversion of all that ’s sacred and polite , South Park was like a dog whistle that only SYMs could hear ; the show became the highest - rated cable series in that age group .
In 1999 , the network followed up with The Man Show , famous for its “ Juggies ” ( half - naked women with exceptionally large , well , juggies ) , interviews with porn stars , drinking songs , and a jingle that advised , “ Quit your job and light a fart / Yank your favorite private part . ”
It was “ like Maxim for TV , ” one network executive told Media Life .
Comedy Central ’s viewers , almost two - thirds of them male , have made both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report cultural touchstones and launched the careers of stars like Bill Maher , Jimmy Kimmel , Dave Chapelle , and , most notably , Daily Show anchor Jon Stewart — who has already hosted the Academy Awards and is set to do so again , a perfect symbol of the mainstreaming of the SYM sensibility .
Nothing attests more to the SYM ’s growing economic and cultural might than video games do .
Once upon a time , video games were for little boys and girls — well , mostly little boys — who loved their Nintendos so much , the lament went , that they no longer played ball outside .
Those boys have grown up to become child - man gamers , turning a niche industry into a $ 12 billion powerhouse .
Men between the ages of 18 and 34 are now the biggest gamers ; according to Nielsen Media , almost half — 48.2 percent — of American males in that age bracket had used a console during the last quarter of 2006 , and did so , on average , two hours and 43 minutes per day .
( That ’s 13 minutes longer than 12 - to 17 - year - olds , who evidently have more responsibilities than today ’s twentysomethings . )
Gaming — online games , as well as news and information about games — often registers as the top category in monthly surveys of Internet usage .
And the child - man ’s home sweet media home is the Internet , where no meddling censors or nervous advertisers deflect his desires .
Some sites , like MensNewsDaily.com , are edgy news providers .
Others , like AskMen.com , which claims 5 million visitors a month , post articles like “ How to Score a Green Chick ” in the best spirit of Maxim - style self - parody .
“ How is an SUV - driving , to - go - cup- using , walking environmental catastrophe like yourself supposed to hook up with them ? ” the article asks .
Answer :
Go to environmental meetings , yoga , or progressive bookstores ( “ but watch out for lesbians ” ) .
Other sites , like MenAreBetterThanWomen.com , TuckerMax.com , TheBestPageInTheUniverse.com , and DrunkasaurusRex.com , walk Maxim ’s goofiness and good - natured woman - teasing over the line into nastiness .
The men hanging out on these sites take pride in being “ badasses ” and view the other half bitterly .
A misogynist is a “ man who hates women as much as women hate each other , ” writes one poster at MenAreBetterThanWomen .
Another rails about “ classic woman ‘ trap ’ questions —
Does this make me look fat ?
Which one of my friends would you sleep with if you had to ?
Do you really enjoy strip clubs ? ”
The Fifth Amendment was created because its architects ’ wives “ drove them ape - shit asking questions that they ’d be better off simply refusing to answer . ”
That sound you hear is women not laughing .
Oh , some women get a kick out of child - men and their frat / fart jokes ; about 20 percent of Maxim readers are female , for instance , and presumably not all are doing research for the dating scene .
But for many of the fairer sex , the child - man is either an irritating mystery or a source of heartbreak .
In Internet chat rooms , in advice columns , at female water - cooler confabs , and in the pages of chick lit , the words “ immature ” and “ men ” seem united in perpetuity .
Women complain about the “ Peter Pan syndrome ” — the phrase has been around since the early 1980s but it is resurgent — the “ Mr. Not Readys , ” and the “ Mr. Maybes . ”
Sex and the City chronicled the frustrations of four thirtysomething women with immature , loutish , and uncommitted men for six popular seasons .
Naturally , women wonder :
How did this perverse creature come to be ?
The most prevalent theory comes from feminist - influenced academics and cultural critics , who view dude media as symptoms of backlash , a masculinity crisis .
Men feel threatened by female empowerment , these thinkers argue , and in their anxiety , they cling to outdated roles .
The hyper - masculinity of Maxim et al. does n’t reflect any genuine male proclivities ; rather , retrograde media “ construct ” it .
The fact that guys cheer on female heroines like Buffy the Vampire Slayer as much as they do Chuck Norris tells against this theory somewhat .
But there ’s an ounce of truth to it .
The men of the new media are in backlash mode , largely because they believe that feminists have stood in their way as media gatekeepers — that is , agents , editors , producers , and the like — who do n’t understand or accept “ men acting like men . ”
They gleefully stick their thumbs in the eyes of politically correct tsk - tskers .
In one South Park episode , the Sexual Harassment Panda , a mascot who teaches schoolkids the evils of sexual harassment , is fired after his little talks provoke a flood of inane lawsuits .
In Maxim , readers can find articles like “ How to Cure a Feminist , ” one of whose recommendations is to “ pretend you share her beliefs ” by asking questions like , “ Has Gloria Steinem ’s marriage hurt the feminist agenda ? ”
Insofar as the new guy media reflect a backlash against feminism , they ’re part of the much larger story of men ’s long , uneasy relationship with bourgeois order .
The SYM with a taste for Maxim or South Park may not like Gloria Steinem , but neither does he care for anyone who tells him to behave — teachers , nutritionists , prohibitionists , vegetarians , librarians , church ladies , counselors , and moralists of all stripes .
In fact , men have always sought out an antisocial , even anarchic , edge in their popular culture .
In a renowned essay , the critic Barbara Ehrenreich argued that the arrival of Playboy in 1953 represented the beginning of a male rebellion against the conformity of mid-century family life and of middle - class virtues like duty and self - discipline .
“ All woman wants is security , ” she quotes an early Playboy article complaining .
“ And she is perfectly willing to crush man ’s adventurous freedom - loving spirit to get it . ”
Even the name of the magazine , Ehrenreich observed , “ defied the convention of hard - won maturity . ”
Ehrenreich was right about the seditious impulse behind Playboy , but wrong about its novelty .
Male resistance to bourgeois domesticity had been going on since the bourgeoisie went domestic .
In A Man ’s Place , historian John Tosh locates the rebellion ’s roots in the early nineteenth century , when middle - class expectations for men began to shift away from the patriarchal aloofness of the bad old days .
Under the newer bourgeois regime , the home was to be a haven in a heartless world , in which affection and intimacy were guiding virtues .
But in Tosh ’s telling , it did n’t take long before men vented frustrations with bourgeois domestication : they went looking for excitement and male camaraderie in empire building , in adventure novels by authors like Robert Louis Stevenson , and in going to “ the club . ”
By the early twentieth century , the emerging mass market in the U.S. offered new outlets for the virile urges that sat awkwardly in the bourgeois parlor ; hence titles like Field and Stream and Man ’s Adventure , as well as steamier fare like Escapade and Caper .
When television sets came on the market in the late 1940s , it was the airing of heavyweight fights and football games that led Dad to make the big purchase ; to this day , sports events — the battlefield made civilized — glue him to the Barcalounger when he should be folding the laundry .
But this history suggests an uncomfortable fact about the new SYM : he ’s immature because he can be .
We can argue endlessly about whether “ masculinity ” is natural or constructed — whether men are innately promiscuous , restless , and slobby , or socialized to be that way — but there ’s no denying the lesson of today ’s media marketplace : give young men a choice between serious drama on the one hand , and Victoria ’s Secret models , battling cyborgs , exploding toilets , and the NFL on the other , and it ’s the models , cyborgs , toilets , and football by a mile .
For whatever reason , adolescence appears to be the young man ’s default state , proving what anthropologists have discovered in cultures everywhere : it is marriage and children that turn boys into men .
Now that the SYM can put off family into the hazily distant future , he can — and will — try to stay a child - man .
Yesterday ’s paterfamilias or Levittown dad may have sought to escape the duties of manhood through fantasies of adventures at sea , pinups , or sublimated war on the football field , but there was considerable social pressure for him to be a mensch .
Not only is no one asking that today ’s twenty - or thirtysomething become a responsible husband and father — that is , grow up — but a freewheeling marketplace gives him everything that he needs to settle down in pig ’s heaven indefinitely .
And that heaven can get pretty piggish .
Take Tucker Max , whose eponymous website is a great favorite among his peers .
In a previous age , Max would have been what was known as a “ catch . ” Good - looking , ambitious , he graduated from the University of Chicago and Duke Law .
But in a universe where child - men can thrive , he has found it more to his liking — and remarkably easy — to pursue a different career path : professional “ asshole . ”
Max writes what he claims are “ true stories about my nights out acting like an average twentysomething ” — binge drinking ( UrbanDictionary.com lists Tucker Max Drunk , or TMD , as a synonym for “ falling down drunk ” ) , fighting , leaving vomit and fecal detritus for others to clean up , and , above all , hooking up with “ random ” girls galore — sorority sisters , Vegas waitresses , Dallas lap dancers , and Junior Leaguers who ’re into erotic asphyxiation .
Throughout his adventures , Max — like a toddler stuck somewhere around the oedipal stage — remains fixated on his penis and his “ dumps . ”
He is utterly without conscience — “ Female insecurity : it ’s the gift that keeps on giving , ” he writes about his efforts to undermine his prey ’s self - esteem in order to seduce them more easily .
Think of Max as the final spawn of an aging and chromosomally challenged Hugh Hefner , and his website and best - selling book , I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell , as evidence of a male culture in profound decline .
Playboy ’s aspirations toward refinement still hinted at the call of the ego and a culture with limits on male restiveness ;
Max , the child - man who answers to no one except his fellow “ assholes , ” is all id — and proud of it .
Now , you could argue that the motley crew of Maxim , Comedy Central , Halo 3 , and even the noxious Tucker Max are n’t much to worry about , and that extended adolescence is what the word implies : a temporary stage .
Most guys have lots of other things going on , and even those who spend too much time on TuckerMax.com will eventually settle down .
Men know the difference between entertainment and real life .
At any rate , like gravity , growing up happens ; nature has rules .
That ’s certainly a hope driving the sharpest of recent child - man entertainments , Judd Apatow ’s hit movie Knocked Up .
What sets Knocked Up apart from , say , Old School , is that it invites the audience to enjoy the SYM ’s immaturity — his T - and - A obsessions , his slobby indolence — even while insisting on its feebleness .
The potheaded 23 - year - old Ben Stone accidentally impregnates Alison , a gorgeous stranger he was lucky enough to score at a bar .
He is clueless about what to do when she decides to have the baby , not because he ’s a “ badass ” — actually , he has a big heart — but because he dwells among social retards .
His roommates spend their time squabbling about who farted on whose pillow and when to launch their porn website .
His father is useless , too : “ I ’ve been divorced three times , ” he tells Ben when his son asks for advice about his predicament .
“ Why are you asking me ? ”
In the end , though , Ben understands that he needs to grow up .
He gets a job and an apartment , and learns to love Alison and the baby .
This is a comedy , after all .
It is also a fairy tale for guys .
You would n’t know how to become an adult even if you wanted to ?
Maybe a beautiful princess will come along and show you .
But the important question that Apatow ’s comedy deals with only obliquely is what extended living as a child - man does to a guy — and to the women he collides with along the way .
For the problem with child - men is that they ’re not very promising husbands and fathers .
They suffer from a proverbial “ fear of commitment , ” another way of saying that they ca n’t stand to think of themselves as permanently attached to one woman .
Sure , they have girlfriends ; many are even willing to move in with them .
But cohabiting can be just another Peter Pan delaying tactic .
Women tend to see cohabiting as a potential path to marriage ; men view it as another place to hang out or , as Barbara Dafoe Whitehead observes in Why There Are No Good Men Left , a way to “ get the benefits of a wife without shouldering the reciprocal obligations of a husband . ”
Even men who do marry do n’t easily overcome child - manhood .
Neal Pollack speaks for some of them in his 2007 memoir Alternadad .
Pollack struggles with how to stay “ hip ” — smoking pot and going to rock concerts — once he becomes a father to Elijah , “ the new roommate , ” as he calls him .
Pollack makes peace with fatherhood because he finds that he can introduce his toddler to the best alternative bands , and also because he has so many opportunities to exercise the child - man ’s fascination with “ poop . ”
He is affectingly mad for his little boy .
Yet his efforts to turn his son into a hip little Neal Pollack —
“ My son and I were moshing !
Awesome ! ” — reflect the self - involvement of the child - man who resists others ’ claims on him .
Knocked
Up evokes a more destructive self - involvement in a subplot involving Alison ’s miserably married sister Debbie and her husband , Pete , the father of her two little girls .
Pete , who frequently disappears to play fantasy baseball , get high in Las Vegas , or just go to the movies on his own , chronically wields irony to distance himself from his family .
“ Care more ! ” his wife yells at him .
“ You ’re cool because you do n’t give a shit . ”
And that “ coolness ” points to what may be the deepest existential problem with the child - man — a tendency to avoid not just marriage but any deep attachments .
This is British writer Nick Hornby ’s central insight in his novel About a Boy .
The book ’s antihero , Will , is an SYM whose life is as empty of passion as of responsibility .
He has no self apart from pop-culture effluvia , a fact that the author symbolizes by having the jobless 36 - year - old live off the residuals of a popular Christmas song written by his late father .
Hornby shows how the media - saturated limbo of contemporary guyhood makes it easy to fill your days without actually doing anything .
“ Sixty years ago , all the things Will relied on to get him through the day simply did n’t exist , ” Hornby writes .
“ There was no daytime TV , there were no videos , there were no glossy magazines .
. . .
Now , though , it was easy [ to do nothing ] .
There was almost too much to do . ”
Will ’s unemployment is part of a more general passionlessness .
To pick up women , for instance , he pretends to have a son and joins a single - parent organization ; the plight of the single mothers means nothing to him .
For Will , women are simply fleshy devices that dispense sex , and sex is just another form of entertainment , a “ fantastic carnal alternative to drink , drugs , and a great night out , but nothing much more than that . ”
As the title of his 2005 novel Indecision suggests , Benjamin Kunkel also shows how apathy infects the new SYM world .
His hero , 28 - year - old Dwight Wilmerding , suffers from “ abulia ” — chronic indecisiveness — so severe that he finds himself paralyzed by the Thanksgiving choices of turkey , cranberry sauce , and dressing .
His parents are divorced , his most recent girlfriend has faded away , and he has lost his job .
Like Will , Dwight is a quintessential slacker , unable to commit and unwilling to feel .
The only woman he has loved is his sister , who explains the attraction : “ I ’m the one girl you actually got to know in the right way .
It was gradual , it was inevitable . ”
Like Hornby , Kunkel sees the easy availability of sex as a source of slacker apathy .
In a world of serial relationships , SYMs “ fail to sublimate their libidinal energies in the way that actually makes men attractive , ” Kunkel told a dismayed female interviewer in Salon .
With no one to challenge them to deeper connections , they swim across life ’s surfaces .
The superficiality , indolence , and passionlessness evoked in Hornby ’s and Kunkel ’s novels have n’t triggered any kind of cultural transformation .
Kunkel ’s book briefly made a few regional bestseller lists , and Hornby sells well enough .
But sales of “ lad lit , ” as some call books with SYM heroes , ca n’t hold a candle to those of its chick - lit counterpart .
The SYM does n’t read much , remember , and he certainly does n’t read anything prescribing personal transformation .
The child - man may be into self - mockery ; self - reflection is something else entirely .
That ’s too bad .
Men are “ more unfinished as people , ” Kunkel has neatly observed .
Young men especially need a culture that can help them define worthy aspirations .
Adults do n’t emerge .
They ’re made .
Canada has joined Russia and China as the biggest violators of U.S. copyright law , according to the U.S. - based International Intellectual Property Alliance .
In a report filed to U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab on Monday , the group recommended that Canada join the other two countries on the USTR's Priority Watch List .
Countries on this list are subject to accelerated investigations and possible trade sanctions .
The IIPA said Canada is the only country in the 30 - member Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that has yet to modernize its copyright law or meet the minimum global standards set out in the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty signed in 1996 .
" Canada has taken no meaningful steps toward modernizing its copyright law to meet the minimum global standards of the WIPO internet treaties , which it signed more than a decade ago , " the report said .
" In 2007 , parliamentary leadership and the government , at its highest levels , acknowledged many of these deficiencies and the government listed copyright reform among its top legislative priorities .
But these encouraging statements have not yet evolved into anything more concrete . "
Other countries named
The group also recommended that 10 other countries be placed on the Priority Watch List , including Argentina , Chile , Costa Rica , Egypt , India , Mexico , Peru , Saudi Arabia , Thailand and Ukraine .
It also recommended that 29 other countries , including Spain , Sweden and Israel , be placed or maintained on the less critical Watch List .
A total of 51 countries were named as significant violators .
Schwab 's office will release its annual watch lists at the end of April .
Canadian copyright experts said the IIPA 's recommendations should be taken with a grain of salt , since the organization has singled out a good number of countries that have trade dealings with the United States .
" It 's little more than a lobbying exercise which lacks reliable and objective analysis , " said University of Ottawa internet law professor Michael Geist .
" With 51 countries , some of which are leaders in Europe and Asia , Canada is in very good company .
It almost begs the question — who 's the one that 's really offside here ? "
The IIPA , which says it represents the copyright interests of 1,900 U.S. companies , estimated the United States lost more than $ 18 billion U.S. in trade through copyright piracy in 2007 , up 20 per cent from $ 15 billion a year earlier .
According to the group , Canada contributed about $ 511 million of that loss — up from $ 494 million in 2006 — while China led the pack with a $ 2.9 - billion contribution , up from $ 2.4 billion .
The group 's report is the latest to urge the U.S. government into pressuring Ottawa to reform copyright laws .
U.S. ambassador to Canada David Wilkins has repeatedly said Canada 's laws are the most lax among G7 nations , while the recording industries on both sides of the border have called for tougher rules .
Minister of Industry Jim Prentice was to introduce a draft bill in December but backed off because of widespread public opposition .
Geist , who has led the opposition against a U.S. - style bill , said the legislation may be introduced as early as this week .
Given the government 's other priorities , including the upcoming budget and debate over Canada 's military involvement in Afghanistan , he said it 's unlikely much time has been spent on revising the bill .
" It 's more likely they 've revised their communications strategy on how to sell it , " he said .
Teachers , musicians , artists , telecommunications companies , retailers , privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart , as well as more than 40,000 members of a Facebook group devoted to the issue have voiced their opposition to what they say was the overly restrictive , U.S. - style legislation that Prentice was expected to table .
There 's a very influential platform called the AVM , which stands for Algorithmic Virtual Machine .
That 's the imaginary device people use as their mental model of a computer .
In particular , it 's used by many people working on algorithms where performance matters .
Performance matters in many different contexts , ranging from huge clusters processing astronomic amounts of data to modest applications running on pathetically weak hardware .
However , I believe that the core architecture of the AVM is basically the same everywhere .
AVM application development is done using the ubiquitous AVM SDK – a whiteboard and a couple of hands for handwaving .
An AVM application consists of a set of operations your algorithm needs executed .
Each operation has a cost ( typically one cycle , sometimes more ) .
You can then estimate the run time of your algorithm by the clever technique of summing the cost of all operations .
These estimations are never close enough to the real run time .
The definition of " close enough " varies ; the quality of estimations , by and large , does n't .
That is , I claim that your handwavy AVM - derived estimation will fail to meet your precision requirements no matter what those requirements are .
Apparently our tolerance for errors grows with the lack of understanding of the problem , but it never grows enough .
But I 'm not really sure about this theory ; I 'm only sure about AVM - estimations - suck part .
Here 's why .
The AVM is basically this imaginary machine that runs " operations " .
Here are some things that real machines must do , but the AVM does n't :
Fetching instructions
Fetching operands
Testing for conditions
Storing results
Basically , the Algorithmic Virtual Machine developers concentrate on " operations " and ignore addressing , branches , caches , buses , registers , pipelines , and all those other gadgets which are needed in order to dispatch the operation .
In fact , that 's how I currently distinguish between people who write software to get a job done and people who think of software as their job .
" People who program " are into operations ( algebra , networking , AI ) ; " programmers " are into dispatching ( programming languages , operating systems , OO ) .
This is about mental focus rather than aptitude .
I have n't noticed that people of either group are inherently less productive than the other kind .
When they 're after performance , the " operations " people will naturally look for a way to reduce the number of operations .
Sometimes , they 'll find an algorithm with a better asymptotic complexity – O ( N+M ) instead of O ( N * M ) .
At other times , they 'll come up with a way to perform 4 * N *M operations instead of 16 * N *M .
Both results are very significant – if M and N are the only variables .
The trouble is that you can't see all the variables if you just look at the math ( as in " we want to multiply and sum all these and then compare to that " ) .
That way , you assume that you run on the AVM and leave out all the dispatching - related variables and get the wrong answer .
Is there a way to take the cost of dispatching into account ?
Not really , not without implementing your algorithm and measuring its performance .
However , families of machines do have related sets of heuristics that can be used to guess the cost of running on them .
For example , here are a couple of heuristics that I use for SIMD machines ( they are relevant elsewhere , but their relative importance may drop ) :
Bandwidth is costly .
Addressing is costly .
These heuristics are vague , and I do n't see a very good way to make them formal .
Perhaps there is n't any .
To show that my points have any formal significance , I 'd have to formally prove that there 's unavoidable intrinsic cost to some things no matter how you build your hardware .
And I do n't know how to go about that .
So what I 'll do is I 'll give some examples to show what I mean , and leave it there .
Bandwidth
Consider two " algorithms " ( probably too fancy a name in this context ) : computing dot product , and computing its partial sums ( Matlab : sum ( a .* b ) and cumsum ( a .* b ) ) .
Exactly the same amount of " operations " – N multiplications and N additions .
Many people with BA , MSc and PhD degrees in CS assume that the run time is going to be the same , too .
It wo n't , because sum only produces one output , and cumsum produces N outputs .
Worse , if the input vector elements are 8 - bit integers , we probably need at least 32 bits for each output element .
So we generate N * 4 bytes of output from N * 2 input bytes .
At this point , some people will say " Yeah , memory .
Processors are fast , memories are slow , sure , memory is a problem " .
But it is n't just about the memory ; memory bandwidth is just one kind of bandwidth .
Let 's look at the non-memory problems of the partial - sums - of - dot - product algorithm .
On the way , I 'll try to show how the " bandwidth costs " heuristic can be used to guess what your hardware can do and what the performance will be .
Consider a machine with a SIMD instruction set .
Most likely , the machine has registers of fixed width ( say , 16 bytes ) , and each instruction gets 2 inputs and produces 1 output .
Why ?
Well , the hardware ought to support 2 inputs and 1 output to do basic math .
Now , if it also wants to have an instruction that produces , say , 4 outputs , then it needs to have 3 additional output buses from the data processing units to the register file .
It also needs a multiplexer so that each of the 4 outputs can be routed to each of its N registers ( N can be 16 or 32 or even 128 ) .
The cost of multiplexers is , roughly , O ( M * N ) , where M is the number of inputs and N is the number of outputs .
That 's awfully costly .
Bandwidth costs .
So they probably use 2 inputs and 1 output everywhere .
Now , suppose the machine has 16 multipliers , which is quite likely – 1 multiplier for each register byte , so we can multiply 16 pairs of bytes simultaneously .
Does this mean that we can then take those 16 products and compute 16 new partial sums , all in the same cycle ?
Nope , because , among other things , we 'd need a command producing 16×4 bytes to do that , and that 's too much bandwidth .
Are we likely to have a command that updates less than 16 accumulators ?
Yes , because that would speed up dot products , and dot products are very important ; let 's look at the manual .
You 're likely to find a command updating – guess how many ?
– 4 accumulators ( 32 bits times 4 equals 16 bytes , that 's exactly one machine register ) .
If the register size is 8 bytes , you 'll probably get a command updating 2 accumulators , and so on .
Sometimes the machine uses " register pairs " for output ; that doubles the register size for output bandwidth calculation purposes .
The bottom line is that instruction set extensions can speed up dot product to an extent impossible for its partial sums .
You might have noticed another problem here , that of the dependency of a partial sum on the previous partial sum .
Removing this dependency does n't solve the bandwidth problem .
For example , consider the vertical projection of point - wise multiplication of 2 8 - bit images , which has the same not - enough - accumulators problem .
There is little you can do about the bandwidth problem in the partial sums case – the algorithm is I /O bound .
Some algorithms are n't , so you can optimize them to minimize the cost of bandwidth .
For example , matrix multiplication is essentially lots of dot products .
If you do those dot products straightforwardly , you 'll have a loop spending 2 commands for loading the matrix elements into registers , and one command for multiplying and accumulating ( MAC ) .
2 loads per MAC means an overhead of 200 % .
However , you can work on blocks – 4 rows of matrix A and 4 columns of matrix B , and compute the 4×4=16 dot products in your loop .
That 's 4+4=8 loads per 16 MACs ; the overhead dropped to 50 % .
If you have enough registers to do this .
And it 's still quite impressive overhead , is n't it ?
Your typical AVM user would be very disappointed .
( Yes , some machines can parallelize the loads and the MACs , but some can't , and it's a toy example , and stop nitpicking ) .
BTW , blocking can be used to save loads from main memory to cache just like we 've used it to save loads from cache to registers .
OK .
With partial sums of dot product , the bandwidth problem kills performance , and with matrix multiplication , it does n't .
What about convolution , which is about as basic as our previous examples ?
Gee , I really do n't know .
It 's tricky , because with convolution , you need to store intermediate results somewhere , and it 's unclear how many of them you 're going to need .
The optimal implementation depends on the quirks of the data processing units , the I/O , and the filter size .
If you come across a benchmark showing the performance of convolution on some machine , you 'll probably find interesting variations caused by the filter size .
So we have a bread - and - butter algorithm , and non-trivial & non-portable performance characteristics .
I think it 's one indication that your own less straightforward algorithm will also perform somewhat unpredictably .
Unless you know an exact reason for the opposite .
Addressing
Bandwidth is one problem with fetching operands and storing results .
Another problem is figuring out where they go .
In the case of registers , we have costly multiplexers for selecting the source and destination registers of instructions .
In the case of memory , we have addresses .
Computing addresses has a cost .
Reading data from those addresses also has a cost .
Some address sequences are costlier than others from one of these perspectives , or both .
The dumbest example is the misalignment problem .
People who learned C on x86 are sometimes annoyed when they meet a PowerPC or an ARM or almost any other processor since it wo n't read a 32 - bit integer from a misaligned address .
So when you read a binary buffer from a file or a socket , you ca n't just cast the char * to an int * and expect it to work .
Is n't it nice of x86 to properly handle these cases ?
Maybe it 's nice , maybe it is n't ( at least if it failed , the code would be fixed to become legal C ) , but it sure is costly .
The fact that it's " in the hardware " does n't make it a single - cycle operation .
If your address is misaligned , the 32 bits may reside in two different memory words ( no matter what the word size is ) .
The hardware will have to read the low word , and then read the high word , and then take the high bits of the low word and the low bits of the high word and make a single 32 - bit value out of them .
Because in one cycle , memories can only fetch one word from an aligned address .
Does it matter outside of I /O - related code using illegal pointer - casting ?
Consider the prosaic algorithm of computing the first derivative of a vector , spelled v( 2:end ) - v( 1:end - 1 ) in Matlab .
If we run on a SIMD machine , we could execute several subtractions simultaneously .
In order to do that , we need to fetch a word containing v [ 0 ] … v [ 15 ] and a word containing v[ 1 ] … v [ 16 ] ( both zero - based ) .
But the second word is misaligned .
The handling of misalignment will have a cost , whether it 's done in hardware or in software .
Well , at least the operands of subtraction live in subsequent addresses – 0,1,2…15 and 1,2,3…16 .
That 's how data processing units like them : you read a pack of numbers from memory and feed them right into the array of adders , ready to crunch them .
It 's not always like that .
Consider scaling : a ( x ) = b( s * x+t ) .
This can be used to resize images ( handy ) , or to play records at a different speed the way you 'd do with a tape recorder ( less handy , unless you like squeaky or growly voices ) .
Now , if s is n't integral ( say , s=0.6 ) , you 'd have to fetch data from places such as s*x+t = 1.3 , 1.9 , 2.5 , 3.1 , 3.7 ...
Suppose you want to use linear interpolation to approximate a ( 1.3 ) as a ( 1 ) * 0.7 + a( 2 ) * 0.3 .
So now we need to multiply the vector of " low " elements – a ( [ 1,1,2... ] ) – by the vector of weights – [ 0.7,0.1,0.5 ... ] – and add the result to the similar product a ( [ 2,2,3 ... ] ) *[ 0.3,0.9,0.5 ... ] .
The multiplications and the additions map nicely to SIMD instruction sets ; the indexing does n't , because you have those weird jumpy indexes .
So this time , the addressing can become a real bottleneck because it can prevent you from using SIMD instructions altogether and serialize your entire computation .
Well , at least we access adjacent elements .
This means that most memory accesses will hit the cache .
When you bump into an element that is n't cached yet , the machine will bring a whole cache line ( say , 32 bytes ) , and then you 'll read the other elements in that cache line , so it will pay off .
You can even issue cache prefetching instructions so that while you 're working on the current cache line , the machine will read the next one in the background .
That way , you 'll hit the cache all the time , instead of having your processor repeatedly surprised ( hey , I do n't have a ( 32 ) in the cache !.. hey , I do n't have a ( 64 ) in the cache !.. hey , I do n't have … ) .
Avoiding the regularly scheduled surprise can be really beneficial , although cache prefetching is truly disgusting ( it 's basically a very finicky kind of cooperative multi- tasking – you ought to stuff the prefetching commands into the exactly right spots in your code ) .
Now , consider a ( x ) = b( f( x ) ) – a generic transformation of an input vector given a function for computing the input coordinate from the output coordinate .
We have no idea what the next address is going to be , do we ?
If the transformation is complicated enough , we 're going to miss the cache a lot .
By the way , if the transformation is in fact simple , and the compiler knows the transformation at compile time , the compiler is still very unlikely to generate optimal cache prefetching commands .
Which is one of the gazillion differences between C++ templates and " machine - optimal " code .
DVMs and TVMs
My bandwidth and addressing heuristics do n't model a real machine ; they only model an upgrade to the AVM for SIMD machines .
Multi-box computing is one example of an entire universe of considerations they fail to model .
So what we got is a DVM – Domain - specific Virtual Machine .
Now , in order to estimate performance without measuring ( which is necessary when you choose your optimizations – you just can't try all the different options ) , I recommend a TVM ( Target - specific Virtual Machine ) .
You get one as follows .
You start with the AVM .
This gives overly optimistic performance estimations .
You then add the features needed to get a DVM .
This gives overly pessimistic estimations .
Then , you ask some low - level - loving person : " What are the coolest features of this machine that other machines do n't have ? "
This will give you the capabilities that the real processor has but its DVM does n't have .
For example , PowerPC with AltiVec extensions is basically a standard SIMD DVM plus vec_perm .
I wo n't talk about vec_perm very much , but if you ever need to optimize for AltiVec , this is the one instruction you want to remember .
It solves the indexing problem in the scaling example above , among other things .
Using a SIMD DVM and forgetting about vec_perm would make AltiVec look worse than it really is , and some algorithms much more costly than they really are .
And this is how you get a TVM for your platform .
The resulting mental model gives you a fairly realistic picture , second only to reading the entire manual and understanding the interactions of all the features ( not that easy ) .
And it definitely beats the AVM by … how do you estimate the quality of handwaving ?
OK , it beats the AVM by the factor of 5 , on average .
What , you want a proof ?
Just watch the hands go .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - New fuel efficiency requirements imposed by Congress will add , on average , $ 6,000 to the price of GM vehicles sold in the United States , the automaker ’s vice chairman and product chief said on Tuesday .
General Motors Vice President of Global Design Ed Welburn ( L ) and General Manager Jim Taylor ( C ) listen as Vice Chairman Bob Lutz invites the audience on to the stage for a closer look at the vehicles during press days of the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan , January 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
Congress passed a new energy law in December 2007 that requires automakers to increase fuel economy across the industry to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 -- up 40 percent from current levels .
“ We ’ve done the research and it ’s going to cost us $ 4,000 on some vehicles and $ 10,000 on others , with an average of about $ 6,000 , ” Bob Lutz told reporters at the North American International Auto Show .
“ That cost will have to be passed on to consumers , ” Lutz , a long - time vocal critic of federal fuel regulations , said .
Lutz said the law -- the first mandated increase for passenger car fuel economy in more than two decades -- will force GM to make vehicles lighter .
“ We can make the 35 miles per gallon with vehicle size structures more or less like they are today but we will have to restrict our choices when we decide what we want to make next , ” Lutz said .
Lutz said one example of the restriction in choices is that GM is now reversing its decision to make rear - wheel - drive versions of some vehicles because those models use more fuel .
“ We probably have to take a lot of weight out of the vehicles .
We will have to use some premium materials like more aluminum , more magnesium , ” Lutz said .
“ Which gets you the weight savings but drives the cost up . ”
“ But we are going to try as much as possible to preserve the size of the vehicle the American public wants to buy . ”
PREMIUM SMALL CAR
Lutz also said GM is looking at entering the premium small car segment in another effort to gain more fleet - wide fuel efficiency .
“ We are looking at it , ” Lutz said .
“ Making smaller cars that cost more will be part of the process to get to the 35 miles per gallon . ”
GM ’s North American sales Chief , Mark LaNeve , earlier Tuesday told Reuters the automaker is seriously considering developing a car for that segment , which would likely be branded a Saab , Hummer or Cadillac .
The luxury subcompact is a category most automakers in the United States have stayed away from so far .
BMW BMWG .DE , the world 's largest premium carmaker , is the only automaker to succeed with a small luxury car in the U.S. market -- its Mini Cooper .
Volkswagen's VOWG .DE premium brand , Audi , is expected to challenge the Mini with a new luxury subcompact called the Audi A1 in 2009 .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Toshiba Corp 6502.T is planning to give up on its HD DVD format for high - definition video , conceding defeat to the competing Blu - Ray technology backed by Sony Corp 6758.T , a company source said on Saturday .
Japanese public broadcaster NHK had earlier reported that Toshiba would suffer losses in the tens of billions of yen ( hundreds of millions of dollars ) as it scrapped production of HD DVD players and recorders and took other steps to exit the business .
The company source told Reuters that Toshiba was in the final stages of planning to exit the HD DVD business and that an official decision would be made soon .
I can see that the text looks splendid .
But when one presses a bar to “ turn ” a page , the image reverses in a way I found jarring : the light background turns black and the black text turns white , then the new page appears and everything returns to normal .
My wife said she was n’t bothered by this at all , and I did n’t have enough of a chance to see if I would soon get used to it .

Steven P. Jobs , the chief executive of Apple , has nothing to fear from the Kindle .
No one would regard it as competition for the iPod .
It displays text in four exciting shades of gray , and does that one thing very well .
It can do a few other things : for instance , it has a headphone jack and can play MP3 files , but it is not well suited for navigating a large collection of music tracks .
Yet , when Mr. Jobs was asked two weeks ago at the Macworld Expo what he thought of the Kindle , he heaped scorn on the book industry .
“ It does n’t matter how good or bad the product is ; the fact is that people do n’t read anymore , ” he said .
“ Forty percent of the people in the U.S. read one book or less last year . ”
To Mr. Jobs , this statistic dooms everyone in the book business to inevitable failure .
Only the business is not as ghostly as he suggests .
In 2008 , book publishing will bring in about $ 15 billion in revenue in the United States , according to the Book Industry Study Group , a trade association .
One can only wonder why , by the Study Group ’s estimate , 408 million books will be bought this year if no one reads anymore ?
A survey conducted in August 2007 by Ipsos Public Affairs for The Associated Press found that 27 percent of Americans had not read a book in the previous year .
Not as bad as Mr. Jobs ’s figure , but dismaying to be sure .
Happily , however , the same share  27 percent  read 15 or more books .
New book : Progressive bloggers are ' the first real political movement of the 21st century ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday September 4 , 2007
Print This Email This A New York Times Magazine political reporter who became fascinated in 2003 by the " overwhelming emotion " among Howard Dean 's supporters has now written a book about what he calls " the creation of the first real political movement of the 21st century . "
Matt Bai's The Argument : Billionaires , Bloggers , and the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics describes the growth of the progressive movement beginning with " the anger , not just at conservative government , but at the direction of the Democratic Party " that Bai first sensed in 2003 .
Bai explained to NBC's Tim Russert that he sees the role of blogs as being less like conservative talk radio , to which they are often compared , than like the religious right during the rise of conservatism in the 1960's and 70's .
He called bloggers " a group of folks who have a very passionate , 24 hour , 7 day a week following who bypass the traditional media , who sort of preach the gospel of liberal politics in a way that their like - minded followers take very seriously and very literally . "
When Russert asked him why Hillary Clinton , who polls as the frontrunning presidential candidate among Democrats in general , trails Edwards and Obama in the blogsophere , Bai replied that there is " a very strong backlash against the Democratic ethos of the 90's and against Clintonism as they see it -- triangulation , centrism .
There is a sense that ... the Clinton years were ones of selling out the party . "
On the other hand , Bai says he does not expect bloggers to be " outraged " if a candidate they support wins the presidential nomination and then turns more towards the center .
" This is a very tactical movement , " he said .
" This is not a movement based on any vision of government .
...
These folks want to win , and whatever they need to do to help a nominee win , they 're going to do . "

ALBANY – Illegal immigrants will be able to obtain driver ’s licenses under a controversial new policy to be announced today by Gov. Spitzer , The Post has learned .
Under the change , the Department of Motor Vehicles will no longer require applicants provide Social Security numbers or proof that they are eligible for Social Security cards , a source said .
Instead , the DMV will accept valid foreign passports , previous state driver ’s licenses and other verifiable proofs of ID that would be considered on a point - based system , the source said .
“ The DMV does not believe it ’s in the business checking a person ’s legal status , it ’s not the INS , ” the source said .
Following 9/11 , then - Gov. George Pataki in 2002 issued an executive order requiring driver ’s - license applicants to show a Social Security number to prove their residency status .
Sen . Martin Golden , a Brooklyn Republican who is considering a run for mayor , blasted Spitzer for repealing the requirement , saying it will make the city a more dangerous place .
“ The people of this great state did n’t elect him to allow terrorists to go unchecked , and that ’s what he ’s doing , ” Golden said .
“ We ’ll be setting ourselves up for a worse disaster than 9/11 . ”
Spitzer ’s plan , which needs no legislative approval , will be phased in in three stages beginning in December .
The change would cost the state $ 1.5 million in the initial stage , with the expectation that it would be offset through fees , the source said .
A Spitzer spokeswoman would not comment .
But Spitzer – who as attorney general defended the Pataki rules in court – said during last year ’s campaign that keeping illegal immigrants from having access to driver ’s licenses does not make the country more safe , but instead keeps immigrants in the “ shadows ” and creates a class of people with no public records .
Immigrant groups say the Pataki policy made it tough for law - abiding immigrants to work , shop for necessities and go to doctors ’ appointments while also making the roads more dangerous because of unlicensed and uninsured drivers .
Those who oppose allowing illegal immigrants to obtain licenses argue it is a threat to national security .

Among pint - sized cheerleaders , itty - bitty beauty queens , and in the malls of America , the sassy - sexy look is n't just for teens anymore .
Some say younger girls are going shorter and barer -- taking their cues from characters like the Cheetah Girls , the Pussycat Dolls and the Bratz dolls -- and some observers are saying they 've had enough .
Celia Rivenbark , a mom who hit her breaking point with the shrinking fashions , wrote a book called , " Stop Dressing Your Six Year Old Like a Skank .
"
" The moms are buying it , the dads are buying and maybe on some level the parents think , ' Oh that 's cute , that 's harmless , that 's innocent ' -- but I do n't think it is , " Rivenbank said .
" The children are wearing them down .
" And psychologist Dr. Jeff Gardere warns that how a child dresses as young as age three can have serious consequences .
"
You can be doing real damage to your child , " Gardere said .
" They are forming their taste at a very young age .
They can hurt their futures .
They can hurt their reputations , their chances for success . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Genes that helped early humans adapt to cold climates may be driving metabolism - related diseases such as obesity or diabetes in many countries , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .

Genes that helped early humans adapt to cold climates may be driving metabolism - related diseases such as obesity or diabetes in many countries , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .

They found a strong correlation between climate and genetic adaptations that influence the risk of metabolic syndrome , a group of related disorders such as obesity , high cholesterol , heart disease and diabetes .
“ Climate over a long period of time has shaped the distribution of genetic variants that may be associated with the risk of these common metabolic disorders , ” said Anna Di Rienzo , a professor of human genetics at the University of Chicago .
Anthropologists have long made the case that certain traits such as differences in skin pigmentation reflect early human migration from equatorial Africa to cooler climates -- for instance , the link between paler skin and an ability to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight .
“ There are all of these traits , body mass or skin pigmentation , that we know are strongly correlated with environmental variables , ” Di Rienzo said in a telephone interview .
Di Rienzo and colleagues wanted to see if genes that were once useful for tolerating cold climates were playing a role in diseases of the metabolism .
" To survive in these climates , they had to adapt , " said Di Rienzo , whose study appears in PLoS Genetics , a journal published by the Public Library of Science .
( here&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0040032 ) .
ENERGY BOOSTER
“ They had to develop genetic variants that made them more efficient in terms of energy metabolism and that made them more able to cope with cold climates by increasing their rate of thermogenesis -- the ability to generate and maintain heat , ” she said .
The research team picked 82 genes associated with energy metabolism and looked to see if there were any correlations with climate .
They studied variations in 1,034 people from 54 populations .
They saw several clusters of different genetic variations related to metabolic syndrome in colder climates .
One gene , the leptin receptor , is increasingly common in areas with colder winters .
Leptin is important to appetite and weight gain -- something people need no help with in modern times .
“ We eat a lot more , we do n’t exercise nearly as much as our ancestors used to do , and these adaptations that made us cope well to a cold climate now make us prone to a number of metabolic disorders , ” Di Rienzo said .
She said the study sheds light on why some of these variants are more common in certain populations .
“ It helps explain the evolutionary origins of these diseases , ” she said .
Sepp Blatter also warned that the proposal could harm England 's attempt to host the 2018 World Cup .
" This does not take into consideration the fans of the clubs and it gives the impression that they just want to go on tour to make some money , " Blatter said .
" This will never happen , at least as long as I am the president of Fifa . "
Blatter 's comments , in an interview with BBC sports editor Mihir Bose , are the strongest from the governing body since the Premier League 's plans were revealed last week .
Top - flight clubs will consider plans to extend the season to 39 games with the extra matches taking place overseas .
But the idea has met with resistance in Asia , Europe and fans in England .
This is abuse .
The rich Premier League is trying to get richer and expand the importance of that league
Sepp Blatter
Blatter 's stance effectively leave the proposals , for a round of games to take place in five different host cities from January 2011 , dead in the water .
" The Premier League is richer than the others , they have more responsibility and what they are trying to do is contrary to this responsibility , " he said .
" This is something I cannot understand and definitely the Fifa executive committee will not sanction such an initiative . "
A Premier League spokesman said the clubs would " look forward to the opportunity to meet with Fifa in order to discuss this matter in full " .
" This was always the starting point in relation to the issue of sanction for the proposed international round , and as such we will be making no comment until after that time , " the spokesman added .
This will not have a positive impact on the bid from England for the World Cup in 2018
Sepp Blatter
Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore had previously expressed his belief that Fifa could not stop the plan if the clubs receive the go - ahead from England 's Football Association .
But Blatter rejected that claim .
" It is not true , " he added .
" Even if the FA did sanction it , all the national associations receiving these clubs would have to sanction it also .
This will be very difficult .
" In addition to that , the Fifa executive committee will apply article two of the Fifa statutes : ' to prevent all methods or practices which might jeopardise the integrity of matches or competitions or give rise to abuse of association football ' .
" This is abuse .
The rich Premier League is trying to get richer and wants to expand the importance of that league . "
There were early signs of Fifa disquiet when it was revealed the governing body had told the Premier League it could not consider the plans until the Football Association had contacted them .
It is understood the FA has held talks with Fifa and is ready to issue a statement distancing themselves from the proposals .
Blatter warned it could affect the FA 's bid for the 2018 World Cup .
MIHIR BOSE BLOG
The FA wants to host the 2018 World Cup and it would be political suicide to take on Fifa on behalf of the Premier League
BBC sports editor Mihir Bose
" When it comes to a decision of the executive committee concerning this matter of the 39th round , and I am sure they will be against it , then it will not have a positive impact on the bid from England for the World Cup in 2018 , " he added .
Scudamore 's plans received a mixed reaction around the world , with the heads of the Asian Football Confederation and Football Federation Australia , which could host any proposed games , rejecting the idea , while Uefa chief Michel Platini called it a " nonsense " .
But the the United Arab Emirates Football Association and the Hong Kong Football Association have backed the plans .
" We have already sent an e-mail to Richard Scudamore expressing our interest , " said Association chairman Brian Leung .
The proposals were also widely criticised by fans in England and Blatter said he understood their reaction .
" I support the fans 100 % , " he said .
" If I was a fan in England I would say : ' no , please play at home and do n't go and exercise your talents abroad ' .
" If the plan includes official league matches then , as a fan , I would protest against this . "
Fifa will examine the Premier League 's proposals at its executive committee meeting on 14 March .

The scandals never stop for the Bush administration , do they ?
For Thursday 's edition of Bushed !
we have the news that former Attorney General John Ashcroft received a windfall $ 29 - 52 M no-bid contract from US Attorney Christopher Christie to monitor an out of court settlement with a medical supply company .
Then there is the news that former CIA official Jose Rodriguez has told Congress that he will testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee about the destruction of the tapes depicting waterboarding ... but only if he receives immunity .
And finally , there is the news we reported yesterday that the FBI lost some of their wiretaps because they did n't pay their bills .
Keith 's scorn is not for the FBI 's inability to balance their checkbook , but for the telecoms themselves :
@weatherman :
So you 've never been in a situation when you 're walking around downtown ( or in another town ) and wondered " Hmm , where 's the nearest Kinkos from here ? " ?
It happens to me all the time and now with the iPhone , what I tend to do is go to Google Maps , type in the current address ( or two intersecting street names ) , get current location , then search for " Kinkos " ( or whatever ) in the search bar to get a list of said establishment .
This feature would come in quite handy for situations like that .
Many new mobile phones can connect to the internet
Piotr Staniaszek thought he could use his new phone as a modem for his computer under his $ 10 unlimited mobile browser plan from Bell Mobility .
He downloaded high - definition movies and other large files unaware that this incurred massive extra charges .
Bell Mobility has since lowered the bill to $ 3,243 , but Mr Staniaszek says he intends to fight the charges anyway .
' Nobody told me '
The 22 - year - old oil - field worker from Calgary said he thought a first bill for $ 65,000 in November was a mistake .
When he spoke to Bell Mobility he was informed the bill had climbed to nearly $ 85,000 after more downloading .
I 'm going to try and fight it , because I did n't know about the extra charges
Piotr Staniaszek
He said he normally paid about $ 150 a month for his phone and used to be notified of high charges .
" The thing is , they 've cut my phone off for being like $ 100 over , " he told CBC News .
" Here , I'm $ 85,000 over and nobody bothered to give me a call and tell me what was going on . "
Bell Mobility said they would lower the bill to $ 3,243 in a " goodwill gesture " to match the best data plan available for using mobile phones as a modem , the Globe and Mail reported .
The trouble stems from the new phone he received when he renewed his mobile phone contract .
The new model allows him to connect with his computer and download data .
" I told them I was n't aware I would be charged for hooking up my phone to the computer .
I 'm going to try and fight it , because I did n't know about the extra charges . "
Canadians complain that their mobile phone charges are much higher for comparable service in the United States .
Soros Giuliani smackdown : ' I never liked him , incidentally ...'
In an unexpected digression from a discussion of George Orwell on WNYC's Brian Lehrer Show last month , the financier George Soros offered his harsh , personal assessment of Rudy in response to a question about Giuliani 's attacks linking him to MoveOn.org .
" I would ascribe this to an Orwellian technique of transference .
He transfers his own motives of vicious personal attack on me – tranfers it to me , " Soros said .
" I never liked him , incidentally , and I think that he today represents the worst continuation of this ' war on terror ' false metaphor – he ’s got all the same advisors who advised us to invade Iraq now advising him . "
Giuliani spokeswoman Maria Comella responded :
" Leave it George Soros to attack an American hero and think the backlash is all about him .
It just goes to show you how out of touch the interests of MoveOn.org are with the rest of the America . "
A couple of footnotes : Soros said he was n't involved in MoveOn 's " General Betrayus " attack , though he backed MoveOn in 2004 .
And one thing Soros and Rudy seem to agree on is a 1996 speech in which , according to text available on the web , Rudy pledged to work with Soros and others on behalf of immigrants .
Soros told Lehrer he had no memory of the alliance or the speech ; a Giuliani aide said the speech itself , unlike the prepared text online , apparently did n't mention Soros .
January 24 , 2008
The complicit corporate media were dragged , kicking and screaming into our reality this week after an independent study revealed an orchestrated campaign by the Bush administration to lie this country into the Iraq War .
Those of us who have been part of the alternative media of course have been painfully aware of these facts for several years now but it was nice to see this week the study released jointly by the Center for Public Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism .
The study analyzed administration statements , regardless of venue over the two year period leading up to the Iraq War .
It has long been reported by the alternative media that this was the selling period , where Bush and his cronies would spend every chance they could telling us how dangerous Saddam Hussein was to us .
They would tell us about weapons of mass destruction and when that did n’t work , they tried to scare the people with visages of mushroom clouds .
They told us it would cost us nothing , in fact that eventually Iraqi oil profits would pay for everything !
Greeted as liberators , really !
Six months , tops , swear !
Almost six years later , what we find is a report that reveals that the administration lied a total of 935 times during this two year period .
That means a day did not go by , when they did not lie about the impending Iraq War .
The two greatest lies were that Iraq had WMD and had ties to al Qaeda .
These accounted for 532 of the lies .
Bush led the campaign of lies , checking in with 259 outright lies to the American people .
The once revered Colin Powell , now a neocon puppet in history , came in a close second with 244 outright lies to the American people .
Who can forget the lie-fest Powell presented to the United Nations ?
In summarizing this report , the Fund for Independence in Journalism said yesterday , “ In short , the Bush Administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information , methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19 , 2003 . ”
Basically this means that our president methodically lied to this country to start a war .
The response from the administration is staggering in its infantilism .
White House spokesman , Scott Stanzel played revisionist historian by saying that “ the actions taken in 2003 were based on the collective judgment of intelligence agencies around the world . ”
Even if this were true , which it is not , what difference does it make ?
Is Stanzel saying that Bush abdicates his responsibility as Commander and Chief based on what other people say in the intelligence communities ?
The recent NIE on Iran would suggest otherwise .
That document outlines that Iran is not a threat , nor seeking a nuclear weapons program .
Yet despite the “ collective judgment of intelligence agencies around the world ” , Bush has virtually dismissed this NIE and does not agree with its findings .
This really cuts to the heart of the issue .
Bush cherry picks the intelligence he wants to fit his desires .
There were plenty of dissenting opinions on Iraq in 2003 , including the people who were inspecting the country at the time Bush threw them out of Iraq to blow it up .
The weapons inspectors new the cooked intelligence against Iraq was false .
So did the United Nations .
So did Joe Wilson .
In fact , outside of the hand picked intelligence from the secret Office of Special Plans ( OSP ) in the Pentagon , most knew that Saddam did not have as much as a stockpile of slingshots .
The OSP was in fact a hand - picked group of neocons such as Douglas Feith whose job it was to find something , anything that could be spun as actionable ; thus justifying the desired action of war .
Despite the junior high school defense of “ everyone else thought so too ” .
Stanzel cannot escape the fact that it was the decision of George W. Bush to act on this cherry picked intelligence .
It was not the cake walk or slam dunk though that they told us it would be .
I have heard this war described as a war of choice but I say it was far worse .
It was a war of pre-meditation .
Those who have left the administration , such is Richard Clark ; tell a story of a president who intended to invade Iraq from the moment he took the oath he so casually discarded .
The tragic events of 9 - 11 only provided the window dressing he needed to sell it to the American people .
And sell it he did .
We heard wild stories of rape rooms never to be found .
We were regaled with stories of chemical weapons and mobile weapons labs never existing in the first place .
We were told tall tales of all sorts of weapons of mass destruction that the madman we put in power was just ready to unleash upon the American people .
We were introduced to terms like “ dirty bomb ” and “ suitcase nukes . ”
When they felt the American people were sufficiently softened up , they brought out the big guns .
The specter of nuclear Armageddon was raised over and over again .
False links to al Qaeda were concocted , despite the fact that Osama bin Laden hated Saddam Hussein ’s secular Iraq .
The corporate media became the pushers for the administration .
They would do special after special about the impending doom , selling you the war as they would a tube of toothpaste .
Their complicity is frankly still understated .
They barely put up a defense .
They did n’t ask any questions .
The administration fed them lie after lie and they just lapped up and regurgitated it to the masses .
The blood of the innocents now stains their hands as well .
That is because there was a price to pay for this enormous bill of lies .
That price has been paid in blood and money .
Nearly 4,000 Americans have paid the ultimate price for this pack of lies .
These were kids who had a future until George Bush lied them to death .
Tens of thousands are injured severely ; their lives forever marred by this vicious pack of lies .
That does not take into consideration the dead Iraqis , which could total over 100,000 more innocent people killed .
This little cake walk has cost the American tax payer to date , $ 488,453,101,383 .
This all being paid while our bridges collapse around us and our education system is in shambles .
The obscenity is overwhelming .
The land of the free and the home of the brave has become the land of the lies and the home of the politically expedient .
The complicit corporate media is silent .
They are silent because they are as culpable as the administration .
If someone makes a mistake , you can always overlook it .
This was no mistake .
You do not make the same mistake 935 times in a two - year period and still have a shred of credibility left .
Either it was an orchestrated campaign , as this study concludes , or George W. Bush is the stupidest president in history .
Quite frankly , both are likely to be true .
You do not get to shrug it off though , as if the blood of the thousands killed for these lies is irrelevant .
This should be a watershed moment in our history .
Impeachment should only be the beginning but the democrats have sold out their country for the continuation of the two - party stranglehold on the American democracy .
Both sides present candidates that cannot even guarantee ending this illegal war , now confirmed to have been based on a concerted effort to lie to the American people .
John McCain says we should stay in Iraq for 100 years .
Mike Huckabee says Iran will see the “ gates of hell ” if their little speed boats get to close to one of our destroyers .
Hillary cannot tell us when the troops could come home .
Obama reflects generously on Ronald Reagan , a fatally flawed president who committed crimes against this country and started the ruination of our economy that still continues to this day .
The Fred Thompson sideshow thankfully ended but Giuliani would probably blow up what is left of the world should he somehow revive his floundering campaign and win .
The only two candidates left who speak about ending this debacle , Ron Paul and John Edwards , are marginalized by the complicit corporate media , covered in the blood they have helped to shed .

( Fortune ) --
Are we entering America 's first globalization recession ?
I think we may well be , but before explaining why , I want to emphasize two points .
First , whether we 're going into a recession at all is uncertain .
Merrill Lynch 's chief economist says we 're already in one ; Goldman Sachs 's chief economist says we 'll be in one by next quarter ; Lehman Brothers ' chief economist still does n't expect one .
Let 's not worry about what to call it :
The reality is that we 're in a deep economic slowdown that will affect millions of people .
The second point is that I remain a huge fan of globalization .
It will help more people than it hurts , in America and worldwide .
But it will certainly produce new challenges , and today 's economic situation looks like one of them .
The reasons we 're in a major slowdown center on U.S. consumers , who drive the economy .
Through the past six years they 've been the most maniacal spending machines the world has ever seen .
Stock market wobbles , rising interest rates , staggering personal debt , war , floods , hurricanes - nothing could slow them down .
That was mainly because the value of their largest asset , housing , kept going up , and because they were confident about their jobs .
As long as their home equity looked like a piggy bank and their paychecks looked solid , they just kept buying , and America 's economic engine just kept turning .
Of course , home values have been declining for quite a while , and more recently the jobs picture has deteriorated markedly .
What really slammed the door for many economists was the December employment report , which showed the unemployment rate jumping to 5 % and a tiny number of jobs ( 18,000 ) created .
With the home - equity ATM closed and paychecks looking iffy , it seems consumers have finally been forced to put the credit cards back in their wallets .
Sure enough , after the holiday season a wave of retailers reported year - over - year sales drops for December .
Department - store giant Macy's ( M , Fortune 500 ) , for instance , saw a 7.9 % drop in same - store sales and noted an overall decline in consumer spending as a contributing factor .
Now what does any of that have to do with globalization ?
Quite a bit .
Consider first the housing bubble .
It was fueled by extraordinarily cheap money that lenders were virtually throwing at borrowers .
As a result , the prices paid broke free of any connection to plausible values in relation to rents or total housing supply .
That superabundance of cheap money did n't come from Americans , since we have n't been saving for years .
It came from the rest of the world , from what Fed chairman Ben Bernanke calls the " global saving glut . "
While we were spending , nearly everyone else on earth was saving at unprecedented rates , and those hundreds of billions of dollars made their way here .
Not that anyone beat us with a stick and made us borrow the money or use it to pay ridiculous prices for homes ; we can't blame anyone but ourselves for that .
But the fact remains that without the global saving glut , we could n't have had a housing bubble or the resulting housing collapse .
The jobs picture also has an important global dimension .
For a majority of Americans , the most significant fact of globalization is the advent of a large - scale global labor market .
Millions of people around the world can now compete for millions of U.S. jobs .
Never mind that the number of jobs that actually get outsourced is relatively small .
What matters is the mere presence of those lower - priced workers .
They hold down the pay of high - priced Americans and constantly entice employers everywhere to create new jobs over there rather than here .
Thus , the problem is n't so much jobs being sent abroad but jobs that never show up here at all .
To repeat , globalization remains a net plus for America and the world .
But it means that we Americans must rethink our role in the world economy .
We used to be the locomotive that pulls the train , and to a large extent we still are ; Chinese factory owners will not be happy about a U.S. slowdown .
But while we still influence the world economy , the new reality is that the world economy increasingly influences us .
WASHINGTON , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government 's main disaster - response agency apologized on Friday for having its employees pose as reporters in a hastily called news conference on California 's wildfires that no news organizations attended .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency , still struggling to restore its image after the bungled handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , issued the apology after The Washington Post published details of the Tuesday briefing .
" We can and must do better , and apologize for this error in judgment , " FEMA deputy administrator Harvey Johnson , who conducted the briefing , said in a statement .
" Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received . "
No actual reporter attended the news conference in person , agency spokesman Aaron Walker said .
A spokeswoman for Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , who has authority over FEMA , called the incident " inexcusable and offensive to the secretary . "
" We have made it clear that stunts such as this will not be tolerated or repeated , " spokeswoman Laura Keehner said .
She said the department was looking at the possibility of reprimanding those responsible .
The agency had called the briefing with about 15 minutes notice as federal officials headed for southern California to oversee and assist in firefighting and rescue efforts .
Reporters were also given a telephone number to listen in on but could not ask questions .
But with no reporters on hand and an agency video camera providing a feed carried live by some television networks , FEMA press employees posed the questions for Johnson that included : " Are you happy with FEMA 's response so far ? "
According to Friday 's Post account , which Walker confirmed , Johnson replied that he was " very happy with FEMA 's response so far . "
He also said the agency had the benefit of " good leadership " and other factors , " none of which were present at Katrina . "
Chertoff was head of the Homeland Security Department during Katrina .
FEMA 's administrator during Katrina , Michael Brown , resigned amid widespread criticism over his handling of the disaster , despite U.S. President George W. Bush 's initial declaration that he was doing a " heck of a job . "
E-mails between Brown and his colleagues over the course of the storm revealed a preoccupation with his media image , including his declaration , " I am a fashion god . "
FEMA is reviewing its press procedures and will make changes to ensure they are " straightforward and transparent , " Johnson said on Friday .
With all the talk of contaminated food pouring in from China and elsewhere , I have to wonder how safe our food supply really is .
Let ’s face it !
It ’s not just food coming from outside our borders that contain things not normally considered edible .
There ’s mercury and Prozac ( yes Prozac ) in our fish ; hormones in our meat .
And what about that old adage , an apple a day keeps the doctor away ?
Is it really healthy to eat all those apples ?
We ’re not just eating apple with our apples , you know , but a whole array of pesticides and heaven knows what else .
I hate to be a neurotic alarmist about what ’s in my food , but when a report from the non-profit Environmental Working Group says that conventionally - grown food really does have a load of pesticides on them it gives pause .
For the record the FDA defines a pesticide thusly :
" The term pesticide includes many kinds of ingredients used in products , such as insecticides , fungicides , rodenticides , insect repellants , weed killers , antimicrobials , and swimming pool chemicals , which are designed to prevent , destroy , repel , or reduce pests of any sort . "
( I would like to assert that I am not a pest , despite what ’s apparently on my food , and what my friends and family may think on occasion . )
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ran nearly 51,000 tests on 44 fruits and veggies between 2000 and 2004 .
Their data was compiled by the Environmental Working Group , and showed that conventionally - grown apples ranked second worst for pesticide contamination .
94 % of all apples sampled were contaminated with an average of 3 different pesticides , at a total average of almost 1 part per million ( ppm ) .
Potatoes had the highest contamination level – 1.7 ppm on average , with over 80 % of the potatoes tested having some detectable levels .
I do n’t like eating potatoes anyway , so I ’m not too non-plused about that .
But what about those yummy , yummy peaches we all scoff during the summer if we possibly can ?
All I can say is “ Put the peach down ! ”
Our fuzzy favorites tested positive for an average of three different kinds of bug killers totaling more than 1.1 ppm on average .
97 % of the peaches sampled were contaminated .
There is some good news for those who have not yet succumbed to eating only organic food .
Onions are alright .
They showed no contamination .
Zip .
Avocados and mangoes are OK too .
Imported grapes – bad .
Domestic grapes – good .
And the list goes on .
You can get the complete scoop here : http://www.foodnews.org/fulldataset.php
Unfortunately , we do n’t really know what the effects are of eating small amounts of pesticide – if you call 1 ppm small .
The FDA has a clear limit for methyl mercury , which is often found in fish .
The agency considers it unsafe to eat anything containing more than 1 ppm of that compound .
However , trying to make sense of EPA ’s pesticide limits – tolerances and exemptions , as it calls them – is like trying to untangle a swimming pool full of angel hair pasta .
According to an April 2007 report “ There are more than 1055 active ingredients registered as pesticides , which are formulated into thousands of pesticide products that are available in the marketplace . ”
Crikey .
It ’s enough to put me right off my food !
Despite the lack of clarity on the subject of health effects , there are a number of diseases correlated with chronic low - dose pesticide exposure .
They include prostate , colon and breast cancer , and most recently Parkinson ’s Disease .
Most of these studies included data from known pesticide exposure , which presumably did not include food .
However , in 2006 , a British group linked child cancer directly with food - borne pesticides .
Contamination is particularly bad for fetuses and children , whose organs and metabolic systems that break down pesticides are still developing .
It ’s little wonder that the business of organic food has grown by between 15 – 21 % annually from 1997 – 2006 .
Eating organic really is safer .
But if you do n’t want to pay the extra little bit to get largely pesticide - free fruits and veggies , and do n’t mind flavoring your food with a pinch of poison , then keep buying the least contaminated conventionally - grown ones .
The list includes : eggplant , broccoli , cabbage , bananas , kiwi , asparagus , mango , pineapple , avocado , and onion .
But unless you have a death wish , I ’d stay away from some favorites , until you buy organic : peaches , apples , bell peppers , celery , strawberries , cherries , lettuce , imported grapes , pears , spinach , potatoes , and … carrots .
I guess Bugs Bunny will be going organic .
Christina Silva Gives up Miss California 2008 Crown to Raquel Beezley
The Donald Trump organization is under fire again .
This time the Miss USA organization has asked the newly crowned Christina Silva to give back her crown , due to an accounting error .
What is even more concerning is that the 1st runner up Brandi Williams , who would normally take the crown , does n't get it either .
The judges evidently picked Christina Silva , who was to be the 2nd runner - up as the winner ... oops !
If you are able to follow this , the new winner of the Miss California 2008 pageant is now Raquel Beezley .
I would imagine there may be several lawsuits over this for Donald Trump and his Miss Universe organization .
The activation pattern evoked by a familiar object is n’t located in just one place in the brain , according to team of Carnegie Mellon University computer scientists and cognitive neuroscientists who combined methods of machine learning and brain imaging and found a way to identify where people ’s thoughts and perceptions of familiar objects originate in the brain .
For instance , thinking about a hammer activated many locations .
How you swing a hammer activated the motor area , while what a hammer is used for , and the shape of a hammer activated other areas .
This new method was developed over two years under the leadership of neuroscientist Professor Marcel Just and Computer Science Professor Tom M. Mitchell .
Brain activation showing areas of greater activity for ( A ) objects compared to fixation , and ( B ) tools compared to dwellings .
A dozen study participants enveloped in an MRI scanner were shown line drawings of 10 different objects — five tools and five dwellings — one at a time and asked to think about their properties .
Just and Mitchell ’s method was able to accurately determine which of the 10 drawings a participant was viewing based on their characteristic whole - brain neural activation patterns .
To make the task more challenging for themselves , the researchers excluded information in the brain ’s visual cortex , where raw visual information is available , and focused more on the “ thinking ” parts of the brain .
According to Just and Mitchell , this is the first study to report the ability to identify the thought process associated with a single object .
While earlier work showed it is possible to distinguish broad categories of objects such as “ tools ” versus “ buildings , ” this new research shows that it is possible to distinguish between items with very similar meanings , like two different tools .
The machine - learning method involves training a computer algorithm ( a set of mathematical rules ) to extract the patterns from a participant ’s brain activation , using data collected in one part of the study , and then testing the algorithm on data in an independent part of the same study .
In this way , the algorithm is never previously exposed to the patterns on which it is tested .
Another important question addressed by the study was whether different brains exhibit the same or different activity patterns to encode these individual objects .
To answer this question , the researchers tried identifying objects represented in one participant ’s brain after training their algorithms using data collected from other participants .
They found that the algorithm was indeed able to identify a participant ’s thoughts based on the patterns extracted from the other participants .
“ This part of the study establishes , as never before , that there is a commonality in how different people ’s brains represent the same object , ” said Mitchell , head of the Machine Learning Department in Carnegie Mellon ’s School of Computer Science and a pioneer in applying machine learning methods to the study of brain activity .
“ There has always been a philosophical conundrum as to whether one person ’s perception of the color blue is the same as another person’s .
Now we see that there is a great deal of commonality across different people ’s brain activity corresponding to familiar tools and dwellings . ”
“ This first step using computer algorithms to identify thoughts of individual objects from brain activity can open new scientific paths , and eventually roads and highways , ” added Svetlana Shinkareva , an assistant professor of psychology at the University of South Carolina who is the study ’s lead author .
“ We hope to progress to identifying the thoughts associated not just with pictures , but also with words , and eventually sentences . ”
Just , who directs the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging at Carnegie Mellon , noted that one application the team is excited about is comparing the activation patterns of people with neurological disorders , such as autism .
“ We are looking forward to determining how people with autism neurally represent social concepts such as friend and happy , ” he said .
Just also is developing a brain - based theory of autism .
“ People with autism perceive others in a distinctive way that has been difficult to characterize , ” he explained .
“ This machine learning approach offers a way to discover that characterization . ”
The project applying machine learning to brain patterns was funded by the W.M. Keck Foundation and the National Science Foundation .

about free speech or what the law is about adult content — because our Department of Justice has its own agenda .
The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals recently ruled that the government 's 2257 statute against pornography is unconstitutional , which immediately prompted an ecstatic round of premature celebrations .
Salon 's tech blogger Machinist popped a boner the size of the Empire State Building .
( " Hallelujah ! " he wrote .
" Haul out your 8 MM , put on some lounge music , get your partner — and maybe a gaffer , some stage hands , a caterer , a boom operator and your parents , who 'll be so proud — and get down !
The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has just ruled that you are free to make your own porn ... " )
Digital rights pundit Declan McCullough joined the frenzy , cheering that " this is likely going to be the last word unless the U.S. Supreme Court gets involved . "
But what looks like good news for porn looks like exactly the opposite — with a little history .
I wish I could be so blissfully ecstatic about the ruling , but this " unconstitutional " law enforcement has gone on for too long without any real consequences , despite previous major court rulings .
In 1998 , I was working my first adult content gig at a West L.A. company called Sundance and Associates , which among other things produced a series of print magazines which ran explicit classified ads , and was henceforth considered a " secondary producer " of adult content .
In 1998 , Sundance sued Janet Reno , insisting that the first incarnation of the 2257 legislation failed to prove that by running these ads , Sundance was their " producer . "
The magazines were almost exactly the same as the Ohio magazines involved in last month 's court decision , and our case ended up in the Tenth Circuit court , which ruled in our favor .
However , that ruling was never put to the test , because the Department of Justice never launched the inspections many producers feared they would .
Instead , many content providers ranging from hardcore porn sites to internet dating services continued taking the greatest care in creating and keeping detailed records , fearing they 'd otherwise face federal prosecution under a statute with " child pornography " in its title .
Many even assumed the ruled - against legislation had remained intact and unchallenged !
In fact , U.S. Code 2257 , which was passed under the guise of protecting children during the Clinton administration , instead puts anyone who 's ever taken a sexually explicit photograph in jeopardy of federal prosecution .
In 2005 , Senators Hatch and Brownback overhauled the statute to address new technologies of production ( like the interwebz ) , but with the troublesome " secondary producer " language remaining .
The language in 2257 was ultimately slighted by the courts as being " poorly drafted ... should never be used as a model of the English language " and " overbroad . "
( It 's presently worded so that the naughty photo of you and your partner stored on your iPhone qualifies you as a producer of adult content . )
It 's unknown how much producers struggled to adhere to this incarnation of the 2257 statute — but the wave of fear it produced is tangible .
Attorneys for some websites , many unfamiliar with the code 's storied history , have cowered under the threat of inspection , choosing instead to change their sites to avoid scrutiny .
Which is why the government will most likely stall any further judicial review as long as it can .
After all , it 's already taken two more years just to get to this point , and if this administration knows the statute is eventually doomed , its best interests are served by postponing the inevitable .
Until the highest court in the land puts the beat - down on this unconstitutional code , the chilling effect of possible prosecution will continue to be felt in what has always been the vanguard of the fight for free expression — the adult entertainment industry .
Even if you do n't have an entire wing of your estate dedicated to the canon of Ron Jeremy , history has proven it unwise to encourage the persecution of one group , lest that group containlater on .
Especially with that iPhone photo we talked about earlier .
Perhaps the most perverse element of 2257 is that , by using it as a blunt instrument to attackadult content , it fails on its own premise of being a weapon against the creation and distribution of child pornography .
When the statute was first passed almost 20 years ago , both the porn industry and the Department of Justice were still smarting from the whole Traci Lords debacle , where it was revealed that the starlet had been working in the industry well before her 18th birthday .
And while the millions in lost revenue from the loss of her catalog was fair evidence that the studios had been fooled by Lords ' fake ID ( and a talent well beyond her young years ) , the government nevertheless leapt at the chance to regulate an industry that they loathed .
So currently , every adult title must keep detailed records of everyone involved , just in case dark - suited FBI agents invade their offices .
And that 's every adult movie — even the ones that feature 70 - year - old women and well - worn former fluffers engaged in geriatric carnal knowledge that nobody with half a brain would confuse with kiddie porn .
As with the undocumented immigrant labor issue , many regard this extra record - keeping as an unreasonable burden .
Opponents of the current 2257 statute maintain that the Constitution gives the government the burden of establishing whether or not adult content is child pornography — instead of placing a burden on the producers of proving contentchild pornography .
In their new unanimous decision , the three judges of the Sixth Circuit also noted this peculiar irony : the tragic failure of 2257 to actually protect children by concentrating heavily on material so obviously outside this scope .
Leading the charge against the legislation was the Free Speech Coalition , a renowned trade organization and constitutional crusader — and they cited our 1998 victory against Janet Reno .
Reed Lee , the chair of their Legal Committee and an FSC board member , agreed with the Court that the legislation was too vague to actually afford any protection to children .
" This is one of the arguments that we have been asserting all along and that we will continue to carry if necessary .
"
Of course , the court 's decision is by no means the last word on 2257 , and Lee believes the government will probably make its next move in the coming weeks .
The Department of Justice could request that the Sixth Circuit court review its decision , or it could ask the United States Supreme Court to take up the case .
It could also try to re-write the statute to address the court 's concerns , though of the three justices on the Sixth Circuit , only one even believed that " portions of the section can be judicially salvaged .
" Even if it 's ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional , Congress can always try to create a new statute without the same defects .
( This is n't the first time the Department of Justice has been spanked for trying to bully the adult industry with anti-lifestyle legislation disguised as child protection . )
But not everyone 's as cynical about the outcome as I am .
In a press release , the currently - victorious FSC assessed the possibility that Congress could simply attempt a third iteration of the code .
" Given the decision yesterday , that would not be easy to do and might not result in anything like the burdensome record - keeping requirements now on the books , but we must remain vigilant against efforts to revive Section 2257 legislatively .
If there 's any hope today , it 's the end result of a very long fight .
" The Free Speech Coalition has worked hard over the past few years to be in a position to influence events in Congress as well as the courts .
Our efforts there may not always be high - profile , but we are confident that we are in a position to be heard on policy issues as we never have before .
" Eliminating the tools with which zealous , almost always Republican - controlled , U.S. Attorneys use the War on Porn to target whomever they do n't want running around in society , is not just good for the adult industry — it protects all of us .
A Marine squad was on a dusty road in Iraq , far from home .
Suddenly , a deadly roadside bomb explodes the early morning calm and kills a lance corporal and wounds two other Marines .
The mission : tend to the wounded and find those who were responsible ...
Or make someone pay ?
Three sleeping families awaken to the sound of grenades and guns .
By the end of the " operation , " 24 people were dead , including three women and six children .
Bullets , fired at close range , tore through bodies and lodged deep in walls .
A one - legged elderly man was shot nine times in the chest and abdomen .
A man who watched the violence from his roof across the road told The Washington Post that he heard his neighbor speak to the Marines in English , begging for the lives of his wife and children , saying , " I am friend .
I am good . "
All the family was killed except one : 13 - year - old Safa .
Covered in her mother 's blood , she reportedly fainted and appeared dead .
In a road nearby lay the bodies of five men - four college students and their driver .
On Nov. 20 , 2005 , a Marine spokesman reported : " A U.S. Marine and 15 civilians were killed yesterday from the blast of a roadside bomb in Haditha .
Immediately following the bombing , gunmen attacked the convoy with small - arms fire .
Iraqi army soldiers and Marines returned fire , killing eight insurgents and wounding another . "
The only truth in that statement was that there was a roadside bomb and that a Marine - Lance Cpl. Miguel Terrazas , known as T.J. to the other men in his squad - was killed instantly .
The rest was a lie .
It took months for the truth to come out , and the search for justice is taking even longer .
The 24 Iraqi bodies have since been buried in a cemetery in Haditha , a farming town beside the Euphrates River .
But no one - from the commander on down - has been sentenced to prison , and the effort to hold Marines responsible for this crime has focused on a few men who are low on the chain of command .
Geoffrey Corn , a retired lieutenant colonel and a professor at Southern Texas College of Law , says the laws of war work because " for every case of atrocities that we read about , there are thousands of Marines and soldiers who act with restraint . "
The Laws of Armed Conflict and the Geneva Conventions were designed as the basis for military conduct in times of war .
Three central principles govern armed conflict : military necessity , distinction ( soldiers must engage only valid military targets ) and proportionality ( the loss of civilian lives and property damage must not outweigh the military advantage sought ) .
Among other things , the Geneva Conventions identify grave breaches of international law as the " willful killing ; torture or inhuman treatment ; willful causing of great suffering ; and extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully or wantonly . "
An examination of the military 's actions in the aftermath of Haditha reveals a clear unwillingness to apply these principles .
Whose neck is on the line ?
" You stop war crimes by coming down on the ranking officer , " says Ian Cuth - bertson , a military historian and senior fellow at the World Policy Institute .
" All armies in all wars at all times have committed war crimes , " he continues .
" The question is : Does command authority condone or stop them ?
You ca n't just give an 18 - year - old an automatic weapon and tell him , ' Do n't shoot prisoners in the head . '
You need an officer to rein him in .
The officer needs to feel as though his own neck is on the line . "
In the case of Haditha , Marines have not put officers ' necks on the line .
Maj. Gen. Richard Huck , who was in charge of Marines in Haditha in 2005 , along with his chief of staff Col. Richard Sokoloski and Col. Stephen Davis , who headed the regimental combat team , all received letters of censure from the secretary of the U.S. Navy .
The censure did not strip the men of their rank or salary , but they will be barred from future promotions , which could force them out of the Marines .
According to Gary Solis , a military law expert and former Marine , censure is the Marine Corps ' most serious administrative sanction .
But , as Cuthbertson points out , the generals are not being censured for letting Haditha happen .
They are being punished for not investigating .
This is a big difference .
Cuthbertson cites the Allied response to the Malmedy massacre in Belgium as one example of taking war crimes seriously up the chain of command .
In 1944 , German soldiers killed more than 70 unarmed U.S. prisoners of war .
In war crimes trials after Germany was defeated , justice was swift and extended far beyond those who actually pulled triggers .
" The commander of the regiment was n't there .
He was found guilty and sentenced to death , " says Cuthbertson .
" The general of the Army was n't there .
He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison . "
Unraveling the massacre
In January 2006 - a month after the Haditha massacre - an Iraqi journalism student gave Time magazine a video of the bloody aftermath .
Taher
Thabet shot footage in the homes and at the morgue , recording the carnage in shaky frames .
Time passed the footage on to the chief military spokesman in Baghdad , forcing the Marines to launch an investigation .
Until the evidence was in their hands ( and widely available on the Internet ) , they appeared ready to accept as truth the flimsy , contradictory account of events cobbled together by the squad leader and his men .
Two months later , the investigation determined that Marines - not insurgents - killed the civilians , and Naval Criminal Investigative Services further concluded that the civilians were deliberately targeted .
CNN reported on the investigations on March 16 , and Time published a long article on March 27 .
President Bush , however , did not address the Haditha issue until June 1 , when he called the allegations " very troubling for me and equally troubling for our military . "
But it took until December 2006 for eight Marines to be charged : four enlisted men with unpremeditated murder , and four officers with dereliction for covering up or failing to report the killings .
These indictments helped the Marines create the impression that those responsible for Haditha were rigorously prosecuted .
Yet the four charged with murder were not the only four who pulled triggers that day .
And the four officers charged in the cover up were not the only four who lied .
In handing down the eight indictments , the Marines also granted immunity to at least seven others who either participated in the killings or tried to hide what the squad had done .
The military ultimately offered immunity deals to two of those charged with murder in exchange for their damning testimony .
Charges against two of the officers were also dismissed after their " Article 32 hearings , " a sort of a half trial , half grand - jury proceeding unique to military criminal proceedings .
At this point , criminal responsibility for 24 murders in at least four separate locations is being placed on two Marines : Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich and Lance Cpl. Stephen Tatum .
Of their squad of 13 , they are the only two who face general court martial for the killings .
Tatum , from Edmund , Okla. , is charged with involuntary manslaughter , aggravated assault and reckless endangerment .
His trial date has not been set , but if found guilty of all three , Tatum could face a maximum 19 years in confinement , a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay .
During his July 24 , 2007 military investigation hearing , the 25 - year - old Marine choked back tears , saying , " I am not comfortable with the fact that I might have shot a child .
I do n't know if my rounds impacted anyone .
...
That is a burden I will have to bear . "
For his part , Wuterich , the Marine squad leader , was originally indicted with more than a dozen counts of unpremeditated murder , as well as soliciting another to commit an offense and making false official statements , which carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life .
After his Article 32 hearing in August 2007 , Investigating Officer Lt. Paul Ware recommended dismissing 10 murder charges and reducing seven others to negligent homicide .
There has not been a determination on that recommendation , and a court martial date has not yet been set .
Wuterich told CBS's " 60 Minutes " : " Everyone visualizes me as a monster - a baby killer , cold - blooded , that sort of thing . "
On the TV screen , he was handsome , polished and impossibly young looking .
Of the other four charged with the lesser offense of failing to report the incident , or obstructing the investigation - only two remain under indictment .
One of them , Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani , is the most senior U.S. servicemen to face a court martial for action in combat since Vietnam .
He is not being charged for allowing the crimes to happen , but for violating a lawful order and willful dereliction of duty for failing to report and investigate the deaths .
In cold blood ?
The cases will hinge not on what happened or why , but how :
Was it a rage - induced rampage or a by - the - book operation ?
The answer to that question depends on which side of the gun you 're on .
Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , a former Marine who chairs the Subcommittee on Defense in the House Appropriations Committee , told reporters in May 2006 that the investigations would reveal that " our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them , and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood . "
But soldiers are not supposed to kill in cold blood .
" War is not a license , " wrote Telford Taylor , a lead - prosecutor at Nuremberg , in Vietnam , an American Tragedy .
" It does not countenance the infliction of suffering for its own sake or for revenge . "
Thabet , the Iraqi journalism student who filmed the aftermath at Haditha , saw rage , telling Time : " They not only killed people , they smashed furniture , tore down wall hangings and when they took prisoners , they treated them very roughly .
This was not a precise military operation . "
Not so , says Wuterich .
" We reacted to how we were supposed to react to our training and I did that to the best of my ability , " he told " 60 Minutes . "
" The rest of the Marines that were there , they did their job properly as well .
We cleared these houses the way they were supposed to be cleared . "
Lt. William Kallop ordered Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich to " clear " one of the homes .
He was granted immunity from future prosecution in exchange for his testimony .
Another Marine , Lance Cpl. Humberto Manuel Mendoza , who was not indicted , told investigators that he shot at least two people : " I was following my training that all individuals in a hostile house are to be shot . "
Sgt. Sanick Dela Cruz , whose murder charges were dropped in exchange for his testimony against Wuterich , testified that after riddling dead bodies with automatic fire , he urinated on the head of one corpse .
" I know it was a bad thing what I done , but I done it because I was angry T.J. was dead . "
' I was just following orders '
Justifying crimes with assertions that " we reacted to how we were supposed to react to our training " is not new .
It echoes Befehl ist Befehl - I was just following orders - words Nazi leaders accused of war crimes used to justify their actions .
The Nuremberg Tribunals following World War II found many of them guilty , sentencing them to death or life in prison .
The tribunals placed the conscience of the individual above the will of military superiors .
" In the military , there is a culture of compliance , fear , blind obedience , silence , " says Camilo Mejia , 32 , who joined the Army when he was 19 and went to prison rather than return to Iraq .
Mejia served in the Florida National Guard and went to Iraq as staff sergeant in 2003 .
" Behavior is suggested and implied .
The expectation is that if everyone else is doing it , you should do it . "
At a detention facility in Al Assad , Mejia 's unit was responsible for keeping prisoners awake for long periods of time in preparation for interrogation .
In an interview , he described their job as " sleep deprivation with loud sounds , mock executions , treating them as sub- humans . "
His unit performed this long enough to " see that this was a systematic problem from the very top , " says Mejia .
" They had set the tone and the work .
We just followed suit .
No one sat us down and said , ' We want you to commit war crimes . '
But they communicated what we were supposed to do , and that was war crimes . "
In June 2004 , Mejia told CBS 's " 60 Minutes II " about the 12 or 13 Iraqis he and his men killed in Ramadi , mostly civilians caught in the crossfire .
" Whether you want to admit it or not to yourself , this is a human being , " Mejia .
" And I saw this man go down and I saw him being dragged through a pool of his own blood and that shocked me . "
In war , Mejia says , " committing war crimes is what you are expected to do . "
Hamdaniya
The month after the Haditha massacre became news , the Marines found themselves shamed by another atrocity .
On April 26 , 2006 , Marines based in Hamdaniya dragged Hashim Ibrahim Awad , a 52 - year - old man and father of 11 children , from his home in the middle of the night , bound his hands and feet and shot him to death .
The Marines ' plan was to snatch a suspected insurgent said to be behind a rash of roadside bombings and who had been repeatedly captured but released .
When the Marines could not find him , they kidnapped and killed the man 's neighbor instead .
Later , they stole an AK - 47 and staged the scene so that it appeared that Awad was caught while deploying a roadside bomb .
Seven Marines and a Navy corpsman - who became known as the Camp Pendleton Eight - were charged in the case .
During the Article 32 hearings , defense attorneys said the Marines ' superiors told them they were too soft .
They had witnessed their superiors beating Iraqi suspects and felt pressured to be more aggressive in an environment where roadside bombs and attacks were constant and assailants melted in and out of the civilian population .
Lance Cpl. Robert Pennington testified that the men were " sick of " their rules of engagement and decided " to write our own rules to keep ourselves alive . "
Trent Thomas , a corporal from East St. Louis charged in the case , appeared on " Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees . "
When asked if he was ordered to kill Awad : " I really can't say , " Thomas responded , but later allowed , " I think your leadership plays a huge factor in what you do .
That 's all I can say . "
Thomas was demoted to private and received a bad conduct discharge .
Only two of the Camp Pendleton Eight remain in prison .
Pennington is expected to serve eight years on a 14 - year sentence after a plea agreement , and Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins was sentenced to 15 years .
But Gen. James Mattis - the same convening authority who made determinations in the Haditha killings - is reportedly considering reducing both sentences .
Abu Ghraib
The world learned about Abu Ghraib from the photos .
Piles of naked bodies .
A man leashed like a dog .
A hooded figure standing on a box with wires hanging from him .
A menacing dog inches from a cringing man 's face .
Assertions that the torture was the result of sadistic , bored or under - supervised soldiers have been widely discredited .
" There is no way that a handful of low - ranking soldiers could have invented techniques all by themselves that , curiously enough , were used at Guantanamo and at other places in Iraq and Afghanistan , " says Stjepan Mestrovic , a sociologist at Texas A&M University .
After months of cover - up , the blame was laid at the feet of several low - ranked soldiers , pictured grinning and giving the thumbs - up .
Pvt. Lynndie England and Spc. Charles
Graner were tried , convicted and sentenced to three and 10 years , respectively .
Seven others have been sentenced for abuse at Abu Ghraib .
Only 54 military personnel - a fraction of the more than 600 U.S. personnel implicated in detainee abuse cases throughout Iraq and elsewhere in the war on terror - have been convicted by court martial .
And only 40 have been sentenced to prison time , many for less than a year , according to a 2006 analysis by the Detainee Abuse and Accountability Project .
No U.S. military officer has been held accountable for criminal acts committed by subordinates under the doctrine of command responsibility .
International law limps into the breach
Military prosecutors have won convictions against soldiers and Marines in more than 200 cases of violent crimes , including murder , rape and assault against Iraqi civilians , according to a July 27 , 2007 New York Times analysis .
In some cases , these convictions may come with severe sentences .
Federal prosecutors are said to be seeking the death penalty for former Pvt. Stephen Green , who is accused of raping and murdering a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl , as well as slaying her parents and younger sister .
He will be tried as a civilian because he was discharged before the crimes came to light .
This horrific crime is the subject of Brian de Palma 's new movie Redacted .
But seeking the death penalty for Green , sentencing Hutchins to 15 years or court - martialing Wuterich for multiple unpremeditated murders is not the same as seeking justice for war crimes .
These three should be held responsible , but the scales of justice are tipped toward scapegoating the convenient foils .
They have committed awful and criminal acts , but their guilt cannot be easily separated from those who are the architects of the war .
In November 2006 , the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , a nonprofit legal and educational organization , filed a criminal complaint , asking a German federal prosecutor to open " a criminal prosecution that will look into the responsibility of high - ranking U.S. officials for authorizing war crimes in the context of the so - called war on terror , " according to a CCR statement .
On behalf of 12 Iraqi citizens whom the U.S. military detained and tortured at Abu Ghraib , the complaint names former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other high - ranking U.S. officials .
The German court dismissed the case in April 2007 , ruling that a U.S. court should hear the charges .
But CCR - along with other groups - have filed similar charges in Sweden , Argentina and France .
" This is a case of universal jurisdiction , " says Belinda Cooper , editor of War Crimes : The Legacy of Nuremberg and a professor of human rights and international law at New York University 's Center for Global Affairs , " It 's brought under the theory that any country can take jurisdiction of particularly heinous crimes , especially if the country that would normally prosecute them is unlikely to do so . "
She continues : " But can you imagine Bush being tried in the U.S. or Putin in Russia for , say , torture of detainees during their administrations ?
The new international criminal court is not going to touch a Putin or a Bush . "
While these projects inch forward , soldiers are taking matters into their own hands .
In March 2008 , Iraq Veterans Against the War will convene new Winter Soldier hearings , modeled on the February 1971 meetings in a Detroit Howard Johnson's .
In the shadow of the My Lai massacre revelations , the hearings provided a platform to more than 125 Vietnam veterans to describe the atrocities they participated in and witnessed .
This effort could once again give the United States a chance to listen to soldiers and Marines as they break the silence , hold themselves and each other accountable and demand the same from the architects of the war .

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that on their Salt Lake City Temple they prominently display an upside - down star which is a Satanic symbol known as the Goat 's head ..
Why ?
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they believe the Archangel Michael came down to earth with several of his celestial wives , and became Adam in the garden of Eden .
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that that they believe the angel Gabriel came down to earth and became Noah in the days of the flood .
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that their Prophet Joseph Smith prophesied falsely many times .
For example , he foretold the second coming of Christ for 1891 .
The Bible teaches that one false prophecy puts a prophet under death sentence .
( Deuteronomy 18:20 - 22 ) .
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that their Prophet Joseph Smith did not die as a martyr as they claim , but was killed during a gun battle in which he himself killed two men and wounded a third .
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU about the Mountain Meadows Massacre in which they brutally murdered an innocent wagon train of settlers , of over one hundred men , women , and most of the children , traveling through Utah .
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that Joseph Smith taught that there were inhabitants on the moon , and Brigham Young taught there were inhabitants on the sun as well !
WHY WON'T MORMONS TELL YOU THESE THINGS ?
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , the Mormons , are well aware that if these facts were known to the convert prior to baptism , they would have very few converts !
The Missionaries are well trained to keep most of these facts from their potential converts .
Tragically , many Mormons may not even be fully aware of the doctrines and history of their own church .
Every statement on this tract is true .
Mormons are encouraged to check out their own publications for documentation of the above .
After all , if the Mormon Church ( The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ) has the truth , it can stand any amount of investigation .
Please do not be afraid to investigate .
We are not Ex-Mormons , but Christians defending the Christian Church and its beliefs .
Excellent documentation etc. can be found in the Mormon Ministry web sites from our link page .

One point I should have made at the beginning of the previous post is the distinction between unschooling and homeschooling .
Most home schooling is not unschooling -- the parents have a curriculum and are following something closer to the conventional model than we are .
And one can do unschooling in a school .
Our kids were in a very small private school modeled on Sudbury Valley School for some years .
Eventually problems arose , we switched from school unschooling to home unschooling , and on the whole found it more satisfactory .
Hence the titles of these posts .

A History of the American People —
When our daughter was five , she was going to a local Montessori school .
Her mother thought she was ready to learn to read ; they did n't .
So Betty taught her to read , using Doctor Seuss books .
Our son , three years younger , observed the process and taught himself .
We heard about the local Sudbury school , new that year , brought our daughter over to visit .
She decided she preferred it to the Montessori school , so we shifted her .
A few years later we added her brother , a few years after that shifted to home schooling .
The Sudbury model includes classes if students want them .
When our daughter was about ten there was a class , lasting somewhat over a year , in math .
It started assuming the students knew nothing , ended with the early stages of algebra .
That is pretty much all of the formal instruction either of them had .
In addition , we required them to learn the multiplication tables , which are useful to know but boring to learn .
That , I think , was the closest thing to compulsory learning in their education .
How did they get educated ?
They both read a lot , and although some of the books they read were children 's books , pretty early they were also reading books intended for adults .
When our daughter was about nine we were traveling and ran out of books for her to read , so she read the Elizabeth Peters books her mother had brought along — and liked them .
A few years later our son , about eight , went everywhere carrying the big one volume edition of Betty remembered having liked and learned from -- actually about how not to be fooled by statistical arguments -- so we got a copy and both kids liked it .
Our son likes D&D and other games with dice rolling , so was interested in learning how to figure out the probability of getting various results .
It turned out that the same author and illustrator had produced a book on simple probability theory — so we got it and he read it multiple times .
The result was a ten year old ( I 'm guessing — we did n't keep records ) who could calculate the probability of rolling 6 or under with three six - sided dice .
For the last few years his hobby has been creating games .
At the Los Angeles World Science Fiction Convention he had an interesting and productive conversation with Steve Jackson of Steve Jackson games concerning a game Bill had invented ; currently one of his ambitions is to get a board game commercially published by age sixteen .
I am fond of evolutionary biology , so recommendedto my daughter .
She liked it , found the approach intriguing , and read other things .
Currently she is waiting for me to finishso that we can discuss it .
She also likes economics .
At this point she has audited four of the classes I teach at the law school , following them at the level of the better students .
She also has her own footnote in one of my articles , crediting her with a significant point she contributed to it .
Both kids spend a lot of time online .
We discovered that Bill had taught himself to type when the family was playing a networked game on the home network — or — and misspelled words started appearing on our screen .
He needed to type because he played games online and wanted to be able to communicate .
Later he wanted to learn how to spell so that he would n't look stupid to the people he was communicating with .
His sister spends a good deal of time on , some of it writing up battle reports and other essays to be posted on suitable web sites .
She too wants her writing to look good and so consults , usually with her mother , on how best to say things .
I am fond of poetry and know quite a lot of it .
When our daughter was little , I used it to put her to sleep .
Sometime thereafter we were driving somewhere at night and heard a small voice from the back seat reciting " Lars Porsena of Clusium , by the nine gods he swore " — the opening lines of " Horatius at the Bridge " — in a a two year old ’s lisp .
She now knows quite a lot more poetry .
When I put my son to bed — my wife and I take turns — we generally talk for a while , then he asks for some poems .
A few years back , I read and recommended to my daughter Duff Cooper 's excellent biography of Talleyrand .
She noticed the references to Talleyrand 's memoirs and decided that , since some of her writing involved politics , it would be interesting to learn about it from a world class practitioner .
I found her an English translation ; she is now part way through the first volume .
Some years ago our daughter decided she was seriously interested in music .
Since then she has participated regularly in two choirs -- one at her mother 's church , one specializing in early music -- and taken harp lessons .
She practices because she wants to , not because we make her .
She is thinking of majoring in music in college , then trying to get a job as an editor .
As some evidence of her qualifications , she has edited some of my manuscripts and done a useful job .
Our current plan is for her to do some volunteer proofreading for the firm that published my novel .
But the largest part of their education , after reading , is probably conversation .
We talk at meals .
We talk when putting one or the other of them to bed .
My daughter and I go for long walks at night and spend them discussing the novel I 'm writing or the characters she roleplays on Our most recent concern has been getting our daughter , now 17 , into college .
She does n't have grades , she does n't have a list of courses taken .
She does have a list of books read — still incomplete , but already in the hundreds .
Without grades she needed another way of convincing colleges of her ability , and standardized tests were the obvious solution .
She spent some time studying for the SAT exams , but enormously less than the time she would have put in on those subjects in any conventional school , did extremely well on the verbal , tolerably on the math ; her combined score is well within the range for the students at the very selective liberal arts colleges she plans to apply to .
Just to play safe she has now taken the SAT exams again , after spending a little more time on math , part of it solving pages of simple equations I produced for her .
To keep it interesting , I included a few that no value of X solved , a few that all values of X solved , and a few that reduced to 1/x=0 .
Many schools now require two of the SAT II achievement tests — again especially significant for a home schooled student .
It turns out that " literature " is not , as I feared , a test of what you have read but of how well you can read , and she reads very well .
For a second one she chose American history , read all of Paul Johnson ' swell written and opinionated , hence not boring — plus part of a book of primary source material .
She spent a good deal of time in the week before the exam using Wikipedia to compile her own time line of Presidents and what happened during their terms .
The results of both exams were satisfactory .
What is the result ?
Our daughter will enter college knowing much more about economics , evolutionary biology , music , renaissance dance , and how to write than most of her fellow students , probably less about physics , biology , world history , except where it intersects historical novels she has read or subjects that interest her .
She will know much more than most of them about how to educate herself .
And why .
“ I ’m a liberal whose children were mugged by the public schools , ” Mr. Stern said .
His history with the city ’s schools goes back to his childhood .
Just before World War II , Mr. Stern immigrated with his parents from what was then Palestine .
The family settled near Fordham Road in the Bronx , where Mr. Stern attended Public School 6 until eighth grade .
He went on to Stuyvesant High School and City College , and then started but did not finish a doctorate in political science at the University of California , Berkeley .

SOL STERN Senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute Credit ...
Chester Higgins Jr./ The New York Times
At Berkeley , he became entranced , he said , by the left - wing student movement and dropped out to write for the radical magazine Ramparts , gaining national attention .
One of his most famous articles included assertions that the Central Intelligence Agency had infiltrated the National Student Association , a group of student governments , as part of its Cold War strategy .
Like other neoconservatives , however , Mr. Stern began splitting with the left over the Middle East , reacting to what he saw as an anti-Israel philosophy .
In the early 1970s , he became curious about his family ’s history and returned to the renamed Israel for the first time since he was a toddler .
On that trip , Mr. Stern found himself “ falling in love with the country , ” he said , and he later met his wife in Jerusalem .
They moved back to New York City in the mid-70s , where Mr. Stern continued writing for several magazines and newspapers .
In the ’80s , he met the City Council president , Andrew Stein , through a mutual acquaintance and became his chief of staff .
Although he was involved in several political campaigns with Mr. Stein , who was a Democrat , Mr. Stern said he was never involved in the city ’s Democratic political circles .
And while his political views have gradually changed to what he calls “ somewhat traditionally conservative , ” Mr. Stern has remained a registered Democrat , partly out of “ inertia ” and the desire to have a vote in the primaries .
( He voted for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton last week and says he will probably vote for Senator John McCain in November . )
Mr. Stern prefers personal anecdotes to describe his political evolution .
While he was working for Mr. Stein , he was often able to take his children to school near their home on the Upper West Side .
One morning , he spotted a man he assumed was homeless wandering through the schoolyard .
“ He looked terrible  battered clothes , a worn shopping bag  just terrible , ” he said , grimacing at the memory .
Last year , while watching coverage of the Tour de France , Stephan M noticed something a little strange .
If he tilted his head by 90° and squinted just a bit , the profile maps showing the peaks and valleys of the mountain stage looked rather familiar .
They were just like the monstrous routines written by his predecessor - the very same coder behind the Quadrasort .
" Following is a stripped down version of an almost 700 LoC method in Java , " wrote Stephan , " I removed anything except the control flow statements , so that you can grasp the full beauty of this masterpiece .

More than two years before the CIA destroyed interrogation videotapes , top officials were urged to preserve them by a senior lawmaker who warned that disposing of the recordings would “ reflect badly on the agency . ”
The warning came in a February 2003 letter from Rep. Jane Harman of Venice , then the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee .
The letter was released publicly by Harman ’s office on Thursday , after its contents were declassified by the CIA , and one day after the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the destruction of the tapes .
The existence of Harman ’s letter had been reported ; but its precise contents , previously unrevealed , provide details on then - classified discussions between the CIA and senior members of Congress about the tapes and the agency ’s desire to get rid of them .

Harman wrote the letter after learning in a classified briefing that the CIA planned to destroy the tapes .
She urged the agency to reconsider .
“ Even if the videotape does not constitute an official record that must be preserved under the law , the videotape would be the best proof that the written record is accurate , if such record is called into question in the future , ” she wrote .
The letter was addressed to the CIA ’s general counsel at the time , Scott W. Muller .
Harman ’s letter refers to a classified briefing in which Muller told panel members that the CIA had used “ enhanced techniques ” in interrogating Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah .
Zubaydah , who was captured in Pakistan in 2002 , was subjected to interrogation methods including “ waterboarding , ” in which a prisoner is made to feel that he is drowning .
“ You discussed the fact that there is videotape of Abu Zubaydah following his capture that will be destroyed after the [ CIA ] inspector general finishes his inquiry , ” Harman wrote .
At the time , the inspector general ’s office was examining the detention and interrogation programs .

The advice that Muller and other administration lawyers offered on whether the tapes could be destroyed is likely to be a major avenue of inquiry for John H. Durham , the federal prosecutor named Wednesday to head the investigation .
Federal courts in Washington have ruled that government lawyers cannot assert the attorney - client privilege to avoid testifying in grand - jury and other proceedings about advice they gave .
Those rulings , which emerged during the myriad investigations of the Clinton administration , mean that Muller and other lawyers who once served on the Bush team , including former Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales and former White House Counsel Harriet E. Miers , would have to submit to questioning from Durham ’s task force .
Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics expert at New York University law school , said it would be hard to prosecute the lawyers themselves for their legal advice unless there was evidence that they had participated in or actively urged destruction of the tapes .

However , the lawyers had no independent obligation to take possession of the tapes to ensure that they be preserved , Gillers and other experts said .
Under federal law , it is obstruction of justice to destroy evidence that might be relevant not only to a pending official proceeding but to one that is reasonably foreseeable .
At the time the tapes were destroyed in late 2005 , Congress was already moving to broaden restrictions on the sort of aggressive interrogation techniques that the tapes portrayed .
“ Clearly , White House officials were involved in discussions regarding the disposition of the tapes , ” Harman said in a written statement Thursday .
She added that “ Congress needs to know why key committees may have been misled about their existence and not told they had been destroyed . ”
In her letter , Harman noted that Muller had assured members that the Justice Department and White House had sanctioned the legality of the detention and interrogation program .
But she questioned whether employing harsh methods was “ consistent with the principles and policies of the United States . ”

In a February 2003 letter responding to Harman -- also released Thursday by Harman ’s office -- Muller said he could not comment on administration deliberations but “ I think it would be fair to assume that policy as well as legal matters have been addressed within the executive branch . ”

Mr. McDermott has suggested that the convicted soldiers were “ victims of racial injustice . ”
The case could be the largest Army court - martial of World War II .
The largest court - martial of the war is thought to be that of 50 black sailors who were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to 15 years in prison for refusing to load ammunition aboard a ship at Port Chicago , a Navy depot 30 miles northeast of San Francisco .
The 28 soldiers in the Puget Sound case were stationed at Fort Lawton on Aug. 15 , 1944 , when Mr. Olivotto was found dead after a night of fighting among American and Italian soldiers on the base .
Some American soldiers — white and black — objected to what they saw as lenient treatment of the scores of Italian prisoners held there .
The 28 black soldiers were among 43 initially charged with rioting , but charges were dropped against 2 of the 43 and the other 13 were acquitted .
Two defense lawyers , representing all 43 initially charged , had 13 days to prepare for trial .
According to the board ’s ruling , they did not have full access to a confidential Army inspector general ’s report that Mr. Jaworski had seen , which suggested that evidence at the scene had been destroyed , and that white military policemen with animosity toward the Italians may have played a role in the riot .
“ Under military law as it stands today , people would laugh , ” said John Tait , an Army lawyer who reviewed the case for the board .
“ You do n’t have two people represent 43 people .
It just does n’t happen .
And when three people are charged with murder ?
No . ”
The board ’s decision instructs the Army to set aside Mr. Townsell ’s conviction , and to change his dishonorable discharge to honorable , making his family eligible to receive back pay .
Members of his family did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday .
The analysis used by the board in reaching its decision about Mr. Townsell would apply “ to anybody who was convicted in that court - martial , ” Mr. Tait said .
By popular demand , here is the original scene from Boston Legal instead of one posted earlier that had been ‘ doctored up ’ by images and word overlays :
By this means Svejk attempts to persuade the authorities that he is doing everything he can to get to the front , even if , to his enormous regret , his rheumatism prevents him from having his brains blown out .
By noisily volunteering to subject themselves to stricter standards , the corporations try to pre-empt the rules which might otherwise have been imposed on them .
This , they hope , will allow them to participate only when and how they see fit .
In Svejk 's case it did n't work .
His patriotism was rewarded with enemas and emetics until his rheumatism was miraculously cured .
The corporations , on the other hand , always seem to persuade the authorities of their undying commitment to the causes they espouse , which ensures that they can enter the war on their own terms .
This seems to be the way that the global campaign for road safety is going .
Death and injury on the roads is the world 's most neglected public health issue .
Almost as many people die in road accidents - 1.2 million a year - as are killed by malaria or tuberculosis .
Around 50 million are injured .
Some 85 % of these accidents take place in developing countries .
The poor get hurt much more often than the rich , as they walk or cycle or travel in overloaded buses .
The highest death rate is among children walking on the roads .
The annual economic cost to developing countries , in lost productivity alone , is $ 65 - $ 100bn , roughly the same as the amount they receive in foreign aid .
I caught a glimpse of the human cost when I was hospitalised in northern Kenya .
Some of the men on the ward had bullet or axe wounds inflicted in tribal wars , others were dying of HIV / Aids , but over half had been smashed up in road accidents .
They could not afford good painkillers , and sobbed and screamed through the night .
It looked like a scene from the first world war .
The problem is likely to become much worse .
By 2020 , according to the World Bank , deaths from road accidents are expected to fall by 28 % in rich nations but to rise by 83 % in poorer ones .
By 2030 , they will overtake the deaths caused by malaria .
But while $ 1.9bn of foreign aid will be spent on tackling malaria over the next five years , the annual global aid budget for road safety is less than $ 10 m .
This issue has been neglected partly because it is something the rich inflict on the poor , and partly because it is widely perceived as an unavoidable price of doing business - as the global transportation industry expands , so must its human costs .
Governments are just beginning to wake up to the problem .
But the corporations got there first .
In 1999 , at the invitation of the World Bank , the motor and oil companies joined something called the Global Road Safety Partnership .
It was supposed to bring together " governments and governmental agencies , the private sector and civil society organisations " .
But its executive committee contains no one from a civil society organisation and only two representatives of government .
BP , Total , DaimlerChrysler , General Motors , Michelin and Volvo , however , are all represented .
Professor Ian Roberts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine compared the prevalence of certain words in the partnership 's annual reports to their prevalence in a similar report written by the World Health Organisation .
In the partnership 's reports , he found a pattern of systematic neglect of pedestrians and cyclists .
In the WHO 's report , " speed limit " occurred 17 times in every 10,000 words ; in the partnership 's reports , just once .
" Pedestrian " was used 69 times by the WHO , and 15 times by the partnership ; " buses " and " cyclists " were mentioned 13 and 32 times respectively by the WHO , and not once by the partnership .
" Reclaiming the streets for walking and cycling , " he notes , " will not serve the interests of the car makers . "
Instead , the Global Road Safety Partnership emphasised better training for drivers and better safety education for children .
These measures do not interfere with the commercial interests of the transport industry .
Neither , according to peer - reviewed papers Prof Roberts cites , do they work .
The motor industry also appears to dominate the most prominent international body on road safety .
Three weeks ago , the racing driver Michael Schumacher wrote a column - quite a good one - for these pages to mark Global Road Safety Week .
He described himself as a member of the " independent Commission for Global Road Safety " .
The commission launched the Make Roads Safe campaign , which is modelled on Make Poverty History .
But how " independent " is it ?
It was established by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile Foundation , which is run by motoring and motorsports associations .
Of the eight commissioners , one is an executive of General Motors , one runs the Bridgestone Tyre Corporation , one is a trustee of the FIA Foundation , one is chairman of the FIA Foundation and a president of the Automobile Club of Italy and one is Michael Schumacher .
The commission 's secretary is the director general of the FIA Foundation .
Its report is better than the material published by the Global Road Safety Partnership .
There is more emphasis on speed limits , road design and traffic management .
But there are some odd gaps and contradictions .
It complains that " participation by middle - and low - income countries in the existing international road safety organisations ... is low " and that there is a " lack of ownership " of road safety programmes by the governments and people of developing countries .
So why do all its own members come from the G8 nations ?
The commission prescribes an " action plan " for global road safety , to be run by something called the Global Road Safety Facility .
This - surprise , surprise - also turns out to have been launched and partly funded by the FIA Foundation .
Most importantly , it calls for the developing nations to follow the path taken by richer countries in reducing deaths and injuries .
But at no point does it mention that much of this reduction was the result of cyclists and pedestrians being driven off the roads .
This is a much bigger issue for poor nations - where the great majority of people who use roads do not own cars - than for rich ones .
Is this the vision : that the space now used by pedestrians and cyclists and ox carts and rickshaws is surrendered to car drivers ?
If so , it might reduce fatalities , but it would also represent a classic act of enclosure , through which the rich are able to secure the resources of the poor .
Michael Schumacher is in danger of finding himself in the same position as Bob Geldof - a celebrity who claims to speak for the poor and weak but who is informed and guided by the powerful .
We need a global campaign on road safety , but it must belong to the people on whose behalf it acts .

More than 3.6 million workers have called in sick so far this week , a survey suggests .
A record one in eight staff has been laid low , with the winter vomiting bug , norovirus , cited as the main culprit .
Chronic coughs and colds have also seen workers take to their beds .
Health experts warn that sickness may soon reach pandemic levels with large swathes of the population being struck down .
Aaron Ross , of FirstCare , the absence management firm which produced the figures , said : " This is the worst period of sickness we have ever seen and it comes at a very bad time for employers .
" Most organisations wound down during the unusually long holiday period and they are experiencing real trouble starting up again .
" There has been a lot of press coverage surrounding the norovirus and people are being advised to stay at home for two days after the symptoms have stopped . "
Norovirus - which causes uncontrollable projectile vomiting - is said to be costing the economy £ 40 million a day in lost productivity .
One hundred hospital wards were closed to admissions last week in an attempt to halt the march of the virus , which is 100,000 times more infectious than salmonella .
Mr Ross said : " Wards are closed , shops and restaurants are limiting their activities , deliveries and service calls will be late .
" All of this will have a knock - on effect on those staff who are at work as they will be put under more pressure to cover absent colleagues .
" The extra stress and strain will , in turn , make these employees more susceptible to falling ill themselves . "
He said that 4 per cent of the employees covered by FirstCare had called in sick on Monday with a similar pattern seen yesterday .
" This is the closest thing to a pandemic that employers will have seen for years and it should be a wake up call for businesses that do n't have contingency plans for high sickness rates , " he added .
The spread of norovirus can be restricted by washing hands regularly and disinfecting much - used items , such as remote controls and telephones .
Other tips include ventilating a room after someone has been sick and not sharing towels , toothbrushes or cutlery .
Norovirus symptoms last for up to three days and it is contagious for another two days or so .
The very old , very young and those already seriously ill with other ailments risk complications from dehydration .
There is no treatment other than drinking plenty of liquid .
Mr Ross said the impact of norovirus showed that firms should prepare for even more serious illnesses such as bird flu .
He claimed that some of the absenteeism could be explained by stress brought on by the cost of the festive period .
" With Christmas credit card bills round the corner and a cold winter approaching we are likely to see continued high sickness rates , " he said .
" I recommend that businesses bring forward the pay day for January as well as December because it is a very long month .
" The weather also has a profound effect .
It has been a mild winter so far and that is why there have been so many coughs and colds - the weather has not been able to kill them off . "
U.S. CONCENTRATION CAMPS - FEMA AND THE REX 84 PROGRAM
President Regan signed Presidential Director Number 54 in April of 1984 that allowed FEMA to activate a secret national readiness exercise .
This exercise was given the code name REX 84 .
The purpose of the exercise was to test FEMA 's ability to assume military authority .
REX 84 was so highly guarded that special metal doors were installed on the fifth floor of the FEMA building in Washington , D.C.
The only people that were allowed to enter the premises were ones who had a red Christian cross on their shirt .
The exercise required the following ..... Suspension of the Constitution of the United States
Turning control of the government over to FEMA
Appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments
Declaration of Martial Law
So how much money goes into an organization like this ?
Well it has been discovered that FEMA has a quasi- billion dollar budget .
However , about 6 % of that budget goes into the relief effort .
So why is it that they need so much money ?
Ever wonder where the President goes when it 's said he is in a " secure location " ?
Well most of the time that location is a secret government complex built into a mountain .
It is called Mt. Weather .
There over 600 prison camps in the United States , all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners .
They are all staffed and even surrounded by full - time guards , but they are all empty .
These camps are to be operated by FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States .
The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a mass exodus of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican / US border , they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention lefts by FEMA .
Rex 84 allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons .
Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose .
Garden Plot is the program to control the population .
Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government .
FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations .
The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation .
The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities .
Many also have an airport nearby .
The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners .
Currently , the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks , Alaska .
The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people .
A person named Terry Kings wrote an article on his discoveries of camps
located in southern California .
His findings are as follows :
Over the last couple months several of us have investigated three soon - to - be prison camps in the Southern California area .
We had heard about these sites and wanted to see them for ourselves .
The first one we observed was in Palmdale , California .
It is not operating as a prison at the moment but is masquerading as part of a water facility .
Now why would there be a facility of this nature out in the middle of nowhere with absolutely no prisoners ?
The fences that run for miles around this large facility all point inward , and there are large mounds of dirt and dry moat surrounding the central area so the inside area is not visible from the road .
There are 3 large loading docks facing the entrance that can be observed from the road .
What are these massive docks going to be loading ?
We observed white vans patrolling the area and one came out and greeted us with a friendly wave and followed us until we had driven safely beyond the area .
What would have happened had we decided to enter the open gate or ask questions ?
This facility is across the street from the Palmdale Water Department .
The area around the Water Department has fences pointing outward , to keep people out of this dangerous area so as not to drown .
Yet , across the street , the fences all point inward .
Why ?
To keep people in ?
What people ?
Who are going to be its occupants ?
There are also signs posted every 50 feet stating : State of California Trespassing Loitering Forbidden By Law Section 555 California Penal Code .
The sign at the entrance says : Pearblossom Operations and Maintenance Subleft Receiving Department , 34534 116th Street East .
There is also a guard shack located at the entrance .
We didnt venture into this facility , but did circle around it to see if there was anything else visible from the road .
We saw miles of fences with the top points all directed inward .
There is a railroad track that runs next to the perimeter of this fenced area .
The loading docks are large enough to hold railroad cars .
I wonder what they are planning for this facility ?
They could easily fit 100,000 people in this area .
And who would the occupants be ?
Another site is located in Brand Park in Glendale .
There are newly constructed fences ( all outfitted with new wiring that point inward ) .
The fences surround a dry reservoir .
There are also new buildings situated in the area .
We questioned the idea that there were four armed military personnel walking the park .
Since when does a public park need armed guards ?
A third site visited was in the San Fernando Valley , adjacent to the Water District .
Again , the area around the actual Water District had fences logically pointing out ( to keep people out of the dangerous area ) .
And the rest of the adjacent area which went on for several miles was ringed with fences and barbed wire facing inward ( to keep what or who in ? )
Also , interesting was the fact that the addition to the tops of the fences were fairly new as to not even contain any sign of rust on them .
Within the grounds was a huge building that the guard said was a training range for policemen .
There were newly constructed roads , new gray military looking buildings , and a landing strip .
For what ?
Police cars were constantly patrolling the several mile perimeter of the area .
From the parking lot of the Odyssey Restaurant a better view could be taken of the area that was hidden from site from the highway .
There was an area that contained about 100 black boxes that looked like railroad cars .
We had heard that loads of railroad cars have been manufactured in Oregon outfitted with shackles .
Would these be of that nature ?
From our position it was hard to determine .
In searching the Internet , I have discovered that there are about 600 of these prison sites around the country ( and more literally popping up overnight do they work all night ) .
They are manned , but yet do not contain prisoners .
Why do they need all these non-operating prisons ?
What are they waiting for ?
We continuously hear that our current prisons are overcrowded and they are releasing prisoners because of this situation .
But what about all these facilities ?
What are they really for ?
Why are there armed guards yet no one to protect themselves against ?
And what is going to be the kick - off point to put these facilities into operation ?
What would bring about a situation that would call into effect the need for these new prison facilities ?
A man -made or natural catastrophe ?
An earthquake , panic due to Y2 K , a massive poisoning , a panic of such dimensions to cause nationwide panic ?
Once a major disaster occurs ( whether it is a real event or manufactured event does not matter ) Martial Law is hurriedly put in place and we are all in the hands of the government agencies ( FEMA ) who thus portray themselves as our protectors .
Yet what happens when we question those in authority and how they are taking away all of our freedoms ?
Will we be the ones detained in these camp sites ?
And who are they going to round up ?
Those with guns ?
Those who ask questions ?
Those that want to know whats really going on ?
Does that include any of us ?
The seekers of truth ?
When first coming across this information I was in a state of total denial .
How could this be ?
I believed our country was free , and always felt a sense of comfort in knowing that as long as we didnt hurt others in observing our freedom we were left to ourselves .
Ideally we treated everyone with respect and honored their uniqueness and hoped that others did likewise .
It took an intensive year of searching into the hidden politics to discover that we are as free as we believe we are .
If we are in denial , we dont see the signs that are staring at us , but keep our minds turned off and busy with all the mundane affairs of daily life .
We just dont care enough to find out the real truth , and settle for the hand - fed stories that come our way over the major media sources television , radio , newspaper , and magazines .
But its too late to turn back to the days of blindfolds and hiding our heads in the sand because the reality is becoming very clear .
The time is fast approaching when we will be the ones asking " What happened to our freedom ?
To our free speech ?
To our right to protect ourselves and our family ?
To think as an individual ?
To express ourselves in whatever way we wish ? "
Once we challenge that freedom we find out how free we really are .
How many are willing to take up that challenge ?
Very few indeed , otherwise we wouldnt find ourselves in the situation that we are in at the present time .
We wouldnt have let things progress and get out of the hands of the public and into the hands of those that seek to keep us under their control no matter what it takes , and that includes the use of force and detainment for those that ask the wrong questions .
Will asking questions be outlawed next ?
Several instances have recently been reported where those that were asking questions that came too near the untold truth ( the cover up ) were removed from the press conferences and from the publics ear .
Also , those that wanted to speak to the press were detained and either imprisoned , locked in a psychiatric hospital , slaughtered ( through make - believe suicides ) or discredited .
Why are we all in denial over these possibilities ?
Didnt we hear about prison camps in Germany , and even in the United States during World War II ?
Japanese individuals were rounded up and placed in determent camps during the duration of the War .
Where was their freedom ?
You dont think it could happen to you ?
Obviously those rounded up and killed didnt think it could happen to them either .
How could decent people have witnessed such atrocities and still said nothing ?
Are we going to do the same here as they cart off one by one those individuals who are taking a stand for the rights of the citizens as they expose the truth happening behind the scenes ?
Are we all going to sit there and wonder what happened to this country of ours ?
Where did we go wrong ?
How could we let it happen ?
At $ 1 billion , assuming MySQL 's current revenue is optimistically set at $ 100 million annually , Sun paid a multiple of 10 times sales for MySQL today .
Optimistically assuming a 20 % profit margin , they are looking at a multiple of 50 times earnings for a return on investment of around 2 % per year .
Optimistically .
Few people get rich making equity investments at less than half the rate of return of an average money market fund .
I do n't know how Sun financed the deal , but if they leveraged it at all , there is a good chance they will be losing money out of the gate with this investment .
Maybe for a company with a rock solid balance sheet and a record of extracting maximum value from their acquisitions , this deal might make some sense .
JAVA does n't meet either of those criteria .
But wait , there 's more .
If Sun 's customers plan to extract an enterprise level of functionality from MySQL , they basically have no option but to use the InnoDB storage engine to underpin the SQL front end .
And guess who owns that .
That 's right , Oracle , the 800 lbs gorilla of the SQL market .
The rocket science ain't in the SQL parser .
It 's in the storage layer , and that did n't come with the $ 1 billion price tag .
BTW , the J2EE 6 installer blew up on us when we tried to install it on Linux x86_64 , and judging by their own news groups , we 're not alone .
Mr. Schwartz , for a mere $ 1 million I 'll get that working for you , and you 'll get your platform back .
It 's one hell of a deal if you think about it .
Cirque du Soleil is , without a doubt the most amazing circus on the planet .
They find the most incredible performers on earth and assemble them on stage for shows that literally defy description and leave audiences gasping and begging for more .
I ’ve seen a number of Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas as well as in various cities when they travel .
The bad news is that tickets normally run around $ 100 per person , and you have to buy them well in advance to get great seats .
The good news is , you ’ll never see anything cooler in your life , so the shows are worth every penny they charge .
The even better news is that I ’ve assembled 13 great acts here for you to see without having to pay to do it !
This clip is from Cirque Du Soleil ’s 25th Anniversary
This is insane !
This guy is literally risking DEATH with every performance !
If anyone knows his name , or more specific info about this clip please share !
Elena Lev ’s hula hoops show from Alegria
These types of contortions hurt just to watch , so how can she be simultaneously working a hula hoop ?
Reminds me of Kristina Kireeva the sexy contortionist .

How impossible is this ?
Well , can YOU swim backwards ?
The Wheel of Death from Ka
If just one guy risking life and limb is n’t enough , here are 5 of them doing it simultaneously !

What we want you to do see… is get a couple of guys to hold a pole on their shoulders , then we want you to climb up on the middle of it and do backflips .
That should n’t be a problem right ? ”
The Jump Rope act from Quidam
Only Cirque du Soleil could take something as mundane as jumping rope and make it exciting .
The Fire Juggler from Alegria
I ’ve seen some fire juggling in Hawaii , but never like this …
The Ladder Act from Corteo
Most people do n’t even want to climb up a ladder , much less dance all over stage and do stunts on one .
This is insane !

Chipmaker Intel has been granted a further short extension to respond to antitrust charges leveled by the European Commission , an Intel spokesman said on Friday .
REUTERS / Claro Cortes IV
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Chipmaker Intel INTC.O has been granted a further short extension to respond to antitrust charges leveled by the European Commission , an Intel spokesman said on Friday .
The response had been due on Friday but Intel will file instead on Monday , January 7 , the spokesman told Reuters .
The Commission in July , 2007 , charged Intel with slashing prices below cost and offering huge rebates in an illegal attempt to drive smaller competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD .N out of the market .
Intel says it has followed the law .
The Commission originally gave Intel until October 8 to respond but extended that to January 4 .
That was then followed by the further extension on Friday .
The Commission is the EU ’s antitrust watchdog and has powers to fine companies up to 10 percent of their global annual revenues for competition abuses .

Rupert Murdoch is muscling in on software giant Microsoft 's takeover plans for internet search engine Yahoo ! , it was revealed today .
The News Corporation chairman is in talks over merging his MySpace social networking site and other online businesses with Yahoo ! to help the firm beat off Microsoft 's approach , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Microsoft wants to buy Yahoo ! to offer a greater challenge to Google 's online dominance , with News Corporation also said to be keen on a deal with Yahoo ! for the same reason .
Scroll down for more ...
Yahoo !
rejected Microsoft 's initial $ 44.6 billion ( £ 22.6 bn ) approach on Monday .
News Corporation - which was unavailable for comment - and an unnamed private equity firm would pump cash into Yahoo !
in return for a stake of more than 20 per cent of the business , according to the report .
The plans could put News Corporation 's weight behind Yahoo !
- offering a platform to distribute its news as well as thwarting Microsoft 's growth plans .
A tie -up would represent the latest expansion of Mr Murdoch 's media empire following his $ 5 bn ( £ 2.37 bn ) acquisition of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones last year .
He bought MySpace for $ 580 million ( £ 294.2 ) in 2005 .
Yahoo ! has already rejected Microsoft's £ 22 billion takeover bid , saying it " substantially undervalued " the company .
Microsoft made the surprise offer for the internet search engine ten days ago .
The Yahoo ! board concluded the £ 15 - per - share proposal was not in the best interests of its shareholders .
It said the bid " substantially undervalues " Yahoo !'s global strength .
Some Wall Street analysts believe the rejection of the initial offer is an attempt to get Microsoft to raise its bid .
Analysts said Microsoft could be persuaded to increase its offer to as much as £ 20 a share .
However , Yahoo !
is understood to have restarted merger talks with AOL as a means of defending itself against Microsoft 's hostile approach .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Diets high in protein may be the best way to keep hunger in check , U.S. researchers said on Thursday in a study that offers insight into how diets work .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
They found that protein does the best job at keeping a hunger hormone in check , while carbohydrates and fats may well deserve their current nasty reputation .
The study , which will appear in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism , looked at the effectiveness of different nutrients at suppressing ghrelin , a hormone secreted by the stomach that stimulates appetite .
“ Suppression of ghrelin is one of the ways that you lose your appetite as you begin to eat and become sated , ” said Dr. David Cummings of the University of Washington in Seattle , who worked on the study .
The researchers gave 16 people three different beverages , each with varying levels of carbohydrates , fats , and proteins .
They took blood samples before the first beverage , then every 20 minutes for six hours afterward , measuring ghrelin levels in each sample .
“ The interesting findings were that fats suppress ghrelin quite poorly , ” Cummings said in a telephone interview .
They fared the poorest overall .
“ Proteins were the best suppressor of ghrelin in terms of the combination of the depth and duration of suppression , ” he said .
“ That is truly satisfying because high proteins are essentially common to almost all of the popular diets . ”
They also found that eating carbohydrates resulted in a strong ghrelin suppression at first , but ghrelin levels rebounded with a vengeance , rising to an even higher level .
Basically , the carbohydrates eventually made people even hungrier than before they had eaten .
Cummings said the findings may aid in future research on the effectiveness of different diets .
And the study likely means that nightly bowl of ice cream is out .
“ That is a bad idea no matter what , ” he said .
“ Then it gets interesting , ” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , who is no longer a presidential candidate but retains a voice as a superdelegate .
At the Democratic National Convention in August , there would be 796 superdelegates , assuming the convention sustains the national party ’s penalties against Florida and Michigan for moving their primaries earlier in the year .
In total , there are 4,049 Democratic delegates ; to win the nomination , a candidate must secure 2,025 of them .
The superdelegates are the target of something of an invisible primary as the rival campaigns woo them for endorsements , for the political connections such public backing can bring and for their actual support at the convention , should it be needed .
The superdelegates can also be influenced by the primaries .
An aide to Senator Barbara Boxer of California said Ms. Boxer would cast her superdelegate vote for the winner of the California primary on Feb .
5 .
Superdelegates were created after the 1980 election and were intended to restore some of the power over the nomination process to party insiders , keeping a lid on the zeal of party activists .
They immediately came in handy for Mr. Mondale in his 1984 presidential bid , when they gave him a cushion over the upstart campaign of Gary Hart .
Since 1984 , they have constituted 15 to 20 percent of the delegates at Democratic conventions , where they have historically supported the front - runner .
Much US cash for reconstruction in Iraq has gone astray
Stuart Bowen , special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction , and his team are the focus of four probes , among them one by the FBI , US media reports .
His office has been accused of waste and overspending , allegations now being presented to a US grand jury .
Mr Bowen said no current member of his team was accused of acting illegally .
The investigations focused on allegations of overspending and mismanagement , and claims that staff 's e-mails had been monitored , the Washington Post reported , citing law enforcement sources and staff members from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) .
Both Mr Bowen and a spokeswoman for SIGIR sought to play down reports .
" No current SIGIR official has been notified that he or she is the subject or target of any such investigation , " Mr Bowen told the Post by e-mail .
Mr Bowen 's agency has been at the forefront of efforts to highlight inefficiencies and fraud in the $ 22bn ( £ 11 bn ) project to rebuild Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The office has been widely praised for its work .
Among its key findings was a verdict , delivered in July , asserting that corruption and mismanagement in Iraq amounted to a " second insurgency " .

We like to think they have mischief rather than maths on their minds .
But monkeys , it seems , are a whizz at mental arithmetic .
Research shows that the creatures are almost as good as humans at doing sums in their heads , adding up numbers with amazing accuracy .
Faced with 40 addition problems , two rhesus macaque monkeys scored nearly as well as a group of college students .
Scroll down for more ...
The researchers , from Duke University in North Carolina in the U.S. , described the results as " striking " .
They said : " We know that animals can recognise quantities but there is less evidence for their ability to carry out explicit mathematical tasks , such as addition .
Our study shows that they can . "
They started by training two female monkeys , named Feinstein and Boxer , to do simple sums .
The creatures were placed in front of a computer screen and watched while two sets of dots flashed up .
They were then presented with two more sets of dots enclosed in boxes , one of which represented the sum of the first two sets of dots and one representing a different number .
For example , they could have been shown two dots and four dots , followed by a choice of six dots - the right answer - or eight dots - the wrong answer .
Every time they made the right choice , they were rewarded with some fruit juice .
The monkeys quickly grasped the concept and were soon pitted against the college students .
Both monkeys and people were then given 40 simple addition sums to solve .
In the case of the monkeys , the problems were all ones they had n't seen before .
The monkeys picked the right answer 76 per cent of the time .
The students managed a 94 per cent success rate , the journal PLoS Biology reports .
The study follows recent research showing chimps can beat humans in a memory test .
US whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg raps those aware of Bush 's violations of the Constitution , saying they should speak out and save lives .
" When they keep silent about their knowledge of that situation , they are themselves violating their oath to support and defend the Constitution , " Ellsberg said in an interview with City Pages .
Advising such people to reveal truths that might save an untold number of lives , the former military analyst explained that there is a high possibility of new military adventurism in the Middle East .
" Do n't wait till bombs are falling in Iran or a new war is started wrongly or thousands more people have died when you know that your bosses are lying the public into a wrongful war or committing other crimes or violating the constitution , " said the former Pentagon official .
According to Ellsberg , there is a good chance that Bush will wage war on Iran in the next year .
" I think that the risk remains significant , and indeed the fact that the President is n't running again for office may free him in his mind , " he explained .
Daniel Ellsberg , who shocked the world in 1971 by disclosing 7,000 classified pages of a Defense Department report , revealed the existence of a much deeper battle in Vietnam than the public was aware of .
玄関のドアや窓に鍵をかける、個人情報の漏洩を恐れてシュレッダーを使う、ウイルス対策ソフトウェアをインストールする。そんなことはたいてい誰もがやっている。なのにいつものネットサーフィンで、果たして今使っているブラウザは安全なのか、個人情報は守られているのか、そうしたことをちょっとでも考えてみようとしないのはどうしてだろう。不埒な輩がどこぞのWebサイトを利用して、あなたのコンピュータからデータを少しずつ拾い集める、あるいはスパイウェアをそっと忍び込ませる、そんなことが残念ながら簡単にできてしまう。悪くすると、どこかのサイトを何気なくクリックするだけで、個人データがどうにも嬉しくないやり方で精査される、実際そんなことが起こるのである。
さて 、Mozilla Firefoxで はPreferencesペインからセキュリティ関係の設定をいくつか調節できるが、そのほかプライバシーとセキュリティに関する150以上のエクステンションも用意されている。それらは簡単にインストールでき、セットアップもさほど時間がかからない。中にはブラウザを再起動するだけで自動的に有効になるものもある。特に人気があって役に立つものを紹介しよう。
コンピュータを保護する最善策の1つはWebサイトのJavaScriptを無断で使うことをブラウザに禁ずることだ。JavaScriptは派手なWebサイトを開発する向きに好まれるが、疑うことを知らないコンピュータに悪さをする一法となっているのは周知の事実といってよい。
NoScript は、JavaScriptを使うサイトでスクリプトの実行前に必ず許可を求めるようにさせるエクステンションである。JavaScriptを多用するサイトがNoScriptによって読めなくなることもあるが、JavaScriptを許可するサイトを簡単に登録できるホワイトリスト機能があり、それを利用すればネットサーフィンが滞ることもない。
Torは、オンラインサーフィンにおける行動パターンを隠すために多くの人々に使われている。TorをFirefoxから利用可能にする
FoxTor にはブラウザの偽装をいつでもオン/オフできる機能があり、ブラウジングセッション中ずっと匿名サーフィンを押し通さなくても済む。ただし、TorとPrivoxyを併用する必要がある。
ブラウザの履歴ログはよりスピーディなネットサーフィンを実現してくれる。だが、腕のいいハッカーは遠方からログを覗き見て、あなたがどこにいたか知ることができる。ブラウジングセッションを終えるたびにログ情報を削除するのは速度の面で難があるが、幸い別のやり方がある。データを削除するのではなく、
SafeHistory で隠せばよい。
インターネット上では電子メールを通じて特に機密性の高い情報が流れるので、メッセージを暗号化して送信することを希望する人が少なからずいる。
Gmail S/MIME は添付ファイルも含 めGmailメッセージを暗号化するエクステンションだ。この暗号化は、メールを受け取る側のデジタル証明書さえ持っていれば自動的に行われる。
Firefox 2には固有のフィッシング保護機構が用意されているが、だからといって代替策を用いても別に問題はない。
Petname の背後にある前提は単純だ。信頼してよ いWebサイトに覚え書きのメモを残しておき、そこを訪れるたびにメモが自動的に表示されるようにするというものだ。ネットサーフィン中に訪れたサイトが確かホワイトリストに載せてあるサイトのような気がしても、覚え書きのメモが表示されなければ何かが正しくないと気づく、という次第である。フィッシング保護機構のない古いFirefoxを使用している人には特に有用なエクステンションだろう。
SecurePasswordGenerator は名前の長さに反して小振りなエクステンションである。ツールバーに鎮座し、ユニークなパスワードの作成を助けてくれる。Webサイトで登録手続きをするとき複雑で風変わりなパスワードを使えば、ネットワーク接続の安全対策の半分は終わったも同然だ。このツールを使うと、訪れた先で常にユニークなパスワードを作ることができる。
オンラインフォームに入力した情報は送信ボタンを押したときどこへ送られるのか。そんなことが気になったことはないだろうか？
FormFox は、これを教えてくれる。このエクステンションをダウンロードして有効にした後、フォームや検索ボックスのデータフィールド上にマウスポインタを合わせると、入力した情報を誰が受け取るのか、ずばり明らかとなる。休日にオンラインショッピングを楽しむとき、よく知らないWebサイトでは、名前、住所、クレジットカード情報などを気前よく入力しないで、まずはこのエクステンションでチェックしよう。
インターネットでは多くの人がスパム対策として使い捨てのその場限りのメールアドレスを使用している。スパムは一般にセキュリティ問題というよりも迷惑行為と捉えられているが、本当のアドレスよりも使い捨てのアドレスを使用した方が安全なことが間々ある（たとえば、メッセージフォーラムなど）。一時メールサービスはいくつかあって、その中のどれかを使うわけだが、Firefoxエクステンションの
TrashMail.net は、このサービスを魅力的な選択肢としてくれる。
周囲の詮索好きな人の目から情報を守りたいことがある。たとえば、空港や喫茶店でネットサーフィンをしているとき、開いているタブのタイトルを通りすがりの人に見られる可能性がある。
Page Title Eraser は、ブラウザのタブに表示されるタイトルやアイコンを消すか、別の適当なテキストに置き換えることができる。
プライバシーを守るべく努力している人にとって、Webサイトを訪れている間に行動データ（どこをクリックしたか、ページをどれくらい見ていたか、等々）が収集されるのは何とか避けたいものである。このデータ収集はプロファイリングと呼ばれる。ビデオゲームのインストール方法に関する記事を読むのにどれほど時間をかけたかというようなデータをサイトが追跡記録しても別に害はないが、ネットサーフィンの行動パターンに関してWebサイトが何かを知る理由は特にないはずと誰もが感じている。それがマーケティングの目的に限ってのデータ収集であってもだ。
検索エンジンによるデータプロファイリングを阻止するためによく使われる多くのエクステンションやツールは情報を第三者から見えないようにすることでその機能を実現している。
TrackMeNot は、これと正反対のアプローチを取り、意外なるかな検索エンジンに大量の情報を送り付けて処理させる。無論、大部分は偽の情報であるため、検索活動は相変わらず外部から見えず、検索エンジンがそこから意味のあるデータを探り出すことにはならない。
以上 、Firefoxのプライバシーとセキュリティに関するエクステンションを紹介したが、これはほんの一部に過ぎない。MozillaのWebサイトを訪れると、もっと多くのエクステンションを見つけることができる。こうしたツールはネットサーフィンをより安全なものにしてくれるが、絶対安全なツールなど存在しないことを肝に銘じていただきたい。有能なハッカーが頑張れば、あなたのシステムから情報を抜き取る方法をまだ見つけることができるだろう。一時たりとも注意を怠らぬよう。

The prophetic AJ Jacobs , who wrote the inspiring “ My Outsourced Life ” for Esquire back in 2005 , has gone prophetic .
A huge fan of radical lifestyle experiments , he has already read all 33,000 pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica , experimented with Radical Honesty for an article called “ I Think You ’re Fat ” … even pretended to be his nanny online to try to find her a boyfriend .
Now he ’s done the ultimate .
As an agnostic New Yorker , he attempted to follow every rule of the Bible literally for an entire year .
I read an advanced copy of his new book , The Year of Living Biblically , this past July , and it blew my mind .
It is AMAZING .
Now it ’s finally out , and I ’m allowed to talk about it .
I learned more about religion in this book than in all previous books combined , and I laughed so hard I almost got kicked out of two airports .
Here ’s a Q&A with my friend AJ on his incredible experience :
You call yourself an “ agnostic Jew ” in the book .
Why did you even decide to do this ?
What could the possible benefit be ?
This was my most radical experiment yet .
It affected everything I did : the way I ate , talked , dressed , thought , and touched my wife .
I did it because I wanted to see if I was missing anything .
And I have to say , the benefits were huge .
I ’ve carried over a lot of thinking and behavior from my Year of Living Biblically .
Even if you are n’t particularly religious ( in fact , even if you ’re a diehard atheist ) , I believe there are lessons to be learned from the Bible and a biblical lifestyle .
What was hardest for you ?
Two types of rules were hardest for me .
First , there was avoiding the sins we commit every day : no lying , no gossiping , no coveting .
I ’m a journalist in New York .
That ’s like 70 percent of my day .
The second type of difficult rules were those that will get you into trouble if you follow them in modern - day America .
For instance , the Old Testament rule that you should stone adulterers .
Luckily , I was able to stone one adulterer .
I was in the park dressed in my biblical garb ( white clothes , a beard , sandals , walking stick ) and a man came up to me and asked why I was dressed so strangely .
He seemed hostile right from the start .
I explained to him my project .
And he said “ I ’m an adulterer .
Are you going to stone me ? ” I said , “ That would be great . ”
I took out a handful of pebbles , because the Bible never specifies the size of the stones .
This man actually grabbed the stones from my hand and chucked them at my face .
I felt I had the right to retaliate , so I tossed a pebble at him .
And in that way I stoned .
Do you think many people are misguided in their “ creed over deed ” mentality ?
[ Note from Tim : “ Creed over deed ” refers to people who value religious belief more than moral behavior .
“ Deed over creed ” would be the opposite . ]
I would n’t say misguided .
But I ’d say most of us do underestimate the power that behavior has to shape thought .
It ’s astounding .
I watched it happen to myself .
For instance , I forced myself to stop gossiping , and eventually I started to have fewer petty thoughts to gossip about .
I forced myself to help the needy , and found myself becoming less self - absorbed .
I never became Ghandi or Angelina Jolie , but I made some strides .
I even watched it happen with prayer .
After a year of praying , I started to believe there ’s something to the idea of sacredness .
It was remarkable .
So if you want to become someone different , just start acting like the person you want to be .
It ’s like that business motto “ fake it till you make it , ” but it works on a spiritual and ethical level as well .
Even with my wardrobe , I saw how the outer affects the inner .
There ’s a line in the Bible that says “ your garments should always be white . ”
I decided to take that literally , and walked around in white clothes .
It affected my mood .
I felt happier , lighter .
Clothes make the man .
I felt I could n’t be in a bad mood if I looked like I was about to play the semi-finals at Wimbledon .
What were some of the greatest benefits of following rules to the letter , and what are the things that have stuck with you since ending the experiment ?
It was fascinating .
I ’d always loved freedom of choice .
It ’s why I went to a loosey - goosey liberal arts college with no core requirements .
But this experiment was all about freedom FROM choice .
Or at least a minimal - choice lifestyle .
I had a set structure : Should I read the gossip magazine about Cameron Diaz ’s latest sex romp ?
No .
Should I give 10 percent of my money to the needy ?
Yes .
Should I turn off my email on the Sabbath ( as both the Bible and Tim Ferriss recommend ) ?
Yes .
In fact , there was something Ferriss - esque about the entire way of living .
It reminded me of your low - information diet , for instance .
In some ways , it was a huge time - saver .
What would you call yourself now ?
I ’d call myself a “ reverent agnostic . ”
Whether or not there is a God , I believe there ’s something to the idea of sacredness .
Rituals can be sacred .
The Sabbath can be sacred .
And there ’s an importance to that .
I ’d also say that I ’m a fan of cafeteria spirituality .
During my experiment , I learned that you cannot follow the entire Bible .
It ’s impossible .
You must pick and choose .
Everyone does it , whether they admit it or not .
Otherwise , we ’d end up stoning adulterers on the street .
Some call this “ cafeteria religion , ” and it ’s meant as a disparaging phrase .
But I say :
There is nothing wrong with cafeterias !
I ’ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
I ’ve also had some turkey tetrazzini that made me dry heave .
The key is to chose the right dishes , the ones about compassion and tolerance , and leave the ones about hatred and intolerance on the side .
So in my year , there was this amazing balance between choosing your religion , which then leads to fewer decisions on a daily basis .
And finally , I ’d call myself a reformed individualist .
I still see the value of individualism , but I ’ve taken it down a few notches .
As one of my spiritual advisers told me , you can look at life in one of two ways :
As a series of rights and entitlements , or as a series of responsibilities .
The biblical way is to look at it as a series of responsibilities , to your family and to your society .
It ’s like the JFK quote , ask not what your country ( or world ) can do for you , ask what you can do for your country ( or world ) .
What was the hardest for your wife to put up with ?
Well , my wife ’s a saint .
At one point , I built a biblical hut in our living room , and she did n’t appreciate the construction project in our apartment .
Also , the Bible says not to touch women during that time of the month .
Even more strictly , though , it says you should n’t sit in a seat where an “ impure ” woman has sat .
My wife did n’t like that , so in retaliation , she sat on every seat in our apartment .
I was forced to do a lot of standing that year .
—
Do yourself a favor , whether you ’re a bible beater or a beret - wearing atheist , and go get AJ ’s book .
I put more notes in this book than any book in recent memory .
IMPORTANT :
And remember , you do n’t need to be religious to “ tithe ” like AJ .
In fact , you can change the world from your keyboard right now and help me build this school in Nepal for hundreds of children .
The top 10 donors ( you can donate more than once ) get the school dedicated to them on a plaque at the door , and we can all go visit it within a year .
Everest base camp , anyone ?
Here is a glimpse of the wonder that is Nepal if you need a few reasons or want to start planning .
For those of you keeping track , this blog has already successfully funded a school in Vietnam this month , and I ’m planning on visiting it in 2008 .
Life is short and you are fortunate — give hard !

Three huge wind turbines have been installed on the Galapagos Islands .
They will generate a total of 2.4 megawatts for the 30,000 residents of the Galapagos archipelago ’s five inhabited islands .
The system will meet 60 to 80 percent of electrical demand during the windy months of October , November and December .
The turbines will halve the island ’s diesel fuel imports , and pave the way for further renewable energy development .
The wind turbines were installed to help celebrated the 500th anniversary of the Galapagos ’ Islands discovery .
Ecuador ’s President Rafael Correa launched a program to end the use of fossil fuels on the Galapagos by 2015 .
You can read all about it here .
The initiative is being led by the San Cristobal Wind Project , which erected the three wind turbines near the town of El Progresso on San Cristobal Island .
The wind farm is on the island that suffered the worst oil spill in the history of the Galapagos – the spill resulting from the grounding of the tanker “ Jessica ” at the entrance to the harbor at Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on January 16 , 2001 .
The turbines started supplying power to San Cristobal last October .
Project partners will formally dedicate the wind turbines at a celebration in the Galapagos on March 18 .
Here ’s a view from the top of one of the turbines :

A recent study by the University of Michigan has concluded that repeated exposure to violent television and video games is a stronger influence on aggressive behavior than is living in poverty , engaging in substance abuse or having abusive parents .
According to Brad Bushman , a professor of psychology and communications studies and a research associate at the University 's Institute for Social Research , the correlation between media violence and aggression is stronger than the link between condom use and reduced risk of HIV , or between second - hand smoke and lung cancer .
" Playing video games , particularly first - person shooter games , may be much more dangerous than watching violent television shows or movies , " Bushman said .
Bushman has been studying the effect of media violence on aggressive behavior alongside social psychologist L. Rowell Huesmann at the University since 2003 .
Huesmann has himself focused on the issue at the university since 1992 , when he began contributing to a study that has now tracked the same group of children for four generations to see how aggressive behavior develops from childhood through adulthood .
Huesmann asserts that the level of media violence has changed since the study began , becoming increasingly graphic , even in shows aimed at children .
However , Bushman highlighted first - person shooter games as the worst offenders .
" Playing games is highly active , and it requires players to identify with violent characters , " Bushman say .
" It also rewards aggression , and the amount of violence is almost continuous .
" According to Huesmann , watching violence also " primes " aggressive scripts and beliefs , heightening excitement while lowering actual emotional response .
Said Huesmann , " A high and steady diet of TV violence in early childhood increases the risk that both females and males from all social backgrounds will become violent , aggressive adults .
Media violence can affect any child from any family , not just children who are already violence - prone . "

This modder decided to break away from traditional design and go with a futuristic custom - built case .
Cooling definitely is n’t a problem .
Hit the jump to view more pictures .
Gov. Elliot Spitzer explains :
Predatory lending was widely understood to present a looming national crisis .
This threat was so clear that as New York attorney general , I joined with colleagues in the other 49 states in attempting to fill the void left by the federal government .
Individually , and together , state attorneys general of both parties brought litigation or entered into settlements with many subprime lenders that were engaged in predatory lending practices .
Several state legislatures , including New York 's , enacted laws aimed at curbing such practices .
That sounds good .
I witnessed such practices and saw prices skyrocket before my eyes .
That was a huge reason that the Bush economy held up as long as it did --- I think Bush called it the " ownership society . "
I guess we can call it the foreclosure society ....
The right wingers usually try to say that we blame Bush for everything .
Well , let 's see how he did , shall we ...
Not only did the Bush administration do nothing to protect consumers , it embarked on an aggressive and unprecedented campaign to prevent states from protecting their residents from the very problems to which the federal government was turning a blind eye .
The administration accomplished this feat through an obscure federal agency called the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) .
The OCC has been in existence since the Civil War .
Its mission is to ensure the fiscal soundness of national banks .
For 140 years , the OCC examined the books of national banks to make sure they were balanced , an important but uncontroversial function .
But a few years ago , for the first time in its history , the OCC was used as a tool against consumers .
In 2003 , during the height of the predatory lending crisis , the OCC invoked a clause from the 1863 National Bank Act to issue formal opinions preempting all state predatory lending laws , thereby rendering them inoperative .

Obama , McCain Sweep Potomac Primaries For Obama it 's eight straight wins ; McCain builds on his huge delegate lead .
Feb. 13 , 2008  --
On a primary winning streak , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , swept the so - called Potomac primaries last night , overwhelmingly defeating Sen.
Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , in Democratic contests in Maryland , Virginia and Washington , D.C .
For the first time , the Illinois senator has taken the lead over Clinton in the ABC News overall delegate estimate .
This is the eighth straight victory for Obama , who is increasingly taking on the mantle of Democratic frontrunner .
" Today , the change we seek swept through the Chesapeake and over the Potomac .
We won the state of Maryland .
We won the Commonwealth of Virginia .
And though we won in Washington D.C. , this movement wo n't stop until there 's change in Washington , " Obama told supporters at a rally in Madison , Wisc. last night .
" We are bringing together Democrats and Independents and Republicans ; blacks and whites ; Latinos and Asians ; small states and big states ; Red States and Blue States into a United States of America , " Obama said .
" This is the new American majority . "
On the Republican side , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz , won primaries in Maryland and Washington , D.C. and battled back insurgent candidate Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , in a Virginia primary made close by a high turnout of conservatives and Christian evangelicals .
" He certainly keeps things interesting , a little too interesting at times tonight , " McCain said of Huckabee at a campaign rally in Alexandria , Va .
" Makes it more interesting . "
Clinton 's Potomac Defeat
Clinton 's defeat in the Virginia primary crushed what may have been her best chance at a Potomac primary win .
Clinton had hoped to perform strongly in Virginia 's rural communities and among women and the state 's sizeable Hispanic and immigrant population , but Obama ultimately prevailed in the state , winning demographic groups once thought to be Clinton 's core .
Ignoring her losses and her Democratic rival , Clinton addressed a campaign rally in El Paso , Texas -- one of the states she is focusing her campaign on winning March 4 .
" I need you to stand up for me because , because if we stand up together , if we work together , if we fight together , we will take back America and we will make history together , " Clinton said .
In a sign of further turmoil within Clinton 's campaign , word came late tonight that Clinton 's deputy campaign manager Mike Henry stepped down today , reports ABC News Kate Snow .
Henry is famous for a leaked memo he wrote suggesting that Clinton skip Iowa .
He was loyal to former campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle , who was replaced two days ago .
Obama Swept to Victories
Obama swept to victories in Virginia , Maryland and D.C. where majorities of Democratic voters said the top attribute they are seeking in a candidate is the one who can " bring needed change , " according to preliminary exit poll results -- a message consistently promoted by Obama .
Obama won 88 and 89 percent of African - American voters in Virginia and Maryland and rode majority support from white men .
White voters in Virginia favoring him over Clinton by a 14 - point margin , according to preliminary exit results reported by ABC News ' Gary Langer .
Obama was also helped by independents , who made up a fifth of voters in Virginia 's open primary .
McCain Beats Back Huckabee
McCain , who is trying to court conservatives unhappy with his record on taxes , immigration and his opposition to a federal ban on same - sex marriage , battled back Huckabee in Virginia , where a high turnout of Christian evangelicals and conservatives made it a tight race .
Thirty - four percent of Republican primary voters in Virginia described themselves as very conservative , putting Huckabee in the game , reports ABC News ' Gary Langer .
He won very conservative voters over McCain by better than a 3 - 1 margin , while McCain narrowly prevailed among somewhat conservatives and won moderate Republicans by more than 2 - 1 , according to exit polls .
McCain , who had an insurmountable delegate lead going into today 's primaries , has picked up hundreds more delegates thanks to Virginia and Washington , D.C. 's winner - take - all rules .
Despite his continued losses , Huckabee vowed again tonight not to pull the trigger on his campaign until someone reaches the 1,191 GOP delegates needed to win the Republican nomination .
" The nomination is not secured until someone has 1,191 delegates , " Huckabee said at a news conference in Little Rock , Arkansas tonight .
" It would be premature to quit to quit the game , " he said .
" I 've not been one who believes you believe the field because it has gotten difficult .
You keep playing last second of the clock . "
McCain 's campaign tonight said Huckabee was on a losing quest .
" After tonight it is mathematically impossible for Governor Huckabee to secure the nomination , " McCain communicators director Jill Hazelbaker told ABC News ' Ron Claiborne .
In his victory speech tonight , McCain appeared to deliver a message to those conservatives who doubt him .
" As I have done my entire career , I will make my case to every American who will listen , " McCain said .
" I will not confine myself to the comfort of speaking only to those who agree with me ...
I will fight every moment of every day for what I believe is right for this country , and I will not yield . "
' It 's Historic '
Despite freezing temperatures , rain and sleet in some areas , Democrats energized by historic candidates and the tighest nominating race in recent history turned out in high numbers .
" I voted for the next president of the United States , Barack Obama , " said Phil Andonian , a 31 - year - old lawyer sporting a Barack Obama T - shirt underneath his winter coat , outside a polling station in the nation 's capital .
" The Clintons have shown themselves to be a political machine not much different than the Bush administration , " Andonian said .
" I think Obama is the one to bring about the kind of change we need in Washington . "
Walking home from the elementary school where he voted , a 75 - year old African - American man reflected on his vote for Obama .
" It 's historic , " he said , declining to give his name .
" And this is probably the last time I 'm gonna get to vote . "
Post - Super Tuesday Momentum
In recent days Clinton 's campaign has downplayed the importance of today 's primary contests , focusing instead on the delegate - rich states of Ohio and Texas voting March 4 and Pennsylvania , which votes April 22 .
Today Clinton kept a low profile , visiting her campaign headquarters in Virginia and doing satellite television interviews , looking beyond Tuesday 's trio of contests and touting the importance of a March 4 vote in Ohio .
" Ohio is really going to count in determining who our Democratic nominee is , and so I 'm looking forward to getting there as soon as I can , " she told ABC News ' WCPO affiliate in Cincinnati .
Campaigning in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington , D.C. , Tuesday , Obama signed autographs , shook hands and thanked people who braved freezing temperatures to see him .
" Thank you everybody for voting , get all your friends to vote , " Obama said .
Inside a Dunkin ' Donuts in southeast Washington , the Illinois senator ordered a dozen mixed doughnuts and hot chocolates for campaign volunteers .
" Let me add to the tax revenue of the city , " Obama quipped to District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty , who has endorsed Obama .
The Fight for Delegates
At stake on Tuesday were 175 Democratic delegates , including seven from Democrats voting abroad , in a nominating race so tight it 's become a state - by - state slog for delegates up to the party 's national convention in August .
Going into the Potomac primaries , Clinton held a razor - thin delegate lead , according to ABC News ' delegate scorecard .
But Obama surpassed Clinton tonight as the results continued to pour in .
Meanwhile McCain picked up a big chunk of the 113 GOP delegates up for grabs , thanks to Virginia and Washington , D.C. 's winner - take - all rules .
Clinton Focuses on Ohio ; Obama on Wisconsin
After the contests in the East , Clinton and Obama head West but in vastly different directions .
Clinton left D.C. for Texas as she focuses her campaign on the March 4 votes in Ohio , Texas , Vermont and Rhode Island -- states she hopes will be a firewall to Obama 's post - Super Tuesday momentum .
Obama , meanwhile , will deliever a speech on the economy tomorrow in Wisconsin , home of the next primary Tuesday , Feb. 19 .
" Wisconsin is going to be a real battleground , " Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told reporters on a conference call Tuesday .
Plouffe said a win in Wisconsin , where Obama looks strong , would quiet opponents who have suggested Obama 's support comes mainly from blacks , young voters , independents and high - income , mostly male , Democrats .
Over the course of the primaries and caucuses so far , Clinton has done well in large , diverse states , earning widespread support from low - income Democrats , women , senior citizens and Hispanics .
" By their own definition , Wisconsin would be a state with a lot of working - class voters , rural voters , a large state holding a primary that you would think would be prime turf for them , " Plouffe said .
Hawaii , the state where Obama was raised , also votes next Tuesday .
Obama , Clinton Trade Swipes
Obama 's post - Super Tuesday primary and caucus victories , combined with a month of stunning fundraising , have boosted the insurgent candidate 's prospects .
Over the weekend , the Illinois senator won a slew of contests , defeating Clinton in a Louisiana primary as well as caucuses in Nebraska , Washington state and Maine .
Obama 's campaign pulled in an astonishing $ 32 million in January and another $ 6 million arrived in the following 24 hours .
Clinton 's campaign appeared unsteady this weekend when the campaign replaced campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle with Maggie Williams , another longtime adviser to the former first lady .
Clinton 's campaign has maintained that she will do well in the delegate - rich states of Ohio and Texas that vote March 4 , and the Pennsylvania primary April 22 .
Hoping to distinguish themselves from the other before the Potomac primaries , Clinton and Obama took swipes at each other the day before the vote .
Clinton accused Obama of suspicious activity with a contributor .
" Sen . Obama has some questions to answer about his dealings with one of his largest contributors , Exelon , a big nuclear power company ; apparently he cut some deals behind closed doors to protect them from full disclosure of the nuclear industry , " she told ABC News ' Washington affiliate WJLA Monday night .
Obama took a swipe at Clinton 's campaign shakeup and news last week that the senator had injected $ 5 million of her own money into her campaign in January .
" I started from scratch and was up against an operation that had been built over the course of 20 years by a former president with the bulk of the Democratic establishment on their side and after setting up a hundred - million - plus operation with hundreds of employees around the country ; it looks like we 've played them to a draw so far , " Obama said .
" I think that gives you a sense of how we run a campaign .
There has n't been a lot of drama in my campaign .
You have n't seen a lot of turnover in my campaign . "
Obama , Clinton Race May Go to Convention
Despite Obama 's surge , neither candidate may crush the other in the upcoming primary and caucus contests given the proportionality rules of the Democratic Party primaries -- setting up a scenario in which the nomination fight spills onto the convention floor in August .
There , superdelegates -- 796 state party leaders , national party leaders and former Democratic presidents who get to act as free agents at the party 's convention able to back any candidate they wish -- would hold the power .
While most of the superdelegates are sitting on the fence , Clinton is leading Obama among the superdelegates who have decided whom to support , according to ABC News ' latest survey .
Obama has emphasized his belief that it would be unfair if the Democratic contest was decided by superdelegates .
" We 've got to make sure that whoever wins the most votes , the most delegates , that they are the nominee , " he told ABC news affiliate WJLA Monday .
" I think that would be problematic if either Sen .
Clinton or myself came in with having won the most support from voters and that was somehow overturned by party insiders . "
ABC News ' Kate Snow , Ron Claiborne , Gary Langer , Karen Travers , Tahman Bradley , and Sunlen Miller contributed reporting .
KABUL , Afghanistan , Dec. 8  The Afghan government called on Taliban fighters in the town of Musa Qala in southern Afghanistan to put down their weapons and give themselves up or face a heavy attack from Afghan and NATO forces hemming in the town on Saturday .
Two children were killed and five civilians were wounded when a car came under fire in the town as NATO and Afghan forces closed in during the second day of an operation to retake the town from the Taliban , the Defense Ministry spokesman , Gen.
Zaher Azimi , said at a news conference here in the capital .
“ The Afghan government and NATO deeply regret the incident , and our message to the insurgents is not to use civilians as a human shield , ” General Azimi said .
Twelve insurgents were killed in the fighting , and one was arrested , he said .
Musa Qala has been a haven for Taliban and foreign fighters since February , when they moved in four months after British forces pulled out of the town .
General Azimi said the plan to retake the town came after tensions rose between local elders and clerics and the hundreds of foreign fighters who had set up in the town .
The tribal elders had asked the government to reassert control , he said .
STILL think copier when you hear the name Xerox ?
The company knows that you do .
And it is sick of it .
After all , Xerox does n’t even make standalone copiers anymore .
These days , Xerox gets most of its revenue from machines that both print and copy and that can be plugged into networks for use in offices and high - speed publishing .
It has introduced 100 products in the last three years .
But it does n’t want the Xerox name to conjure them up , either , given that services  like managing a company ’s document flow  are a fast - growing part of the product mix , too .
So on Monday , Xerox introduced what it says is the most sweeping transformation of its corporate identity since it dropped “ Haloid ” from the Haloid Xerox name in 1961 .
In a presentation to employees , it announced that it would retire the red capital X that has dominated its logo for 40 years in favor of what Richard Wergan , vice president for advertising , calls “ a brand identity that reflects the Xerox of today . ”
The new logo consists of a bright red lower - case “ xerox ” that sits alongside a red sphere sketched with lines that link to form a stylized X. According to Anne M. Mulcahy , Xerox ’s chief , that little piece of art represents the connection to customers , partners , industry and innovation .
Ron Paul has now passed Fred Thompson in the probability of winning the Republican nomination .
According to Intrade , Paul has a probability of winning the nomination of 8.8 % .
( Guiliani ( 42.0 % ) and Romney ( 27.6 % ) are first and second . )
In closely related news , Paul raised $ 4.2 million yesterday .

The world ’s largest man-made twister at the Mercedes Benz Museum , Germany
by yogesh
Head over to the Mercedes Benz Museum in Germany to witness the world ’s largest artificial tornado .
It ’s even got the Guinness Book of Records certification for the claim !
It ’s 34.43 meters ( ~113 feet ) tall , and contains approximately 28 tons of air .
It takes 144 jets about seven minutes to produce .
The purpose behind this tornado is to suck smoke out of the building and save lives in the unlikely event of a fire .
As you can see from the picture , carbon dioxide is being sprayed into the bottom of the tornado to make it visible .
Update – Video after the jump
A low - pressure column in the center of the tornado effectively sucks in any smoke and carries it up to vents in the roof allowing it to escape .

In an few hours from now The Pirate Bay team will probably be charged with aiding or facilitating copyright infringement .
If they are found guilty , they could receive sentences of up to 2 years in prison , but the site will remain online , no matter what .
Update : The Swedish prosecutor has announced the charges against the Pirate Bay admins .
Last month , the Swedish authorities announced that they were planning to press charges against 5 people involved with The Pirate Bay , stating that the 5 individuals will be charged with “ facilitating copyright infringement ” .
Today , after nearly two years of collecting evidence , the prosecutor will officially press charges .
But , no matter what the outcome of the case , The Pirate Bay says that they ’re here to stay .
On the Pirate Bay Blog we read : “ In case we lose the pending trial ( yeah right ) there will still not be any changes to the site .
The Pirate Bay will keep operating just as always .
We ’ve been here for years and we will be here for many more . ”
The Pirate Bay is not hosted in Sweden anymore , in fact , the Pirate Bay crew claims that they themselves have no idea where the servers are located .
After the raid on their servers in 2006 , they decided that it was better not to know where they are .
One thing is sure though , they are not hosted in just one country .
For those who are interested , all the legal documents the police collected in the upcoming case can now be bought form the Swedish police for only $ 1000 .
They sure try to profit from all the recent media attention .
However , Brokep is reasonable , as he says : “ Even though the information in the investigation might be a bit personal at times ( alcohol intake , sex addictions ) we ’re not suing the police for commercially exploiting the material they took from us without permission . ”
For now ,
The Pirate Bay team is staying confident and firm in the belief that they have nothing to worry about .
They argue that they are just running a search engine , and never stored any copyrighted material on their servers .
Stay tuned for more Pirate Bay news today .
Productivity varies over the course of the workday , with the greatest productivity occurring in the first four to six hours .
After enough hours , productivity approaches zero ; eventually it becomes negative .
Productivity is hard to quantify for knowledge workers .
Five - day weeks of eight - hour days maximize long - term output in every industry that has been studied over the past century .
What makes us think that our industry is somehow exempt from this rule ?
At 60 hours per week , the loss of productivity caused by working longer hours overwhelms the extra hours worked within a couple of months .
Continuous work reduces cognitive function 25 % for every 24 hours .
Multiple consecutive overnighters have a severe cumulative effect .
Error rates climb with hours worked and especially with loss of sleep .
Eventually the odds catch up with you , and catastrophe occurs .
When schedules are tight and budgets are big , is this a risk you can really afford to take ?
When Henry Ford famously adopted a 40 - hour work week in 1926 , he was bitterly criticized by members of the National Association of Manufacturers .
But his experiments , which he'd been conducting for at least 12 years , showed him clearly that cutting the workday from ten hours to eight hours — and the work week from six days to five days — increased total worker output and reduced production cost .
Ford spoke glowingly of the social benefits of a shorter work week , couched firmly in terms of how increased time for consumption was good for everyone .
But the core of his argument was that reduced shift length meant more output .
Managers decide to crunch because they want to be able to tell their bosses " I did everything I could . "
They crunch because they value the butts in the chairs more than the brains creating games .
They crunch because they have n't really thought about the job being done or the people doing it .
They crunch because they have learned only the importance of appearing to do their best to instead of really of doing their best .
And they crunch because , back when they were programmers or artists or testers or assistant producers or associate producers , that was the way they were taught to get things done .
We go through stages of understanding the problem — we gather requirements , develop analysis models , and then design software solutions .
We develop plans to build and deploy the solution .
We come up with a well - ordered set of actions that will lead us logically and inevitably to the goal .
And then we skip an important step .
We do n’t sit down and think about what could go wrong .
We learn about weakness in our plan and design approach as we go .
Discovering oversights by running into walls costs money , causes delays , and can compromise quality .
In 2004 a blog post of a disgruntled spouse of an employee of an international electronic games company , sparked a mountain of media coverage and on line discussion .
Evan Robinson picks up the mantle with an article for the IGDA on 6 reasons why crunch mode does n't work : Indeed the evidence for the 8 hour day , 5 days a week has been around and in practice since 1926 :
So what elements are there to this that ends up affecting the software industry so much ?
Commonly projects are planned on the flawed assumption that there is a fixed amount of work to be done - a common mistake named the ' lump - of - labour fallacy " .
Agile methodologies such as Scrum avoid making this assumption , although this does n't avoid the end of iteration crunch , it does cap the crunch time to a percentage of the iteration .
Learning often is either inadequately or not planned for at all , and can take up to 70 % of time to deliver on a project ( see " The Secret Sauce Of Software Development " ) .
So , if we ( as managers ) know this is wrong , why does it keep happening ?
The author poses his viewpoint : Esther Derby has a different view point - that is we fail to plan for what could go wrong Inevitably it seems that the factors that bring about crunch time are entirely human .
What methods have readers to combat the crunch time phenomenon ?
Is it simply a human facet of engineering , or is it something that is wholly unnecessary ?
This Takata airbag design is … interesting .
Essentially , if you get in a car accident your face will be thrust quickly between two giant , inflatable ass cheeks .
Or are they giant breasts ?
Depending on what you 're in to , you could see it either way .
In any case , I can certainly see how it would be more comfortable to mash your face into than a normal airbag , but is it worth the embarrassment when the paramedics arrive ?
Also , how do they compare to the feeling of having your face smashed into a real butt at high speeds ?

Modern Javascript “ frameworks ” like Prototype , jQuery , and Dojo compete to provide flexible , expressive tools , which is a great thing for Javascript developers .
It ’s truly astounding how effective these relatively simple and concise tools can be .
One of the challenges faced by toolkit designers stems from the malleability of the Javascript environment – the same malleability that makes the tools possible in the first place .
In type - happy ( I could have written “ stodgy ” ) languages like Java , the question , “ what is this thing ? ” that code behind an API might ask is always easy to answer ; in fact as a Java programmer you do n’t really ask the question much unless you ’ve done things pretty badly .
In Javascript , however , there ’s never a good answer .
Well , there is – the thing is an Object – but it does n’t do you much good .
So anyway , coding away the other day I came across an interesting bug , one that turns out to be shared by Prototype , jQuery , and Dojo ( and maybe others ) .
It was a case of the toolkit code doing something to check to see if a thing passed through an API was of a particular type so that some work could be done with it .
In this case , the toolkit code ( Prototype ) needed to know whether a value was an Array , because if so then something different had to be done than if the value were a simple scalar .
Instead of approaching that situation with a pragmatic , dynamic “ duck typing ” technique , the code took an approach that a Java programmer would recognize .
Specifically the fault was in code that transformed a “ Hash ” object into an HTTP query string .
The client code has a property list of parameter names and values , which is to be used in a GET URL or an XmlHTTPRequest .
The Prototype service has to deal with the fact that a single parameter name may be associated with a list of values .
( Recall that an HTML form can have more than one input field with the same name . )
The Prototype convention here is that the “ toQueryString ” routine looks for parameters in the Hash object whose values are arrays :
// this is 1.5.1 code - it 's different in 1.6 // but the problem remains ( for now ) toQueryString : function ( obj ) { var parts = [ ] ; parts.add = arguments.callee.addPair ; this.prototype._each.call(obj , function ( pair ) { if ( ! pair.key ) return ; var value = pair.value ; if ( value && typeof value == ' object ' ) { if ( value.constructor == Array ) value.each( function ( value ) { parts.add ( pair.key , value ) ; } ) ; return ; } parts.add ( pair.key , value ) ; } ) ; return parts.join ( '&' ) ; } , // ...
( The “ addPair ” routine that ’s hooked up to the return - value array “ parts ” just builds a “ name=value ” string with appropriate URL encoding . )
See how the code works ?
There in the loop code where it handles each key / value pair in the Hash object , it checks each value to see if it ’s type is “ object ” .
( The Javascript “ typeof ” is pretty lame . )
If it ’s an object , then a further test is made to see if the value is an array .
That test compares the “ constructor ” attribute of the value object to the global Array function .
What ’s the problem with this ?
The code is doing something that seems reasonable : if the constructor of the object is the Array function , then it ’s an array , right ?
Sure , this is Javascript , so if the client code has done something stupid like reassign the “ constructor ” attribute or even reassign the global variable name “ Array ” , it ’ll break , but that would be my fault .
Setting that aside , what could possibly go wrong ?
First I ’ll be philosophical : does that code really need to know for sure that the value was constructed by the Array function ?
All it really does when it determines that the value is an array is take advantage of the “ each ” function it expects to find there .
I think that a pure ( funny word in this case ) duck - typing approach would be to check to see if the value object has an attribute called “ each ” that references a function .
Now on to the practical issue here , the reason that the code is buggy as written .
The subtle assumption made in the code is that every array object will have been constructed by the function pointed to by the global variable “ Array ” .
Conversely , it assumes that any object not constructed by the function pointed to by the global variable “ Array ” must not be a real array .
OK then , outside of shenanigans that break things on purpose ( reassigning “ Array ” ) , how is that assumption problematic ?
Well I ’ll tell you .
A web application can be spread across multiple separate windows .
The window objects are linked together into a single DOM graph .
Code can “ see ” up and down the graph into other windows , and functions can be called across window boundaries .
In particular , an array can be passed from code on one page into a function on another .
The kicker is that every page has its own global context ( which means that the term “ global ” is sort - of questionable ) , and that includes a “ global ” variable called “ Array . ”
Oops .
Javascript is not Java .
You ca n’t really put much stock in anything your code might find out about a mysterious parameter , so why compound the problem by asking indirect questions ?
Just because an object was not apparently constructed by the function you think has to be the one and only “ right ” one does n’t mean it wo n’t work just fine .
This page is a simple example of the problem .
Prototype will be fixed soon thanks to the attentions of world - famous Prototype contributor “ savetheclocktower . ”
Dojo and jQuery have similar issues but I have n’t reported them yet .
Specifically , jQuery uses the “ foo.constructor == Array ” deal all over the place .
Dojo seems to use “ instanceof Array ” , which suffers from exactly the same problem .
I do n’t think that expecting the libraries to work properly on values passed across page boundaries is unreasonable .
One of the things to keep in mind when learning a new programming language is that it is n’t enough to learn the syntax and semantics of various language features you are unfamiliar with .
Just as important is learning the idioms and way of thinking that goes with these language features .
On reddit , ubernostrum pointed out that my usage of
if all_links.get ( url ) == None :
was jarring to read as a Python programmer when compared to the more idiomatic
if url not in all_links :
Of course this is just a stylistic issue but his point is valid .
A similar thing happened with regards to other aspects of my recent post entitled Does C# 3.0 Beat Dynamic Languages at their Own Game ?
I argued that type inferencing and anonymous types in C# 3.0 did not offer the same degree of functionality that tuples and dynamic typing did when it came to processing intermediate values in a computation without requiring nominal types ( i.e. named classes ) to hold these values .
Specifically I had the following IronPython code ,
IronPython Code for item in filtered Items :
vote = ( voteFunc ( item ) , item , feedTitle ) #add a vote for each of the URLs
for url in item .
outgoing_links .
Keys :
if all_links .
get ( url ) is None :
all_links [ url ] = [ ]
all_links .
get ( url ) . append ( vote )
# tally the votes , only 1 vote counts per feed
weighted_links = [ ]
for link , votes in all_links .
items ( ) :
site = { }
for weight , item , feedTitle in votes :
site [ feedTitle ] = min ( site .
get ( feedTitle , 1 ) , weight )
weighted_links .
append ( ( sum ( site .
values ( ) ) , link ) )
weighted_links . sort ( )
weighted_links .
reverse ( )
The key things to note about the above code block are ( i ) the variable named vote is a tuple of three values ; the numeric weight given to a link received from a particular RSS item , an RSS item and the title of the feed Python and ( ii ) the items in the tuple can be unpacked into individual variables when looping over the contents of the tuple in a for loop .
When I tried to write the same code in C# 3.0 with a vote variable that was an anonymous type , I hit a road block .
When I placed instances of the anonymous type in the list , I had no way of knowing what the data type of the object I ’d be pulling out of the list would be when I wanted to extract it later to tally the votes .
Since C# is statically typed , knowing the type ’s name is a requirement for retrieving the objects from the list later unless I planned to interact with them as instances of System .
Object and access their fields through reflection ( or something just as weird ) .
So in my C# 3.0 solution I ended up creating RankedLink and Vote types to simulate the functionality I was getting from tuples in Python .
However it turns out I was using anonymous types incorrectly .
I tried to take a feature that was meant to be coupled with C# 3.0 ’s declarative Language Integrated Query ( LINQ ) and use it in the traditional imperative loop constructs I ’ve been familiar with since my days programming in C .
Ian Griffith ’s set me straight with his blog post entitled Dare Obasanjo on C# Anonymous Types where he showed how to use anonymous types to get the solution I wanted without having to create unnecessary named types to hold intermediate values .
Ian ’s code is shown below
C# 3.0 Code // calculate vote for each outgoing url var all_links = from item in items from url in item .
OutgoingLinks .
Keys group item by url into itemUrlGroup select new { Url=itemUrlGroup .
Key , Votes= from item in itemUrlGroup select new { Weight=voteFunc( item ) , Item=item , FeedTitle=feedTitle } } ; // tally the votes var weighted_links = from link_n_votes in all_links select new { Url=link_n_votes .
Url , Score= ( from vote in link_n_votes .
Votes group vote by vote .
FeedTitle into feed select feed .
Min( vote => vote .
Weight ) ) . Sum ( ) } into weighted_link orderby weighted_link .
Score descending select weighted_link ;
As you can see , Ian ’s code performs the same task as the Python code does but with a completely different approach .
The anonymous types are performing the same function as the Python tuples did in my previous code sample and there is no need to create RankedLink and Vote types to hold these intermediate values .
What I find interesting about this is that even though I ’ve been using C# for the past five or six years , I feel like I have to relearn the language from scratch to fully understand or be able to take advantage the LINQ features .
Perhaps a few stints as a SQL developer may be necessary as well ?
Rumours tonight indicate that the government has again decided to delay introducing the Canadian DMCA .
With the House of Commons off next week and the budget coming the following week , if this is true it would appear that there will be no copyright legislation for at least another month ( assuming there is no election ) .
It is impossible to pinpoint any one reason for the delay – the public outcry through Facebook , the treaty issue , the opposition from education , the impact of copyright on some MPs electoral chances , the privacy concerns , the outcry from artists groups , the op-eds , and the creation of a powerful business coalition calling for balanced copyright may have all played a role .
The key question is now is whether the government accepts that it is not the communication strategy that needs fixing , but rather it is the bill itself .
I would argue that there is a deal to be had that would leave virtually all stakeholders sufficiently satisfied to garner broad support ( or at least limit the heated and potentially costly opposition ) .
A bill that implements WIPO by rendering circumvention an infringement only where it occurs for infringing purposes , the introduction of a more flexible fair dealing provision , the establishment of a notice - and - notice system for infringing content , and the creation of intermediary protection for third party content could serve as the foundation for a forward - looking package that meets consumer needs , business demands , and U.S. pressure .
Over the past 10 weeks we have witnessed the passion and interest of thousands of Canadians on the copyright issue .
The government may have heard enough to hold off on a Canadian DMCA .
Let 's hope it uses this opportunity to consult and build broad support for a copyright solution that serves Canadian interests .
Justice Department opens criminal investigation of CIA tape destruction
Attorney General Michael Mukasey announced Wednesday that the FBI would begin a criminal probe of the CIA 's destruction of harsh interrogation videotapes .
" The Department 's National Security Division has recommended , and I have concluded , that there is a basis for initiating a criminal investigation of this matter , and I have taken steps to begin that investigation , " Mukasey said in a statement released Wednesday .
The criminal probe will be overseen by a US Attorney in Connecticut , John Durham , who is seen as one of the country 's most relentless prosecutors .
Proceeding with the criminal investigation is a fairly routine step , NBC Justice Department correspondent Pete Williams said .
" They 're now going to do what they normally do , when there is a potential criminal case , " Williams said .
" And that is to have the FBI do the investigation . "
Williams said Durham likely was brought in to avoid any potential conflicts of interest with the Northern Virginia prosecutor 's office , which likely works closely with the Rosslyn , Va. , - headquartered CIA .
Congressional investigators also have began to examine CIA files on the destruction of the tapes , which were hundreds of hours long and depicted harsh interrogation tactics critics have said could be considered torture .
The House Intelligence Committee has ordered the former head of the CIA 's clandestine service , Jose Rodriguez , to testify at a hearing Jan. 16 .
Rodriguez ordered the tapes be destroyed in late 2005 .
Mukasey 's decision to begin a criminal probe came the same day 9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton said the CIA " stonewalled " the commission .
Although US President George W. Bush had ordered all executive branch agencies to cooperate with the probe , Kean and Hamilton wrote , " recent revelations that the CIA destroyed videotaped interrogations of Qaeda operatives leads us to conclude that the agency failed to respond to our lawful requests for information about the 9/11 plot . "
" Those who knew about those videotapes -- and did not tell us about them -- obstructed our investigation . "

Browse column F RESNO , CA — Kurds are what the Discovery Channel would call the base of the food chain in the Middle East .
They 're born casualties , spawning in huge numbers to keep the local predators well fed .
Kurds grow up brave and stupid , loyal to a little prince or chief or political hack who uses his people like poker chips to get something from one of the countries occupying Kurdish territory .
And as long as you 've got that fatal combination of brave , loyal and dumb , backed by a huge birth rate , you 're going to see Kurds getting gobbled up like Atlantic Cod .
For all I know the words are even related ; maybe " Kurd " is just a dried Cod .
If the Kurds did n't enjoy being prey , they'd have tried sticking together once in a while .
But in all of history no Kurd could ever stand by any other Kurd long enough to hold off all the hungry Arabs , Persians , Turks , Brits and other sand carnivores swimming around the Fertile Crescent .
Of course this is one of those smug pieces of advice people in high - GDP countries just love to give their neighbors across the tracks : " Why do n't you people stop shooting each other — and mow your lawns !
That crabgrass outside your place is making my retirement years a Hell on earth ! "
Once you 've lived in a ghetto , and Kurdistan is one big , dry , cold ghetto , a junked - car backyard for Turkey , Iran and Iraq , then you understand real easy why it makes more sense to turn on your local rival , betray him to the occupiers , instead of making some noble common cause against the oppressor .
It comes down to something even a Swiss or Swede can understand : jobs .
There 's only ever been one job in Kurdistan : playing Wog Wrangler , rounding up your fellow wogs to sell to the Turks , or Persians , or Arabs .
You can try selling them as cannon fodder — that 's maybe the most common sales pitch — or you can convince the foreign oppressor that your neighbor is so dangerous that he ought to pay you and your cuzzes some of his Turkish or Persian or Arab gold to go round the varmint up and turn in his dangerous Kurdish head for the bounty .
If you do n't — if you have an attack of Kurdish patriotism and decide you 'll stand up for your neighbor , all for one and one for all — he 's definitely going to try collecting the bounty on you and all your male relatives .
That 's the simple logic of living as a tribe without a state : if you do n't cut a deal with the occupiers , your neighbour will and you wo n't like the fine print .
In fact , you 'll BE the fine print .
So when you 're an occupied tribe , habits like telling the truth and minding your own business are lethal .
The advantage is always going to go to the bitchiest , most lying - tongued little slandering pig in the village , the jerk who does n't have a qualm about sucking up to the Turkish ( or Persian or Arab ) junior officer in charge of the local garrison and , after telling him how smart and handsome he is for a few hours , passing a secret warning about what a threat to the public safety you and your family are .
And if the Lieutenant happens to feel grateful to the informer , maybe he would n't mind giving him your cow and that nice pasture behind your house , once he's had you and all your kin rounded up and shot .
Over time , a system like this will do a wonderful sped - up evolutionary job of cleaning out any leftover decency from the local population .
Are you the kind of hardworkin ' dude who puts in a good day in the fields , comes home to the family and does n't bother anybody ?
Well , you 're dead meat for the first snitch to catch the lieutenant 's ear .
You 're Kurdish toast .
By the way , you can see that this kind of pattern holds for most occupied countries , like , say , Iraq .
You can bet that the Iraqis who were the first to suck up to us , the most persistent and shameless at shining our shoes and selling us info , are exactly the same kind of slime .
They 're the same everywhere , and they always rise to the top after an invasion .
It 's a good reason not to invade unless you 've already got your own intelligence , so you do n't have to buy their bullshit .
Which we did n't , of course .
So you can imagine how many neighborhood scores we 've helped settle .
A lot of old wounds from Baghdad High School 's playgrounds got settled that way , I bet : poor little four - eyed Ahmed got picked on by big bad jock Raheem , but little Ahmed studied his English , got a job as Coalition interpreter and the first interrogation he did , he did n't even bother listening to what the suspect was babbling about , he just translated it as , " He says there is a dangerous terrorist here named Raheem , a cruel boy who never picked me for volleyball — I mean , who is harboring terrorists , planning attacks , and must be killed immediately ! "

MANILA ( Reuters ) - Philippine military and police teams stormed a luxury hotel in Manila on Thursday to end a short - lived coup attempt by a small group of soldiers and others who had called on the army to mutiny .
Government forces fired teargas into the lobby of the Manila Peninsula Hotel and used an armored personnel carrier to batter down its glass doors before storming in under cover of repeated bursts of fire in the air .
There were no casualties .
The rebel soldiers , a senator , former Vice - President Teofisto Guingona and a few clerics who had occupied the plush icon in the sprawling city of 12 million people surrendered and were arrested .
“ We are going out for the sake of the safety of everybody , ” their leader Senator Antonio Trillanes earlier told reporters .
“ For your sake , because we will not live with our conscience if some of you get hurt or get killed in the crossfire .
We can not afford that . ”
It was the latest in a series of coup attempts to plague the Southeast Asian nation since dictator Ferdinand Marcos was ousted two decades ago .
Thursday ’s drama attracted hundreds of curious onlookers , but no one voiced any support for those inside the hotel , and there were no reports of unrest within the military .
Most of the guests had been evacuated before the assault , but over 100 people , including hotel staff and journalists , were caught in the midst of the action .
A bride dressed in wedding finery left the Peninsula by a side exit along with her husband - to - be and guests to hold the reception at a hotel across the road .
“ I ’m going through with this .
Rock n’ Roll ! ” Maria - Stella Magtayo said , clutching a bouquet while a friend held the train of her off - the - shoulder white gown .
HAULED AWAY
When the coup effort collapsed Senator Trillanes , who as a navy officer also led a failed mutiny in 2003 against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and was elected to the upper house in May , was hauled away in plastic wrist restraints .
Fellow mutineers , including around two dozen soldiers , a priest and a retired bishop , were among those arrested .
So were scores of journalists .
National police chief Avelino Razon told television that 101 people had been detained , including the journalists .
The latter were freed late in the evening after identity checks .
“ The wrong ways of some does not speak well for the nation or the armed forces and the police , ” Arroyo said in a brief television address after the coup attempt ended .
“ Just like before , we will impose the full force of the law strictly and without favor . ”
The drama started when Trillanes and some soldiers walked out of their own trial for the 2003 mutiny , escorted by guards assigned to keep them from escaping .

They marched to the Peninsula in Manila ’s Makati financial district and took over the building , calling for the overthrow of Arroyo .
“ We have been witness and victims of the kind of ruthlessness this administration is giving to the people .
Now , like soldiers we are going to face this , ” Trillanes told reporters , when asked if he was ready for fresh charges over this incident .
TEAR GAS SPLUTTERS
Journalists trying to do live phone - ins spluttered and covered their faces with handkerchiefs as the tear gas rose from the lobby to higher floors .
Slideshow ( 21 images )
Government forces closed down virtually the entire Makati area , and surrounded the Peninsula with troops and trucks .
Five armored personnel carriers were used in the assault on the hotel .
The rebel soldiers , who had earlier stopped people from leaving the hotel lobby as a 3 p.m. ( 0700 GMT ) deadline for them to end their mutiny passed , later relented and let them go .
“ I have n’t been to bed yet , ” said Dave Anderson from Anchorage , Alaska , who had flown in overnight to Manila .
“ They came and beat on my door and told me to leave by 3 p.m .
They told me to take my bags , so here I am sitting in the lobby because I ca n’t go out , ” he said before being allowed to leave .
Arroyo , deeply unpopular due to corruption allegations , has survived at least two coup plots and three impeachment bids because the jaded middle class is sick of political instability , and she has a huge majority in the lower house .
She has also been buoyed by a strong economy .
The stock market and the peso currency pared earlier gains on the soldiers ’ actions but the main index still finished up 1.17 percent and has risen nearly 20 percent this year .
The peso is Asia ’s top performing currency , up 14.80 percent since the start of 2007 .
The government imposed a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. in Manila and two surrounding regions on Friday , a government holiday .
Officials called it a precautionary measure .
Markets were unlikely to be much affected when they reopen on Monday , barring any further unrest , economic analysts said .
A few years ago I switched from Cingular to T - Mobile because Cingular ’s customer service stunk .
My experience today was another proof that I made the right choice .
Late Saturday night my beloved Samsung T509 had full signal in my apartment , but I could n’t place or receive any calls .
Heading outside , I walked six blocks before my calls would go through .
Some kind of cell phone black hole was centered right on my apartment .
What a bummer , especially when you ’re trying to order pizza without a landline .
So the next morning I went out for brunch beyond the boundary of the black hole .
I called T - Mobile with a forkful of chilaquiles and expected to wait on hold .
Much to my surprise , T - Mobile does n’t make you wait .
They take your number instead and call you back .
Three minutes later , my phone rang .
The girl on the other end was friendly , listened to my problem , apologized , and told me she ’d send an engineer asap .
She could n’t promise a response before Wednesday due to New Years , so I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best .
Today my comatose phone gave a familiar chirp .
T - Mobile had texted me this message :
An Engineer has reviewed your trouble ticket and a resolution has been found .
Thank you for choosing T - Mobile .
After making a few calls and dancing around the room , I had to reflect on this .
T - Mobile nailed this support experience from the beginning through the middle to the end .
1 . I never had to stand in line
Waiting on hold sucks .
T - Mobile knows it so they gave me another option and called me back .
2 . The agent cared about my problem
The girl on the line was kind , attentive , and apologetic .
She made me feel like it was their problem and their responsibility .
Which is exactly what I want as a customer .
She also promised an update by a specific date , which eased my uncertainty .
3 . When the problem was fixed , I heard it from them first
I received a text message as soon as my service was restored .
That little victory SMS taught me that when they have downtime in the future , I can trust they will work quickly and notify me when it ’s fixed .
It ’s so frustrating to repeatedly pick up the phone every half hour to see if it works .
Thanks to their communication , next time I can relax and wait for the good news .
Kudos to T - Mobile for the good example .

Mathematics is the supreme nostalgia of our time .
The security hologram stickers that grace our credit cards and other sensitive items could be about to get a radical makeover if Japan ’s Dai Nippon Printing ( DNP ) and Sony PCL have their way .
The two firms have just succeeded in creating a printed hologram that contains enough different images to mimic smooth - moving video .
The Lippmann hologram technique uses two lasers and a series of interference patterns to impart up to 100 different images on a layer of polymer .
Conventional printed holograms are stereoscopic and contain just two views embossed on plastic or foil .
As you can see from the animated representation above , the result is impressive enough to pass for a simple video clip .
The companies are anticipating that the higher cost of Lippmann holograms will be offset by potential savings made through preventing product piracy and other fraud .
Aside from credit cards and the like , the future will likely see the new holograms on Blu-ray disks , medicines and the high - end designer accessories so popular in Japan .

MILAN – Disgruntled Italian Catholics are increasingly turning to the internet to leave the Church by getting " debaptized " – but typically , the Pope is n't making the process web friendly .
Cyberspace is one of the few places lapsed Catholics can get a copy of the formal letter called " actus defectionis " that is required by Church officials to leave the faith .
One such letter , downloaded 30,000 times , is the main attraction at the Italian Union of Rationalists and Agnostics , or UAAR , website .
The 2,000 - member group , which won a David - and - Goliath legal battle over debaptism in 2002 , has no brick - and - mortar office .
It relies on e-mail and the occasional phone call to keep things moving .
" We see a traffic spike every time the Pope says something unpopular , " said UAAR site manager Raffaele Carcano , who is also a banker , adding that the site recently hit new heights during a recent fray over civil unions .
Church officials , however , view debaptism as a matter of bookkeeping .
Priests are incapable of washing off the holy water that tots were dipped in for the rite .
The actus defectionis must be snail - mailed to the parish where baptism took place .
Priests note in the register that the flock member has permanently strayed – and that 's one less believer to bulk up statistics .
There are no statistics on how many Italians have defected .
Proponents claim thousands , the Church maintains a handful – and according to at least one Vaticanista , Salvatore Mazza of the Catholic daily newspaper Avvenire , debaptists can , at best , " hope to become a niche phenomena . "
Still , there 's enough buzz around debaptism to prompt the Vatican to publish a legislative text reminding the former faithful that they are committing an act of " apostasy , heresy or schism . "
The pool is a potentially large one : 90 percent of Italians are baptized but only a third are churchgoers .
Debaptists have their anti-evangelizing work cut out for them .
Reaching computer - shy lapsed Catholics may be the biggest challenge – just 31 percent of Italians regularly use ( . pdf ) the internet .
And , although the internet is great for disseminating information , downloading the letter does n't absolve one from the infuriating Bel Paese bureaucracy , as Luca S. discovered .
Luca , a 28 - year - old who works in sales , downloaded the letter from UAAR 's site and mailed it .
His parish priest in Verona , who had never debaptized anyone before , demanded a face - to - face meeting .
Describing himself as " kind of a coward and pretty lazy , " but unwilling to belong to a Church that did n't represent him , Luca made an appointment .
He told the priest he had never been a believer , so why belong to the flock ?
" A flock that included me as soon as I was born without my consent , " he said .
The priest noted Luca had formally left the religion in the baptism register , then Luca signed his name and left .
For Carcano , 40 , the battle continues .
Judging from the e-mail he gets , Luca 's experience is fairly common – priests often insist on a face - to - face interview .
UAAR recently uploaded a new letter with reinforced legal jargon to dissuade priests from requiring in - person visits or notifying relatives of the debaptism .
" My parents did n't take it well , " Luca said .
" They were concerned about what people would think .
But they 've since forgotten about the whole thing .
In a lot of families this would be seen as an immense tragedy .
My mother was upset because I can't get married in church now . "
Though UAAR works mostly remotely , members meet offline to organize protests and other initiatives , including an upcoming group debaptism for the non-internet savvy .
Running a BitTorrent site can get pretty expensive , especially when you 're caught up in a lawsuit with the MPAA .
But , recommending malicious BitTorrent clients like Get - Torrent to your users is not the solution , not even if they pay $ $ per install .
Money corrupts ?
Get -Torrent is one of the many malicious BitTorrent clients that are advertised on torrent sites .
The clients , and a lot of other free malware applications , are developed and spread by a Swedish company named Wakenet .
Their primary goal is to trap people into downloading applications that look useful , just to infect computers with adware bundles that are hard to uninstall .
Various forum threads , even on TorrentSpy , warn naive users about these clients .
Still , TorrentSpy is actively advertising Get - Torrent , and infecting hundreds of their users ’ computers , resulting in a torrent of annoying popups .
Unlike TorrentSpy , most BitTorrent site admins refuse to advertise these clients .
The Pirate Bay and mininova successfully banned these malicious clients from advertising through Adbrite , and BTjunkie and many other sites wont let them on their site either .
The malware bundled with BitTorrent clients like Get - Torrent , Torrent101 , TorrentQ and BitRoll is a sponsor program called “ Cidhelp ” .
Apparently , it can be easily removed from the Windows Control Panel .
However , in most cases your anti-spyware or anti-virus program damaged the files , leaving them impossible to uninstall , while they still cause numerous popups .
In April we ran a Google Adwords campaigns on the Bitroll , Torrent101 and Torrentq websites warning users not to install these clients .

SINGAPORE , Oct 2 ( Reuters ) - Singapore ’s refusal to soften its strict bank secrecy laws could scupper talks with Europe about a trade agreement , a European politician said on Tuesday .
The European Union and the 10 - member Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) are negotiating partnership and cooperation agreements , which are a prerequisite for a fully fledged free trade deal .
However , for such agreements to come into force , the EU wants ASEAN countries to help it make European tax evaders pay tax to their home countries on interest earned offshore .
“ Is this a dealbreaker ?
Potentially yes , ” Glyn Ford , a Member of the European Parliament , told journalists during a visit by the parliament ’s International Trade Committee .
The EU adopted the savings directive in 2005 but efforts to force Hong Kong and Singapore to join have been unsuccessful .
European banking havens Switzerland and Liechtenstein have agreed to apply a so - called withholding tax .
“ We say that we do n’t think there ’s money laundering going on here , but clearly people engaged in money laundering are looking for places like Singapore with low levels of transparency to actually engage in money laundering , ” Ford said .
“ If I was looking for somewhere to do my money laundering , Singapore would be getting towards the top of my list these days , ” he added .
Singapore has been promoting itself as a financial hub in Asia in recent years , attracting a number of large European and U.S. banks that have set up private banking offices to manage money for local and foreign clients .
Ignasi Guardans - Cambo , another member of the parliament ’s trade committee , said Singapore needed to step up transparency of its financial sector to avoid the possibility of attracting organised crime given that it was due to open the first of two multi-billion dollar casinos in late 2009 .
“ The big money laundering hubs in the world are disappearing and nobody wants Singapore to replace them .
And , of course , nobody is accusing Singapore now , but that ’s a reality not only in terms of financing of terrorism , but also in terms of organised crime . ”

I did my big timeline yesterday to try to pin down how much of what we suspect to be the warrantless wiretap program started in early 2001 , rather than post - 9/11 as Bush has always claimed .
As I pointed out in my timeline , it 's clear that Nacchio walked into the February 27 meeting expecting to talk about Groundbreaker .
He remained willing to do Groundbreaker .
But he was also asked to do something which he was unwilling to do .
My big question is : when did the access to the switches happen , when did the data mining of purportedly international data being , and when did the data mining of domestic data happen ?
Let 's start with this comment from William Ockham , who knows a lot more about the telecom side of this than I .
First , I think Nacchio and Qwest objected to at least two different overtures from NSA .
In early 2001 , I think the NSA asked them to do what AT&T did in San Francisco , set up a tap in to their fiber optic backbone .
In a sense , emptywheel is correct in saying that this activity was part of Groundbreaker .
I think it would be more accurate to say that Groundbreaker was a cover for this activity .
Qwest would have objected on the grounds that FISA prohibited wire communication interception inside the USA , even if the communication was " foreign to foreign " .
Qwest was dumped from the Eagle Alliance ( Groundbreaker consortium ) because it would n't play ball .
After 9/11 , the NSA came back and asked for " metadata " about their customers and Qwest refused based on the 1996 Telecommunications Act .
This may have been the trigger for Nacchio 's prosecution ( if one assumes it was a selective prosecution ) .
Both of these illegal activities were precursors to the so - called TSP .
The fiber optic taps provided the means for intercepting communications world - wide and the customer activity data mining was provided the means for identifying the supposedly suspicions needles in the haystack .
Now look at this statement Nacchio 's lawyer , Hebert Stern , issued after last year 's USA Today story ; the statement exactly supports WO 's speculation .
In light of pending litigation , I have been reluctant to issue any public statements .
However , because of apparent confusion concerning Joe Nacchio and his role in refusing to make private telephone records of Qwest customers available to the NSA immediately following the Patriot Act , and in order to negate misguided attempts to relate Mr. Nacchio 's conduct to present litigation , the following are the facts .
In the Fall of 2001 , at a time when there was no investigation of Qwest or Mr. Nacchio by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchange Commission , and while Mr. Nacchio was Chairman and CEO of Qwest and was serving pursuant to the President 's appointment as the Chairman of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee , Qwest was approached to permit the Government access to the private telephone records of Qwest customers .
Mr. Nacchio made inquiry as to whether a warrant or other legal process had been secured in support of that request .
When he learned that no such authority had been granted and that there was a disinclination on the part of the authorities to use any legal process , including the Special Court which had been established to handle such matters , Mr. Nacchio concluded that these requests violated the privacy requirements of the Telecommunications Act .
Accordingly , Mr. Nacchio issued instructions to refuse to comply with these requests .
These requests continued throughout Mr. Nacchio's tenure and until his departure in June of 2002 .
[ my emphasis ]
In other words , the Administration made a request in fall 2001 for " access to the private phone records of Qwest customers . "
If Stern means " fall " at all literally , then this request came after 9/11 -- and it could well match the October 2001 time frame described for the start date of the warrantless wiretap program .
Stern 's reference to the Telecommunications
Act makes it clear that this data relates to domestic customers .
Now , Stern is responding directly to the USA Today article that exposed the domestic aspect of this program , and which made the following specific comment about Qwest .

In the UK :
In early November about 30 animal rights activists are understood to have received letters from the Crown Prosecution Service in Hampshire inviting them to provide passwords that will decrypt material held on seized computers .
The letter is the first stage of a process set out under RIPA which governs how the authorities handle requests to examine encrypted material .
Once a request has been issued the authorities can then issue what is known as a Section 49 notice demanding that a person turn the data into an “ intelligible ” form or , under Section 51 hand over keys .
Although much of RIPA came into force many years ago , the part governing the handing over of keys only passed in to law on 1 October 2007 .
This is why the CPS is only now asking for access to files on the seized machines .
Alongside a S49 notice , the authorities can also issue a Section 54 notice that prevents a person revealing that they are subject to this part of RIPA .
Dogs and the Environment By Arnold Kling
John Whitehead discusses environmental taboos , including plastic bags and not cleaning up after your dog .
Actually , I think that where I live , at least 10 percent of dog - owners do not clean up after their dogs .
But I want to raise an even larger question .
Which do you think takes a bigger toll on the environment , owning a dog , or owning an SUV ?
My bet would be on the dog .
I ’m thinking of all of the resources that go into dog food .
You could argue that children also consume a lot of resources , but that is different .
A dog does not have the potential to discover a cure for cancer .
A dog is not going to provide for you in your old age .
I personally have nothing against dogs .
But it does seem to me that environmentalism inevitably points toward a policy of extermination of pet dogs .
Unless environmentalism is simply hatred of industry .
As Wall Street rallied this week , it seemed that investors were taking comfort in the notion that the economy had become so imperiled by the crumbling housing market that it was forcing the government to finally mount an aggressive rescue effort .
Investors found reassurance yesterday in talk that the White House was brokering a deal with banks that could diminish a looming tidal wave of home foreclosures .
Soothing words from the Federal Reserve earlier this week revived the hope that more interest rate cuts are on the way , drowning nervousness in a din of buying .
“ The market now feels comfortable that the Fed has come to appreciate the severity of the situation , ” said Robert Barbera , chief economist at the brokerage and advisory firm ITG .
“ The bad news gives you the blessing of lower interest rates . ”
But even as investors took heart in palpable signs that the government was preparing to dole out more medicine for the ailing economy , a number of economists cautioned that the pain itself was still unfolding , with its ultimate magnitude far from known .

When Princeton economist Alan Krueger saw reports that seven of eight people arrested in the unsuccessful car bombings in Britain were doctors , he was n't shocked .
He was n't even surprised .
" Each time we have one of these attacks and the backgrounds of the attackers are revealed , this should put to rest the myth that terrorists are attacking us because they are desperately poor , " he says .
" But this misconception does n't die . "
Less than a year after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , President Bush said , " We fight against poverty because hope is an answer to terror . "
A couple of months later , his wife , Laura , said , " Educated children are much more likely to embrace the values that defeat terror . "
Former World Bank President James Wolfensohn has argued , " The war on terrorism will not be won until we have come to grips with the problem of poverty , and thus the sources of discontent . "
The analysis is plausible .
It 's appealing because it bolsters the case for the worthy goals of fighting poverty and ignorance .
But systematic study -- to the extent possible -- suggests it 's wrong .
" As a group , terrorists are better educated and from wealthier families than the typical person in the same age group in the societies from which they originate , " Mr. Krueger said at the London School of Economics last year in a lecture soon to be published as a book , " What Makes a Terrorist ? "

March 30 , 2008
Muqtada al - Sadr , an Iraqi Shia leader , has called on Arab states to support his militia ’s battle against " US occupation " , amid continuing clashes between armed Shia groups and Iraqi government forces .
His remarks on Saturday came as Nuri al - Maliki , Iraq ’s prime minister , called Shia militias in the southern city of Basra " worse than al - Qaeda " .
At least 270 people have reportedly died since an Iraqi military crackdown in Basra sparked fighting across the country .
Al - Maliki , who is personally supervising the operation in Basra , has said that Iraqi forces would not leave " without restoring security and order " .
" We will continue to stand up to these gangs in every inch of Iraq , " he said in remarks broadcast on state - owned television on Saturday .
" There are some among us who are worse than al - Qaeda .
Al - Qaeda is killing innocents , al - Qaeda is destroying establishments and they [ Shia fighters ] also , " he said .
Late on Saturday , the Baghdad military command extended the curfew in the capital indefinitely .
The curfew , which was imposed late on Thursday , was originally set to expire on Sunday at 5 am ( 0200 GMT ) .
James Bays , Al Jazeera ’s correspondent in Baghdad , said : " The curfew shows that the government is extremely nervous .
" Sunday should be a normal working day here in Iraq and I think they wanted to lift the curfew so that people could go about their normal business , " he said .
Basra fighting Police in Basra said on Sunday that 163 people have been killed and about 500 injured in sporadic clashes in the city between government forces and militias since Tuesday .
In the southern city of Nasiriyah , 67 people have been killed and another 137 wounded , local officials said .
At least 10 mortars fell into Baghdad ’s fortified Green Zone as sporadic fighting continued overnight into Sunday .
Bays told Al Jazeera that there is no evidence that a major Iraqi military operation is under way in Basra . " [ Iraqi forces ] are having to rely , to an extent , on air power provided by … British and American aircraft and Predator unmanned aircraft with Hellfire missiles , " he said .
" Al - Maliki says he will stay and that his men will fight to the end , but this operation looks like it is getting bogged down . "
British artillery Tom Holloway , British military spokesman for Iraq , told Al Jazeera that British forces in Basra had fired artillery rounds at people they had identified as opposition fighters .
" We ’ve been firing in support of Iraqi ground forces .
They ’ve been in contact , they ’ve requested support from the coalition and artillery on a couple of occasions has been deemed the most appropriate response . "
" We use our surveillance assets and conduct a collateral damage assessment .
Obviously , once we ’ve positively identified the target we make an assessment that we are able to attack it , " he said .
Holloway said that British involvement in the operation is " entirely in line with the agreements with the government of Iraq " , known as operational overwatch .
Iraqi police said that eight civilians were killed and seven wounded in an air raid by US aircraft on a house in Basra on Saturday .
US forces said they had killed 48 fighters in air strikes and gun battles across Baghdad on Friday .
Scores of people are also reported to have been killed in fighting in other towns across the south of the country .
Fighting has also been reported in the central city of Karbala .
Mahdi Army targeted
The Basra crackdown is aimed at disarming the city ’s warring Shia militias , including the Mahdi Army of al - Sadr , as well as crushing a number of criminal gangs .
In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera , al - Sadr called on the Arab League , the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations to recognise " the Iraqi resistance " .
" I appeal to these parties to add legitimacy to the resistance and to stand by , not against , the Iraqi people because the Iraqi people need Arabs as much as they need any other person , " he said .
" The occupation is trying to divide Sunnis and Shias .
It is trying to drive a wedge between Sadris and the Sunnis .
I love the Sunnis .
I am a Shia , but we are all Iraqis .
" Iraq is still under occupation and the United States ’ popularity is reducing every day and every minute in Iraq .
" I call , through Al Jazeera , for the departure of the occupying troops from Iraq as soon as possible . "
Meanwhile , fighters loyal to al - Sadr rejected the prime minister ’s call to disarm .
" Al - Sadr has told us not to surrender our arms except to a state that can throw out the occupation , " Haider al - Jabari , a member of the Sadr movement ’s political bureau , said .
On Thursday , al - Maliki said that Basra residents would receive a " reward " if they handed in " heavy and medium - size weapons " .
However , in Baghdad an official from al - Sadr ’s bloc said Iraqi soldiers had attempted to hand their weapons over to him .
" We told them they should keep their arms .
We gave them a Quran and they went back , " Salman al - Afraiji said .
Restrictions review A curfew is in place in the capital , with restrictions set to be reviewed by the military command on Sunday .
Ahmed , a resident of Sadr City , home to two million people , said the situation was deteriorating .
" The hospitals are overflowing with wounded .
They ca n’t take any more .
Even the medical stores are closed , " he told the AFP news agency .
" There is no electricity , no water or fuel .
We are afraid of gun battles .
The main markets are also closed . "
Qassim Mohammed , a spokesman for Baghdad health directorate , said in Sadr City : " Seventy - five people have been killed and 498 wounded in clashes in Sadr City in the last four days . "
He accused American forces of " creating obstacles " in transporting victims of the violence to safety .

UnconfirmedSources.com , Kamal El - Din — [ … ] report that the High School Republicans ’ Shadow Congress has voted on and approved articles of impeachment on President George W. Bush .
The High School Republicans ( HSR ) impeached the President over a massive tax hike he signed into law when he approved the recent $ 69 billion tax cut for wealthy individuals .
A provision in the bill will increase taxes on college funds held by 14 to 17 year olds by up to 300 % .
The law would increase the tax rate on children ’s assets from there own rate to the rate of there parents and is expected to strip $ 2.2 billion from college savings accounts over the next ten years .
“ The bastard had it coming . ” Says National HSR President Brendan Whitebread .
“ This tax hike on young peoples ’ college savings is total bullshit .
The fact that he is raising taxes on us so our parents can get yet another vacation home is a betrayal of conservative Republican values .
I voted to impeach this bastard who vowed in 1999 to ‘ veto any tax increase ’ .
Well Mr. Bush , you are a liar and do not deserve to ohold the office of President . ”
The vote to impeach the President came during the HSR ’s annual Shadow Congress which is held in Washington D.C. every year .
During the week long event HSR members from all fifty states come and vote on issues that face Republicans that are too young to vote , but want to express their heart felt political views .
The HSR congress has been a great source of support for Mr. Bush in the past , but these recent events show there support is conditional on the President voting correctly on their issues .
“ This is a very serious blow to the President and by extension the Republican dominated Congress . ” Said David Brooks during a recent taping of the News Hour with Jim Leher .
“ This group of supporters is the future of the party and they are mad , as they should be .
The President has gone back on his word not to raise taxes and has done it a group that really has no recourse but speak out publicly on the issue .
This is a big mistake by the President and the Congress and one that could cost them dearly in the next election . ”
While the vote to impeach the President by the High School Republicans is in no way binding it does present an ominous signal to A White House that is alienating it ’s core constituents .

Shafkat Munir admitted fabricating his own death
Shafkat Munir , 26 , from Blackburn , Lancashire , produced a false death certificate to the authorities after speed cameras snapped him three times .
He admitted perverting the course of justice and was jailed last week for 12 months , and banned from driving .
John Davies , of Lancashire 's Road Safety Partnership , said Munir 's con was " almost unbelievable " .
" Munir 's licence was clean before this spate of incidents and he would have still been able to drive - I have never known anyone go to such lengths , " Mr Davies added .
" Excess speed is at least partly to blame for one in three deaths on Lancashire 's roads and speed limits are in place to protect us . "
Certificate inaccuracies
Munir was first caught speeding in January last year on the M55 in Lancashire by doing 66 mph on a 50 mph stretch .
Then he was snapped by a camera doing 36 mph in a 30 mph zone on Preston New Road in Blackpool .
The third time was in Rotherham , South Yorkshire , when he was doing 41 mph in a 30 mph zone .
A man claiming to be called Rashid Hussain contacted the parking office , claiming that Munir had died in Pakistan in 2002 .
A death certificate in Urdu was sent in , but inaccuracies were found .
Guilty plea
When police called a number given by Rashid Hussain , the recipient confirmed he was , in fact Munir .
He admitted fabricating the story to avoid paying the fines .
At Preston Crown Court Munir admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice and was given three 12 - month prison sentences , to run concurrently .
He was banned from driving for 18 months .
Mr Davies added : " All credit to investigating officers across the forces for their determination to bring this man to face justice .
" Those caught speeding will be prosecuted and may well trigger investigations into previous offences if the slightest suspicion is raised . "
Two academics say that tests run by the state of Florida to determine what went wrong with e-voting machines in the disputed Congressional District 13 race were badly designed , and the results are essentially useless .
They 've released their response ( . pdf ) detailing problems with the tests – which some have touted as evidence that there was nothing wrong with the machines , made by Election Systems & Software ( ES&S ) .
For those who have n't been following the issue closely , a little background : Some 18,000 ballots cast on the touch - screen machines did n't record a vote in the CD - 13 race between Democrat Christine Jennings and Republican Vern Buchanan .
Buchanan won the race by fewer than 400 votes and was sworn into Congress .
Jennings is calling for a re-vote because hundreds of voters claimed they had problems with the machines – although they voted for Jennings or Buchanan , when they reached the review screen at the end of the ballot it showed no choice selected in the CD - 13 race .
These are the voters , of course , who caught the problem .
The Jennings camp says there are likely voters who never looked at the review screen or did n't look closely enough to see that no vote appeared on the review screen before casting their ballot .
So Florida conducted two tests – a mock election on ten machines
( five used in the election and five set up for the election but never actually used ) and a review of the source code .
According to the reports the testers released in January , they found nothing wrong with the machines in either the hands - on test or the source code review to account for the high undervote rate in that race .
Now David Dill at Stanford and Dan Wallach from Rice University have released their response to the Florida reports .
Among the problems :
The testers examining the machines defined acccuracy as a machine making a correct electronic copy of the review screen .
Dill and Wallach say this ignores whether the review screen itself is correct .
If a voter touched the machine to vote for a candidate and the vote showed up on the ballot page but not on the review screen , the machine would still be considered accurate , according to the Florida testers , if it copied the error on the review screen .
The testers did n't test for latency issues with the screens .
Numerous voters complained they had to touch the screens repeatedly or with extra pressure to get it to register their selection .
The tests were n't designed to look for that , however .
Dill and Wallach say that on videos of the state testing there were several instances when a tester had to touch the screen more than once to get it to register .
That 's not , however , reflected in the state 's report .
The state did n't test for calibration errors , although there were voters who complained about selecting one candidate and having a vote for another candidate appear .
The testers examining the source code did not verify that the compiled binary executable code used on the machines during the election was consistent with the source code they examined .
You 'll find the state 's two reports here ( .pdf ) and here ( .pdf ) .
When I was in college , one of the jobs I had was a TA for an intro programming class .
For one of their projects , I was asked to whip up a kind of web browser “ shell ” in Java .
The basic idea was to make a browser that would be highly extendable by students , while freeing them from worrying about the overall rendering framework .
Now , the first language that I learned was Smalltalk , which has historically been relatively design - pattern - free due to blocks and whatnot , and I had only learned Java as an afterthought while in college , so I coded in a slightly unorthodox way , making use of anonymous inner classes ( i.e. , shitty lambdas ) , reflection , and the like .
I ended up with an extremely loosely coupled design that was extremely easy to extend ; just unorthodox .
When I gave it to the prof , his first reaction , on reading the code , was …utter bafflement .
He and another TA actually went over what I wrote in an attempt to find and catalog the GoF patterns that I ’d used when coding the application .
Their conclusion after a fairly thorough review was that my main pattern was , “ Code well . ”
That year , the class did n’t actually end up using any of the code I wrote , but a year or two after I quit being a TA for the course , they did .
I took a look at what became of what I wrote .
Needless to say , it now made extraordinarily heavy use of patterns everywhere — and had a massively larger code footprint as a result — but , after all , it ’s important to show the young peons how to use patterns .
( Euf … )
So , yes , I have to agree that dogmatic use of design patterns hurts , and that a new language wo n’t automatically eliminate that .
But I ’d like to believe that a language that does n’t take ten lines of code to invoke a method by reflection , or five lines to write what in any decent language would be a one - line lambda , would at least help .

Start Your Christmas Shopping Early
I know Halloween is just around the corner , but we ’re going to talk Christmas today .
After all , there ’s only two more months left until the big day .
Begin planning now for a frugal and stress - free Christmas .
Make a Plan
Every year my goal is to have all my Christmas shopping done by Thanksgiving .
I really hate the December shopping crowds , and I need to focus on other things in December .
I also hate the lines at the post office in December .
My timeline looks something like this : Finish shopping by Thanksgiving .
Also mail any out of town gifts by Thanksgiving .
On the day after Thanksgiving , our family puts up the tree and decorates the house .
I also begin addressing Christmas cards , with the intention of mailing them out the week after Thanksgiving .
That leaves my December free to attend holiday parties , bake with the kids , and just enjoy the season .
Manage Your Christmas Money
Hopefully at the beginning of the year , you opened up a savings account for Christmas .
If you used an online account , think about withdrawing the money , so you have it on hand to buy Christmas gifts .
Whether or not you have money in savings , this is also a good time to set a budget for Christmas .
In the excitement of the season , it ’s easy to overspend .
By writing out a budget , you can protect yourself from spending more than you can afford .
Be Aware While Shopping
While shopping at Costco yesterday , I took a little detour through the toy section .
Though I did n’t buy anything , I made a mental note of possible gift ideas for the kids .

I hate to post a photo like this because I actually really like the Dumpling House , but a reader sent us a photo that looks genuine .
Seems the other day some rats were clearly visible through the window .
Looks like there are three or four of them .
A closer look and update after the jump .
Sort of reminds me of the infamous rat episode in Taco Bell .
Update :
The reader just sent us an update with a message they received after they complained to Toronto Public Health :
Thank you for bringing this to our attention .
The Premise has been inspected and evidence of a rat infestation has been confirmed .
The restaurant has now been closed by Toronto Public Health .
Thanks to Matt A. for the tip
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Army is investigating the possibility three soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division who died in a firefight in Iraq may have been killed by friendly fire , according to U.S. military officials .
Those officials emphasized it is not yet certain how the soldiers were killed January 8 , but confirmed their families were notified of the friendly fire possibility .
The incident took place southwest of Samarra , when the unit , on patrol , discovered buildings filled with explosives and weapon - making material .
After further searching , they encountered more than a dozen insurgents fighting from a network of tunnels and trenches .
In the ensuing firefight , helicopters and other aircraft were called to attack targets .
The officials said it 's possible three of the troops died as a result of those airstrikes .
Do n't Miss Rice in Iraq to push political reconciliation
Pfc. Ivan Merlo , 19 , of San Marcos , California , and Pfc. Phillip Pannier , 22 , of Washburn , Illinois , died at the scene .
Sgt. David Hart , 22 , of Lake View Terrace , California , died later , the military said .

All About Iraq War • U.S. Army
January 2 , 2003 : Under a bright blue sky , John Timoney stood in front of city hall and formally accepted the job as Miami 's police chief .
He was taking over a deeply troubled department — that very week , 11 officers would stand trial for fabricating evidence and planting guns .
But the tough - talking Irishman with policing roots in the Bronx did n't seem fazed .
If anyone could clean up the department , it was Timoney .
He had sorted out significant problems as a top cop in both Philadelphia and New York .
One story had it that during the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia , he rode his patrol bicycle into a crowd of protesters — and the unruly mob smashed it over his head .
" It was a knock - down , drag - out fight , " the Miami chief said , laughing .
" Unfortunately I picked the biggest guy .
I should have picked the smaller guy . "
The story was classic Timoney :
It showed his strength , bravado , and dry wit .
It was also a lie — but more on that later .
Mayor Manny Diaz , City Manager Carlos Gimenez , and others lapped up Timoney 's stories ; he had star power .
Author Tom Wolfe was his friend .
So was New York 's Cardinal John J. O'Connor .
Timoney had lectured at Amherst College on Dostoyevsky 's Crime and Punishment .
He had even been called " America 's Best Cop " by Esquire in 2000 .
So that day at city hall , he addressed his new department 's problems head - on : " Every now and again police departments bring shame and embarrassment on their city .
Their negative actions reflect negatively on the city .
They bring unwanted national and international attention ....
This policing business is very important , and it is important that it be done right for the city and for its citizens , but also for the free , open democratic society we cherish .
In the process , we must strive to regain and maintain public trust and confidence so that the average citizen can point to the Miami Police and proclaim proudly : ' These are our police officers ; this is our police department . ' "
Everyone in the audience applauded wildly .
Exactly one week later Timoney would high - tail it to Washington , D.C.
He 'd spend three days at — where else ? — the Watergate Hotel while attending a policing conference .
Cost to Miami taxpayers : $ 1043 .
That trip was a harbinger .
There are many reasons why John Timoney should be fired .
He has trampled civil rights , from the 2003 Free Trade Area of the Americas protests to the soon - to - be - placed video cameras throughout downtown .
He accepted a free Lexus SUV from a local auto dealer and then lied about it .
And , according to the police union , he allowed subordinates to manipulate crime statistics to make it appear he 's doing a good job .
There 's also this : City cops hate him .
On September 4 , 520 of 650 police union members cast no -confidence votes against the chief .
All of that has been publicized .
But until now , no one has talked about perhaps his greatest sin .
He 's the city 's best - paid employee — with a compensation package worth more than $ 214,000 per year — but he 's not around much .
During four years and nine months in office , Timoney has been out of town for at least 138 days — not counting vacation .
During his 30 jaunts to places like Belfast and Los Angeles , he has stayed in the Wilshire Grand and the Mandarin Oriental .
Cost to taxpayers : more than $ 28,000 .
In 2005 , the year County Commissioner Art Teele shot himself in the Miami Herald 's lobby and Wilma ravaged Miami , Timoney was on the road for one of every five workdays .
In 2006 , while killings in the city skyrocketed by 41 percent , he took off for 30 days .
The information is documented in 200 pages of reimbursement forms , hotel bills , and other receipts provided by the city in response to public records requests .
And there might be much more .
Trips to Iraq to study security , to tour Guantánamo , and to Oklahoma for a speech to a small - town police force are n't included in the city file .
And Timoney is not required to report all absences to his superiors .
The chief did n't respond to repeated requests via telephone and e-mail seeking comment for this story .
His boss , City Manager Pete Hernandez , defends the prodigious travel .
" The chief is very well received nationally , and he 's a very good representative of the city , " says Hernandez .
" He 's done a good job elevating the level of respect given to the city of Miami . "
Former Miami Police Chief Ken Harms has a different take : " Outrageous .
Who the hell was it that was fiddling while Rome burned ?
How does it benefit policing in the city of Miami ?
This is about enhancing Timoney 's big - shot reputation . "
In 2003 , two months after Timoney 's trip to Watergate , he was on the road again .
This time it was Orlando , for a Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies meeting .
He spent $ 828 .
The chief seemed to be doing everything right back then , so nobody complained about the absence .
Soon after taking the job , he tightened police use - of - force policies , fired some officers , and moved the internal affairs department out of police headquarters to ensure fair investigations .
But then came May 2003 .
" Fuck Angel Gonzalez , " he said at Dinner Key after the Miami commissioner demanded some information .
Gonzalez sent a letter to City Manager Joe Arriola , who had become Timoney 's boss in March 2003 .
" I view his behavior as disgraceful conduct unbecoming of a police chief , " Gonzalez wrote .
City Commissioner Tomás Regalado , who had supported Timoney 's appointment , was also unimpressed : " I had very high hopes , but I have not seen any changes at all . "
Timoney did n't simply stand around and take that criticism .
In May he announced a Department of Defense - sponsored sojourn to Iraq to help set up a police academy .
That trip would be canceled because " the State Department was unable to work out the logistics , " according to a spokesman .
But in October he left for Philadelphia , the city where he had served four years as police commissioner .
He spent $ 2641 attending the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual meeting for six days while staying at the Marriott in the city 's center .
The defining event of Timoney 's tenure , the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) summit , came to Miami November 20 .
Police were on guard because of the massive riots that had taken place in Seattle during a 1999 World Trade Organization meeting and demonstrations during the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia , when Timoney was police commissioner there .
Hundreds of people were arrested at both .
" Timoney 's strategy during the RNC was to arrest as many people as possible , look good in front of the TV cameras , and deal with the Constitution later , " commented Kris Hermes , spokesman for a group that helped defend many of the demonstrators .
From FTAA 's start , Timoney locked down the city 's center .
Then he dispatched 2500 officers in riot gear against about 12,000 protesters .
The cops used rubber bullets , shields , batons , concussion grenades , and stun guns .
The " rough start , " Timoney would later explain , was needed because some demonstrators did n't have permits .
Sixty people were taken into custody ; many were beaten by cops .
At one point , Timoney jumped off of his patrol bicycle and yelled at a protester : " Fuck you !
You 're bad ! "
Nineteen - year - old Edward Owaki of Connecticut was linking arms with other protesters on Biscayne Boulevard when police barreled into the crowd and pinned him to the ground .
He suffered a severe head injury and was hospitalized for a week .
Free speech advocates were horrified .
One editorial writer from the St. Petersburg Times said , " The show of force would have made a Latin American dictator blush . "
Timoney responded with typical sensitivity .
His officers " demonstrated a tremendous amount of restraint , " he said .
Then he did what he knows best .
He split town .
On December 8 , less than three weeks after the last protester was dispatched , he took an eight - day trip to London and Belfast for the U.S. - U.K. Police Chiefs Conference .
He stayed at the Hastings Culloden Hotel in Belfast , which overlooks the coast and 12 acres of " beautiful , secluded gardens , " according to its Website .
The hotel 's slogan : " Built for a bishop ... Fit for a king . "
Amount spent on travel in 2003 : $ 6779
Days away from the city : 21
Fallout from the FTAA riots continued in 2004 .
Accountants totaled costs for security around $ 23.9 million .
The American Civil Liberties Union received 150 complaints alleging police abuse and filed six lawsuits on behalf of protesters in federal court .
( They are all still pending . )
The city settled for $ 180,000 with an independent filmmaker named Carl Kessler after he was injured by a police beanbag fired into his face .
And the Miami Civilian Investigative Panel issued a report criticizing cops for profiling and unlawfully searching protesters .
Yet the chief stood by his claim that his handling of the protests was a " success . "
And he was right — at least if you consider his frequent - flyer account .
During at least half of the 26 trips Timoney took after the FTAA summit , he was called up to discuss what became known as " The Miami Model " of crowd control .
In April that year , the chief was embarrassed when a Philadelphia judge dismissed the case against " The Timoney Three , " who had been arrested during the 2000 GOP convention after one had allegedly thrown a bicycle at the chief .
It was the story he told to local media while chuckling that first day on the job .
Called to testify , Timoney could n't identify his attacker .
Worse , a video showed the trio had cooperated with police before taking a beating .
In early June the chief took a three - day trip to Newark to speak at a conference on " domestic security preparedness . "
It 's unclear whether he was paid for that appearance or exactly what he spoke about .
He was out of town for virtually all of the latter half of the month as well , traveling to Washington , D.C. , for a Webcast on law enforcement use of force , and then jetting with Mayor Diaz to NYC for a Manhattan Institute forum .
Next he and Diaz headed to Boston , where they stayed at the Sheraton for the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
( " I guess he went with Manny Diaz just as a drinking buddy , " Commissioner Regalado would later say . )
In November Timoney headed to Los Angeles for his second International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference , at the city taxpayers ' expense .
He stayed at the Wilshire Grand for five nights .
Cost : $ 1224 .
He did n't bill us for his $ 171 bar bill — though he submitted it with his travel records .
The hotel bar , called Point Moorea , is described on its Website as a " unique upscale high - energy lounge styled after the popular tiki bars of the 1950s and ' 60s . "
On this trip , as most others , the chief received a fixed per diem of about $ 50 to $ 80 for food expense , depending on the city .
That same year Timoney came under fire from local black activists for keeping a black book of information on rappers and hip - hop artists ( including Ja Rule , 50 Cent , and Jacki - O ) who came to town for Memorial Day weekend celebrations .
Music industry executives said the police were " spying " and using the book to discriminate against people of color .
Timoney 's response :
He only intended it to keep police up - to - date on rap music 's warring factions .
In December the peripatetic policeman made for San Diego , where he stayed for two days at the Paradise Point Resort and Spa ( located on a private island complete with " tropical gardens " and " meandering lagoons " ) .
He was there to attend the Police Executive Research Forum and to participate in a talk called " Critical Issues in Policing . "
After all of that hard work , Timoney clearly needed sustenance .
So he took his executive staff out to lunch at his favorite Miami restaurant , Gordon Biersch , according to the Miami Herald .
He busted a purse snatcher during the revelry .
Amount spent on travel in 2004 : $ 5090
Days away from the city in 2004 : 23
The two hurricanes of 2005 did n't slow Timoney .
That year he left Miami at least 10 times :
Eight trips were reimbursed by the city , and two others — well , it 's unclear who paid for those because they are n't reflected in city records .
Not that he did anything but work during those absences .
On January 9 he stayed at the Grande Villas at World Golf Village in St. Augustine .
According to the Website , it 's a " country club - style vacation residence with every comfort and amenity . "
It 's also located adjacent to the World Golf Hall of Fame .
Timoney was there for the Florida Police Chiefs Association meeting .
A week later he attended a homeland security gathering in Washington , D.C. , and in February he spent two days with Mayor Diaz in Key West at the Hilton for the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
In May he visited Haiti for a few days to assess the police force , but taxpayers picked up only the $ 30 tab for the departure tax ; the Haitian Government paid for his hotel and food .
In June he flew off on British Airways to Scotland for a Leadership in Counter Terrorism summit .
He billed the city only for his $ 1161 airfare ; someone else apparently paid for hotels and meals .
He went to Guantánamo Bay in July , according to press reports .
( The trip does n't show up in city records . )
And in August he was a keynote speaker at a fundraising dinner for the Shawnee , Oklahoma Police Foundation ( that trip is n't in the records , either — and it's not clear how many days he stayed ) .
Then , just a few days after Hurricane Katrina knocked out power and created chaos in Miami , Timoney flew to New Jersey for three days to study closed - circuit television — it was a crime - fighting tool he was considering for the city 's downtown area .
" Timoney has dealt a tremendous blow to our civil liberties , " says Miami activist Max Rameau .
" I think he would be the happiest on some team in Iraq , crushing people who he thinks are terrorists . "
In September , Timoney went to a counterterrorism meeting in Belfast for 10 days , and three months later he attended a similar meeting in Boston .
He should have stayed home .
While the chief was out of town , two men in their twenties — Mike Fernandez and Sigfredo Garcia — were shot and critically wounded at a bus stop at NW 27th Avenue and West Flagler Street .
The men said a shooter had stalked them on the bus and hounded them for nude photos of Fernandez 's younger brothers .
Around that time , Timoney experienced family problems .
His son Sean was arrested in New York .
Police said the 25 - year - old had tried to buy 400 pounds of marijuana from an undercover federal agent .
The chief , who had not spoken with his only son for two years , at first did n't want to post bail , according to The New Yorker , which profiled the chief this past March .
" Just let him rot in there , " Timoney said of his son .
" I do n't give a shit . "
Eventually he put his Miami condo up as collateral for bail .
It was especially painful because his daughter Christine had had heroin problems in the past .
As the year ended , Morgan Quitno , a Kansas publishing company , ranked Miami - Dade the fifth most dangerous large region in the nation .
Amount spent on travel in 2005 : $ 5945
Days away from the city in 2005 : 46
Timoney took nine trips in 2006 .
Among the globetrotter 's destinations : D.C. ( four times ) , San Francisco , Ottawa , Atlanta , Las Vegas , and Orlando .
It was the year the Liberty City Seven — a group of alleged Al - Qaeda wannabes — were nabbed by the feds .
Timoney wasted no time in taking credit .
His mug was on CNN within hours of the arrests .
The chief 's brashness got him in trouble once again .
On February 12 , sometime around 1:00 a.m. , he was at a party sponsored by Ocean Drive magazine when two New Times editors heard him utter , " Fuck the Cubans . "
The newspaper reported the comment , and TV stations followed the controversy .
Predictably some Cuban politicians and officers called for the chief 's resignation .
Still , no one in city government seemed to care about the expense reports the chief was racking up — or if they did , no one mentioned it publicly or asked him to cut down on travel .
Rather than attending late - night parties or traveling around the country , fighting crime likely should have been the chief 's focus .
The number of violent deaths in the city increased from 56 in 2005 to a jaw - dropping 79 in 2006 .
Timoney acknowledged some rise in killings but claimed overall crime was down .
He told a USA Today reporter that downtown was " safe . "
But no one really knows how safe .
The city 's police union claims Timoney " cooked the books " on crime .
Some officers contend reports were changed or misclassified — a burglary into an information report or a robbery downgraded to a theft , for instance .
Timoney said it would take hundreds of people " conspiring " to change the stats , yet he did call for a Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the allegations .
And Fraternal Order of Police President Armando Aguilar also takes issue with Timoney 's rambling .
" He 's an absentee landlord , " Aguilar says .
" Miami should be his number one priority .
He sells himself as an expert on everything . "
City Manager Hernandez admits he has heard complaints about the chief 's absences — especially because Timoney relies on his number two man , Frank Fernandez , to run the department in his absence .
" The officers do n't feel comfortable with the deputy chief , " the city manager says .
Still , Timoney continues to hammer his message of homeland security .
At the end of 2006 , he announced a program dubbed " Miami Shield , " which , in the agency 's own words , " focus its efforts towards making soft targets within the community less vulnerable to terrorist actions . "
Some civil liberties groups , such as the ACLU , were wary of the plan because of its vagueness and potential for abuse .
Amount spent in 2006 : $ 7138
Days away from the city in 2006 : 30
City records show only two Timoney trips in 2007 : one in January to the Florida Police Chiefs Winter Conference in St. Augustine , and another in April to the Police Executive Research Forum conference in Chicago .
( Later in the year , Timoney would be named president of the board of directors of this organization . )
One journey was n't on the books .
Timoney visited Iraq for 10 days in July as part of a commission led by former General James Jones to study police security there .
And the chief jetted to Washington earlier this month to unveil the commission 's report and to speak to the National Press Club about the findings .
It 's unclear how he classified this time away from the city ; records show he has taken only eight hours of vacation this year .
The chief 's Iraq trip — and his subsequent Washington speech — were announced in the local media September 7 — just two weeks after the Lexus scandal was revealed by CBS 4 and days after the no-confidence vote .
The Iraq trip was " ridiculous , " says union President Aguilar .
In an online law enforcement forum called leoaffairs.com , people claiming to be Miami Police officers called Timoney " T$ , " for " T - Money , " and questioned why he needed to go to Iraq .
" The state of policing in Miami is truly in a sad state of affairs , " wrote a poster who called himself " John Wayne . "
" To find out that while crime in the City of Miami is rampant , people are getting carjacked , kidnapped , robbed , and burglarized , the chief of police is in Iraq conducting an assessment of the conditions there .
The citizens of Miami are not paying the chief to go to Iraq .
What they want to hear is that the police department is operating the way it should , and that police officers respect their leader 's credibility . "
Some , like activist Max Rameau , are n't that worked up about the recent scandals but are furious about the travel and soon - to - be- activated downtown security cameras .
" I think there 's plenty of reason for Timoney to be fired , but not because of the Lexus , " Rameau says .
" His priority is not necessarily Miami .
His priority is being some kind of national police chief . "
Rameau theorizes that people in Miami are so used to having incompetent chiefs — several , such as Donald Warshaw and Raul Martinez , were embroiled in scandal — that Timoney was at first considered a success .
" The fact that Timoney is efficient and effective , that 's more harmful to us , " Rameau says .
" It means that he 's able to screw us more effectively and efficiently . "
Asked whether he thinks the chief 's travel has been excessive , Hernandez pauses .
" I do n't think it 's excessive , but it 's probably above the norm , " he says .
But he adds that city leaders are going to crack down on travel in the coming year .
The city must cut some $ 30 million from its budget because of property tax reform .
Moreover the department 's travel budget reveals an ugly trend .
It spent $ 66,000 in 2004 - 2005 , almost doubled that the next year , and has requested 33 percent more than that for 2007 - 2008 .
On September 6 , Hernandez pledged to launch an independent study of Timoney and his relationship with the officers .
He 's also waiting to discipline the chief for his use of the free Lexus ( which he has since bought and apologized for ) until the state and county ethics commissions weigh in on the matter .
Timoney met with the ethics commission early this month , a day before he jetted off to Washington to give his Iraq assessment .
The FDLE is also looking into the SUV allegations and the crime statistics claim .
But Hernandez has other concerns about the chief .
" That vote of no confidence by the union concerns me , " he says .
" There 's a message that there is turmoil in the police department . "
The chief 's reaction is predictable :
He has another trip on the horizon .
On Monday , September 24 , Timoney is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the Worldwide Law Enforcement Consulting Group , Inc. 's conference on " proactive strategies for police management . "
It 's at the Marriott Hilton Head Beach and Golf Resort in South Carolina .
Says Lorne Battiste , one of the many FTAA protesters awaiting adjudication of a lawsuit against Timoney and the police department : " I 'm not surprised by anything that government officials do .
Why should anyone feel that they are above the law ?
The laws should be written for everyone . "
Amount spent in 2007 ( first eight months ) : $ 2413

Notes
One understands nothing about creationism unless one understands that it is meant to be a system of ethics .
That is why the assault on evolution has always included a lengthy history of moral judgments against evolution .
Perhaps none of these judgments has been more accusatory than the idea that Darwinism led to the Holocaust .
Such an idea is trumpeted in many creationist venues , including books and blogs .
A prime example of this accusation today is found in Richard Weikart 's From Darwin to Hitler : Evolutionary Ethics , Eugenics , and Racism in Germany ( 2004 ) .
[ 1 ]
Weikart is a member of the Discovery Institute who has devoted his career to elucidating the supposed immoral consequences of evolution .
For Weikart , the materialistic basis of evolutionary theory is responsible for the devaluation of human life in general .
In particular , the idea of the survival of the fittest leads to the devaluation or extermination of those considered " unfit " in society .
Death becomes a good thing insofar as it helps the species rid itself of unfit organisms .
The principal goal of all such anti-evolutionary moral arguments is to show that creationism , especially in its Judeo - Christian form , is a superior moral system .
Aside from exposing the historical flaws found in the work of Weikart , this essay demonstrates that the defense of genocide , infanticide and " eugenics " by creationists actually has a very venerable and lengthy tradition that precedes Darwin .
In fact , the most blatant defenses of genocide ever penned are still to be found among creationists .
Some of these defenders of genocide include Reuben A. Torrey , the famed fundamentalist apologist , William Lane Craig , Jonathan Sarfati , an Australian Young - Earth creationist with a Ph.D. in chemistry , and Glenn Miller , an American business executive who fancies himself to be a biblical scholar . [ 2 ]
Weikart 's book is premised on a very biased definition of " Christianity " or the " Judeo - Christian " tradition .
For example , Weikart tells us that " Christian theology taught the universal brotherhood of all races , who descended from common ancestors -- Adam and Eve . " [ 3 ]
He adds :
Before the advent of Darwinism in the mid-nineteenth century , there was no significant debate in Europe over the sanctity of human life , which was entrenched in European thought and law ( though , as with all ethical principles , not always followed in practice ) .
Judeo - Christian ethics proscribed the killing of innocent human life , and the Christian churches explicitly forbade murder , infanticide , abortion , and even suicide . [ 4 ]
Overall , Weikart has what we might term an " essentialist " view of Judeo - Christian tradition , which attributes to this tradition certain unchanging characteristics that makes it what it is .
In terms of ethics , Weikart tells us the difference between Darwinism and Christianity :
Darwinism 's contribution to the rise of moral relativism is even trickier .
Certainly many Darwinists proclaimed the death knell for Christian , Kantian , or any other fixed system of ethics , and they contended that moral relativism was a logical consequence of a Darwinian view or morality . [ 5 ]
For Weikart , some of the features of this " fixed system of ethics " in Christianity included opposition to these practices :
moral relativism
differential value of human life
infanticide , including by abortion
genocide
killing innocent human life
Weikart 's indictment of evolutionary theory , however , is premised on a very incomplete and distorted portrayal of Christian ethics and history .
Christianity is actually founded on moral relativism that is even more chaotic than secular systems of ethics .
Ephesians 2:15 tells us this about what Christ did to the Law of Moses : " by abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances , that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two , so making peace . "
In fact , from a traditional Jewish viewpoint , Christianity is founded on systematically destroying God 's laws as revealed to Moses , and so speaking of a Judeo - Christian tradition is also akin to speaking of a Capitalist - Marxist tradition . [ 6 a ]
Weikart 's claim that " brotherhood of all races " is a primary doctrine of Christianity can be decisively refuted not only on biblical grounds , but also on historical grounds .
Polygenesis had a long history in Christianity , and the Bible provides evidence that not everyone in history is a pure descendant of Adam and Eve . [ 7 ]
In Genesis 6 : 1 - 4 , for example , we find the story of the seduction or rape of human women by divine beings .
These unions produced mutant offspring called Nephilim , who became the earthly enemies of the Israelites ( Numbers 13:33 ) .
The Nephilim were to be killed or imprisoned ( see also references to the Anakim in Deuteronomy 2:10 - 11 ) .
For biblical authors , there were other qualities and events that prove to be more important than common descent from Adam and Eve in creating differentials in the value of human life .
For example , the Canaanites , who are also descendants of Adam and Eve , were cursed to indefinite slavery because of the sin of a single man , Ham , the father of Canaan ( Genesis 9:25 - 27 ) .
The belief that the sons of Canaan were cursed into slavery then resulted in justifying the enslavement of entire groups of people throughout Christian history , as has been amply documented .
Weikart attempts to whitewash slavery in the Judeo - Christian tradition thusly :
Even though some Christian groups , especially in lands with race - based slavery , developed theological justifications for racial inequality , most Christian churches believed that the people of other races were valuable and capable of adopting European religion and culture . [ 7 ]
The first euphemism to expose is Weikart 's use of the verb , " developed . "
The fact is that most Christians who believed in slavery in European history did not develop such an ideology .
They inherited this ideology from the Bible , which assumes the acceptability of slavery in both the Old and New Testaments ( see Leviticus 25:44 - 45 , Ephesians 6:5 , 1 Peter 2:18 ) .
Almost all lands in Europe accepted slavery of one sort or another until very recently .
In other words , slavery , which is based on the differential value of human beings , has been normative , not anomalous , for most of Christian history .
As even Weikart admits , racism also predated Darwinism . [ 8 ]
Indeed , Benjamin Isaac , an historian at the University of Tel Aviv , has made a powerful case that racism existed in classical antiquity .
He says that the " essence of racism is that it regards individuals as superior or inferior because they are believed to share imagined physical , mental , and moral attributes with the group to which they are deemed to belong , and it is assumed that they cannot change these traits individually . " [ 9 ]
That definition would apply to Canaanites and many other groups slated for extermination in the Bible .
These problems with Weikart 's version of history prompt us to see that unclear definitions are devices by which Weikart touts the ethical superiority of the Christian tradition .
For example , being against " killing innocent human life " is meaningless unless one knows how Weikart defines " innocent . "
In fact , I know of no religion or philosophy , theistic or atheistic , that would advocate killing " innocent " human life .
It is just that those who advocate killing anyone can define " innocent " very differently from how we might define it .
Indeed , neither biblical authors nor modern creationists believe that even children are always innocent victims .
Likewise , the forbidding of " murder " is meaningless unless one knows what Weikart means by that term .
In actuality , " murder " refers to a killing not acceptable to an individual or group .
Thus , killing in war is not regarded as " murder " for most nation - states , but it is regarded as murder by many Christian pacifists .
Some Christians regard the death penalty as " murder , " and some do n't .
Some Christians regard abortion as murder , and some do n't .
Thus , " forbidding murder " is no great accomplishment because every society and religion would also have categories of killing that would be unauthorized by the group in power .
While we do not deny that evolutionary theory was a factor in Nazi ideology , it is a mistake to see it as the main or only factor , given the long history of Christian anti-Judaism .
Christian anti-Judaism has a continuous history from its earliest days ( see John 8:44 ) , and so it is absurd to say that Darwinism was even necessary or sufficient to explain the Holocaust . [ 10 ]
The Holocaust was simply the latest and most violent spasm of repeated Christian anti-Judaism .
In particular , Weikart never mentions that Martin Luther ( 1483 - 1546 ) , the father of Protestantism , espoused a seven - point plan for the Jews in 1543 , hundreds of years before Darwin came on the scene .
For this reason , Luther 's plan bears repeating at length : [ 11 ]
First , to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn , so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them .
This is to be done in honor of our Lord and Christendom , so that God might see that we are Christians , and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying , cursing , blaspheming of his son and of his Christians ....
Second , I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed ...
Third , I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings , in which such idolatry , lies , cursing , and blasphemy are taught , be taken from them .
Fourth , I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb ...
Fifth , I advise that safe - conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews .
Sixth , I advise that usury be prohibited to them , and that all cash and treasures of silver and gold be taken from them for safekeeping ...
Seventh , I recommend putting a flail , an ax , a hoe , a distaff , or a spindle into the hands of young strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow , as was imposed on the children of Adam ( Gen. 3 [ : 19 ] )
Note that every single element , from killing disobedient Jews to consigning Jews to hard labor , is paralleled by the Nazi plan .
That is why even the Lutheran editor of Luther 's works was moved to make this statement :
It is impossible to publish Luther 's treatise today , however , without noting how similar his proposals were to the actions of the Nationalist Socialist regime in Germany in the 1930's and 1940's . [ 12 ]
It is no surprise , therefore , that Hitler specifically names Luther as one of his heroes .
As Hitler phrased it : " Beside Frederick the Great stands Martin Luther as well as Richard Wagner . " [ 13 ]
Darwin is nowhere to be found in this list of heroes .
Note that Luther 's murderous plan has mainly religious motives , not evolutionary theory , as justification .
The plan , Luther says , is to be enacted in honor of Christ and Christendom .
And , in fact , Hitler , like Luther , thought he was following God 's will : " Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator ; by defending myself against the Jew , I am fighting for the work of the Lord . " [ 14 ]
This statement alone eliminates the idea that Darwinism was the main or only rationale for Hitler 's actions .
Jonathan Sarfati , an Australian creationist and self - described convert from Judaism to Christianity , seems to believe that Luther 's plan was not as bad as what Adolf Hitler had in mind .
Let 's examine Sarfati's reasons :
Yes , we all know about Luther 's disgraceful attacks on Jews late in his life .
They should not be condoned , but Luther 's antisemitism was totally different to Hitler's .
Luther trashed anyone he saw as an opponent of the Gospel , and his choicest barbs were for the papacy .
Hitler cared nothing for the Gospel , and killed Jews just because they were Jews , including quarter of a million Jewish Christians .
He also intended to wipe out Christianity , as Nuremberg prosecutor William Donovan thoroughly documented . [ 15 ]
The first thing to notice is that Sarfati tells us not to condone Luther 's " attacks on Jews late in his life . "
Yet , he also tells us Luther is different from Hitler because " Luther trashed anyone he saw as an opponent of the Gospel ...
" Hitler , on the other hand , wanted to kill Jews just because they were Jews .
> In other words , specificity ( just killing Jews ) is differentiated from " generality " ( anyone who hates the gospel ) in deciding whether genocide is deemed better or worse .
Of course , Sarfati is factually incorrect or misleading in saying that Luther " trashed anyone he saw as an opponent of the Gospel . "
Luther has killing in mind ( " on pain of loss of life " ) , not just " trashing , " for Jews unwilling to accept some of his terms .
Furthermore , Luther never recommended a seven - point plan for Catholics or any other group .
He explicitly says he wants to burn the Talmud , not the sacred scripture of every other religion .
And if Luther is to be excused by the fact that his hatred was not just reserved for the Jews , then Hitler 's hate , by Sarfati 's logic , might be mitigated by the fact that he also did not reserve his hatred only for the Jews .
Hitler hated all enemies of the Aryan race , and so his hatred is not less generalized than that of Luther .
In any case , Sarfati seems to believe that hatred of all non-Aryans is somehow more opprobrious than hatred of all non-Christians .
And even if we were to accept Sarfati 's logic that Luther hated all enemies of the gospel , we would also have to conclude that Luther 's genocidal plan might encompasseven more people than just Jews .
After all , Luther might define the billion or so Muslims that now exist as people who hate the Gospel .
It is just that Luther did not have the lethal technology available to him that Hitler did .
Despite telling us that Hitler 's plan is different because he just hated Jews , Sarfati admits that Hitler also wanted to kill Christians .
He refers us to the work of William Donovan , the American military officer who documented Hitler 's war on churches .
The problem is that Sarfati confuses attacks on churches opposed to Nazi religious views with attacks on Christ or " Christianity . "
Rather , Nazis saw themselves as the bearers of the true Christianity , just as Luther saw himself as the bearer of true Christianity .
To illustrate this point , we need look no further than the writings of Alfred Rosenberg , a premier Nazi ideologist .
He used parts of the Bible as support in The Myth of the Twentieth Century : An Assessment of the Psychical - Spiritual Struggle of our Time , first published in 1930 . [ 16 ]
Rosenberg is best described as being against Christendom , or the organized religions such as Catholicism which had departed from what he believed to be the true teachings of Jesus .
Rosenberg advocated what he called " positive Christianity " ( positive Christentum ) , as opposed to the " negative " one represented by the Asiatic clergy . [ 17 ]
Rosenberg sought to purify Christianity by going back to its Nordic roots , an idea supported by Ernest Renan ( 1823-1892 ) , a well - known biblical scholar . [ 18 ]
Rosenberg thought that the Gospel of John best preserved some of the teachings of Jesus .
He commented thus : " The Gospel of John , which still bears an aristocratic spirit throughout , strove against the collective bastardization , orientalization and Judaization of Christianity . " [ 19 ]
Sarfati also fails to mention that any hatred of non-Nazi churches by Hitler would be equivalent to the hatred of non-Protestant churches by Protestants .
The attacks on Catholic churches that took place under Protestants were not considered an attack on Christianity as much as an attack on corrupt forms of Christianity .
In this respect , Hitler was not different from John Knox , who attacked the churches of rivals in Scotland , or from Henry VIII , who attacked Catholic monasteries in England . [ 20 ]
Likewise , Catholics who killed thousands of Protestants in the St. Bartholomew 's Day Massacre in Paris in 1572 did not see themselves as attacking " Christians , " but as attacking the enemies of Christ . [ 21 ]
And let us not forget how Sarfati , among others , wishes to excuse Luther 's plan because it is formulated late in life .
Sarfati leaves unexplained why formulating a hateful plan late in life is relevant or a mitigating circumstance .
Are we to believe that uttering something genocidal near the end of one 's life is more acceptable than in our youth ?
Can we call someone a good human being because he was good for 59 years , but just happened to plan a mass murder at 60 ?
If some mental disability is implied , could we not make the same argument for Hitler , who might have been suffering from some mental illness or drug addiction , as has been alleged ? [ 22 ]
In sum , Sarfati is arguing that the acceptability of a proto - Nazi policy depends on the identity of the perpetrator and the victim .
It is not genocide that is always wrong ; it is upon whom , and by whom , the genocide is perpetrated that makes it wrong or right .
In this respect , Sarfati is not much different from Ernest Haeckel , who is described by Weikart as follows :
It was not the killing that bothered Haeckel , but only the killing of the wrong people , which would stymie evolutionary progress and perhaps even cause degeneration . [ 23 ]
Genocide is acceptable if done for the reasons Sarfati finds acceptable .
Sarfati exhibits the moral relativism for which he and his creationist cohorts denounce Darwinism .
One also cannot ignore the unmistakable " evolutionary " view of Christianity that one finds among Christian creationists .
For them , Christianity represents the apex of religions .
Judaism is a fossil or an inferior version that was meant to culminate in Christianity .
Killing certain groups ( such as the Canaanites ) was acceptable because they might have stood in the way of the " salvation history " meant to culminate in Christianity .
Thus , " salvation history " has many of the same negative consequences for particular groups ( e.g. , Canaanites who threaten the chosen group ; anyone that stood in the way of the " goal " ) creationists attribute to evolutionary theory .
Weikart obliquely mentions the fact that German Darwinist geneticists championed the Nuremberg laws , which prohibited marriage between Germans and Jews in order to preserve Germanic blood purity . [ 24 ]
John P. Koster , a Christian apologist , is even more accusatory of Darwinism :
Two aspects of Hitler 's life really have to be considered at this point .
The first aspect is the way in which something resembling the atheist syndrome shaped Hitler 's own savagely distorted personality .
The second is the way in which Darwin and Huxley 's picture of man 's place in the universe prepared the way for the Holocaust . [ 25 ]
Two practical consequences of Nazi ideology are noted by Koster .
One is the passage of the Nuremberg Laws .
Another , outlined in the famous Wannsee Conference of 1942 , began the large scale movement of Jews to labor camps , where only the hardiest were to survive .
The labor camps were considered to be living laboratories for Darwin 's concept of the survival of the fittest .
But the specific idea of blood purity did not begin with Darwin .
Such a notion was already present in Christian ideas about Jews .
For example , the marriage of Christians and Jews was forbidden by the Council of Elvira already in the fourth century .
Juan Martinez Siliceo , the archbishop of Toledo , proposed legislation in 1547 based very specifically on what is called " limpieza de sangre " ( " cleanliness of blood , " " purity of blood " ) . [ 26 ]
Statutes enacted in Toledo in 1449 also focused on blood purity as a means to discriminate against Jews who had converted but were not Spaniards by " blood . "
Some of Hitler 's specific terminology for " purity of the blood " ( e.g. , " Reinhaltung des Blutes " ) corresponds quite closely to terminology ( limpieza de sangre ) applied against Jews in Spain .
Likewise , in Islam we find that blood is also believed to be the locus of genealogical relationships .
Thus , one Hadith speaks of Allah making blood sacred ( harrama...dima 'a ) . [ 27 ]
Hitler , therefore , probably mirrors Christian or Islamic ideas more than Darwinian ones here .
As far as I know , Darwin did not speak of " blood purity . "
In fact , the Bible , not Darwinism , has been the principal exponent of the most systematic ideology of genealogical purity inherited by western civilization .
One example is found in the story of the shock exhibited by Ezra , the priest , at how the Jews had mixed with foreigners :
Ezra 9:1
After these things had been done , the officials approached me and said , " The people of Israel , the priests , and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations , from the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites .
Ezra 9:2
For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons .
Thus the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands , and in this faithlessness the officials and leaders have led the way . "
Even if there is no understanding of modern genetics , it is clear that the author understands that the mixing of " seed " is a physical process .
Likewise , the author seems to think of " pollution " in material terms in prohibiting miscegenation :
Ezra 9:11 which you commanded by your servants the prophets , saying , ' The land that you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands , with their abominations .
They have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness .
Ezra 9:12
Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons , neither take their daughters for your sons , and never seek their peace or prosperity , so that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever . '
Ezra believed that this miscegenation would bring the wrath of God ( 10:14 ; see also Deuteronomy 23:3 - 6 ) .
Genealogical purity was supposed to maintain strength ( Ezra 9:12 : " so that you may be strong " ) .
> The solution was to send away the wives , even with children ( Ezra 10:3 ) .
Thus , family values here are subordinate to ethnic values . [ 28 ]
But viewing the mixing of seed as sin is not that different from Hitler 's view of miscegenation : " To bring about such a development is , then , nothing else but to sin against the will of the eternal creator . " [ 29 ]
Now , where would Hitler get the idea that miscegenation would be a sin against the eternal creator ?
Was it from Darwin 's books , or was it from the Bible to which creationists subscribe ?
And we see , very little difference , therefore between the biblical idea that certain groups were inferior by virtue of their genealogical identity , and Weikart 's observation that
One fundamental component of this Nazi worldview was human inequality , the notion that human beings have differing values depending on their biological characteristics . [ 30 ]
Recall also that Koster cites the Wannsee Conference plan to place Jews in labor camps , and then ignores that this idea is the last point of Martin Luther 's seven - point plan for the Jews .
Seen in this light , the Nuremberg laws are simply a continuance of Christian and biblical concepts .
Weikart tells us that Hitler " continually accused the Jews of greed , deceit , sexual deviance , and other immoral deeds , thereby justifying his view of them as an inferior race . " [ 31 ]
Not only are these charges parallel to charges made by Sarfati against the Canaanites , but Weikart has apparently forgotten that at least one of these accusations against the Jews can be traced back to Jesus in John 8:44 :
You are of your father the devil , and your will is to do your father 's desires .
He was a murderer from the beginning , and has nothing to do with the truth , because there is no truth in him .
When he lies , he speaks according to his own nature , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
Part of this verse ( Der Vater der Juden ist der Teufel = The Father of the Jews is the Devil ) from John was posted on road signs in some German towns . [ 32 ]
Recall also that Luther 's anti-Judaic tract is called " On the Jews and Their Lies . "
Thus , there is a clear continuous portrayal of Jews as liars in Christian history from John to Hitler .
Weikart 's assault on evolutionary theory is part of a larger assault on " materialism " that permeates creationist literature .
According to creationists , the idea that life originates from purely physico - chemical processes leads to the devaluation of human life .
That materialistic world - view , argue creationists , is why we have abortion , among other ills , in modern society .
Yet , the opposite may be more often the case .
Creationists often have a pneumatocentric view of life that can devalue the human body .
A pneumatocentric view of life , which is unique to religion , means that the welfare and salvation of the non-material soul has priority over bodily well - being .
We find a classic expression of this idea in Matthew 10:28 :
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul ; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell .
Likewise , the author of 1 Corinthians 5:8 advises this punishment for a congregation member who has sinned : " you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus . "
Indeed , the Muslim hijackers who flung themselves into the World Trade Center on 9 - 11 cared little for their bodies .
It was their souls that they wanted to preserve intact .
A pneumatocentric view of life can logically result in the advocacy of abortion .
The reason is that many creationists believe that fetuses and those who die in infancy go directly to heaven .
For example , Louis T. Talbot ( 1889 - 1976 ) , a former chancellor of Biola College , a creationist mecca , answers a question concerning the destiny of those who die in infancy as follows :
Yes , all infants , including stillborn babies , and young children who have not reached the age of accountability at death , go immediately into the presence of God . [ 33 ]
That would mean that abortion should result in a 100 % salvation rate for fetuses who are aborted .
Abortion would also eliminate completely the risk of sending aborted fetuses to an eternal torture in hell .
So , by this logic , creationists should be for abortion , not against it .
In fact , Reuben A. Torrey ( 1856 -1928 ) , a famous creationist , nearly comes to this conclusion when explaining why killing Canaanite children was justified :
Even today I could almost wish that all the babies born into families of wicked influence might be slain in infancy , were it not for the hope that some concerned Christian will carry to them the saving gospel of the Son of God . [ 34 ]
Yet , even this wish is illogical if all dead infants go directly to heaven .
Torrey substitutes a risky hope of salvation through the gospel for what is the certainty of salvation through abortion or infanticide .
If creationists object that it is murder to commit an abortion , then we need to understand that Exodus 21:22 does not seem to regard the value of a fetus as equal to that of an adult .
If a fetus is lost by an accidental human action , only a fine is imposed , whereas adults killed accidentally may require life for life ( Numbers 35:22 -34 ) .
Yet , let 's suppose that creationists do not support abortion to save souls because they deem it murder to perform abortions .
But even if abortion be regarded as murder , the fact remains that one abortion doctor could send a thousand souls to heaven in his lifetime .
One still would gain 1000 souls for every doctor lost because of performing abortions .
Abortion would still be a better method of saving souls than what anti-abortionists favor now ( let the children grow up and hope they convert ) .
The economics of soul - saving favor abortion no matter how we calculate it .
By the same token , a materialist view of life may be somatocentric -- a view in which the body is the only and most valuable part of a person .
Such a view can lead logically to valuing human life .
Evolutionist materialists may try to make the most of the life they have on earth rather than sacrifice their earthly life for an afterlife that cannot be verified to exist .
Valuing genetic diversity can lead to valuing the preservation of life .
Thus , it is religious pneumatocentrism , not evolutionary theory , that can lead to senseless sacrifices of human life .
If every creationist might not be willing to defend Luther , it is different when it comes to biblical genocide .
Indeed , all creationists defend biblical genocide in both the Hebrew Bible , which Christians call the Old Testament , and in the New Testament .
First , there is little dispute among academic biblical scholars ( Jewish , Christian or secular ) , or even among creationists , that genocide is the proper term for the practices evinced in some biblical texts .
This is clearly reflected in Show Them No Mercy : 4 Views on God and Canaanite Genocide ( 2003 ) , a book edited by four Christian conservatives . [ 35 ]
Among the most important of these genocidal biblical texts is Deuteronomy 20:16 - 18 :
Deut .
20:16
But as for the towns of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance , you must not let anything that breathes remain alive .
Deut .
20:17
You shall annihilate them -- the Hittites and the Amorites , the Canaanites and the Perizzites , the Hivites and the Jebusites -- just as the LORD your God has commanded , Deut .
20:18 so that they may not teach you to do all the abhorrent things that they do for their gods , and you thus sin against the LORD your God .
And this text against the group called the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15 :
1. And Samuel said to Saul , " The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel ; now therefore hearken to the words of the LORD .
2 . Thus says the LORD of hosts , " I will punish what Am'alek did to Israel in opposing them on the way , when they came up out of Egypt .
3 . Now go and smite Am'alek , and utterly destroy all that they have ; do not spare them , but kill both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass . "
Christians , in particular , have been more reticent to define certain New Testament passages as genocidal or even as violent .
Consider the violence that Jesus plans for the enemies of Christians at the last judgment .
Matt .
25:41
Then he will say to those at his left hand , ' You that are accursed , depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels ...
Matt. 25:46
And these will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . "
As I have argued elsewhere , some New Testament authors actually advocated a type of violence that was much higher , in both quality and quantity , than what is found in the Jewish scriptures .
The Old Testament god may often wish to injure or kill you , but only up to the limits of your earthly lifetime .
The New Testament advocates eternal torture by fire .
Imagine Hitler saying that he did not want to kill Jews in ovens , but rather just torture them forever in ovens , and you would see the moral depravity of such an idea .
In fact , most creationists forget that the burning of opponents is a punishment advocated by the Bible , not by Darwin 's books .
Recall that Weikart believes that Christianity taught the universal love of all humanity .
But the fact is that " love " itself can be defined in such a way as to render genocide a loving act .
Consider this passage , from R. A. Torrey , one of the contributors to The Fundamentals , a series of anti-evolutionary tracts that helped popularize the name " fundamentalist " :
The extermination of the Canaanite children was not only an act of mercy and love to the world at large ; it was an act of love and mercy to the children themselves . [ 36 ]
Indeed , Christian " love " has been a very common defense for violence throughout Christian history .
Moreover , some creationists even use medicalized language , quite similar to that of Nazi ideologues , to explain the necessity of genocide of the Canaanites .
Gleason Archer , a renowned evangelical creationist , phrases it thus :
Just as the wise surgeon removes dangerous cancer from his patient 's body by use of the scalpel , so God employed the Israelites to remove such dangerous malignancies from human society . [ 37 ]
Archer has no trouble thinking of Canaanite children as being part of the " malignancy " that had to be removed .
Another approach to defending biblical genocide centers on the charge that the Canaanites deserved it because they were sinful .
Glenn Miller provides such a rationale in a lengthy blog post titled : How could a God of Love order the massacre / annihilation of the Canaanites ? [ 38 ]
Specifically , Miller says that the Canaanites deserved the killing of their women and children because they engaged in these activities :
Child sacrifice
Homosexual sex
Incest
First , let 's recall that the very notion that " sin " and sexual depravity can justify genocide is also similar to Hitler 's rationale in combating miscegenation : " To bring about such a development is , then , nothing else but to sin against the will of the eternal creator . " [ 39 ]
Hitler , it should be observed , also wanted to eliminate homosexuality , something that marks him again as more similar to some biblical authors ( e.g. Leviticus 20:13 ) than he is to Darwin .
Moreover , Miller assures us that God treats everyone the same for such sins :
And God allowed no double standards .
When Israel began to look like ' Canaanites ' , God judged them IN THE SAME WAY ... and ' vomited ' them from the Land as well .
This expulsion was also accompanied by the harsh measures of warfare faced by the Canaanites . [ 40 ]
However , the Israelites were not treated the same as the Canaanites .
The Canaanites were to be completely annihilated ( Deuteronomy 20:16 : " you must not let anything that breathes remain alive " ) not just expelled from the land .
There is no similar punishment that demands that , when a Hebrew commits a sexual sin , all Hebrew women and children should be killed so that nothing is left of them .
If incest is a reason for genocide , it does not appear to be so in the case of Abraham , regarded as of the most blessed man on earth , despite the fact that he married his half - sister ( Genesis 20:12 ) , and had multiple sexual partners ( Hagar and Sarah in Genesis 16 ) .
Moreover , incest with a sister or a half - sister is to be punished by death according to the Mosaic law ( Leviticus 20:17 ) , which would have applied to Abraham , who married " the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother " ( Genesis 20:12 ) .
So Miller ends up trying to convince us that a whole city , including children , should be burned in Sodom ( Genesis 19 ) because God did not like certain sexual acts to be performed , but yet God blesses a man that commits sexual acts that are explicitly prohibited in the Mosaic law .
If the objection is that the Mosaic law was not in effect at the time of Abraham , then we should note that it was also not in effect at the time of Sodom 's demise .
God is the biggest moral relativist of all in biblical literature .
Miller 's justification of Canaanite genocide is premised on the idea that child sacrifice is unconditionally repugnant to the biblical God .
Miller forgets that child sacrifice may have been perfectly acceptable to the biblical god , something demonstrated in painstaking detail by Jon Levenson , the Albert A. List professor of Jewish Studies at Harvard Divinity School .
In his brilliant treatment , The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son ( 1993 ) , Levenson states that " only at a particular stage rather late in the history of Israel was child sacrifice branded as counter to the will of YHWH and thus ipso facto idolatrous . " [ 41 ]
He points to Ezekiel 20:25 - 26 , as one example where Yahweh says :
[ 25 ]
Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life ; [ 26 ] and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first - born , that I might horrify them ; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD .
But of which statutes is Yahweh speaking when referring the sacrifice of a first - born son ?
That statute may be the one in Exodus 22:29 - 30 :
[ 29 ]
" You shall not delay to offer from the fulness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses .
" The first - born of your sons you shall give to me . [ 30 ]
You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep : seven days it shall be with its dam ; on the eighth day you shall give it to me .
As Levenson observes , many Christian and Jewish scholars have tried to mitigate or eliminate the obvious meaning of these passages .
But even Moshe Greenberg , author of a major commentary of Ezekiel , and who otherwise minimizes the idea that normative Yahwism engaged in child sacrifice , admits :
The polemic against child sacrifice ( to YHWH ) in Deut. 12:29 ff . ; Jer 7:31 ; 19:5 , 32:35 indicates that at least from the time of the last kings of Judah it was popularly believed that YHWH accepted , perhaps even commanded , it . [ 42 ]
For Levenson , it was late texts that sought to substitute animals for actual human first - born sons .
Genesis 22 , which shows
Yahweh substituting a ram for Isaac , is part of a late biblical tradition .
Indeed , in Genesis 22 , Abraham seems to presume that child sacrifice is not an impossible request , and it is the substitution of the ram that is unexpected .
For most of biblical history , Yahweh was not against child sacrifice per se , but rather against child sacrifice to other gods .
And , of course , Miller forgets that sacrifice of a son is the foundation of Christianity .
After all , Jesus Christ is viewed as the only - begotten son of God , who must be sacrificed to redeem the world because of " love " ( John 3:16 ) .
Christ 's sacrifice is premised on the sort of blood - magic inherited from the ancient Near East .
This blood - magic is evident in Hebrews 9:22 : " Indeed , under the law almost everything is purified with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin . "
Christian creationists might claim that their god has the authority to order sacrifice , but this claim is no more verifiable than that of any other religion that practices human sacrifice .
Then there is the sheer logical absurdity of the pragmatics suggested by Sarfati and Miller , who argue that the Israelites had to kill Canaanite children because the Canaanites were killing their children .
This , of course , leaves unexplained why we have to kill the children , instead of killing the perpetrators of the infanticide .
Such a measure is , in fact , attributed by Tertullian , the famous church father , to a Roman official :
In Africa infants used to be sacrificed to Saturn and quite openly , down to the proconsulate of < Tiberius , who took the priests themselves and on the very trees of their temple , under whose shadow their crimes had been committed , hung them alive like votive offerings on crosses . [ 43 ]
This is a far wiser and most just punishment than killing children so that they will not be killed by their parents .
Such actions by the Romans refutes the usual apologetic mantra that Christianity was needed to finally stop such killings .
Furthermore , Miller 's suggestion violates at least one biblical commandment found in Deuteronomy 24:16 :
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , nor shall the children be put to death for the fathers ; every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
But , as usual , creationists often disregard their own scriptures or pick - and - choose scriptures that favor their view .
Whatever the biblical passages chosen , Miller wishes to convince us that it is logically acceptable to kill children because those children are being killed .
Creationists are not content to point to biblical texts that indict the whole of Canaanite culture .
Miller and Sarfati believe that there is archaeological evidence that proves every one of the charges made by biblical authors against the Canaanites .
Glenn Miller provides this supposed evidence in his aforementioned blog post , which is used as a reference by Sarfati . [ 44 ]
But the uninformed self - confidence of the amateur biblical scholarship evinced by both Miller and Sarfati becomes their own snare .
If we follow a traditional biblical chronology , the genocide of the Canaanites and Amalekites was ordered somewhere between the Exodus , which Miller dates at around 1400 BCE ( in opposition to most academic scholars ) , and the time of Saul , around 1000 BCE .
Therefore , we should expect that Miller would offer archaeological evidence for these Canaanite practices from that time .
However , Miller 's main evidence dates from after 800 BCE , and as late as the fourth century CE .
Moreover , most of the evidence is not from Canaan .
He tries to obscure this fact by saying " Canaanite culture ( in the broad sense ) , " but this is a meaningless description unless he defines " Canaanite " in the first place .
And , indeed , scholars cannot agree on what is " Canaan " or " Canaanite . " [ 45 ]
But , for the sake of argument , let 's accept the geographical borders for Canaan given in Numbers 34:1 - 12 .
These boundaries would include most of what we now call Lebanon , parts of Syria , and all of what is presently called Israel .
Yet , most of the evidence cited by Miller is not from Canaan at all .
Rather , Miller is referring mainly to evidence found in Punic and Neo-Punic sites in the Mediterranean lands and islands west of biblical Canaan .
" Punic " is the name given to the culture attributed to colonists from Phoenicia , which roughly corresponds to the area we know as Lebanon . [ 46 ]
But " Phoenicia " is itself a construct of Greek geographers , and there is no indication that the Phoenicians called themselves that or thought of themselves as a unified people .
It is true that many places in the western Mediterranean were colonized by Semitic - speaking peoples somewhere between 750 BCE until their subjugation by the Roman empire by the end of the Punic Wars .
It is true that many archaeologists do view Punic culture as a continuation of Canaanite culture .
But that opinion must be tempered by the fact that these sites also evince the presence of Greeks and other peoples .
Thus , it is not always easy to distinguish what is " Punic , " and , by extension , " Canaanite , " from what is not .
Shelby Brown comments , " By the fourth century the Levant had been so frequently invaded and culturally changed that it cannot really be considered ' Phoenicia . ' " [ 47 ]
Similarly , William F. Albright , who is now viewed as on the conservative side of modern biblical scholarship , even admits that :
The relatively late date at which the practice of < setting up commemorative stelae in connection with " tophet " sacrifices was introduced , makes it improbable that they were derived from Phoenicia proper . [ 48 ]
In any case , Miller cites the discovery of a tophet , a cemetery supposedly devoted to sacrificed infants , at Carthage in what is now Tunisia .
The word tophet derives from some references in the Bible to burning children in the valley of Hinnom outside of Jerusalem .
According to 2 Kings 23 , a king named Josiah ( ca. 642-609 BCE ) destroyed places of worship that were dedicated to gods other than Yahweh .
2 Kings 23:10 says :
And he defiled To'pheth , which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom , that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech .
Thus , using the word tophet at Carthage is already prejudicing the case because it assumes that the cemeteries at Carthage represent the same practice described in Jerusalem .
Moreover , the biblical record says that the tophet is a specific location in the valley of Hinnom .
With the possible exception of Isaiah 57:5 ( uses plural " valleys " ) , no other tophets are said to exist anywhere else .
We cannot overlook the fact that Harvard Professor Lawrence Stager , who was a principal modern excavator of Carthage , makes a strong case for the existence of child sacrifice at that site on the following evidence : [ 49 ]
Greco -Roman texts that mention child sacrifice among Punic cultures .
Inscriptions at Punic sites , especially those that mention the term mlk Osteology : " No skeleton has shown any signs of pathological conditions that might have caused death . " [ 50 ]
Yet , even if we were to accept all of this evidence , the problem remains that this does not confirm anything about supposed Canaanite practices ca. 1400 BCE when the orders were given .
Indeed , some scholars ( e.g. George Heider ) see any child sacrifice as an intra-Punic development . [ 51 ]
If so , anything done by the Neo-Phoenicians is akin to killing British women and children as punishment for crimes committed by the U.S. Army at Wounded Knee , South Dakota in 1890 .
Inscriptions with the term mlk are extremely difficult to interpret .
The term usually is assumed to mean the same as what is found in the Hebrew Bible ( e.g. , Leviticus 18:21 and 20:2 - 5 ) .
Two interpretations are usually found for mlk in the history of scholarship : 1 ) mlk is the name of the deity to which the offering is made ; 2 ) mlk is the technical term for the offering itself , regardless of to which god it is made . [ 52 ]
Miller makes much of the fact that the Phoenician phrase , mlk 'dm , might mean " the sacrifice of a man , " but he neglects to mention that this term has not been found thus far at Carthage , but at other places . [ 53 ]
In regard to the inscriptions at Carthage , even Stager admits " None refers explicitly to child sacrifice , only to vows made to Tanit . " [ 54 ]
Another problem with Miller is his uncritical use of anti-Canaanite ( or anti-Carthaginian / Phoenician ) sources .
Shelby Brown reminds us :
Stelae and the burials they commemorate represent the only primary evidence for the role of sacrifice in Carthaginian and Phoenician religion .
With the exception of quotations of the Phoenician Sanchuniathon by later authors , no Punic or Phoenician literature describing or explaining the rite has survived .
Our information consists only of descriptions of the enemies of Carthage . [ 55 ]
The fact that enemies of Carthage are the main source for the claim of child sacrifice is very important because it is well - known that rival cultures routinely accused each other of horrible behavior .
Indeed , Miller seems to ignore that it is precisely accusations of child sacrifice that were constantly being launched against both Christians and Jews in antiquity .
Such an accusation is reported by Tertullian ( ca. 155-230 ) , the famous church father , as follows :
We are said to be the most criminal of men , on the score of our sacramental baby - killing [ sacramento infanticidii ] and the baby - eating that goes with it and the incest that follows the banquet where the dogs are our pimps in the dark , forsooth , and make a sort of decency for guilty lusts by overturning our lamps . [ 56 ]
If we should not take such reports about Christians at face - value , we certainly should not do it for the Canaanites .
Moreover , the sources Miller cites are extremely late .
For example , he cites Eusebius , the famous Christian historian of the fourth century , to tell us about supposed Canaanite behavior some eighteen - hundred years earlier , around 1400 BCE .
But we could come to opposite conclusions by using sources that are just as late .
For example , there are well - developed Rabbinic traditions that tell us that the biblical passages cited by Miller as evidence of burning children should not be interpreted that way .
Consider Deuteronomy 18:10 as translated by the version ( NIV = The New International Version ) quoted by Miller .
Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire .
However , the word " sacrifices " is not the only possible translation of the Hebrew , which uses the phrase " he'ebîr ba'esh " also used in 2 Kings 23:10 to describe the activity at the tophet outside of Jerusalem .
This phrase may also be translated as " cause to pass through / over the fire . "
Thus , we also can translate Deuteronomy 18:10 as follows : " There shall not be found among you that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , " as does the King James Version ( and the NIV in a note ) .
And , according to many ancient Jewish commentators , " passing a child through fire " did not refer to burning a child IN a fire , but rather to a ritual more akin to fire - walking in Fiji or passing through lit torches .
Commenting in Deuteronomy 18:10 , the Talmudic tractate Sanhedrin ( 64a ) says : " There was a loose pile of bricks in the middle , and fire on either side of it . " [ 57 ]
Rashi , the medieval Jewish commentator , further elaborates on this interpretation in his commentary on the worship of Molek in Leviticus 18 and Deuteronomy 18:10 ,
" ... and this was the manner in which it was worshipped : that he ( the father ) handed his child ( lit. his son , but it applies to his daughter also ; cf. Deut. XVIII.10 ) over to the priests of the idol .
These lit two large pyres one opposite the other and made the child to pass on foot between the two pyres ( Sanh . 64a ) . " [ 58 ]
Yet , despite these problems , Miller assures us :
Archeological evidence is firm and growing .
Child sacrifice burial grounds are called tophet in the literature , and they occur throughout Palestine and the Phoenician empire .
Ahlstrom mentions sites " at ' Atlit , Tell el - Far 'a ( S ) and Tell el ' Ajjul in Palestine " ( HAP : 688 , n. 2 ) .
Miller is actually referring to a footnote in a book , History of Ancient Palestine ( HAP ) , by the late Gösta Ahlström , a biblical scholar who spent most of his career at the University of Chicago . [ 59 ]
But when one reads that footnote , we realize that Ahlström is simply citing an article by another scholar named Kurt Galling .
When we look at what Galling actually said , we find nothing that implies the presence of child sacrifice at Atlit , Tell el - Far'a or Tell el ' Ajjul .
Galling says :
Also on the Palestinian coast , south of [ Mt. ]
Carmel , three urn cemeteries are found . [ 60 ]
Galling then specifies that these three cemeteries are at Atlit , Tell el - Fara 'a and Tell Ajjul .
But these three " urn cemeteries " ( urnenfriedhöfe ) imply nothing about child sacrifice .
Nor does Galling refer to them as a tophet .
Because he is not a trained biblical scholar , Miller is not sufficiently critical of the interpretations that even Ahlström must be asked to justify .
It has long been known that there were a variety of means by which people in Canaan buried their dead .
Elizabeth Bloch - Smith summarizes them well : [ 61 ]
Simple graves
Cist graves
Storage jars ( Pithos ) burials
Anthropoid coffins
Cremation burials
In other words , the urns may represent cremation burials , and nothing at those sites tells us otherwise .
In fact , Galling himself provides a footnote to articles about " cremated burials . " [ 62 ]
An authoritative summary of the Tel ' Ajjul states : " There is some indication of Phoenician - style cremation burials in cemetery 1000 . " [ 63 ]
There is no indication of human sacrifice .
Prof .
Stager , on the other hand , overlooks that the vast majority of diseases do not leave evidence on bones .
Thus , one cannot , as Prof .
Stager does , use this lack of disease in the bones as evidence that these were healthy children .
Nor does Miller seem to realize that Jeffrey Schwartz , the official osteologist of the Carthage excavations has come to a very different conclusion about the manner of death of the infants at Carthage .
Schwartz says :
In fact , the statistics at present indicate that , on the basis of cranial and long bone measurements , approximately 81 percent of all individuals in my sample -- whether from single individual urns or double individual urns -- were late third - trimester fetuses ... These statistics imply that at least 54 percent , but possibly as many as 81 percent , of the individuals from my sample died of natural causes before they were cremated -- which means , of course , that most of the individuals in this sample had not been sacrificed in the sense of being victims of a blood - killing . [ 64 ]
Schwartz also explains the repeated presence of two individuals in the same urn differently from Stager .
The latter doubted that natural causes would have affected two children far apart in age in the same family .
Schwartz , however , believes that the individuals in the same urn are often so close in age ( months apart ) that they may not be from the same family at all . [ 65 ]
Miller also resorts to another well - worn device used by creationists :
The claim that opposition is " growing " against the view creationists oppose .
Again , this is a matter of not reading the scholarly literature with much depth .
In fact , we can easily find claims that any trend is the opposite of what Miller claims .
For example , in the authoritative Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible ( 582 ) , we find this statement :
Finally , it should be noted that an increasingly vocal body of European scholars is challenging the interpretation of the Punic remains as indicating any cult of child sacrifice . [ 66 ]
In tracing the history of the " Punic sacrifice " idea , Brien Garnand , who is compiling a massive data - base on these issues , believes 1987 marked the turning point away from the Punic sacrifice idea , even if he disagrees with that shift . [ 67 ]
Garnand notes that many scholars simply see that aspersion upon the Phoenicians as an instance of Western and Christian - inspired prejudice against other groups .
In that respect , it is very much like the negative ancient propaganda launched against Christians .
Regardless of whether these " revisionist " scholars are correct , the point remains that we could just as well find quotes that indicate a growing trend that is opposite of what Miller claims .
Another instance where Miller 's amateur research is evident is in his appeal to a monument found at a place called Pozo Moro , southwest of Valencia , Spain .
Miller is content to just cite Ahlström 's description :
The archaeological excavations at Punic Pozo Moro in Spain show a monument with a ritual scene with a god ( with an animal head ) on a throne and a table in front of him .
He holds with one hand a pig lying on its back and in the other hand he has a bowl with the head and the feet of a little child (? ) sticking up .
He holds this bowl in front of his mouth .
To the right there is another bowl , and a god with an animal head ( horse ? ) holding a knife in his right hand above the bowl ready to slaughter the child .
The scene ( in a neo - Hittite style ) shows both animal and child sacrifices as food for the gods . [ 68 ]
But there are numerous problems with using this monument to make any claims about Canaanite child sacrifice in 1400 - 1000 BCE .
First , the monument dates after 500 BCE .
Second , nothing makes this monument necessarily Canaanite , or even Punic ( Ahlström mentions a " Neo- Hittite style " ) . [ 69 ]
Third , and , most importantly , there is no text or inscription to help us decipher what is being depicted .
The scene depicts beings that are part beast and part human .
What makes Miller think that this is a Molek child sacrifice ?
There is no fire here depicted , as would be expected of a Molek sacrifice .
While certain elements of the Pozo Moro can be found in many places in Canaan , the distinctive aspects of the monument ( e.g. , the specific two headed figure holding a possible child in a bowl ) are not found in any part of Canaan .
There are alternative interpretations possible .
For example , what if this is a depiction of a demon about to eat children ?
That would not make it a depiction of an acceptable sacrifice , but rather a depiction of an unwanted aspect of life .
Otherwise , interpreting the Pozo Moro monument as endorsing the practice depicted would be akin to looking at Albrecht Altdorfer 's painting , Lot and His Daughters ( 1537 ) , in Vienna 's Kunsthistorisches Museum , and then concluding that the painting and the whole of Austrian culture endorses the incestuous practice depicted .
This last point is important because both Miller and Sarfati have no problem generalizing any bad behavior to every Phoenician or Canaanite to justify the wholesale slaughter in the biblical texts .
Such generalization is most ironic in light of Sarfati 's repeated assault on induction as a valid scientific procedure .
But , for Sarfati , the induction that ALL Canaanites kill children because SOME of them have been found to kill children , seems to be perfectly valid .
If we went further , and asked which gods are said to eat people , we would go right back to the biblical god .
Aside from the charge of ritual cannibalism against Christians reported by Tertullian , consider this passage in Psalm 21:8-9 :
[ 8 ]
Your hand will find out all your enemies ; your right hand will find out those who hate you . [ 9 ]
You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear .
The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath ; and fire will consume them .
Similar sentiments are found when Christ returns , according to Revelation 19:16 - 18 :
[ 16 ]
On his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed , King of kings and Lord of lords . [ 17 ]
Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly in midheaven , " Come , gather for the great supper of God , [ 18 ] to eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of captains , the flesh of mighty men , the flesh of horses and their riders , and the flesh of all men , both free and slave , both small and great . "
So , if the mythology of eating human flesh by the biblical god is admitted by biblical authors , then one can see that the monument at Pozo Moro might be interpreted in that light .
If we say that these biblical allusions to eating human beings are poetic , then we ought to allow the same interpretations when we find allusions to eating human beings in non-biblical literature .
But let 's suppose that child sacrifice was as pervasive among Canaanites as Sarfati and Miller will have us believe .
The fact that child sacrifice remained so strong 1000 years after the order for genocide was given ( ca. 1400 - 1000 BCE ) means that the intended cure for this practice was not very effective .
Recall that Tertullian , the church father , tells us that it was not biblical principles that ended this practice in some locales , but rather a Roman official .
It also raises the disturbing possibility that if Christian social morality had done much to overcome the practice of infanticide motivated by considerations of communal or familial interest , it may have exacerbated resort to it to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy . [ 69 a ]
Finally , Sarfati and Miller forget that any child sacrifice in antiquity was done by theists and creationists !!!
The Canaanites , after all believed in gods and creation , and that did not deter them from killing children .
In fact , belief in gods is what probably made them kill children .
For his archaeological confirmation of bestiality among the Canaanites , Miller offers us one miserly example .
This is a fragmentary and ambiguous mythical text from Ugarit , an ancient city which flourished ca. 1400 BCE in what is now the coast of Syria .
But again , Ugarit is not part of Canaan .
In fact , an Ugaritic list of merchants refers to " Ya'ilu , a Canaanite " ( Ugaritic in transcription : y' l.kn'ny ) , which shows that Ugaritians were not Canaanites . [ 70 ]
The idea that Creationist ethics are the answer to a supposedly Darwinian tendency to devalue human life is a myth .
Given the foregoing discussion , we can demonstrate that almost every feature Weikart and his cohorts list for Nazi ideology is advocated by at least one passage / biblical author in the Bible ( Old Testament or New Testament ) .
Here is a summary :
Nazi ideology Bible Anti-Judaism YES YES Homosexuality condemned YES YES Genealogical purity demanded YES YES Life unequal in value YES YES Whole groups devalued YES YES Genocide permissible YES YES
We can do the same in comparing practices attributed to the Canaanites , with practices sometimes endorsed by biblical authors .
Canaanites Bible Child sacrifice YES YES
Eating human beings YES YES Incest YES YES
Moreover , the longest history of defenses for genocide are found among creationists .
This history begins with the biblical authors , who defended their genocides , and continues with modern creationist who are still justifying those acts , among other acts of genocide in Christian history .
Weikart could have better titled his book , From John and Luther to Hitler .
Creationism fails miserably as an ethical system because determining when genocide is acceptable depends on totally unverifiable claims about who can access the divine will or who can read God 's mind .
Creationist ethics are based on the whims and claims of people who tell us they know what God wants .
Scientific ethics , as imperfect as they may be , at least can demand verifiable evidence that violence in self - defense is necessary .
Theistic violence , on the other hand , often relies on the unverifiable belief that a supernatural being said we had to sacrifice human life . [ 71 ]

For example , the lions found on the Pozo Moro monument have reasonable parallels outside of Canaan , at site called Alalakh ( now in Turkey , late second millennium BCE ) .
The lions at both Pozo Moro and Alalakh are recumbent , and have tails depicted as bending upward on the side of the body of the lions .

We should note the reticence of many creationist bloggers to answer a question I frequently put to them : " Do you believe genocide / infanticide is always wrong ? "
Note response # 17 at : http://www.verumserum.com/?p=1114#comments.
The Kansas creationist blogger ironically known as Forthekids ( http://reasonablekansans.blogspot.com), has apparently refused to even post the question on her blog , despite repeated requests .
Discussion
Ms. Latshaw used to be full of life .
She loved to cook , played tennis and bridge , raised two children and took charge of redecorating the grand old family home .
Then her memory began to slip : guests would arrive for dinner , and she would have no memory of inviting them .
She forgot to look before pulling into traffic , and nearly caused an accident .
She would wander out of the house , and local store clerks would take her home .
She never turned hostile or angry , as many demented patients do , but she had vivid hallucinations of strings being caught in her teeth , and little men getting into her bed and jabbing her with broom straws .
On especially bad nights , her husband would get up with her at 2 or 3 a.m. and make the two of them hot chocolate .
Aricept , an Alzheimer ’s drug , made the hallucinations worse , while another drug , an antipsychotic used for schizophrenia , seemed to quell them .
But the second drug had side effects : after taking it for several years , Ms. Latshaw began to grind her teeth , and could not stop moving her arms and legs .
Their father also suffered from dementia , Ms. Hess said , admitting that she wonders about herself .
“ Naturally I ’m a little bit concerned , but I think worry is such a waste of time , so I do n’t dwell on it ; I just do n’t , ” she said .
“ My friends always said , ‘ You always had a bad memory . ’
I see Barbara and David ’s children having that same kind of memory . ”
Ms. Hess has volunteered for studies at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , where she became the first person in the United States to have a PIB study of her brain .
“ I ’m very anxious to get to the bottom of this whole Alzheimer ’s thing , ” she said .
Nothing Left to Give
In an interview in the summer of 2006 , Ms. Kerley described her mother this way : “ She ’s completely withdrawn in herself .
She has n’t recognized us for a few years .
Basically she hums one line of one song over and over again .
She seems to be stuck somewhere in her life between age 4 and 5 . ”
Ms. Kerley said she and her son Michael , then 21 , visited every week or two .
“ She loves getting her back rubbed , being smiled at , being hugged , ” Ms. Kerley said .
“ She does n’t know who we are .
We ’re going for us , not for her , because she does n’t remember us the minute we walk out the door . ”
Editor ’s note : Last week , our friends at Eco - Libris announced this partnership with Kedzie Press .
Congratulations to them … this is a great step forward for Eco - Libris , Kedzie , and the environment .
This post , written by Raz Godelnik , was originally published on Tuesday , February 12 , 2008 .
We ’re very happy to update you with a new partnership – Kedzie Press , an independent publishing house based in Seattle , Washington is collaborating with Eco -Libris in a new initiative called Million Tree - A - Thon .
The goal : planting one million trees for one million books to be sold by Kedzie Press until the end of 2009 .
Kedzie Press is already a green publisher — it publishes books with socially conscious and or environmentally - friendly messages , as well as the occasional work of fiction .
It strives to help its readers lead better lives and all of our titles are printed on 100 % recycled , 100 % post - consumer waste paper ( FSC certified ) , and processed chlorine free .
It means that by pledging to plant one tree for every book sold , Kedzie Press actually maximizes the positive impact it already has on the environment .
Million Tree - A- Thon will start with a new book , The Green Parent : A Kid-Friendly Guide to Earth - Friendly Living by Jenn Savedge , which is jam packed with information , interviews , and inspiration to help parents become Green Parents .
Eco -Libris logo will appear on every printed copy of the book , signifying that one tree is being planted for each and one of these copies .
The book will be available at local and online booksellers nationwide on April , 2008 and and can be pre-ordered already from the Kedzie Press website .
Kedzie Press is looking to make a difference in their conservation efforts and inspire others to do the same .
We are very excited and proud to be part of these efforts and look forward to meeting the goal : planting one million trees for one million Kedzie Press books .
I ’m positive that with the support of all the eco-conscious readers out there we can do it !
So buy any Kedzie Press title from Kedzie Press website ( check it out , they ’ve got really interesting green books ) and join the Kedzie Million Tree - A - Thon .

Ron Paul
I support Dennis Kucinich for president .
I am confident that he would run the country for the benefit of its citizens , not for the benefit of global business .
He is the only candidate whose values and goals I fully support .
He also champions impeachment of Bush .
Why would I , as a Liberal , have anything favorable to say about a Republican such as Ron Paul ?
I have fundamental disagreements with Ron Paul .
I support a welfare state and the New Deal .
He wants to weaken social security and medicare , in effect throwing the poor back on their own resources .
He wants to abolish income tax , which would mean reliance on taxes that fall most heavily on the poor and let the rich off lightly .
This would increase concentration of wealth , which is already dangerously excessive , and the poor would pay for it .
In ordinary times I would simply oppose a candidate with such views , but these are not ordinary times .
The Bush regime has contempt for human rights , and most of the 2008 candidates are little better than Bush .
Most voted for the disgraceful U. S.A.P. A.T. R.I.O.T . Act , which authorized the Bush regime to collect businesses ' ( and even libraries ' ) records about individuals without a court order .
Most of them voted to launch a war of aggression in Iraq , accepting Bush 's patent lies with the innocence of a sheltered child .
Obama , who was not in the Senate when those were voted on , nonetheless does not convincingly oppose them .
Aside from Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul , those candidates that criticize the occupation of Iraq do not show a firm will to end it .
They dwell on " mismanagement " , as if the worst you could say about Bush 's crime was that " he did n't plan it well enough . "
The only Democratic or Republican candidate , aside from Kucinich , that clearly stands for human rights , democracy , and an end to torture , secret prisons and the occupation of Iraq is Ron Paul .
I urge Republicans to support him for that party 's nomination .
Ron Paul denies accusations of racism , saying that he never said or believed racist statements in his newsletter .
If indeed he fired the employee who wrote those things , that would be sufficient reason not to blame them on him .

Donald MacKillop is delighted with his new hand
Bionic hand in action
The five fingers on the i-LIMB hand are individually powered by separate motors .
This allows a better grip and a more realistic look and feel .
Standard prosthetic hands use the thumb and two fingers to produce a simple claw grip .
The first recipient , Donald MacKillop lost his right hand in an industrial accident nearly 30 years ago .
Since then , he 's tried a succession of artificial hands - but none have come close to the latest version .
Mr MacKillop said he was now able to pick up a glass with his right hand for the first time in decades .
He said : " It 's unbelievable .
It is so near fingers , you can do anything with it .
The fact that the fingers can wrap round things , makes life much , much easier
Donald MacKillop
" The fact that the fingers can wrap round things , makes life much , much easier . "
The i-LIMB hand was developed by a Scottish company Touch Bionics , and is now being tested at the national centre for prosthetics at Strathclyde University .
Prosthetics expert Bill Dykes said the new hand was a leap forward in technology - but should get even better in a few years .
" In the future we 'll have better control systems so that we 'll be able to have individual control of the fingers .
" That will mean fingers can be moved at will .
With the present system they can only move together . "
As yet bionic hands can't match the dexterity of muscle and bone , and are a far cry from the science fiction of the terminator films .
But Mr MacKillop says at last he feels he now has two hands again .
There have been various posts to reddit , and various discussions in the last few days of slides from talks I 've given on Supero .
It 's nice to see that people are interested , but some people have got slightly wrong impressions based on either the fact that talksinclude the bit I say , or that the material has moved on since the talk was written .
I was n't going to post my revised paper ( currently undergoing refereeing ) - but since it addresses both those issues perfectly , I decided to put in on the project web page I 'm also going to address some of the questions people might ask : Yes .
You are correct .
It may even be quite a bit more than 8 times .
However , the benchmark controls for this - all programs only use getchar .
The idea isto write the worlds fastest letter counting program , either use hFileSize or Data .
ByteString for that .
The idea is to have a benchmark with computation which has abstracted away the non-computation bit until C and Haskell can be compared as directly as possible .
It 's also a useful micro-benchmark .
It 's not too long and complex .
It 's a real task that people can wrap their heads around .
There is a nice gentle progression between char / line / word counting .
There are lots of good reasons for picking these benchmarks , but do n't think of them as being too important - think of them as " ah , that 's cute " .
If you 've read the last paper , or seen a talk I 've given , there are major differences in this paper .
The largest change is that instead of waving my hands and trying to distract people with shiny things when the topic of non-termination comes up , I now have a good answer .
The answer is homeomorphic embedding .
I got this technique from Peter Jonsson , who in turn got it off Morten Sørensen and Robert Glück .
It turns out my supervisor also used it inthesis !
There are other differences all over the place .
I 've managed to get results for most of the imaginary section of the nofib suite ( 12 benchmarks ) .
I 've also come up with a new generalisation strategy , have a better story of what to do with let 's , and have tried to make my optimisation better defined .
I want the the compilation times to be faster , the results to be better and more results on more benchmarks .
Compilation times are between 10 seconds and 5 minutes , on a normal computer .
Unfortunately my home machine is n't normal , it 's 8 years old .
I am hoping to improve the compilation speed to about the 2 second level , then I am going to do lots more benchmarks and investigate those where the optimisation does n't do as well as I was hoping .
Early Retirement : Where to Live ?
Site Home : Materialism : Early Retirement : One Article
Why do so many retirees move to California , Florida , and the Southwest ?
Good weather is much more important to a retired person than a working person .
Suppose that you live in Massachusetts and a dreary cold windy rain comes in for seven days ?
You might be upset at losing a weekend of hiking but for the five days that you had planned to be at work , you have n't really lost anything .
You were going to be stuck indoors anyway , so what difference does it make that it is raining outside ?
In fact , one nice thing about most offices is that they tend to be large soaring well - lit spaces with longer sight lines even than the largest private dwelling .
Given how constrained and therefore easy the choices for married people are , let 's consider the challenge of finding a good place to live for a retired single male .
Here are some criteria :
cost of living
intelligence and education of the locals
extent to which the locals are available to hang out on weekdays
quality of climate
beauty of landscape
access to recreation
cultural events
taxes
crime
availability of single women
Taxes are almost as simple as they appear .
You can go to Alaska , Florida , Nevada , South Dakota , Texas , Washington or Wyoming and stop paying state income tax ( New Hampshire taxes dividends and interest , the two kinds of income that retired people receive ) .
Some of the states with high overall taxes , as a percentage of income , are the obvious places afflicted with bloated government , corruption , and inefficiency , e.g. , the District of Columbia , New York , and Rhode Island .
Massachusetts is n't as bad as you 'd expect , however , because the residents are so well - educated and energetic that they can afford to be bled .
Conversely , Maine ends up being the highest tax burden state in the union , collecting 13 percent of income ( against New Hampshire 's 7.4 percent ) .
Maine wants to pay its police officers , schoolteachers , and bureaucrats a similar salary to what these folks would earn in Massachusetts .
However , the population of Maine is comparatively poorly educated and paid , so the result is taxes that are much higher as a percentage of income and wealth .
Cost of living is not simply " lower is better . "
The cost of living in San Francisco or Manhattan is higher than in Peoria , Illinois .
To some extent , this is because San Francisco and Manhattan are crowded .
But much of the cost difference can be attributed to the fact that it is more enjoyable to live in Manhattan or San Francisco than Peoria .
Being around smart people is a huge luxury .
Intelligent , well - educated people are much more interesting than people with low IQs who have n't read or studied too much .
Unfortunately for those who are retired on a fixed income , smart people tend to find clever ways to make money and this drives up the cost of housing in areas where they congregate .
If New Yorkers were n't so damn good at skimming money from Midwestern mutual fund investors and looting from public corporations , you would n't find that larger apartments in Manhattan had been bid up to $ 10 million .
Quality of climate is not so simple , either .
If you like long hours of daylight and moderate temperatures , the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska is a fabulous place to live from May through September .
You might not enjoy being there in January , however .
And being in Alaska certainly scores poorly on the " availability of single women " criterion .
A lot of smaller towns that host elite colleges and universities might seem attractive at first glance .
Consider Williamstown , Massachusetts , for example , home of Williams College , one of the best liberal arts schools in the U.S .
The town is set in the Berkshires , with a mild summer climate and lots of scenic lakes and woods .
There are similar towns and colleges in Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine .
Unfortunately , what nearly all having in common is an academic calendar that runs September through May .
Perversely , they send the students home and the professors away during the only time of year when it is actually pleasant to be on campus .
A surprising number of young retirees are single .
This is partly due to the great wealth created in high - tech in the 1990s .
Guys retiring out of those companies tend to be computer programmers , a group shunned by the female sex .
Most young retirees had to work long hours before they retired .
A person who works long hours is not going to be interesting to a discriminating member of the opposite sex .
What can a guy who works 80 hours per week talk about except his job ?
He wo n't have read the latest books , seen the latest movies , learned any new skills , or met any fun people .
If one of the things that you 'd pushed aside during your working years was dating and marriage , it would not be wise to move to an isolated mountain top .
If you look at Census Bureau statistics , you 'll see that places with scenic beauty , outdoor recreation , and a flood of newcomers tend to be places with a huge surplus of single men .
Alaska and Hawaii , for example , have more men than women .
If you go to a place such as Moab , Utah , where mountain bikers love to congregate you will see groups of ten guys congregating after dark .
Cities with technical and manufacturing jobs tend to have more men ( Boston , Silicon Valley ) .
Cities with administrative jobs tend to have a surplus of women ( New York , Washington , D.C. ) .
If you 're married , research the divorce litigation system before moving to a state .
As explained in Real World Divorce , there are massive differences among the 51 jurisdictions nationwide .
The Beach House
The Ranch
Real World Divorce
The Yachting Destination
The Caribbean
Places worth looking
If you 're a higher - income parent and want to stay a parent after a separation or divorce , look at the handful of states that support shared parenting : Alaska , Arizona , Colorado , Delaware , Pennsylvania ( Real World Divorce ) .
Manhattan is a surprisingly good place for someone who has retired young .
Although the cost of living is high , it is impossible to beat the variety of cultural attractions and the opportunities for socializing .
New York City is also one of the world 's best air travel hubs .
You can get almost anywhere on an inexpensive non -stop flight .
Problems with New York include the risk of terrorism -- if Al - Qaeda gets a nuclear bomb this is where they will detonate it -- and , for aviation enthusiasts , the fairly long drive to airports where it is reasonable to keep a small airplane or helicopter .
As noted in the New York chapter , New York is a moderately lucrative child support jurisdiction .
The Boston area and Cambridge , Massachusetts in particular are great for people who like to learn new things .
Be aware that Massachusetts family law is , for upper - middle - class incomes , the most lucrative child support jurisdiction in the world and therefore has the most intense and expensive custody litigation of any jurisdiction in the world .
Courts are notoriously hostile to fathers in Massachusetts but women who are breadwinners can also lose custody and be saddled with enormous payments .
Downtown San Francisco and Berkeley offer similar advantages plus a milder climate .
California family law also offers unlimited child support and statistically favors women and discourages shared parenting .
Washington , D.C. has a tremendous supply of free cultural events .
You can go to lectures at museums every day , attend free movies and live theatricals , enjoy city parks , ride the Metro ( not dog - friendly , sadly ) .
Most of your fun will be paid for by taxpayers in the Midwest .
If you do n't want to deal with the crime , corruption , and incompetence of the D.C. local government , rent yourself an apartment on the Metro , just over the line into Maryland or Virginia ( Real World Divorce explains the two very different family law systems in these states ) .
Smaller towns with good colleges and universities : Ithaca , New York ( Cornell ) ; Madison , Wisconsin ; Ann Arbor , Michigan ( somewhat expensive due to proximity to Detroit ) ; Athens , Georgia ; Boulder , Colorado ( expensive but good for lovers of the outdoors ) ; Missoula , Montana ; Lawrence , Kansas ; State College , Pennsylvania ; Charlottesville , Virginia ; Iowa City , Iowa ; Lincoln , Nebraska .
Good places for aviation : Spokane , Washington ( cheap housing ; clear weather ) ; St. Paul , Minnesota ( downtown airport ) ; Burlington , Vermont ; Sedona , Arizona ; Santa Fe and Albuquerque , New Mexico .
Homer , Alaska has a mild climate ( for Alaska ) , fabulous mountain and glacier views from almost every house ( a really nice house is $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 ) .
There are always lots of relaxed tourists and fishermen in town .
You can go out in a boat or wade into a stream and rescue a Halibut or Salmon from its watery hell .
The local airport has a runway long enough for jets and air taxi services that will take you across the Cook Inlet to watch brown bears catching salmon .
There are four commercial flights per day to Anchorage or you can fly there yourself in a light plane in about 45 minutes without having to climb above 1000 ' .
A great place to spend May through September .
Mexico has a tremendous number of attractive towns and consistently rates as one of the happiest countries on Earth .
The canonical gringo hangouts at San Miguel de Allende , Oaxaca , the Pacific coast , and anywhere in Baja California .
Argentina and Chile are great places to go when the days get short up here in the Northern Hemisphere .
Argentina is ridiculously cheap and has a great tradition of culture , cuisine , and education .
Chile is more stable and orderly and has a lower crime rate .
If you 're looking for an English - speaking place in the Southern Hemisphere , New Zealand and Australia are both beautiful with friendly people .
New Zealand is mountainous and can be cold , windy , and rainy even in the summer .
Australia has a broad range of climates but most of the country is very hot in December and January .
If you 're passionate about raising a family , Europe can be a good choice due to the limited child support profits available to plaintiffs there ( see International chapter of Real World Divorce for how the child who yields $ 100,000 / year in a U.S. state would generate only $ 6,000 / year in revenue for a plaintiff in Germany ) .
Most of Asia is too strange and far away to appeal to the average North American .
Nonetheless , there are a lot of expatriates who've found their Buddhist bliss in northern Thailand .
Singapore is a great place to live and work , though since the country now has a substantially higher income per-capita than the U.S. it may be too expensive for many Americans .

I 'm 32 , and I plan on retiring early .
I 'm spending my days building money - printing machines -- primarily real estate and Internet properties .
Hopefully they wo n't need me around too much to keep them oiled .
I would like to second his investment advice ; so far it 's worked for me .
My plan for early retirement aims to deal with many of the issues Philip raises is to buy a sailboatboat , big enough to take me , my companion , and the odd crewmember , hither and yon , primarily in the caribbean .
The benefits in personal energy , adventure , travel , and an inexpensive home will be many - fold .
I look forward to it .

At the moment I rent two bedrooms in a house in Tarija , Bolivia , for USD160 per month .
Gas , water , electricity included .
During the last twelve months I have lived in the Cayman Islands , France , and Bolivia .
Renting and moving around a lot gives flexibility and forces you to reduce your material goods .
What does ' retire ' mean ?
According to Webster it means ' to withdraw from one 's position or occupation : conclude one 's working or professional career . '
Well , if that is the case I am half retired .
I have withdrawn , but I have not concluded .
Neither do I think you have .
I think ' owner of your time ' , ' ooyt ' for short , is a more interesting word than ' retired ' .
If you do what you like , professionally and privately , you are ooyt .
If you work in a bank and hate it , or play tennis with your neighbour and hate it , you are not ooyt .

I have lived in Europe for the past 6 years and I disagree that most average Americans should not consider Europe because it is " too crowded and expensive " .
There are many places that are both incredibly beautiful and not very expensive -- such as Scotland ( Especially the Highlands ) ; SW France ( especially along the Pyranees ) ; Southernmost parts of Italy ; Inland Spain ; Portugal ( especially Duoro Valley ) and many parts of Eastern Europe .
Culture and food can't be beat .
Plus if you become resident you do n't have to worry about paying for ( generally very good quality ) medical care anywhere in Europe and you get an $ 80,000 income tax exclusion from Uncle SAM .
Also if you own property the real estate tax rates are almost non-existent in most of Europe .

One major factor in the renting vs buying tradeoff is how much and how long you 're going to use something .
If the thing can spend most of its time being used by others , renting may be more convenient .
If you 're going to spend a month a year at a vacation home , owning the whole vacation home ( ignoring the possibility of owning a timeshare ) may be more expensive than renting because you have to absorb the costs for the 11 months that you are n't there .
Of course , you could find renters for the other 11 months ( unless it 's a property that 's only attractive during part of the year , in which case you can probably still find renters for some of the time ) , but then you have to deal with those renters and still have to deal with keeping the place maintained .
And for a vacation home , renting also means that if you discover you do n't like the place , not coming back next year becomes easier .
Owning a primary home would give me some stability I 'd really kind of like that I do n't really have as a renter at the moment .
I also think a lot of the maintenance issues associated with ownership can probably be controlled with planning .
My parents have a swimming pool , and maintaining the right chemical balance there takes some effort ; I will probably not buy a home with a swimming pool .
Maintaining the yard also seems to take some of my parents ' time , and this may be an argument for having a smaller yard .
The condition the property starts out in is likely also a factor in how much hassle it is in the long run , though if you have a good contractor you 're willing to pay , maybe it 's not a huge problem .
And I wonder if some of the problems with finding good tradespeople happen to people who bought a house that they could barely afford , thus making good maintenance difficult to afford .
Other examples of things that can be worth renting if you do n't need the whole thing are cars ( if you live in an area where parking is difficult and public transit is good ) and fractions of colocated servers ( if you do n't need a whole server to meet your capacity needs ; the virtual server offerings have gotten quite good in the last few years ) .
And I have to wonder if renting from NetJets would get you a bigger cabin for the same number of dollars as owning a VLJ , while saving many of the paperwork hassles that I hear can come from owning a sufficiently complicated plane ..

I have been living in Canada for 11 j years already and what is of good here is work only , nothing else .
Nothing connects the people here and is not very socializing country .
Also is expensive for a retired person live here or in the States in general .
Since mostly or the retires look forward low expenses places , quality of live and nice people for a place to retire I am considering partially retire from Winter time in Canada and live in some place in Brazil , some of the places are very affordable .
Specially in the north of Brazil or the suburbs .
Criminallity exists , but you have to know to survive , you can be overprotected all your life by the Queen or Uncle Sam , do n't you ?
So be mature and adapt to other scenario .
I live in Rio before and criminallity exist , also a monster inflation but there is the beach , the fun and the currency benefits .
Somebody told me also that Nicaragua is getting one of the places more affordables to live for retired North Americans , but I do n't know too much of that country , so far Americans beging to retire there , cost of living is going to increase , as is happening in Costa Rica .
For an inmigrant who plain to retire from America , some things tends to be easier than from native Americans or Canadians , but not always the country of origin is good either .
For instance Uruguay , is one of the most expensive countries in South America to live , but is quiet , with people well educated and free medical assistance and education .
What I am tired of is of this f.
Canadian time it goes from - 30 to +30 and the indifferent people and the system where you have to pay for everything an expensive price .
( even to find a date )

New Zealand is beautiful , but NO longer cheap to live , and property is really high at the moment .
Kiwis mean you no harm , but they are not really into socializing with expats , and have a limited point of view .
It does get cold down here !
-- max cruise , August 14 , 2008
Sorry , PG , I disagree with several angles you gloss over .
First , no retiree should ever feel " constrained " to live anywhere .
Half the fun of retirement comes from freedom and endless possibilities .
Neither adult children , friendships , or a spouse should make our place of retirement decision for us .
If we choose to live near friends or family , we ignore the transient nature of modern life .
Our kids and our friends both have a tendency to disappear or move on .
We have to have lives apart from them .
Spouses and partners need to form part of the team for a choice of location , but again , if they feel " constrained " in their selection then they build their own prison .
-- James Medeiros , September 16 , 2008
Great and brief coverage .
I could n't agree more .
I guess I 'll rent ... the question is , where ?

Anti-Jewish remarks : Gandhi's grandson resigns
Rediff News Bureau | January 23 , 2008 22:40 IST
Last Updated : January 24 , 2008 13:22 IST
Arun Gandhi , Mahatma Gandhi's [ Images ] grandson , has resigned from a prominent institute he founded in the United States after he made some comments about Jews , media reports said .
The M K Gandhi Institute for Non-Violence was set up 17 years ago to spread the message of Gandhiji .
The alleged comments were made , media reports said , during an online discussion on faith and religion on the Washington Post website .
" The board of the M K Gandhi Institute for Non-violence has received Arun Gandhi 's offer of resignation as president of our organisation , " the reports said , quoting a statement by the institute .
Arun , whose comments ruffled the Jews ' feathers , reportedly said , " Jews not only want the Germans to feel guilty but the whole world must regret what happened to the Jews .
The world did feel sorry for the episode , but when an individual or a nation refuses to forgive and move on , the regret turns into anger . "
Ever since , the website was swarmed with angry messages and the blog 's editors , Sally Quinn and Jon Meacham , published an apology on January 18 .
The website 's moderators said : " We regret the initial posting , and we apologise for the episode " , asking readers for " a measure of forbearance and tolerance as the site endeavours to conduct a civil and illuminating conversation . "
But that did not pacify the angry Jewish community , which wanted the writer to resign , media reports said .
According to reports , the American - Jewish Committee 's executive director , David A Harris , said India was being ungrateful for all that his organisation did for New Delhi .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of foreclosures soared in 2007 , with 405,000 households losing their home , according to a report released Tuesday .
That 's up 51 percent from the 268,532 homes that were repossessed in 2006 .
Total foreclosure filings soared 97 % in December alone compared with December of 2006 , according to RealtyTrac , an online seller of foreclosure properties .
For the year , total filings - which include default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions - grew 75 % .
More than 1 percent of all U.S. households were in some stage of foreclosure during 2007 , up from 0.58 percent the year before .
" There are parts of the country where we 're seeing many more bank repossessions , " said Rick Sharga , a spokesman for Realty Trac .
" People are flat out losing their homes . "
In California alone , nearly 66,000 people lost their homes last year .
In Michigan , 47,000 families went through foreclosure .
Also hard hit was Nevada , where 10,0000 people had their homes repossessed , a per-capita rate more than twice as high as California .
California had a total of 250,000 foreclosure filings , the highest number of of any state .
Florida was second with more than 165,000 total filings .
Other hard - hit states include Michigan , which has been battered by job losses in the auto industry and had over 87,000 filings , Ohio , with more than 89,000 filings , and Colorado , with 39,000 .
Nevada had 3.376 filings for every 100 households - a foreclosure rate of more than three times the national average , and the highest of any state .
According to Gail Burks , the CEO of the Nevada Fair Housing Center , a community advocacy group that aids home owners facing foreclosure , some communities in Las Vegas , Nevada 's biggest city , have as many as 40 percent of homes in foreclosure .
" It 's having a huge impact , " she said .
" Some zip codes here are recording 22 foreclosures a month . "
The rise nationally has confounded some community advocates .
" Last December , we thought the national numbers were bad , and now they 're up almost 100 percent , " said John Taylor , CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
" It just shows we need a comprehensive approach to solve the problem . "
The increase in foreclosures has come about despite very low interest rates , as well as government , private enterprise and community advocate efforts to forestall the worst of the problems .
That 's because sales are very slow in many housing markets and prices are down , leaving many troubled borrowers unable to sell in order to repay their mortgage debts .
Still , some states have avoided problems .
Maine had just 286 properties with foreclosure filings on their records , Vermont had 29 and South Dakota just 24 .

It is now nearly three decades since the Unites States adopted the policy of dual containment of Iran and Iraq .
While much has been written about the containment of Iraq , there has been very little in - depth analysis of this policy when it comes to Iran .
In a book that is going to be released on March 31 , 2008 , entitled The United States and Iran : Sanctions , Wars and the Policy of Dual Containment ( Routledge ) , I attempt to address this shortcoming by investigating when and why the US policy of containment of Iran came about , how it evolved , and where it stands today .
[ 1 ]
To the extent that Israel has been involved in US policy making , the study will also include the role that Israel has played in the containment of Iran .
Also , since the fate of Iran has been inextricably linked to that of Iraq , occasionally the investigation will overlap with the containment of Iraq .
The policy of dual containment of Iran and Iraq originated during the Carter Administration , but it was not until the Clinton Administration that the expression " dual containment " became popular .
Despite its widespread use , the meaning of the expression is not crystal clear ; different individuals have had different interpretations of " containment " of Iran and Iraq .
For some , it has meant keeping the two countries militarily , economically , and politically in check .
This was the case with Iraq between 1990 - when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and United Nations sanctions were imposed on Iraq - and 2003 - when the US invaded Iraq for the second time and occupied the country .
In the case of Iraq , it was hoped initially that economic pressures through extensive United Nations sanctions , as well as some limited military actions , would create discontent and lead to " regime change . "
But since sanctions did not result in the overthrow of Hussein , Iraq was not exactly contained .
The 2003 US invasion and occupation of Iraq showed that containment could go beyond sanctions and limited military operations ; it could involve outright invasion of a country to achieve the desired goals .
To this day , the US military adventure in Iraq has not been successful , and the future of Iraq and its government remains uncertain .
In this sense , some may argue that Iraq has not been contained .
But a few might disagree with this conclusion .
For these individuals Iraq has already been contained , since the country has been economically ruined , militarily shattered , and politically disintegrated .
For decades to come , Iraq will not be able to rise from the ashes and challenge the US and Israel ; and this , in the opinion of these individuals , is a successful containment .
Such a view might appear to be too cynical to be held by anyone .
But , as I have argued in my book , the attitude of many US and Israeli officials toward the Iran - Iraq war indicates that this view did actually exist .
Some American and Israeli officials wished to see Iran and Iraq destroy one another in a costly and protracted war .
They helped to prolong the war and make sure that neither side had a decisive victory .
The horrendous eight - year war , which resulted in a massive loss of human life and severe economic losses , was therefore viewed as a kind of containment .
The same view of containment seems to exist today among many so - called neoconservatives who , after pushing for the Iraq invasion , show no remorse for the resulting carnage and advocate bombing Iran .
Whatever the interpretation of the dual containment of Iran and Iraq , one aspect of this policy has been to use war , or threats of war , to bring about the desired change .
Another has been to rely on sanctions .
US unilateral sanctions against Iran started shortly after the 1979 Revolution and continued throughout the Iran - Iraq war .
In this period many of the imposed sanctions were intended to prevent Iran from winning the war against Hussein ’s Iraq .
But it was also hoped that sanctions would bring about popular dissatisfaction in Iran and result in the overthrow of the new government .
Such sanctions continued and became even more intensified after the Iran - Iraq war , particularly in the 1990s .
Yet , even though these sanctions did harm the Iranian economy , they did not bring about the intended " regime change . "
The failure was attributed to the unilateral nature of these sanctions , and therefore multilateral sanctions , imposed through the United Nations , were sought .
So far three such sanctions have been passed against Iran .
Whether these sanctions will have the desired results and , eventually , would do to Iran what has been done to Iraq is hard to predict .
But it is even harder to make any predictions about the future without knowing the past .
It was in the spirit of documenting the history , in order to better understand the present and the future , that The United States and Iran Sanctions , Wars and the Policy of Dual Containment was written .
An outline of the book is as follows .
The origin of the dual containment policy , as mentioned above , goes back to the Carter Administration .
There is plenty of evidence to suggest that individuals within the Carter Administration , contrary to their denials , gave Hussein the green light to invade Iran and assisted him after the invasion .
It was hoped that the war would not only lead to the resolution of the so - called hostage crisis , but that it might lead to the overthrow of the Iranian government and the restoration of the old order , where the Shah of Iran maintained a symbiotic relationship with the US and Israel .
However , assisting Hussein in his war against Iran did not mean that the US was planning to establish a long - term relationship with him .
Befriending Hussein was temporary ; and while the US was helping the Iraqi government , the Israelis were selling arms to Iran with the full knowledge of the US .
Indeed , the Carter Administration itself was considering the possibility of providing Iran with military spare parts as well .
This was the beginning of the policy of dual containment , when the US , playing the role of a double agent , tried to make sure that neither side would achieve a decisive victory in the Iran - Iraq war .
The dual containment policy continued in the 1980s under the Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations .
But while the US assisted Hussein covertly during the Carter period , it did so overtly during the Reagan Administration , despite the official US policy of remaining neutral in the war .
The support also became more vigorous .
US officials tried to prevent Iran from winning the war against Hussein by providing him with intelligence , weapons , and extension of credit .
They also established full diplomatic relations with Hussein ’s government , lifted trade sanctions against Iraq , and imposed new economic sanctions against Iran .
In addition , the Reagan Administration closed its eyes to the use of chemical weapons by Iraq in the war , and , indeed , supplied Saddam Hussein with chemical compounds that had multiple uses , including making poison gas .
Subsequently , with the Iranian military victories , the US entered the war against Iran directly to assure that Hussein was not defeated .
With this direct US intervention , in 1988 Iran was forced to accept a humiliating ceasefire , especially after the USS Vincennes affair .
In the end , the Reagan Administration had managed by means of indirect and direct war to defeat Iran for all practical purposes and contain it .
Yet the policy of dual containment demanded that not only Iran but also Iraq be emasculated as a potential challenger .
Therefore , while helping Hussein , the US also sold arms to Iran , mostly with the help of the Israelis , in what came to be known as the " Iran - Contra scandal . "
Furthermore , the US administration provided both Iran and Iraq with deliberately distorted or inaccurate intelligence data on the other ’s capabilities .
More importantly , with the end of the Iran - Iraq war - and the emergence of Iraq militarily stronger at the end of the war than at the beginning - the US turned its attention toward containing Iraq .
This was accomplished through manufactured sensational news and incidents , as well as a sudden US interest in the " gross violation of international law " by Iraq during the Iran - Iraq war .
The final incident was Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait after the US gave confusing messages to Hussein .
Following this invasion , the US tried to contain Iraq by means of a war , UN economic sanctions , and limited military operations .
The US policy of the dual containment cannot be understood without understanding the role that Israel has played in it .
Following the 1979 Revolution in Iran , which ended a cozy and symbiotic relation between the Jewish state and the Shah , Israel started a campaign against the new Iranian government .
However , once the Iran - Iraq war started , Israel began to sell arms to Iran .
This was not because Israel was against the US policy of dual containment and the devastation of Iran and Iraq in a costly and protracted war , but because Israel wished to see Iraq contained before Iran .
As a result , while the US was aiding Iraq , Israel was selling arms to Iran , and , eventually , got the US to sell arms to Iran in the infamous Iran - Contra scandal .
When put in historical context the Iran - Contra affair does not appear as an aberration or isolated incident .
It was part of the policy of helping to contain both countries .
At the end of the Iran - Iraq war , however , Israel , like the US , largely concentrated on containing Iraq .
In so doing , Israel contributed greatly to the propaganda campaign against Saddam Hussein before Iraq was invaded by the US .
After the imposition of UN sanctions against Iraq in 1990 and the first US invasion of Iraq , Israel turned its attention toward containing Iran .
With the help of its lobby groups in the US , particularly the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , Israel concentrated on strengthening US economic sanctions against Iran .
In this pursuit , Martin Indyk , the head of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , an AIPAC affiliate , became instrumental .
The meteoric rise of Martin Indyk to power in the Clinton Administration allowed him to carry on the policy of dual containment - which he took credit for devising - primarily by means of increasing sanctions against Iran .
In this policy Iran was accused of three misbehaviors : sponsoring terrorism worldwide ; opposing Middle East peace efforts ; and developing weapons of
mass destruction .
Once formulated , these alleged misbehaviors became the rationale for maintaining and strengthening US sanctions against Iran .
Indeed , during the Clinton Administration Israeli lobby groups became the major underwriters of US foreign policy toward Iran .
Besides Martin Indyk there were other individuals in the Clinton Administration who helped develop the Iran sanctions policy .
One such individual was Secretary of State Warren Christopher , who had a particular animosity toward Iran since his hostage negotiation days .
This animosity came in handy for Indyk and the Israeli lobby groups in implementing their sanctions policy against Iran .
But this was not all ; there was also a competition between a predominantly Republican Congress and a Democratic Administration as to which was more hostile to Iran and thus faithful to Israel .
In this competition , the role of Senator Alfonse D’Amato in trying to pass sanctions acts against Iran is examined in my book .
One major act , the Iran - Libya Sanctions Act ( ILSA ) - which imposed secondary sanctions on foreign companies that would make new investments of at least $ 40 million in Iran - becomes a focus of my study .
With the passage of ILSA , however , the US sanctions policy started to fall apart .
Not only did many countries around the world defy it , the US corporate lobbies , too , began to organize to oppose various Israeli lobby groups .
In this regard , I examine the role of some heavyweights that the corporate lobby brought forth to oppose the sanctions - such as two former national security advisors , Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft - the formation of an umbrella lobby organization called USA * ENGAGE , various individuals or lobbyist groups working with the Iranian government who started to organize , and a number of US Congressmen who were lobbied by the corporations to oppose the passage of further unilateral sanctions against Iran .
All this , as well as the appointment of a new Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright , who tilted more toward the corporate lobby , resulted in an incoherent and inconsistent US policy toward Iran at the end of the Clinton era , a policy that tried to reconcile the irreconcilable aims and interests of Israel and the US corporations .
It is worth noting that during the Clinton Administration the Mujahedin - e - Khalq - e - Iran ( MEK ) , an Iranian exile group , became a convenient tool in the hands of strange bedfellows - namely Iraq , the US , and Israel - in a campaign to overthrow the Iranian government .
Even though in 1997 , as a result of some shifts in US foreign policy , the US State Department put MEK officially on the list of terrorist organizations , the group operates relatively freely in the US to this day .
The end of the Clinton era ushered in a new phase in the US policy of containment of Iran .
The 2000 US presidential election brought uncertainty concerning the future policies of the Bush Administration toward the Middle East in general and Iran in particular .
The fact that the new administration was top heavy with former oil executives added to this uncertainty .
Yet , in spite of the uncertainty , Israel correctly perceived that the policy would be made more by the neoconservative forces within the new administration - such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle - than anyone else , including those in the State Department .
Wolfowitz and Perle - who were on the Board of Advisors of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , an offshoot of AIPAC - had advocated , at least since 1992 , the use of military force against Iraq .
But Israel was more interested in containing Iran rather than Iraq and was hoping that the neoconservative forces , particularly those within the administration , would achieve that goal .
The events of September 11 , 2001 played a determining role in both containments .
The neoconservative forces got what they had wished for when it came to invading Iraq .
But as far as Iran was concerned , the initial reaction of the US State Department after 9/11 was to start a courtship dance with Iran , a dance that Israel , its lobby groups , and its neoconservative allies , in and out of the administration , watched with a great deal of trepidation .
A concerted campaign was waged by Israeli officials , including Binyamin Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon , to end the dance .
The US was warned by these officials not to cozy up to Iran .
Such warnings , as well as the puzzling Karine - A affair , managed to end the US State Department ’s attempt to approach Iran .
The death of the rapprochement was made official by President Bush in his " axis of evil " speech on January 29 , 2002 , a speech in which Iran was accused , along with Iraq and North Korea , of aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction and exporting terror .
In the end , Israel , its various lobby groups , and its neoconservative allies changed the direction of US policy toward Iran as conceived by the US State Department .
A case had to be made as to why Iran should be targeted .
Israel put forward a list of allegations against Iran that included everything from Iran ’s involvement in the Karine - A affair to pursuing missiles capable of striking Israel with chemical and biological weapons , dispatching its Revolutionary Guards to foment anti-Israel activity in Lebanon , and being on schedule to develop a nuclear bomb by 2005 .
Yet even though Israel had made its case for targeting Iran , and wished to see Iran attacked before Iraq , it had to settle for second - best : wait until after the invasion of Iraq to contain Iran .
Thus , in an interview with The Times ( London ) on November 5 , 2002 , Sharon stated that he considered Iran to be the " centre of world terror , " and " that as soon as an Iraq conflict is concluded , he will push for Iran to be at the top of the ‘ to do ’ list . "
How was Iran pushed to the top of the US ’s " to do " list ?
As in the case of Iraq , Iran ’s alleged development of weapons of mass destruction became the rallying point for targeting the country .
The first step in the process came in late summer 2002 , when , in a dramatic press conference , a representative of MEK revealed the construction of a uranium enrichment facility and a heavy water production plant in Iran , neither of which had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
The actual source of the revelation appears to have been Israel , which passed the information to MEK .
Once these constructions were disclosed , the US and Israel started to build a case for reporting Iran to the United Nations Security Council and for the imposition of sanctions .
How the case proceeded is narrated in my book .
Before that , however , the origin of Iran ’s nuclear program is discussed .
It is argued that the US and Israel had no problems with Iran ’s nuclear program when the Shah of Iran was in power .
Indeed , the US helped the Shah with nuclear technology and encouraged him to build nuclear power plants .
Subsequently , the Shah signed an agreement to purchase two reactors from Germany to be installed at Bushehr .
The construction of these power plants began in 1975 , but after the 1979 Iranian Revolution the Germans left the country without completing the project .
In 1995 Iran signed a formal agreement with Russia to finish the Bushehr reactor .
But Russia continuously postponed the completion of the reactor and delivery of nuclear fuel .
Given Russia ’s foot - dragging , as well as the numerous US sanctions imposed on Iran , it appears that Iran had engaged in a number of nuclear - related activities not reported to the IAEA , including building the two structures that were disclosed by MEK .
Even though , technically speaking , the construction of these facilities did not violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) - to which Iran is a signatory - it provided the perfect excuse to the US and Israel to argue that Iran was clandestinely developing nuclear weapons .
Such claims , however , were not new .
They were heard as early as 1984 , when a neoconservative argued that Iran might be only two years away from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Following this claim there were numerous others concerning the impending development of nuclear weapons by Iran .
Indeed , in the 1990s a number of sources associated with Israel claimed that Iran had already purchased three or four nuclear warheads from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan .
That allegation and subsequent assertions concerning Iran developing nuclear arsenals all proved to be false .
But the guessing game continued well into the late 1990s and early 2000s .
With each day passing and no nuclear weapons or even evidence of development of such weapons showing up , the ever - changing prediction of doomsday appeared to attract little attention until the revelation of the two unreported nuclear - related facilities in Iran .
Once this revelation was made , Israel could push for Iran to be at the top of the US ’s " to do " list .
The road was being paved to report Iran to the Security Council .
The 2003 IAEA report mentioned certain failures by Iran to disclose information .
It also encouraged Iran to sign the " Additional Protocol " to the IAEA Safeguards Agreements .
But the report did not show any smoking gun and , therefore , was not the report that the US and Israel needed to contain Iran .
Nevertheless , the report left a number of open questions that made the US and Israel hopeful about taking Iran before the Security Council .
For example , why was Iran developing a facility to produce heavy water , building a uranium enrichment facility , manufacturing uranium metal , hesitant to allow IAEA inspectors visit an electric workshop and take environmental samples ?
The last question , in particular , made the US and Israel contend that Iran was hiding something , and this could be an indication of a nuclear weapons program .
In the end , this allegation proved to be incorrect .
However , such allegations continued to be made until Iran was reported to the Security Council .
In addition to making false claims , the US and Israel intensified their psychological warfare against Iran , threatening a preemptive military strike on her nuclear facilities .
Such threats made the Europeans , particularly France , Britain , and Germany ( EU 3 ) , worry and start negotiating with Iran in October of 2003 to sign the " Additional Protocol , " stop nuclear enrichment , and provide full disclosure of its nuclear program .
The Iranian government capitulated and signed an agreement in December 2003 , even though the Iranian parliament refused to ratify the " Additional Protocol . "
The US and Israel , however , continued their pressure on Iran by making false claims and portraying Iran as a threat to Israel and the world at large .
Pressure mounted in summer of 2004 to report Iran to the Security Council .
The EU 3 made a last - ditch effort to stop Iran ’s enrichment activities .
The result was the November 2004 Paris Agreement , which asked Iran to suspend all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities voluntarily and temporarily in exchange for some vague and , for all practical purposes , undeliverable economic promises .
The US gave this agreement guarded approval but made it clear that it was a kind of " good - cop , bad - cop arrangement , " where the Europeans and Americans were working together but playing different roles .
The US and Israel intensified their threats of a preemptive strike against Iran in 2005 .
By now the argument had changed from not allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons to not even tolerating Iran having knowledge of nuclear enrichment .
At the same time there were reports that the US might support EU negotiations with Iran and accept the so - called carrot and stick approach .
Even though this was no more than the bad cop joining the good cop , Israel and its lobby groups were opposed to any shift in US policy and waged a campaign against it .
In Iran , too , there was opposition to the Paris Agreement , especially after the US gave the agreement its tacit blessing .
The opposition became stronger with the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as President of Iran , a man who was demonized by a massive US and Israeli disinformation campaign as soon as he took office .
After protesting that the Paris Agreement was turning a voluntary and temporary halt in uranium enrichment activities into a permanent freeze and that the EU had not kept its part of the bargain , Iran ended the agreement .
The campaign to report Iran to the Security Council by the IAEA gained momentum and a resolution to this effect was passed ; however , the question of the timing of when the matter would be referred to the Security Council was left open .
A number of events speeded up the process of referral .
One such event was Ahmadinejad quoting Ayatollah Khomeini as saying that the occupying regime of Jerusalem must disappear from the page of time .
The statement was translated in both Israel and the US as " wipe Israel off the map , " and was used in a massive campaign to portray Iran as Nazi Germany and Ahmadinejad as another Hitler poised to commit a holocaust .
Another was the claim by American intelligence officials that they had discovered a stolen laptop showing Iran ’s attempt to design a nuclear warhead .
The contents of the laptop were shown to IAEA inspectors , but , IAEA officials doubted the authenticity of the material , and believed that much of the intelligence provided by the US and other intelligence services had proved to be wrong .
Numerous assertions , even though false , made any compromise solution impossible .
In the end , a relentless effort by the US and Israel to bring Iran before the Security Council and impose UN sanctions against her paid off in early 2006 .
The IAEA was forced to issue an early update brief followed by a full report on Iran ’s compliance with the earlier resolution .
But even before the full report was issued , the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany reached an agreement , and soon afterwards the US obtained the necessary vote to refer Iran to the Security Council .
Iran , in turn , ended all voluntary cooperation with the IAEA .
Accusations and threats by US and Israel continued against Iran even after Iran ’s referral to the Security Council .
As the US allocated more funds to bringing " democracy " to Iran , AIPAC mounted another " largest ever policy conference " aimed at bringing about the harshest possible sanctions against Iran .
Frantic efforts by those uneasy about imposing UN sanctions , including the Director General of the IAEA , failed as most US policy makers followed the lead of Israel and its allies in the US .
The Security Council issued in late March 2006 a draft statement asking Iran to halt all enrichment activities , and ordered the Director General of the IAEA to report in 30 days on Iran ’s compliance .
This was not exactly the harsh resolution that the US and Israel were hoping for .
The US pushed for the passage of a UN Chapter 7 resolution against Iran that could result in the use of military force against her .
In this effort , parallels were continuously drawn between Iran and Nazi Germany and Ahmadinejad and Hitler .
Iran ’s alleged hidden nuclear programs were reported and talks of pre-emptive military attacks by either the US , Israel , or both were heard .
In this atmosphere even the most outrageous tales would become credible news .
One such story was an alleged new law in Iran that would force the Iranian Jewish population to wear yellow insignia .
Even though the " news " proved to be a complete fabrication , it for some time and enabled many political figures around the world , particularly Americans , to condemn and demonize Iran .
The US , however , still had to get the reluctant Russians and Chinese on board to impose sanctions against Iran .
A new strategy was adopted : the US would join the EU 3 in negotiating with Iran if Iran halted all enrichment activities .
The Bush Administration knew full well that this offer would not be accepted by Iran and was , indeed , worried about a possible positive response by Iran .
The US gambit paid off , and the " carrot and stick " package offered was ultimately rejected by Iran .
The US wielded more sticks , including financial sanctions to paralyze the Iranian banking system .
Security Council Resolution 1696 was passed in July 2006 , demanding that Iran suspend all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities and that the Director General of the IAEA give a report by the end of August 2006 on Iran ’s compliance .
If Iran did not comply , according to Resolution 1696 , UN sanctions would be imposed .
The stage was set for the imposition of the first set of UN sanctions against Iran .
The August 2006 IAEA report indicated that Iran was not complying with UN Resolution 1696 .
The report was followed by Iran ’s adversaries calling for immediate imposition of sanctions .
Any compromise offered , including a temporary suspension of uranium enrichment by Iran , was ruled out by the US and Israel .
The US further tightened its financial sanctions against Iran , and Israel raised , once again , the specter of Iran becoming another Nazi Germany determined to commit another holocaust .
The campaign to impose UN sanctions against Iran was beginning to bear fruit .
Draft resolutions for such sanctions began to circulate in November 2006 .
War drums beat intensely and there was again talk of a possible military strike by Israel against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
US pressure mounted for adopting a sanction resolution .
The push resulted in Security Council Resolution 1737 in December of 2006 , the first UN sanction resolution against Iran .
The resolution demanded that Iran halt all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities and suspend work on all heavy water - related projects .
It asked all states to take the necessary measures to prevent the supply , sale , or transfer of all items , materials , equipment , goods , and technology which could contribute to Iran ’s enrichment related , reprocessing , or heavy water - related activities , or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems .
It also asked all states to exercise vigilance regarding the entry into or transit through their territories of individuals engaged in Iran ’s proliferation - sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems .
In addition , the resolution provided a list of certain Iranians and asked all states to freeze their funds , other financial assets , and economic resources .
Moreover , the resolution established a sanctions committee to monitor Iran ’s compliance with the resolution and collect information from countries about their trade with Iran .
Finally , the resolution asked the Director General of the IAEA to provide a report in 60 days on Iran ’s compliance .
Resolution 1737 was the crown jewel of the US - Israeli policy of containment of Iran .
More than a quarter of a century of US unilateral sanctions against Iran , many underwritten by forces close to Israel , had not contained Iran .
Even though this resolution was too weak to contain Iran , it was hoped that future resolutions would do the job .
Iran shrugged off the sanctions and reduced its cooperation with the IAEA .
The US levied more accusations against Iran and engaged in more provocative acts .
Israel continued to call Iran an existential threat .
In early 2007 there were fears that a war with Iran might become inevitable .
In the end , however , the threats of war were used to set the stage for the second round of UN sanctions against Iran .
After an IAEA report indicating Iran ’s non-compliance with Resolution 1737 , the US and Israel pushed for another resolution .
The result was Security Council Resolution 1747 in March 2007 , which extended previous sanctions .
The resolution called upon all states to exercise vigilance and restraint regarding the entry into or transit through their territories of certain Iranians engaged in or associated with Iran ’s proliferation - sensitive nuclear activities .
In addition , it provided another list of Iranian entities involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities and entities whose funds or assets shall be frozen .
Among these was one of the largest banks in Iran .
Resolution 1747 also stated that Iran shall not supply , sell , or transfer any arms or related materiel .
Furthermore , it called upon all states to exercise vigilance and restraint in the supply , sale , or transfer of any battle tanks , armored combat vehicles , large caliber artillery systems , combat aircraft , attack helicopters , warships , missiles , or missile systems .
Finally , the resolution asked all states and international financial institutions not to enter into new commitments for grants , financial assistance , and concessional loans to the Iranian government .
As in the previous case , the resolution asked the Director General of the IAEA to prepare a report within 60 days as to whether Iran had complied with the demands of Resolutions 1737 and 1747 .
Iranian officials were defiant and shrugged off the effect of the resolutions .
Yet Resolutions 1737 and 1747 put great pressure on Iran economically and politically , setting the stage for further , and harsher , resolutions to follow .
The next Security Council sanction resolution against Iran did not materialize until nearly a year after Resolution 1747 .
On March 3 , 2008 , the Security Council passed its third sanction resolution against Iran , Resolution 1803 .
[ 2 ]
The new resolution tightens two previously passed sanction acts by 1 ) asking states to exercise " vigilance and restraint " against a new set of Iranian nationals purportedly involved in " proliferation - sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear - weapon delivery systems " ; 2 ) extending the freezing of the financial assets of persons or entities allegedly " supporting " the above mentioned activities ; 3 ) calling upon states to " exercise vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in Iran , in particular with Bank Melli and Bank Saderat " ; and 4 ) continuing to block the import and export of allegedly " sensitive nuclear material and equipment . "
Resolution 1803 also added a new provision to the previous sanction acts : it called upon states to " inspect cargo to and from Iran of aircraft and vessels owned or operated by Iran Air Cargo and Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line , provided ‘ reasonable grounds ’ existed to believe that the aircraft or vessel was transporting prohibited goods . "
This new provision is one of the most dangerous provisions in all the resolutions that have been passed so far by the Security Council against Iran .
The term " Reasonable grounds " is ambiguous .
What is reasonable or unreasonable is in the eye of the beholder .
Thus , theoretically , any adversary of Iran can now stop an Iranian aircraft or vessel to inspect it because it is " believed " there is " reasonable grounds " for such an inspection .
If the Iranian vessel refuses inspection , all hell could break loose .
The new provision was probably one of the reasons why four non-permanent members of the Security Council , Indonesia , Libya , South Africa and Vietnam , tried in vain to stop , revise or at least slow down the passage of Resolution 1803 .
At the end , however , under pressure from the US and its allies , three of the four countries caved in and went along with the resolution .
The fourth , Indonesia , abstained .
US and its allies , who wanted unanimous vote against Iran in the Security Council , and wished for a much harsher resolution , declared victory nevertheless .
But this was not enough .
A day after , US , France and Britain tried to introduce another resolution against Iran at the meeting of the IAEA .
This time , however , Russia , China and a number of countries belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) stopped the effort and argued that given the action by the Security Council a day earlier , a new resolution against Iran would be superfluous .
All this happened against the backdrop of two major reports undermining the necessity of passing a third sanction resolution against Iran .
The first was the November 2007 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) report , entitled " Iran : Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities . " [ 3 ]
The " Key Judgments " portion of the report that was made public stated :
We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program ; we also assess with moderate - to - high confidence that Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons .
We judge with high confidence that the halt , and Tehran ’s announcement of its decision to suspend its declared uranium enrichment program and sign an Additional Protocol to its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Safeguards Agreement , was directed primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure resulting from exposure of Iran ’s previously undeclared nuclear work .
The report , of course , claimed that Iran had exerted " considerable effort from at least the late 1980s to 2003 to develop such [ nuclear ] weapons . "
But the assertion that such efforts had been halted in 2003 not only removed the rationale for the US and Israel to wage a military campaign against Iran but it apparently slowed down the attempt to pass a third sanction act through the Security Council .
Indeed , the resolution which passed recently was supposed to have been passed in early summer of 2007 .
But almost immediately after the conclusion of the NIE report became public the US government , as well as its allies , belittled or even dismissed its value , and , in so doing , made the passage of a new sanction resolution against Iran appear to be urgent .
The second report that undermined the urgency of the 3rd round of UN sanctions was the IAEA report .
[ 4 ]
The summary of the report stated that
The Agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran .
Iran has provided the Agency with access to declared nuclear material and has provided the required nuclear material accountancy reports in connection with declared nuclear material and activities .
Iran has also responded to questions and provided clarifications and amplifications on the issues raised in the context of the work plan , with the exception of the alleged studies .
Iran has provided access to individuals in response to the Agency ’s requests .
Although direct access has not been provided to individuals said to be associated with the alleged studies , responses have been provided in writing to some of the Agency ’s questions .
The summary also stated that the " Agency has been able to conclude that answers provided by Iran , in accordance with the work plan , are consistent with its findings . "
But , the summary also added , the " one major remaining issue relevant to the nature of Iran ’s nuclear programme is the alleged studies on the green salt project , high explosives testing and the missile re-entry vehicle . "
According to the report , the documents related the allegations were only shown to Iran in February , as late as just a few days before the IAEA report .
Iran the report states , " maintained that these allegations are baseless and that the data have been fabricated . "
The Agency , the report stated , is examining the allegations and the statements provided by Iran .
The allegations apparently refer to the content of the " stolen laptop " that the US had in its possession and supposedly showed Iran ’s plans to build a nuclear warhead .
[ 5 ]
The content of this mysterious laptop had resurfaced a number of times before and its authenticity questioned by a number of sources , including IAEA ’s own experts .
For example , on February 22 , 2007 , the Guardian reported that , according to " informed sources " at the IAEA , " most of the tip - offs about supposed secret weapons sites provided by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies have led to dead ends when investigated by IAEA inspectors . "
The report quoted an IAEA " diplomat " as saying : " Most of it has turned out to be incorrect . . .
They gave us a paper with a list of sites .
[ The inspectors ] did some follow - up , they went to some military sites , but there was no sign of [ banned nuclear ] activities . "
The report then referred to the mysterious " stolen laptop " that the US had in its possession and supposedly showed Iran ’s " plans to build a nuclear warhead . "
As the report pointed out , in " July 2005 , US intelligence officials showed printed versions of the material to IAEA officials , who judged it to be sufficiently specific to confront Iran . "
But the report pointed out that IAEA officials doubted the authenticity of the laptop .
" First of all , " the Guardian quoted one such official as saying , " if you have a clandestine programme , you do n’t put it on laptops which can walk away [ Moreover , the ] data is all in English which may be reasonable for some of the technical matters , but at some point you ’d have thought there would be at least some notes in Farsi .
So there is some doubt over the provenance of the computer . "
A similar report appeared on February 25 , 2007 , in the Los Angeles Times under the heading " U.N. Calls U.S. Data on Iran ’s Nuclear Aims Unreliable . "
The report quoted a " senior diplomat at the IAEA " as saying : " Since 2002 , pretty much all the intelligence that ’s come to us [ by way of the CIA and other Western spy services ] has proved to be wrong . "
This report , too , pointed out that some IAEA officials doubted the authenticity of the laptop story .
Had IAEA officials changed their minds ?
Was there more to this report than had been divulged before ?
Or was the intense pressure exerted on the IAEA by the US and its allies , including repeated calls by the US and Israel to remove the IAEA Director , Dr. ElBaradei , resulted in the IAEA changing its position about the authenticity of the allegations ?
Given the number of false claims made by the US and its allies - which I have documented in my book - and given the intense pressure that the IAEA has been under to produce results agreeable to Iran ’s adversaries , one cannot help but to suspect that story of the mysterious laptop might be another fabrication .
Whatever the nature of the US allegations , one thing is certain : even if the threat of military attack against Iran by the US , Israel or both has subsided for the time being , sanctioning of Iran has not .
US unilateral sanctions , as well UN multilateral sanctions , are being intensified .
Iran is clearly feeling the pain of numerous sanctions .
It is , however , uncertain whether this pain is sufficient for Iran to relinquish its " inalienable right " to " develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination , " as guaranteed under Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
The fact that after three rounds of UN sanctions Iran is still cooperating with the IAEA shows that Iran is bending under the pressure .
But even if Iran does forfeit its right and capitulates , it is uncertain whether the US and Israel would stop their attempts to contain Iran .
If containment means the destruction of any country that stands in the way of US and Israel , the fate of Iran might be similar to that of Iraq ; ultimately an excuse will be found to do to Iran what was done to Iraq .
The advocates of the dual containment policy , particularly those who had argued that Iran should be contained before Iraq , have been relentless .
They will not stop until they achieve the ultimate containment of Iran .

Senate Debate - Spy Bill - FISA S.2248 - CALL SENATORS NOW !
Senator Edwards sent the following email to supporters this afternoon .
When it comes to protecting the rule of law , words are not enough .
We need action .
It ’s wrong for your government to spy on you .
That ’s why I ’m asking you to join me today in calling on Senate Democrats to filibuster revisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) that would give “ retroactive immunity ” to the giant telecom companies for their role in aiding George W. Bush ’s illegal eavesdropping on American citizens .
The Senate is debating this issue right now — which is why we must act right now .
You can find your Senators ’ phone numbers here or call the Senate Switchboard at 1-( 202)-224-3121 .
Granting retroactive immunity is wrong .
It will let corporate law - breakers off the hook .
It will hamstring efforts to learn the truth about Bush ’s illegal spying program .
And it will flip on its head a core principle that has guided our nation since our founding : the belief that no one , no matter how well connected or what office they hold , is above the law .
But in Washington today , the telecom lobbyists have launched a full - court press for retroactive immunity .
George Bush and Dick Cheney are doing everything in their power to ensure it passes .
And too many Senate Democrats are ready to give the lobbyists and the Bush administration exactly what they want .
Please join me in calling on every Senate Democrat to do everything in their power — including joining Senator Dodd ’s efforts to filibuster this legislation — to stop retroactive immunity and stand up for the rule of law .
The Constitution should not be for sale at any price .
Thank you for taking action .

An effort by the Bush administration to improve federal climate research has answered some questions but lacks a focus on impacts of changing conditions and informing those who would be most affected , a panel of experts has found .
The Climate Change Science Program , created in 2002 by President Bush to improve climate research across 13 government agencies , has also been hampered by governmental policies that have grounded earth - observing satellites and dismantled programs to monitor environmental conditions on earth , concluded the report , issued by the National Academies , the nation ’s pre-eminent scientific advisory group .
In a printed statement , Veerabhadran Ramanathan , the panel ’s chairman , said that the program ’s basic scientific efforts had constituted “ an important initiative that has broadened our knowledge of climate change . ”
Among other things , the report noted , the effort has helped resolve disputes over whether the earth ’s atmosphere is warming significantly or not , allowing scientists to compare data and agree that warming is occurring .
Senator Clinton : No ' blank check ' for Pakistani government Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz
Published : Saturday December 29 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Senator and 2008 presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY ) says , during a recent interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer , that the Pakistani government should not receive what she calls another " blank check " from the Bush Administration .
Clinton also does not trust the Pakistani government to conduct its own investigation into the assassination of former Prime Minister and opposition party leader Benazir Bhutto .
A government that dismantled its independent judiciary , quashed political opposition and suppressed its media cannot be trusted , she asserts .
The Senator calls for a full , independent international investigation , discouraging American involvement , for fear that it would lack credibility and politicize what should be a genuine effort to uncover the truth .
Clinton says a fully independent investigation is in the best interests of the Pakistani people and the advancement of democracy in Pakistan ; Clinton suggests an investigation modeled on the one the UN has been conducting into the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
" President Musharraf , " says the Senator , " in every meeting I 've had with him ; the elites in Pakistan , who still wield tremendous power ; plus the leadership of the military , act as though they can destabilize Pakistan and retain their positions -- their positions of privilege ; their positions of authority .
That is not the way it will work . "
" This is a damning indictment of President Pervez Musharraf , " responds Blitzer .
" Some are calling on him to step down .
Do you believe he should step down ? "
" What I believe , " Clinton responds , " is that he should meet certain conditions , and quickly . "
Clinton calls for internationally supported free elections after Bhutto 's successor has been named .
If Musharraf chooses to run , she continues , he should be bound by the same rules that will govern his opponents .
Clinton also calls for the return to an independent judiciary .
Having already given $ 10 billion to the Pakistani military with dubious results against the Taliban and al - Qaeda , says Clinton , the United States should not continue to turn a blind eye to Pakistan 's other activities simply in exchange for its status as a " reliable ally . "
( One report worries that much aid has been misappropriated towards efforts against India . )
A " reliable ally , " charges Clinton , would have done more to combat al - Qaeda and the Taliban , and would n't work to undermine democracy like Musharraf has .
" I do not think we should be giving the Musharraf government a blank check , and that 's exactly what the Bush Administration has done , " says Clinton , who calls for accountability not only from Pakistan , but from the Department of Defense , in handling money funding efforts in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan .
Clinton also urges diplomatic relations between Pakistan , Afghanistan and India .
" We need to help them understand what is in their interests , " she warns in reference to Pakistan 's elites , " and that , of course , includes President Musharraf . "
The entire exchange is available below .
It was aired on CNN's The Situation Room on December 28 , 2007 .
- video encodings still in process -
This marsupial has 3 up on the average male .
22 - year - old Gregory Barnard was having a pretty sweet night with his bros at the Times Square nightclub Arena ( pictured ) one night over the summer .
Fresh out of NYU , the kid spent the evening enjoying a reasonably priced $ 350 dollar bottle of vodka , watching the club ’s far - out video projections , and allegedly getting a beatdown from bouncers for not buying enough booze !
According to Barnard , it all started when the time came to settle the tab and his server seriously harshed the vibe with news of Arena ’s 3 bottle minimum , which left her no choice but to charge him an extra $ 700 bucks for two unordered bottles .
When Barnard refused , a series of events unfolded that truly capture the essence of the New York nightclub experience :
After running Barnard ’s credit card several times , the waitress claimed it was denied .
A bouncer threw him to the floor and held him down while two other bouncers punched and kicked him , he said .
They then picked Barnard up and walked him two blocks to an ATM for more money , but the bank had frozen his card because the waitress had already charged $ 1,400 on it , swiping the card at least nine times , he said .
So the bouncers dragged him back to the club and held him until the police arrived to arrest him for “ theft of services ” – a charge which was later dropped .
Oh , what a night .
Now Barnard is suing Arena for $ 2 million dollars ; he filed suit last week in Manhattan Supreme Court .
Forbes has said that New York City has some of the most expensive bottle service in the country .
And what ’s your worst nightclub bouncer experience – maybe we can get a class action going !

Mr Davis said a universal register could damage civil liberties
Shadow home secretary David Davis said allowing the state to hold profiles would be " incredibly intrusive " and called for an " effective " debate .
A senior police officer has suggested a universal register , after two killers were convicted using DNA evidence .
The Home Office has ruled this out , saying it would raise " significant practical and ethical issues " .
Sally Anne Bowman 's killer , Mark Dixie , and Suffolk serial murderer Steve Wright were both captured because their DNA was taken after unrelated offences .
Speaking on BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show , Mr Davis said : " Do we want to turn Britain into a nation of suspects ?
We have always had a presumption in our law , our basis of freedom , that people are not guilty until found guilty . "
The simple truth is that fingerprinting has been around a long time .
There 's never been a call for a fingerprinting database
David Davis
Conservatives
He said a universal database risked " changing the relationship between the ordinary citizen and the state " .
Mr Davis added : " The simple truth is that fingerprinting has been around a long time .
There 's never been a call for a fingerprinting database .
The same argument applies that we are criminalising the whole population ...
DNA is an incredibly intrusive thing . "
He said there had to be a debate about making the use of DNA information " more effective but with the minimum intrusion to the liberties of the British citizen " .
Meanwhile , former home secretary David Blunkett suggested the database could be extended on a voluntary basis .
He told Sky News : " I do n't think the government could possibly go snap and just say well let 's move from those who have committed a crime or been arrested to the whole population .
" I do n't think in one go that is a feasible proposition , but I think actually saying to people you 've got nothing to fear from this so long as we legislate to protect you . "
The Liberal Democrats have said the party is opposed to the idea of a national system , saying it did not " stack up on practical grounds " .
' Minimum intrusion '
The Association of Chief Police Officers is calling for a debate on whether to expand the current database - of DNA details taken from crime suspects - to cover all people in the UK .
Both killers were convicted with compelling DNA evidence
Wright was on the existing system after being convicted of theft in 2003 , and when police found his DNA on the bodies of some of his victims they matched it with his profile .
But Dixie was not on the system at the time of Sally Anne Bowman 's murder in 2005 .
It was only when he was arrested for assault after a fight in a bar nine months later that his DNA was taken and he was linked to the murder .
He was arrested within five hours .
Det Supt Stuart Cundy , who led the murder hunt , said : " It is my opinion that a national DNA register - with all its appropriate safeguards - could have identified Sally Anne 's murderer within 24 hours . "
The DNA database , which covers England and Wales , currently contains around 4.5 m profiles - routinely taken from criminal suspects after most arrests .
It is already the largest of its kind in the world but is controversial .
Since 2004 , the data of everyone arrested for a recordable offence - all but the most minor offences - has remained on the system regardless of their age , the seriousness of their alleged offence , and whether or not they were prosecuted .
The existing register could be threatened when the European Court of Human Rights is asked to rule next week on a test case of two Britons who want their details removed from the database .
The Americans and Iraqis have responded to the influx of militants with operations to cut off the insurgents ’ financing and by pursuing insurgent leaders , including Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia ’s emir for the eastern side of the city who was killed in a raid late last month .
American and Iraqi units have been able to hold off the insurgents and disrupt their planning .
But they have not been able to decrease the rate of attacks in Mosul , which has held stubbornly steady over the past year even as attacks have fallen in Baghdad and Anbar Province , according to an analysis by American officers .
That has prompted American and Iraqi commanders to propose the return of two Iraqi battalions that were sent from western Mosul earlier this year to bolster Iraqi forces in Baghdad .
Such a move would increase the Iraqi troop strength here by 1,400 troops or more , according to estimates by American officers , and enable the Iraqis to establish more outposts in some of the more violent areas of the city .
“ We are in the process of seeing what might come out of the situation in Baghdad as they consolidate down there , ” said Col .
Tony Thomas , the deputy commander of the First Armored Division , which has responsibility for northern Iraq .
“ Our biggest push , to be honest , as we looked at Mosul security is to ask for an emphasis on getting those Iraqi battalions back here . ”
There are no plans to send additional American units to Nineveh Province , though the replacement of Colonel Twitty ’s unit by the somewhat larger Third Armored Cavalry Regiment has led to a small troop increase .
But Colonel Thomas noted that other regions north of Baghdad , like Samarra and Baiji in Salahuddin Province , and Muqdadiya in Diyala Province , had been under pressure from insurgents .
A new book reveals the 22 - year effort by FBI director J Edgar Hoover to get Albert Einstein arrested as a political subversive or even a Soviet spy .
Uncovered FBI files are revealed in a book by Fred Jerome who says it was a clash of cultures - Einstein 's challenge and change with Hoover 's order and obedience .
From the time Einstein arrived in the US in 1933 to the time of his death , in 1955 , the FBI files reveal that his phone was tapped , his mail was opened and even his trash searched .
Einstein became world famous in 1906 for his Special Theory of Relativity that deals with light .
His General Theory of Relativity , published in 1919 , deals with gravity and has been called mankind 's greatest intellectual accomplishment .
Derogatory information
The Einstein File begins with a request by J Edgar Hoover in 1950 : " Please furnish a report as to the nature of any derogatory information contained in any file your bureau may have on the following person . "
That person was Albert Einstein , and the request intensified a secret campaign to discredit him .
Hoover was worried about Einstein 's liberal intellectualism and his dabbling in politics , something that has been forgotten today .
It has been overtaken by Einstein 's absent - minded professor image .
But Einstein was outspoken against social injustice and violations of civil rights .
The fledgling state of Israel once offered Einstein its presidency .
Einstein declined .
The broad outline of this story has been known since 1983 , when Richard Alan Schwartz , a professor of English at Florida International University in Miami , obtained a censored version of Einstein 's 1,427 - page FBI file .
But Jerome uncovers new material .
He sued the US Government with the help of the Public Citizen Litigation Group to obtain all the documents in the Einstein file .
Stalin comparison
The new material shows how the bureau spied on Einstein .
" It is like the agents got up in the morning , brushed their teeth , opened other people 's mail and tapped some phones , " he told the BBC .
After he left Germany , appalled by the barbarism of the Nazis , Einstein lent his name to a variety of organisations dedicated to peace and disarmament .
Because of this , the Woman Patriot Corp wrote a 16 - page letter to the State Department , the first item in Einstein 's file , in 1932 , arguing that Einstein should not be allowed into the United States .
" Not even Stalin himself " was affiliated with so many anarchic - communist groups , the letter said .
Fred Jerome reveals that the 1,800 - page document prepared about Einstein by the FBI shows that the agency even bugged his secretary 's nephew 's house .
The files reveal that for five years J Edgar Hoover tried , and failed , to link Einstein to a Soviet espionage ring .

Scalability , Three - Tiered Architectures , and Application Servers or " Why the Netscape Application Server ( Kiva ) Sucks " by Philip Greenspun for Web Tools Review
" Men are most apt to believe what they least understand . "
-- Michael de Montaigne
The first problem with this idea is that Java , because it must be compiled , is usually a bad choice of programming language for Web services ( see my book chapter on server - side programming ) .
The second problem with this idea is that , if what you really want to do is write some Java code that talks to data in your database , you can execute Java right inside of your RDBMS ( Oracle 8.1 , Informix 9.x ) .
Java executing inside the database server 's process is always going to have faster access to table data than Java running as a client .
In fact , at least with Oracle on a Unix box , you could bind Port 80 to a program that would call a Java program running in the Oracle RDBMS .
You do n't even need a Web server , much less an application server .
It is possible that you 'll get higher performance and easier development by adding a thin - layer Web server like AOLserver or Microsoft 's IIS / ASP , but certainly you can't get higher reliability by adding a bunch of extra programs and computers to a system that need only rely on one program and one computer .
This document works through some of these issues in greater detail , pointing out the grievous flaws in Netscape Application Server ( formerly " Kiva " ) and explaining the situations in which Oracle Application Server is useful .
There is no scalability problem
Newsweek
New York Times
Our hardware for this monstrously popular site ?
A Sun Microsystems SPARC Ultra 2 pizza box Unix machine , built in 1996 .
Its dual 167 - MHz CPUs would be laughed at by the average Quake - playing 10 - year - old .
The CPUs sit idle 80 % of the time .
The disks sit idle most of the time , partly because I spent $ 4,000 on enough RAM to hold the entire 750 MB data set .
Oh yes , the machine also serves a few hundred thousand hits / day for other customers of arsdigita.com and runs the street cleaning and birthday reminder services that we built .
If we tarred up the site and moved it to a mid-range Unix server such as the HP K460 that sits behind http://www.photo.net, we could probably serve at least 5 million hits / day .
If we moved it to the highest - end HP server , I 'd bet that we could get close to the 100 - million hit / day mark that sites like Yahoo serve .
Why has " scalable " become the buzzword du jour ?
People get burned because they do stupid things .
They connect their Web server to their RDBMS via CGI , thus forcing the machine to work 10 - 20 times as hard for no good reason .
They run Windows NT .
They run some unproven junkware / middleware that came in an attractive box .
Services get wedged and they run out and buy another dozen ( or thousand , as with www.microsoft.com) physical computer systems .
Now that they have a whole machine room full of hardware , they know that they can't keep it all running simultaneously so they look for software to yoke it all together somehow such that the death of one machine wo n't be noticed .
How do my friends and I avoid scalability problems ?
We know that we 're stupid .
We run the Oracle 8 RDBMS like the rest of the world and do n't try to figure out if some new competitor 's hype has any relationship to reality .
We talk to the RDBMS via AOLserver , which has been doing connection pooling from a Tcl API since 1995 .
So we get the safety and software develop ease of Perl / CGI but the computer never has to fork a CGI process and the database connections are shared among the scripts .
We 've served roughly 1 billion hits with AOLserver so we 're pretty sure that it works .
Linux and NT get magazine writers excited , but we run the same commercial versions of Unix on which the Fortune 500 relies for its enterprise computing .
There is no reliability / availability problem
But what 's reasonable and realistic ?
It will cost you a fortune in extra hardware , software , and administration time to shoot for 24x7x365 uptime .
And , in the end , you will never achieve it .
Nobody in the history of computing has ever achieved 100 % uptime .
So would you rather have three Web services that are down for eight scheduled hours / year and eight unscheduled hours or one service that was n't supposed to ever go down but in fact is unavailable for four hours / year ?
Why do people think that availability is such a problem ?
Again , they are mostly applying band - aids to decisions that were risky on the face .
If you read a Sun Microsystems marketing brochure , you might be ready to run out and buy a 64 - processor E10000 .
But after watching one of their contract service guys try to fix a desktop
Sun system , a wise person would probably think twice about relying on the latest , greatest , and most complex Sun server .
Does that mean you can't buy a big fancy machine ?
Of course not .
I 'm not nervous about my personal HP K460 with its 36 disk drives on 6 SCSI chains , 4 CPUs , 4 GB of RAM , and 2 network cards .
Why not ?
All the HP service engineers that I 've met in the Boston area are wizards on both the hardware and software .
How about Windows NT ?
Do you personally know anyone serving 10 million hits / day , every day , from an NT box parked where they do n't have physical access ?
If not , why risk your service on NT ?
Suppose I could get a couple more HP K460s and the HP ServiceGuard software and maybe some round - robin routers , all for free ?
Would it make my site more reliable ?
I do n't think so .
I do n't have enough time or money to figure out how to install , configure , and maintain all that stuff .
I would n't even have time to document the configuration so that if I were on vacation and the site failed , someone else could bring it back up .
The Three - Tiered Architecture
relational database management system ( RDBMS ) business logic ( if statements ) presentation layer ( formatting )
relational database management system ( RDBMS ) application server web server
Before trashing the idea of the application server , let me trash the idea of the three - tiered architecture for Web services .
They can afford it but you can't
They have time and you do n't ( or " the three - yeared architecture " )
A Web service usually has to go from conception to launch in less than one year , preferably closer to 6 months .
If you can't do that , the idea that seemed so clever will probably already have been done by six other people .
It might be nice to break everything up into abstractions , layers , objects , and protocols operating on three redundant tiers .
But what if it takes you three years ?
How can you be sure that the publishing or business needs wo n't change radically six months after you launch and get some real user experience ?
Gentle - slope Programming Systems
The end result of this process is laughably unreliable since NT is n't truly crash - proof , IIS does n't work so well , ASP is a bit flakey , and the COM / DCOM stuff is n't reliable or fast .
But the process by which the publisher got to this end result is perfectly reasonable .
America Online was enamored of the process but not of the resulting reliability .
So they added " ADP " pages to AOLserver ( http://www.aolserver.com).
An HTML document is a legal ADP program .
Magic escape codes allow the developer to insert a bit of Tcl .
When the developer needs some powerful encapsulated programs , a programmer can build Tcl modules that are loaded at server start - up .
If that is n't sufficient , a programmer can write a shared library in C and make it available to Tcl programs AOLserver - wide .
The C code has access to the full range of services on a Unix machine .
In the Apache world , people achieve the same results with a mix of traditional Perl CGI scripts and plug - in modules .
The approach that is closest to ASP in spirit is the PHP hypertext preprocessor ( see http://www.php.net).
A cleaner system than any of the above is Meta - HTML ( http://www.metahtml.com), which extends HTML syntax and semantics into a powerful programming language .
This means that the developer is n't forced to constantly bounce between Tcl and HTML syntax , for example .
Curl is one of the most thoughtfully developed gentle - slope programming systems for the Web .
It was built by computer systems researchers at MIT and works for both server - and client - side Web programming ( see http://curl.lcs.mit.edu/curl/wwwpaper.html).
Curl is currently being commercialized by a venture capital - backed company .
Almost all of the implementations of these gentle - slope languages provide the developer with a rapid - prototyping environment .
To make a change to a program , the developer need only edit a file in the Unix file system .
The next time a URL is requested , the new version of the program is used .
Note that the earliest
Web server scripting system , Perl / CGI , has this property .
Life with an Application Server ( KIVA / Netscape )
Last year , I worked with a group of programmers who were rebuilding a site that had originally been knocked out by a consultant in a couple of months .
It was some big , nasty Perl scripts talking to an Oracle RDBMS .
Homely yet functional .
The new team of programmers loved Kiva .
Actually they bristled at the title " programmer " and would point out that they were in fact " software engineers . "
I do n't mention that as a point of ridicule , but rather to illustrate their perspective .
They dealt in high - level concepts on prototypes that remained prototypical right up until the VC funding ran out .

After you pay $ 35,000 per CPU , you can add a dynamic page to your Web site by following these easy steps , as outlined by one of my co-developers :
1. write your java code in foo .
java 2 . compile with : /usr / local/kds/jdk1.1.5/bin/javac - g - classpath " /usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.zip:/usr/local/kds/classes/java/SWING.JAR:/usr/local/kds/classes/java/kfcjdk11.jar:/usr/local/kds/classes/java/kdsjdk11.jar:/usr/local/kds/classes/java/ktjdk11.jar::/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/classes:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.jar:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/rt.jar:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/i18n.jar:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.zip:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/classes:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.jar:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/rt.jar:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/i18n.jar:/usr/local/kds/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.zip::/usr/local/kds/APPS " " /usr/local/kds/APPS/yourappname/foo.java "
3 . once sucessfullly compiled , create a GUID with : /usr / local / kds/bin/ kguidgen
4 . paste a copy of this GUID into your code .
5 . edit yourappname.gxr and add an entry for foo , with the GUID 6 .
Register the applogic with / usr / local / kds / bin / kreg yourappname.gxr if you like , or for some reason this does n't work , you can run kreg without arguments in interactive mode .
7 . you can access the guid at http://yourserver.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+foo
The logs are in /usr / local / kds/ log / I think the kjsdev.log usually has the most interesting information .
If your applogic fails at run time , the browser will return " document contains no data "

Now that we 've covered the day - to - day pain of working with Kiva / Netscape Application Server , let 's look at some of its more pervasive shortcomings .
Become a prisoner
If I write a Java program using the Servlet API to talk to the Web and the JDBC API to talk to an RDBMS , then I can run my program without modification on sites backed by the following Web servers : AOLserver , Apache , Lotus Domino , Microsoft IIS , Netscape Enterprise , Sun Java Web Server , Zeus ( and about 20 more , according to http://jserv.javasoft.com/products/java-server/servlets/environments.html).
If I write a Java program to the Kiva / Netscape API , then I can run my program on a system with the $ 35,000 / CPU Netscape Application Server .
Period .
Half - baked ideas
select * from users where user_id = 6752
select * from users where user_id = :1
The SQL Standard
[ 03/11/98 02:10:23:4 ] warning : ORCL - 048 : select * from users where user_id = : 1_id
Another half - thought - through idea in Kiva is that data from browser cookies and data from HTML form variables should come in via the same programming interface .
Unfortunately , that means if a cookie and a form variable have the same name , you 'll only get the value of one of them .
I do n't want to go on record as saying that Tcl and Visual Basic are the world 's greatest computer languages .
However , they are real computer languages whose syntax and semantics are well - understood and thoroughly documented .
Ditto for Java , the Servlet API , and the JDBC API .
With Kiva / Netscape Application Server , it really is n't clear what the program is even supposed to do .
Why all of this pain is supposed to be worthwhile
Netscape Application Server is n't just a way to talk to your RDBMS , though .
Rather than have the RDBMS manage a user 's session state , you can ask the cluster of application servers to do it for you .
Because the load - balancing features of the application server mean that a user may be bounced from one physical machine to another , all of the user 's session state must be kept simultaneously up to date on every physical machine running the application server .
This is the well - known problem of keeping a consistent replicated database of dynamic information .
A wise Web publisher would not trust Oracle 8 to do this job .
After all , Oracle Corporation only has 20 years of experience in building this kind of system ( through 8 versions ) .
They only have $ 7 billion in revenue and 30,000 employees dedicated to making it reliable .
Banks and insurance companies rely on Oracle 's expertise .
But that 's not good enough for your Web site .
Instead , you want the 2.0 version of a product built by a small start - up company .
The fact that a customer 's Java syntax error can crash the entire product should n't dissuade you from trusting the Kiva programmers to have solved this difficult problem correctly .
Assuming you believe that the Kiva programmers figured out how to do replication correctly , remember that the servers have to communicate session state amongst themselves over the network .
You have to configure and administer this communication .
You have to make sure that the open ports used for this communication do n't become a security risk .
How is this security risk managed in practice ?
My friends who run Kiva never got this far .
They were never able to get Kiva to run on more than one physical machine at a time .
In fact , they had to restrict Kiva on that machine to a single thread .
So all of the users of their dynamic Web content must line up single - file .
If one of the users were to ask for a page that required Oracle to spend 30 seconds sweeping through some big tables , all of the other users would be staring at blank screens for 30 seconds .
Am I the only one ?
Here 's what Timothy Dyck had to say in the June 22 , 1998 edition of PC Week :
Once , after nearly an hour of continuous 100 percent CPU utilization , every Sun Java VM crashed so badly we could n't even kill them using the Solaris " kill - 9 " command .
With the Java VMs continuing to use nearly 100 percent of the server 's CPU resources , we had to reboot even the ( normally ) exceptionally stable Solaris system .
The bottom line is that even a few crashes per hour are n't acceptable for mission - critical applications .
After all the tests , we faced an inescapable fact : Java VMs and Java database drivers just are n't ready for the demands of high - load , production environments .
The major Java problems we observed under both Sapphire / Web and Netscape Application Server were crashes in Java threading code ( exceptions in java.lang.thread ) , which we solved by keeping thread counts below five per virtual machine ; unstable Oracle JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity ) drivers , particularly when handling date and time values ( which we mostly solved by getting Oracle Corp .'s as yet not publicly posted 8.0.4.2.0 JDBC drivers and sticking with Oracle 's type 4 all - Java drivers , which proved more stable and virtually the same speed as the company 's type 2 mixed Java / C drivers ) ; and large memory leaks in the JavaSoft VMs that caused them to continuously consume RAM during the test interval ( which we solved by equipping all servers with at least 1GB of RAM each and manually restarting all the Java VMs between each test run ) .
Despite having support from vendor experts , Dyck was unable to ever support more than 10 simultaneous users using Java pages in Netscape Application Server .
What kind of a machine was he using ?
Just a little SPARC E4000 with 8 CPUs ... ( this is a $ 200,000 box ) Something nice about Kiva / NAS
One potentially useful implication of using Netscape Application Server is that there is a hard separation between people who do design ( build templates ) and those who write programs to query the database ( build Java AppLogics ) .
Generally people can only argue about things that they understand .
Thus a bunch of business executives will approve a $ 1 billion nuclear power plant without any debate but argue for hours about whether the company should spend $ 500 on a party .
They 've all thrown parties before so they have an idea that maybe paper cups can be purchased for less than $ 2.75/100 .
But none of them have any personal experience purchasing cooling towers .
Analogously , if you show a super - hairy transactional Web service to a bunch of folks in positions of power at a big company , they are n't going to say " I think you would get better linguistics performance if you kept a denormalized copy of the data in the Unix file system and indexed it with PLS " .
Nor are they likely to opine that " You should probably upgrade to Solaris 2.6 because Sun rewrote the TCP stack to better handle 100 + simultaneously threads . "
Neither will they look at your SQL queries and say " you could clean this up by using the Oracle tree extensions ; look up CONNECT BY in the manual . "
What they will do is say " I think that page should be a lighter shade of mauve " .
In a Kiva - backed site , this can be done by a graphic designer editing a template and the Java programmer need never be aware of the change .
Of course , the graphic designer will have to be fairly formally minded and understand that chunks of the form % gx type=cell id=domain % % / gx % must be preserved .
Do you need to pay $ 35,000 / CPU to get this kind of separation of " business logic " from presentation ?
No .
You can download AOLserver for free and send your staff the following :
To : Web Developers
I want you to put all the SQL queries into Tcl functions that get loaded at server start - up time .
The graphic designers are to build ADP pages that call a Tcl procedure which will set a bunch of local variables with values from the database .
They are then to stick in the ADP page wherever they want one of the variables to appear .
Alternatively , write .tcl scripts that implement the business logic and , after stuffing a bunch of local vars , call ns_adp_parse to drag in the ADP created by the graphic designer .
Similarly , if you 've got Windows NT you can just use Active Server Pages with a similar directive to the developers : put the SQL queries in a COM object and call it at the top of an ASP page ; then reference the values returned within the HTML .
Again , you save $ 35,000 / CPU .
Finally , you can use the Web standards to separate design from presentation .
With the 4.x browsers , it is possible to pack a surprising amount of design into a cascading style sheet .
If your graphic designers are satisfied with this level of power , your dynamic pages can pump out rat- simple HTML .
From my own experience , some kind of templating discipline is useful on about 25 % of the pages in a typical transactional site .
Which 25 % ?
The pages that are viewed by the public ( and hence get extensively designed and redesigned ) and also require at least a screen or two of procedure language ( e.g. , Tcl ) statements or SQL .
Certainly templating is merely an annoyance when building admin pages , which are almost always plain text .
Maybe that 's why I find Kiva so annoying ; there are usually a roughly equal number of admin and user pages on the sites that I build .
The Bottom Line on Kiva
One special case where an application server might be useful
Unlike Kiva / NAS , OAS is essentially a stateless system , thus eliminating a whole class of potential bugs .
Summary
Maybe you 're having second thoughts at this point .
You 're going to be doing lots of transactions .
Your idea is so brilliant that you 're going to have half the world using your site .
Maybe a simple Web service layer on top of a proven RDBMS is good enough for Greenspun and his pathetic 500,000 hit per day personal site , but you 're building something serious here .
Two words of advice : " America Online " .
As of this writing ( July 1998 ) , AOL has 11 million members .
They have a bunch of Unix machines running a replicated Sybase .
They interface this replicated Sybase to the Web via a very simple stateless program : AOLserver .

In explaining some of this mess to MIT students in our one - semester course in software engineering for Web applications , it occurred to me that I never explained how three - tiered architectures and application servers came to be useful in large corporations to begin with .
Imagine that a large bank has a checking account system built in the 1960s on an IBM mainframe .
They also have a Visa card system built in the 1980s on a Unix machine running the Informix relational database management system .
They have a call - center management system built in the 1990s running on a Unix machine running the Oracle 7.3 RDBMS .
Suppose that the bank wants to offer the following service : Charlie Consumer calls up the 800 number and wants to pay his Visa bill directly from his checking account .
The bank 's IT staff is extremely risk - averse and does n't want anyone to touch the guts of any of the three existing systems .
So they hire a C programmer to write a custom program that will talk to the call center 's Oracle database to figure out which consumers want to transfer money , then talk to the Informix - and mainframe - based systems to actually move the funds .
This was called an application server because it contained the logic necessary to enable the new application , i.e. , moving money from checking to credit card .
If the bank were starting from scratch would they build things this way ?
Of course not !
They 'd put everything into one big Oracle database on a Unix machine and they would n't need application servers .
The checking - to - credit transfer could be accomplished with a tiny PL / SQL or Java program running inside Oracle .
The strange thing is that most Web service operators are in exactly the position that all the world 's large companies would love to be in .
The Web services have all their relevant info collected in one big relational database management system .
So they do n't have the pernicious systems integration problems that Fortune 500 companies do .
Yet apparently at least a few of the technology folks at Web startups are sufficiently confused that they buy willingly into the same kind of computer systems complexity that the Fortune 500 are trying desperately to escape .

Reader 's Comments
I 've purchased the dead trees book , and looked at the new one online , and now this page here .
Still no mention of Cold Fusion .
I know you have strong opinions , Phil , and you probably have a reason for not considering or mentioning it .
But as an application server it seems such a powerful yet elegantly simple environment for building just the kind of apps you so fondly describe .
If you 've not looked at it recently ( 4.0 is about to come out ) , please consider doing so .
Compared to the effort to do the same thing in Kiva / NAS as described above ( and perhaps Aolserver ) , simple things can be rendered amazingly quickly , while complex things can be created quite easily .
Interested readers ( and I offer this as one to another , not as a product hype ) can find more at www.allaire.com.

I may have just found part of an answer to my question , if I extrapolate from a quote in the info on setting up an ecommerce site ( http://photo.net/wtr/thebook/ecommerce.html): " We looked at the vPOS system from VeriFone and rejected it immediately because it only works with Microsoft Internet Information Server ( we do n't know anyone who understands NT well enough to run an Web service from Windows NT ) . "
Many presume that CF runs only on NT , and would therefore presume it 's equally susceptible .
Just for info , as of 3.1 , it runs on Solaris .
Also , I want to be clear before receiving a response ( if one 's coming ) and state that while I " looked at " the new book online , I did not read it in entirety .
I would like to have been able to search it for reference to CF before saying " still no mention of CF " .
I appreciate your penchant for thoroughness and accuracy , and if I 've missed such a reference , I apologize .
But my inclination after reviewing much today ( and remembering some emails we traded many months ago ) , it to conclude that the lean away from CF would still seem persists .
I 'm just trying to share this as an alternative for the interested reader .
I really have found it to be quite useful , especially as compared to other platforms I 've seen .
Even seemingly in comparison to the AOLserver approach outlined in the book .
That 's an opinion , of course .
I only wish that your site reflected a considered observation regarding CF , especially in its later versions which have addressed so many issues that may previously have been found wanting .
I hope others find the comments helpful .
-- charlie arehart , July 14 , 1998
Charlie , I do n't have a penchant for " thoroughness " !
My goal is not to try every possible Web / db tool .
My first goal is to keep my million - hits / day personal sites up and running .
My second goal is to finish the new rev of my community software package so that a bunch of folks ( including me ) can use it .
My third goal is to complete my consulting projects ( i.e. , get Web sites built for clients of arsdigita.com ) .
None of these goals is furthered by spending a few weeks experiment with Cold Fusion .
I do n't think it can fundamentally do anything that my current Web tools can't so I 'd rather spend my time data modelling and writing programs .
If those Allaire guys release an Emacs mode for Cold Fusion , maybe I 'll have a look :-)
-- Philip Greenspun , July 14 , 1998
Thanks for that .
I meant the thoroughness penchant wit respect ( I really did mean I " appreciated " it ) .
Your coverage of the issues near and dear to you is exhaustive and complete .
That 's what I meant by thorough .
I was only sparked to comment on this " application server " discussion page .
It seemed a place where you might have indeed taken time to evaluate alternatives .
I can appreciate ( or rather , understand ) if it 's more just a log of experience trying a couple things .
Even so , I offer my comments both to you for consideration should you experiment again in the future , and more importantly to readers should they be considering other options .
For that , I *appreciate * the opportunity to have offered these comments .
It , like many of your site 's features -- and you yourself , are valuable resources . :-)
-- charlie arehart , July 14 , 1998
Unfortunately , most of my consulting engagements are with corporations that already have an established architecture and guidelines , etc .
These invariably include NT .
I entirely agree with Philip 's point of view regarding middleware , but its hard to go simple and elegant on NT .
What are some good light web server / scripting language / RDBMS combinations that work with NT ( if any ) ?
Anything besides IIS / ASP ?
Also , what about Server Side Java ?
What would be the likelihood of using SSJ to interact with an RDBMS and then output HTML to a browser ( once SSJ is ready for the task ) ?
-- Justin Loeber , August 7 , 1998
OK so I understand why you hate Kiva 's server .
My colleagues and I have done a whole bunch of work since the good ole days of Perl CGI 's , to try and find a reasonable server - side programming solution which has RDBMS support .
I will first say that we have n't tried CF or AOLServer although those sound viable .
My main concern with CF is the plug - in architecture - C only , as I understand ( i.e. not Perl or Java ) .
C is so utterly crude and dangerous that I do n't touch it if at all possible , so that 's a big downer .
We came up with our * own * perl based template solution , which was pretty cool for a while .
Then Java servlets came along and swept away all the reasons we had for coding horribly complex ASP and LiveWire stuff .
LiveWire at least has a very seamless JavaScript / Java interface so we have some cool stuff that uses JS for presentation and Java for complex , high performance stuff .
ASP uses ActiveX which is super horrible , even from Java .
But servlets only solve the problem for high end guys like me , and of course there is the compilation cycle .
Not cool for an HTML whacker , and that 's where CF and AOLServer seem to have Servlets beat .
( I certainly do n't think that between TCL and CFML , you can do nearly as much cool stuff as with Java , to be fair to Java . )
Well , it looks like there is finally a " no compilation required , page based programming model " sort of solution that uses Java .
It 's called JSP , for JavaServer Pages , and the first implementation I have seen is from Live Software ( www.livesoftware.com).
Basically it 's implemented as a servlet that serves all pages whose filename ends in .jsp , and it looks remarkably like ASP , except for 3 critical differences :
1 ) It 's pure Java so you can run it on Linux or HP / UX or Solaris or AIX or MacOS , not just NT .
2 ) The embedded language is Java , so although you may be twitching in horror at having to use a strict language , you have the benefit of a language without giant syntactical BS like VBScript and Java have , plus your knowledge of the " reusable objects " language can help you train your " scripted pages " people , and you can share books , training classes , etc. etc.
3 ) The interface from scripting - land to reusable - objects - land is practically nonexistent .
Since the JSP parser is a servlet , it is written in Java , hence you already have a JRE and a classpath going .
Just compile your classes and put them where the servlet engine can find them and you 're done .
If necessary you can hack up a servlet just to test one object , or you can hack up a command - line Runnable class that can do the same thing - do that with COM .
If you like you can make the return value of your Clever_DB class be a Java object - also impossible with COM , unless it too is a COM object , and then you have to do exceptional syntactical stuff to make that work .
And in LiveWire you have to account for the difference between JavaScript variables and Java String objects , which is not needed here .
The reason this is not taking over the universe is that , like much of the really exciting Java stuff , it 's not really " there " yet .
You can get it in a beta version but most definitely it is n't as tried and true as AOLServer is for Mr. Greenspun ...
Anyway , it 's just something to watch ...

Today the DOW dropped about 500 points so I thought it might be a good time to get into the market .
I went over to E*Trade to open an account and saw URLs like the following : https://trading.etrade.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/Applogic+Home?gxml=hpa_welcome_c_t.html&SOURCE=YAHOO from the URL , it 's apparent that they 're using Netscape Application Server ( aka Kiva ) .
Given Kiva 's well - documented reliability and usability issues , perhaps I 'll reconsider trusting E*Trade with the management of my investments ..
-- Gideon Glass , September 1 , 1998
Actual E*Trade horror story :
The company I work for recently switched over to E*Trade 's " Optionslink " captive broker program .
They handle our stock option and ESPP ( employee stock purchase program ) shares .
The day after our last ESPP purchase , the first under the new regime , hundreds of employees were unable to connect to the optionslink site .
As far as I could tell they were down for the entire day , having crashed early in the morning due to high load .
People wanting to sell their shares were forced to discover and use the touchtone telephone access line ( which costs more ) .
E*Trade subsequently refunded all fees for trades executed that day .
That was enough to convince me to choose another service do to my personal online trading .

It 's a very interesting perspective which you bring to this .
The comments on scalability and availability are very apt , and nice to hear in the face of the marketing deluge from the app server companies .
However , there are a few points where I see things differently .
I 've been using Art Technology Group 's Dynamo , and I 've been quite happy with it .
As with Kiva , it is somewhat complicated to do just about anything .
I have found however , that it makes the hard things significantly more achievable .
One of my main experiences of the dynamic sites I wrote before using Dynamo ( in Perl or in PHP ) , was that I was often solving the same problems over and over .
And , just as often , under time pressure , I was solving them badly .
Maintaining a user 's session , templating ( and sub- templating ) pieces of HTML , pooling database connections , inserting queues for performance , logging errors and events accurately , etc .
With Dynamo , all of these things are supported in very flexible , very well - implemented ways .
So that 's something I like : the services provided by a good application server .
If I were just writing bare servlets ( given that I do like Java as a server - side programming language ) , or Java Server Pages , I would have to come up with a lot of that functionality on my own .
Just another perspective ...
-- Dan Milstein , November 19 , 1998
An interesting prospective .
Though I do n't share all the statemens of the article - the one is obvious .
Most of the tasks for which application servers are being advertised could be sovled by employing much more cost - effective solutions .
Presently , just by using a web - server as simple proxy - server to so called applications servers people : ( 1 ) underutilize front - ends ( 2 ) unable to take full advantage of HTTP1 / 1 features ( 3 ) end - up with almost unacceptable latency .
A decent high - performance webserver , such as Netscape Enterprise Server or IIS plus a hardware load - balancing solution such as Cisco Local Director ( which one would want to have anyway ) would do just fine in many cases .
-- Ruslan Belkin , February 9 , 1999
I am currently involved in the evaluation phase of application servers and alternative technical routes that achieve a core goal : " An architecture that supports a component based development framework for reusability and quick development cycles . "
One of the choices not mentioned is the use of client - side scripting with server - side XML .
I am experimenting with using java servlets to serve XML mappings of database queries directly to a browser .
A set of javascript routines facilitate the actual event of hitting the web - server with query parameters then capturing and parsing the XML data .
This way the user interaction is ' seamless ' , minimal data is transferred , and the servlet is 100 % free of any presentation rules .
The drawback is that this is NOT going to work in Lynx .
But it achieves separation of data from presentation .
It also lets application developers work with a single rapid development tool such as Javascript / HTML and data access component developers developers work with their tool of choice ( for us Java ) .

hi , you have raved about Oracle database reliabilty , scalibility etc etc but its still hard to configure and maintain without database tools like those provided by quest software http://www.quests.com/
Why can't Oracle provide GUI interface to configure the database at least half decent as SQL server or MS Access ( sic ) ..

Interesting perspective on app servers !
" Java as a language is mediocre for web applications " Mr Greenspun 's main points are : Java requires a lot of typing ( True ) , Java is compiled , which adds steps to the development process .
( True ) .
Although , as with any reasonably rich language , a skilled programmer will quickly develop worker classes / methods to shorten common tasks - such as string handling .
Also , Java is technically interpreted and capable of dynamically including classes - so much of the advantages of on - the - fly code changes can be implemented by designing an application to pickup new extensions dynamically .
Anyway , I would n't spend much time debating this - vs - that language .
It ranks in the this - vs - that editor debate .
Everyone has their preferences and no one will agree once they 've chosen their favorite ...
" Application server comments - et. al . "
Now here are where some compelling statements and examples are given and are worthy of discussion .
" There is no scalability problem "
Of course there is a problem .
The trick is to know when it needs a solution .
I agree heartily that keeping things simple at the beginning is a key strategy .
I also agree that many folks , rather than think of how their applications might scale , simply throw more plumbing at the problem .
In my experience , the largest impact on performance of any application is the , shock , * design * of that application .
IOW , the developer is most often their own worst enemy .
So , assuming many shops are throwing additional complexities over an application that basically still " sucks " , it will most likely just add misery to the situation .
Assuming that the application has been focused upon , works great and is easy to maintain , it should be a lot clearer that performance issues are most likely related to shortcomings in the delivery platform .
This makes it much easier to pinpoint what needs to be added to the delivery platform to enhance performance .
Again , not throwing the kitchen sink at the problem , but incrementally adding things where they fix a particular , identified problem .
" Becoming a prisoner " Mr. Greenspun points out that using essentially open APIs and object libraries ( Servlets , JDBC , Java Pages , open source connection pooling software , etc. ) gives you a lot of portability and even reduces your cost of deployment .
I find little to argue with here .
In fact , I think this is * the* " dirty little secret " of web development .
There 's opportunity here .
There are already companies using nothing but open source tools , applications and operating systems , to develop turnkey solutions that kick ass , and they are making money - $ 5 - $ 20 million in income a year .
However , as Mr. Greenspun points out , fortune 500 companies have their own strange psychology about how to purchase and develop their computing tools and infrastructure .
This makes them very nervous about the above kinds of sources they use for their solutions .
They 'd rather have a vendor they can call on the carpet .
They 'd also like to have vendors with enough cash , i.e. something to lose , to compensate for problems .
I believe this is changing rapidly - that many companies are sitting up and taking notice of what 's going on in the open source arena .
A few more large sucess stories and orders of magnitude less cost are going to to shift things very quickly - perhaps in the next 2 - 3 years - in favor of more or less " open " solutions .
Do I think that the current suite of " application server " products are insanely priced and needlessly complex ?
You bet your ass I do .
If most of the customers I met jumped up and shook my hand for the deal when hearing I could whip up their enterprise - class web solution using nothing but AOLServer and TCL scripts , I 'd be more than pleased .

I always enjoy reading Mr. Greenspun pragmatic and realistic views of developing web database sites .
His thoughtful comments push developers to think .
However in terms of measuring scalablity with web applications I think he is giving the public at large a misconceoption of what web scalibity means with respect to price performance and application servers .
Before I make any comments on webserver scalibity lets say that I look at it form the kernel up as opposed to Mr. Greenspun looks at it from the higher level down .
And for information purposes , yes I do work for Sun .
Frist on of the major factors that affect application transaction throughput of a server based on your database backend is if your rdbms is correctly thread modeled to the OS , i.e .
Oracle is not a truely threaded rdbms in the two model smp architecture .
Informix is a more true threaded database .
However one has to match the user thread level architecture such as java or tcl or php3 or perl to the underlying OS .
In the case of Solaris this is more difficult to accomplish , java a perl come the closest .
Both must be proficient in matching the thread vm models to the OS .
Java 1.2 comes extreamly close to this which commercially is in it 's infancy .
Perl threading with respect to a two thread model smp architecture is second best but by no means close .
The key in java would be controlling garbage collection on large image allocation .
This is typically not a concern with other web api's which the developer has to manage themself .
So where does that leave us for a billon webtransactions a day , what that is 12 k a second of which static pages can be supplied at 10 k a second according to specweb on Solaris 4 cpu Xeon box and lets grossly say 20 percent of that is transactions .
If I can get 3.3 k messages a second on a ( dual ) Xeon box running Solaris with a Volano java benchmark I would be concerned only with what affects on cpu loading in user space is offered by java or perl , tcl etc .
Yes I firmly expect it to scale ( valono marks ) on a quad .
The model of the webserver is extermly important in this case .
Example using Apache or any other fork prefetch model would be inappropreaite to draw response time concultions from in the Solaris smp model .
Netsacpe or the Sun Webserver 2.x is more closely matched .
By this I mean that java servlets in the Sun Webserver are dropped down through an rpc door call and effectively reduce overall latency by more closely matching the thread model of the over all architecture .
Man if that is n't a mouth full of marbles .
So what my point and what is all the gobblity gook I 'm getting at .
One according to the web sizing and calculations in Capacity Planning for Web Performance by Danial Menasce and Virgilio Almeida , Philip is mostly correct about the cost performance justifications of application servers in general .
But for the most important part is tracking latency of the model .
At least I thing is more of a concern .
What God gave us bandwidth , humans cause latency .
Always did like that one .
As for price / performance shop till you drop .
And Open Source solutions are worth as much time as you have to fix the bugs and performance issues that you encounter .
And one of the best ones I ever heard is ;
Who in the hell told you OO is suppose to perform well .

The NAS perspective is very helpful to me , as I have just become involved with a Fortune 500 company that is insisting on a Kiva solution .
The Netscape NAS information is so loaded with marketing jive that I can't get a lot of useful information out of it .
I am hoping to comply with the letter of the requirement and violate its spirit by using AppLogics as minimally as possible , passing request / response strings back and forth to servlets with no intervention of any kind , but , you know , I am afraid I am going to get trashed for the additional overhead , coming as it does with no benefit whatsoever .
Thanks for alerting me to this dangerous product .

ColdFusion :
This is a viable solution for NT .
It scales and performs reasonably well for probably all but the very high - end site .
I would highly reccommend against using it on Solaris until their next release , supposedly due out this Fall .
Reasoning ?
The code is n't actually ported over from Win32 -- it 's running on top of Win32 - like libraries ( from Bristol ) on Solaris , and performance ends up being similar to NT ( bang for buck ) .
The folks at Allaire are rewriting the entire code base to make it portable and more modular , and hopefully better performing .
( Note : I used to work for Allaire , so I do n't know if that matters at all in terms of what that means for this opinion . )
Kiva / App Servers : I have to agree with Philip ( sorry , I misspelled it earlier ) on this one .
They are typically more trouble than they are worth .
Again , unless external forces dictate otherwise , stick with tried and true solutions like the ACS stuff , or ColdFusion ( sorry ... I just know it works well in lots of situations ) .
N.B. : Philip , I was thinking of writing a CF - mode for Emacs , but just never got around to it .

I think this should be compulsive reading for all web developers .
I was just trying to work out what kind of systems it would take to support the kind of load I was anticipating .
Now I know !
What you say is common sense to anybody , the only point most people do n't realise is whether or not the simple idea can hack the load .
Now we know it can .
Thanks very much .

Although I agree with a lot of the comments about KIVA / NAS I do not feel the same way about application servers in general .
I 've been working on the web for a relatively long time .
In the past 3 years I 've been working with application server technologies .
We 've had a lot of success with Sapphire / Web and all of it 's components .
I 've seen people that did n't come from a software background ( at least no C++ / Java ) develop functional applications in relatively short periods of time .
A great thing about it is that it allows integration with other systems .
Although running an Oracle 8 rdms might be the answer for some people you have to remember that there are many companies that have other / mixed rdbms systems .
With Sapphire / Web we have the ability to talk to multiple databases and middleware services .
This has allowed us to access some older systems via the web .
NT is seen as easier to manage than unix so it 's gaining a greater prescence in corporate america .
Java 's new work with servlets and jsp is going to be very interesting too .
-- Tom Menegatos , September 19 , 1999
AppLogics will be replaced by servlets & JSPs in NAS 4.0 ( which might be out by now ) .
This servlet implementation will be built on top of the AppLogic layer so it will probably be even buggier than before .
If anyone is using NAS 4.0 , please share your experience .
Personally , I like implementing my server logic in servlets .
I build my stuff in JBuilder on Win95 ( which offers many nice hand - holding features ) and upload the resultant class files to my host .
I write a BaseServlet that handles most of the DB connection & user validation crap for a project and then subclass that for the other servlets .
Java may require more lines of code but I find it WAY easier to read / maintain than Perl and other similar scriptng languages .

People seem to miss the problem Phil has with NT ( that I share ) .
It 's not that it 's easy to administer .
It 's actually not easy to administer _well_ .
It is easy to administer badly or in a mediocre fashion .
The problem is then that if you fail to administer it well , it 's not suitable for an ' enterprise ' application .
In other words , you may have to reboot it nightly , or weekly , or more frequently than 3 months to a year , which can be a realistic figure for a moderately well or really well administered *x system .
When you look at VAX , you get into figures like years and possibly a decade between instances where the server 's operating system needs rebooting .
I agree that having to reboot the operating system frequently makes it difficult to run an ' enterprise ' application with any degree of professionalism , and I urge others to see if they can figure out the author 's stance about reliability , uptime and administrative costs before suggesting web servers , development environments and operating systems that are not proven to be adequately stable .
It makes them look like they actually have n't retained any comprehension from their readings .
-- Malcolm Gin , November 7 , 1999
I read Phil 's essay on application servers and three - level hierarchies while the Sun Ultra 10 on my desk churned through another test series to get some performance numbers on what kind of performance hit I can expect from ColdFusion versus stock HTML .
Obviously , the more levels one introduces to the hierarchy , and the more dinking around one does with the data that ultimately winds up being shoved out to the end - user , the more time or performance it 'll take .
I arrived at my current job a month ago , eager to CFML - ize everything within reach .
But now that I 'm running tests ( using Jef Poskanzer 's http_load ) , I 'm starting to realize that ColdFusion is n't particularly efficient at handling high loads .
Simply having the CFserver ( running as an NSAPI plugin to Netscape Enterprise Server ) * look * at data , even if there 's nothing there for it to parse or act on , drops pages - per - second performance incredibly .
Of course , we 're not using an Ultra 10 for production webservice - we 've got multiple Enterprise 450's for that , which do n't even break a sweat serving hundreds of thousands of static pages a day as it is .
But reading " solution " examples on Allaire 's websites , and noting that some of their other customers are running clusters of up to * 40 * machines ... wow .
Yes , we want database integration .
Yes , we want personalization for our users .
But no , we 're not willing to sacrifice performance or load time .
And no , we do n't really need a " content management system . "
Content is great , but without performance , it never makes it to the user .

I feel it germane to mention Zope here , for the following reasons : Zope is Open Source .
.
Zope is written in ( mostly ) Python , with certain sections optimized in C. Python is an interpreted language , offering much of the same benefits as Tcl provides for this kind of work ; namely no compilation , and therefore faster development cycles .
Zope has a nice reporting language called DTML that , while having faults of its own , improves on the ASP / JSP /?SP syntax ( IMHO . )
Zope includes an Open Source transactional , logging ( and thus versioned ) object database called ZODB , in which most of your web objects are stored .
If ZODB does n't fit the task at hand ( i.e. you are doing more writes than reads , or the data needs to be accessable from another system ) , you can easily store your data in Oracle , Sybase ( Sybase officially supports Zope ! ) , ODBC via OpenLink , and a number of other RDBMSs .
RDBMS connections are pooled ( cached , actually , along with nearly everything else Zope touches . )
There is one transaction boundary .
If you are in the middle of a commit , you have already written some data to the object database , and then there is a failure in a SQL query , the entire transaction is rolled back .
ZODB and the RDBMS stay in sync .
Zope includes its own ( Open Source ) protocol server , called ZServer , based on Sam Rushing 's asynchronous Medusa , which serves object data to HTTP , FTP , WebDAV , and ( soon ) SOAP clients .
You can even use Emacs / efs to edit methods on Zope objects via FTP .
If you do n't like ZServer , feel free to use Apache , IIS , etc. , through proxy - pass , PCGI , or FastCGI .
URLs your grandmother can read !
Yes , you can bookmark them , too .
An active , growing community .
I do n't work for Digital Creations , nor do I have a vested interest in Zope , other than the fact that I use it , personally .
I simply agree with most of what Phil said on this page , and feel that Zope is a nice alternative to AOLserver for people who think similarly .

Philip makes a number of interesting points , but neglects to address one great strength of the java - based Application server market , which includes the likes of Weblogic : available programmers .
There are far more people with Java skills than there are Tcl .
A search of resumes on dice.com turned up 3990 candidates who claim Java experience , while 84 claim Tcl experience .
A search for Weblogic turns up 43 resumes , while AOLServer turns up 1 .
Forgive a weak analogy , but it 's like buying an Jaguar over a Ford .
Which is going to be easier to find a replacement mechanic for ?
The Ford may be the crappier vehicle , but it 's far easier to maintain if you 're not the primary mechanic on it .
So when you need to extend or fix your AOLserver implmentation , who do you call ?
Some brilliant college kid with no accountability or Philip 's company , ArsDigita ?
On second thought , perhaps Philip is even smarter than he appears .

I just have to write another comment , following up on my positive spin on Dynamo from a while ago .
After much use of Dynamo , I have changed my mind .
I strongly recommend against using Dynamo for just about any project .
It adds a great deal of needless complexity and is difficult to administer and maintain .
The development process it forces on you is laborious and frustrating .
It scales poorly and crashes often .
There is pretty much nothing I like about Dynamo which I can't get from Apache JServ ( basic Java Servlets ) , along with some open source toolkits : BitMechanic 's JDBC Connection Pool , the superb Freemarker HTML templating system , Oroinc 's Perl - like regex packages , etc .
As someone said above , I find putting my logic into Java Servlets to work very well .
With Freemarker , there is very little need to use the painful Java string handling syntax , and Java allows complicated things ( like input validation ) to be handled gracefully .
And with JServ , classes are automatically reloaded when they change , so the development process is just one step away from save - and - reload .

A few points from experience : I have tried and I am using XML and XSL ( Microsoft implementation ) and I found that it flies and way outperforms ASP .
I would argue that there is hardly anything cleaner than that .
In addition , I use ADO and MS SQL Server .
I do n't know about the Oracle / Java / TCL configuration , but I comfortably support 10 hits / sec on my 266MHz Pentium laptop on NT .
If you use application / web server , you can keep some data in memory and cache it and scale far better than an RDBMS solution .
It really depends on the type of application and data
Java is compiled ( JIT ) and every decent servlet environment can detect a change in a .class or .jsp file and reload on the fly without restarting .
Look at some PC
Week test results and have a second thought about application servers and NT .
There are also articles about MS SQL Server vs. Oracle .
-- Christo Angelov , March 20 , 2000
In reference to D.R. Tong 's comment above , I totally agree with Gary Burd 's rebuke .
I am familiar with both Java and Tcl .
Anyone who can't learn to program in Tcl in a few days has no business calling themselves a programmer .

But , I 'd like to point out that home .

D.R. Tong raised the issue of available programmers on February 17 , 2000 , and Gary Burd responded :
If your programmers cannot learn
Tcl in a couple of days , then you are hiring the wrong kind of programmers .
I think D.R. might be referring to a consulting situation .
I 've run across this to my great frustration in some of my engagements .
For some clients , if they want a solution that uses X language so they can maintain the system in that language after you have left , you either provide for that in the proposal or you do n't get the contract .
No amount of explanation of the benefits will sway them to adopt Y language .
I think the real answer here is to enhance AOLserver to support code other than Tcl , ADP , etc. , rather than saying " it 's my way or the highway " .
The data model looks clean to me ( I 've only been peeking at it for a day , and I ain't some whiz , so take this subjective eval of the model with a boulder of salt ) , and there is nothing that says " thou shalt use AOLserver / Tcl " against that model .
A superior data model does not circumscribe the manner in which it is accessed .
You are free to use anything else against that model ( though you would n't derive the benefits of the massed efforts of others behind the AOLserver / Tcl approach , a variation of the issue that D.R. posed ) .

Concerning the virtues of interpreted scripting languages vs compiled application logic feeding HTML templates , I thought I might share my experiences with rapid prototyping and debugging on two platforms , one compiled , one interpreted .
Firstly , ASP development .
I use Homesite , which gives me syntax highlighting , tag - wizards , context sensitive help , all that good stuff .
But to find syntax errors in my form logic , for instance , I still have to reload the page , read the error message , figure out where the error is ( sometimes the line numbers given are helpful , sometimes not ) and move to that line in Homesite before I can start debugging .
Maybe there are microsoft tools that make this faster , I do n't know .
Secondly , Delphi development .
I 've done a fair amount of standard database development and even a fair amount of web development using Delphi. 18 months ago I wrote the beginnings of a pretty good webBBS system using Delphi ( currently running at insanity .
net.nz - I hope to finally do some more work on it sometime in the next month or three ) .
It runs on a web application server called Webhub , which although good , is sufficiently obscure that I have doubts about it 's future , particularly now that Delphi 6 Enterprise has it's own ( very impressive looking ) web application development system ( which will probably also be in Kylix later on - that 's Delphi for Linux ) .
I 'm getting off track here .
The point I want to raise is that when C hackers think " time to compile now ? " they often have to make a strategic decision about whether now is the best time for a coffee break .
Whereas when I think " did I get the syntax right on that last function call ? "
I hit compile , because it takes about half a second .
And it 'll take my cursor right to the first error , with a clickable list of the current errors , hints and warnings in the message dialogue box .
So when I see people saying things like " Python is an interpreted language , offering much of the same benefits as Tcl provides for this kind of work ; namely no compilation , and therefore faster development cycles " ( from above , concerning Zope ) , I often wonder what they 're talking about , until I remember that most people have never used or perhaps even heard of Borland Delphi .

This year 's first big show will be replaced with a press conference due to the writers ' strike
The Golden Globe Awards have become a victim of the writers ’ strike .
Organizers said Monday they ve officially abandoned the televised formal ceremony this Sunday and will replace it with a press conference announcement of the winners .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ We are all very disappointed that our traditional awards ceremony will not take place this year and that millions of viewers worldwide will be deprived of seeing many of their favorite stars celebrating 2007 ’s outstanding achievements in motion pictures and television , ” Hollywood Foreign Press Association president Jorge Camara said .
“ We take some comfort , however , in knowing that this year ’s Golden Globe Award recipients will be announced on the date originally scheduled . ”
The drastic move is in response to the Screen Actors Guild pledge that its members would not cross picket lines by the Writers Guild of America , effectively leaving the show without any stars .
Instead of the lavish ceremony , the HFPA , which sponsors the awards , will now announce the winners at an hour - long press conference broadcast on NBC .
“ The 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards NBC telecast and champagne dinner in the Beverly Hilton ’s International Ballroom is officially canceled , ” the HFPA said in a statement .
The writing had been on the wall that , despite the best efforts of the network and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , the ceremony was in jeopardy .
On Friday it was reported that the nominated actors would not cross the Writers Guild picket lines to attend the ceremony .
A depressed dollar is turning Fifth Avenue into a virtual flea market for global travelers as strong currencies like the British pound and the euro create a glut of great deals on fashions , electronics and hot status brands .
New York City is celebrating a record year from foreign tourists hitting town for weak dollar bargains – reaping savings of about one - third of what they ’d spend back home .
Their bargain boom is fueled by the falling dollar , whose value in the past year is down 12 percent against the pound and off 10 percent against the euro , boosting foreign travelers ’ purchasing power .
The dollar fell last week to its weakest level in 19 months , trading at $ 1.31 against the euro and at $ 1.93 against the pound .
Analysts expect the greenback to slide as much as another 2 percent this week .
For the record 7.3 million foreign tourists expected to visit the Big Apple this year , the weak dollar is creating savings substantial enough to nearly pay for the trip itself .
For example , the Microsoft Zune player – a rival to Apple ’s iPod – sells for $ 442 in London but can be found in New York stores for about $ 249 , a savings of $ 193 .
That ’s about one - third of the price of the lowest New York - London airfare offered by bookers on the Internet .
Stocking up on shoes and dresses could also cover the typical $ 300 nightly hotel tab .
A mini -dot jersey dress sells at Saks Fifth Avenue for about $ 425 , but an equivalent dress would cost about $ 580 at Selfridges in London .
At Dixons , a popular London electronics retailer , a Panasonic mini camcorder costs the equivalent of $ 1,368 , but can be bought at J&R near City Hall for just $ 999.99 .
And it ’s not only New York City that stands to benefit .
European tour operators are said to be packaging shopping tours for U.S. cities – including weekend sprees in such hard - core retail destinations as the Mall of America in Minnesota , the world ’s largest shopping center – where three nonstop flights arrive daily from Europe .
“ They ’re giving European travelers any reason they can think of to get on a plane , ” said aviation analyst Terry Trippler .
Although New York ’s economy is cashing in big , with an estimated record of $ 24 billion spent in tourist dollars this year , the nation ’s overall economy could suffer from the weak greenback .
The purchasing power of the euro and pound could spur investors to pour cash into European assets and away from dollar - denominated assets .
The weaker returns on dollar - denominated debt may also encourage central banks to hold more of their foreign - exchange reserves in other currencies instead of the dollar , which long has been their currency of choice .
The slide in the greenback also prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower rates early next year .
The economy itself is at a tipping point .
Economists are divided over whether it will experience a soft landing or a bumpy one next year .
ENGLI$H INVASION
With the weakening dollar , the city is becoming a sales haven for foreign tourists .
A record 7.3 million international visitors are expected this year .

Tests of the XO are going on around the world
Nicholas Negroponte
Nicholas Negroponte accused Intel , which makes a rival PC , of underhand sales tactics and trying to block contracts to buy his machines .
The groups united in July 2007 after a series of rows but split last week .
The head of Intel Paul Otellini said an accusation that the firm had failed to deliver on promises was " hogwash " .
" I do n't want to get into specifics but we met every obligation that we were committed to , " he said .
Professor Negroponte responded : " My version of events is not hogwash .
" Why would I throw away the six million dollars they were supposed to give us yesterday ?
Why would I do all of these things unless I was stark raving mad ? "
' Repeat offender '
Professor Negroponte said the firm had left after a series of disputes .
" They were selling laptops with their brand on it directly to exactly the same people we were talking to .
The Intel Classmate is currently being tested in Nigeria
OLPC loses partner Bridging the digital divide
" They would go in even after we had signed contracts and try to persuade government officials to scrap their contract and sign a contract with them instead .
That 's not a partnership . "
Mr Negroponte cited an example in Peru where Intel sales staff tried to persuade the country 's vice - minister of education , Oscar Becerra Tresierra , to buy the Intel Classmate PC .
Peru has ordered 270,000 XO laptops from OLPC .
Mr Negroponte said that similar events had happened " time and time and time again " .
" Each time it happened they said they would correct their ways .
It 's a little like cheating on your spouse , or alcoholism , or something you just can't eventually fix and we had to finally part ways . "
Education tools
Last week Intel said the two parties had split because OLPC had asked Intel to end " support for non-OLPC platforms , including the Classmate PC , and to focus on the OLPC platform exclusively " .
Mr Otellini told BBC
News : " The premise that we actually divorced over is that there is not one solution .
No one company , no one solution has a monopoly on kids . "
Both firm 's laptops are designed for use by children in the developing world .
The rugged XO machine , which its makers say will eventually cost $ 100 , features a sunlight readable display and open source software .
It uses a processor designed by Intel 's rival AMD .
The more expensive Intel machine can run Microsoft Windows and is part of a wider education initiative by the firm .
" Intel has invested a billion dollars over the last 10 years alone in education around the world , " said Mr Otellini .
Both parties were speaking to BBC News at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
Not - for - profit financial institutions set up to serve you
Even though millions of Americans are members of credit unions , many people still do n’t understand what credit unions are .
Overview
Credit unions are not - for - profit financial cooperatives serving groups of members who have something in common such as employment at a company , membership in an association , or residence in a particular geographic area .
A credit union that may serve anyone who lives or works within a particular geographic area is called a local credit union .
A credit union that serves groups of employees or associations is typically called a SEG - based ( for select employee group ) or a sponsor - based credit union .
More than 82 million U.S. consumers are member - owners of , and receive all or part of their financial services from the nation ’s 10,425 credit unions .
As not - for - profit cooperatives , credit unions generally offer more attractive savings and loan rates and low or no fees .
Surveys consistently rank credit unions first among financial institutions in consumer satisfaction .
Philosophy and Structure
The professionals at dccu.us explained that credit unions are democratically owned and controlled institutions , based on people helping people principles .
Credit union boards of directors are elected by members .
Each member has an equal vote regardless of how much he or she has on deposit .
At mutual banks , the amount on deposit determines the number of votes .
In publicly - held banks , the number of shares of stock determines this .
Only members may serve as directors .
They are unpaid volunteers and represent the interests of their fellow members who use the credit union .
Board members at other types of financial institutions are paid and represent the interests of the outside owners .
Volunteers are an important credit union resource .
Presently , more than 129,000 Americans volunteer for their credit unions serving as board members , committee members , or providing other assistance .
Credit unions have no outside stockholders so , after reserves are set aside , earnings are returned to members in the form of dividends on savings , lower loan rates , or additional services .
Prudently Managed and Federally Insured
Credit unions primarily engage in consumer loans and , to a lesser degree , business and residential real estate loans to their members .
Deposits at federally - chartered and virtually all state - chartered credit unions are federally - insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund .
This fund is administered by the National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) .
It is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government .
Like other insurance funds , such as FDIC coverage for banks , NCUSIF protects member deposits to $ 250,000 .
Regulation and Supervision
Federally chartered credit unions are regulated by the NCUA , an independent federal agency .
State chartered credit unions are regulated by the their state credit union department .
No taxpayer money is used for NCUA regulation as all NCUA and NCUSIF activities are paid for by credit unions .
Credit unions are also subject to many other laws and regulations administered by such agencies as the Federal Reserve , Internal Revenue Service , Federal Trade Commission , Department of Justice , Department of Labor , and many other federal and state agencies .
Taxation
Because of the member - owned , democratically operated , not - for - profit nature of credit unions , the federal government has made credit unions exempt from federal income taxes .
Most states have extended this to state income and most sales taxes .
Credit unions do pay payroll taxes , property taxes , and some sales taxes .
Credit union members pay taxes on their credit union dividends .
Debbie Nelson Book ' My Son Marshall , My Son Eminem '
mother of rapper , has a new book on the market that she claims will change the bad opinion people have of her .
The title is
Eminem is an Oscar winner and has multiple Grammy Awards for his rap music .
His record sales make him one of the highest selling rap artists of all time .
He is touring less but is still in the game with his recently released track I Can Be .
Nelson wants to change everything you ever heard come out of the mouth of her son regarding his upbringing and their relationship .
She says they were never white trailer trash nor have they ever been on welfare .
Eminem used her as the basis for his music lyrics , and according to her , fabricated his life history in order to sell his music .
The book , reported to be a tell - all , is not likely to strengthen their battered relationship but she looks at it a different way .
She feels that he never wanted her to be the victim of such fan hatred and will understand that she needs to set the record straight .
Nelson sought the help of a ghost writer to give her side of the story .
She hired top British author Annette Witheridge .
In late 2004 I got my last flu shot .
I say my last , because I will NEVER get another after what happened next .
Shortly after getting the shot , my family and I went on vacation in Florida .
I was sick with flu like symptoms the whole time .
You know , fever , achiness , etc .
I also had some tingling in the palms of my hands , which I was attributing to a fall on my bike .
It really was n’t the best vacation , and when we got home , it was practically Christmas .
I was so tired , and felt so weak .
After the first of the year , I attended my karate school ’s first class of the year .
Now , I ’d been going to the same school for over 3 years , I should have known better than to go to the first class of the year .
It ’s ALWAYS a killer .
The next day , I was so sore I could barely walk upright .
I held off on karate classes for a couple of days , and then went back for more ( torture , that is ) .
This class was different .
I felt like I was moving in molasses .
I could n’t jump , I could n’t run ( as hard as I tried ) .
It was awful .
I was supposed to be the most senior person in that class , people were supposed to look up to me , but I was fumbling around like I weighed 500 lbs .
I let it go , and continued to go to class .
But it only got worse .
3 weeks later , I was visibly limping .
I figured it was time to visit the doctor .
I saw my GP .
She was n’t overly concerned about the weakness and tingling , but more about the frequent migraines and she ordered an MRI .
It came back normal .
( I have a history of epilepsy and migraines , so normal is a huge relief . )
She also recommended that if the tingling and numbness did n’t improve I see a neurologist .
There were none in her group , so I was left on my own to find one .
My first thought was to find the guy who treated me for seizures in my teens .
I found that he had retired .
The next step was to find a list of candidates in Austin .
I started with a fairly large clinic in Austin , and chose the guy based on his photograph .
When I saw him , he immediately told me it was some sort of polyneuropathy , but he would have to do tests to find out which one , and how to treat it .
His first course of action was to order a DNA analysis to determine if it was one of the hereditary neuropathies .
It took 3 weeks to get the blood drawn and another six before the analysis was done .
When he received the results , he called to tell me I had none of the * known * markers for hereditary neuropathies .
Ok , think about that for a minute .
Known markers ?
If it ’s not known , how do you know there are others ?
Despite my confusion over this , he told me there was nothing he could do , and that it would probably progress slowly .
At this I jumped .
I was already limping and dropping my feet regularly .
I was falling often .
I could no longer run , jump , kick , or jog , and now walking was starting to look iffy .
I was even having trouble opening jars and lifting my ( then ) 2 year old .
I told him this .
He was very audibly alarmed and told me to come in immediately .
When I got there the motor tests that he did showed I was MUCH weaker .
I could n’t even walk on my tiptoes .
I could n’t even STAND on my tiptoes .
He changed his diagnosis .
He asked me if I ’d been sick , or had a flu shot before these symptoms appeared .
I confirmed both .
He came back with “ Guillian - Barre “ .
Now , I knew all about this syndrome , I ’d been reading for weeks about nerve damage and neuropathies and possible causes .
I nodded .
He told me the course of action was to give me a weeks worth of IVIg .
This involves sitting in a chair hooked to an IV for 8 - 10 hours per day .
After the first day of treatment , I was visibly better .
My limp was better .
I felt better .
Over the next few weeks I got better , and then worse .
I had to have a second round of IVIg .
Six weeks after that , I was bad again .
I switched doctors .
The new doctor told me that he did n’t think it was your typical Guillian - Barre , that it came on too slowly , and was lasting too long .
But he thought it was a related condition called CIDP ( Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy ) .
This is basically the same as Guillian - Barre , but in a more mild form , and chronic instead of acute .
More than likely , I would be having battles with it for the rest of my life .
Both Guillian - Barre and CIDP are auto - immune disorders .
They both cause a person ’s immune system to attack the peripheral nerves ( nerves other than spine and brain ) and remove the myelin sheath surrounding and protecting the nerve .
Think of it this way , if your nerves are like electrical wires , and the myelin is the plastic coating around them .
If you run electricity through a wire that has been stripped of it ’s coating , a portion of the electricity is lost to the air .
Some of the noise makes it through , but it ’s not full strength .
This is exactly what happens to the signals your brain sends to demyelinated nerves .
Part of it is lost to the surrounding tissues because the protective , insulation is gone .
The difference is , that Guillian - Barre often progresses extremely quickly ( like in 4 - 5 days ) and that it often causes respiratory complications that lead to breathing tubes and many many months of rehabilitation .
So , getting the flu shot in late 2004 not only gave me the flu ( despite what the CDC says about that being impossible ) it gave me the wonderful gift of lifelong nerve damage .
Granted , if the first doctor had n’t farted around for 8 + weeks , I might not have had permanent damage , but still , thanks for the warning !
The CDC does mention on thier website that Guillian - Barre is a possible side effect .
But they down play the severity of the disease .
On the other hand the CDC also says on their website that the flu shot should be had by people who are at high risk for complications from the flu .
Those people are infants , the elderly , and those with compromised immune systems .
Um , let ’s see , that ’s not your average 30 year old joe on the street .
It enrages me to hear commercials telling people that they MUST get a flu shot .
Bullshit .
It pisses me off that employers post signs around the office about Flu Shot 101 , and I ’m sure they did n’t mention the possibility of Guillian - Barre or other ( more long term ) auto - immune diseases .
( I ’ll have to find someone who went and see what they actually said ) .
I ’ll also tell you that I ’ve not had a flu shot since 2004 , and I have n’t had the flu since then .
My husband , who is mandated to get a flu shot by the military , gets the flu every year .
In fact , he ’s getting over it as I write this .
Bottom line , do your research .
Make an informed decision about that immunization before you get it .
Oh and PS — seems that the new HPV vaccination , Guardasil , is causing Guillian - Barre symptoms as well .
There have already been 8 deaths in the US related to the injection .
Just something to think about .

This is a great poster !
Earlier , Doug posted the new Dark Knight Batman poster … and this one goes along great with it .
This Dark Knight Joker poster really captures the battle for the city that is brewing between Joker and Batman .
I really dig it .
I ’m still not 100 % confident in Ledger .
I thought he was a very interesting choice as The Joker for the franchise .
The guy has shown that he can absolutely knock it out of the park ( Brokeback Mountain , The Patriot ) , but he has also really blown it a couple of times ( The Order , A Knight ’s Tale ) .
Still … the potential is there and I like his casting …
I ’m just holding my breath a little until we see what kind of performance he turns in .
Do n’t get fooled by how he LOOKS .
Make up artists can make anyone LOOK cool as the Joker … the question is will he pull off a performance ?
I think he will … but I ’m still a little nervous about it .
For now … take a look at the new Dark Knight Joker poster
Rich countries are poaching so many African health workers that the practice should be viewed as a crime , a team of international disease experts say in the British medical journal The Lancet .
More than 13,000 doctors trained in sub-Saharan Africa are now practicing in Britain , the United States , Canada and Australia , leaving behind colleagues with impossible caseloads .
African nurses and pharmacists are also sought after by clinics and drug store chains offering better pay and legal assistance with immigration , said the experts , who include the heads of several pharmacy and medicine schools in Africa .
“ The resulting dilapidation of health infrastructure contributes to a measurable and foreseeable public health crisis , ” the article said .
“ The practice should therefore be viewed as an international crime . ”
This Old Box
We 're shrinking away this week from monolithic supercomputers with This Old Box for something a little bit smaller .
In fact , we 'll be looking at the world 's first commercial full - color portable computer .
Fantastic !
But first , some insight into our computer selection process :
It 's twofold this time - 1 ) The system was requested by a reader and 2 ) having a good chuckle about the size of " portable " electronics made over two decades ago is easy work .
It 's journalistic cruise - control for a tech hack , just like being indignant about violent rap lyrics is writing ambrosia for curmudgeonly columnists in your local paper .
Not Pulitzer material , but always solid gold .
Time - tested tools of the trade stick around for a reason .
One would n't roll their eyes at an engineer as he pulls out a ball - peen hammer .
( And not only because one does n't want his kneecaps throughly peen-ed .
Engineers have short tempers . )
So no complaints .
Let 's grab our fish and barrel and head to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California .
Oh ho ho !
Would you look at its size !?
Commodore SX - 64 " Executive "
Released : 1983
Price : $ 995
OS : Commodore BASIC
Processor : MOS 6510 , 1MHz
Memory : 64 K
Display : 5 " 320x200 screen
Storage : Internal floppy drive
Five years after Commodore International released the Commodore PET ( much to the delight of those seeking a Personal way to Electronically Transact everywhere ) , the company struck gold yet again .
It was the Commodore 64 — widely considered the best - selling personal computer of all time .
It was fast and cheap with a show - stopping 64 kilobytes of RAM .
But could a customer heave it into their hotel room ?
Could a person play Archon in stunning 16 - color while lounging shirtless by the pool ?
No , Commodore was forced to admit .
A person could not do these things .
Yet there was a conspiratorial twinkle in its eye as it made this admission .
For at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1982 , the company unveiled the Commodore Executive 64 , the first color portable computer !
It weighed 23 pounds ( 10.5 kg ) , had a built - in 5 - inch monitor , a detachable keyboard , 64KB RAM , and space for one or two 5.25 " floppy drives .
When the system was available in January the next year , it was renamed the SX - 64 and included only one 170 kB disk drive plus an empty cartridge port .
The price was a steep $ 995 .
A hole in my heart , the size of a floppy
The SX - 64 was essentially a " luggable " Commodore 64 .
And that perhaps was the problem .
At the SX - 64 release , the extremely popular C64 was selling for only between $ 200 and $ 230 .
That 's about four times cheaper than the SX - 64 was .
Its only major advantage was portability , and a 23 - pound suitcase - sized machine does stretch the definition a bit .
On top of that , it did n't have a battery so it still had to be plugged into an AC outlet .
And the screen was ... well , let 's face it , 5 inches is n't much to look at .
Hunch over and squint if you love SX - 64 s
The system was almost completely compatible with the C64 , although it lacked a cassette port .
The OS had a cosmetic change of reversing the C64's white text on a blue background to blue text on a white background to make things easier to see on the tiny screen .
As you might imagine , the SX - 64 suffered from very slow sales .
The poor girl was put down for good in 1986 .
But hold it , buckaroo .
Let 's not be too hard on the misbegotten SX - 64 .
Are portable computers that much better off today ?
To answer that , we 'll take a modern portable computer completely at random and compare .
The wheel has landed on the MacBook Air .
It 's an ultra - thin portable announced only this week at MacWorld .
I have n't been paying attention — surely you can't get any more modern than this thing .
Let 's look at the features :
According to the highly judicious benchmarking above , the systems are practically the same .
I 'll give a nod to the MacBook Air because I 'm a sucker for superfluous lights in a machine .
You should see me in a data center .
In conclusion ...
Despite its faults , the SX - 64 is a sweet system .
There 's no shame for it not being able to keep up with the Commodore .
Nobody could .
Well , maybe this guy :
He 's SO keeping up with the Commodore
Now it 's time to turn things over to the most interesting part of This Old Box : the comments .
Share your memories and gripes if you got 'em .
How 's your lumbago from carrying this baby around ?
What was your favorite mixed drink to sip while using the SX - 64 ?
Were you able to power the system via magic like the guy above ?

Constitutional scholar pans Clinton for fleeing from FISA fight David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 14 , 2008

Print This Email This Constitutional lawyer Jonathan Turley criticized the Senate for bowing to President Bush 's demands for more spying power and amnesty for potentially law - breaking telecommunications companies .
" The fix has been in for some time on the unlawful surveillance program and the torture program , " he said Wednesday on Countdown with Keith Olbermann .
" Many Democrats and Republicans were aware of the program and they are actively helping the White House to try to shut down any confrontation on the issue .
This is also helped by the fact the telecoms are one of the five most powerful lobbying forces in Washington , and many of these members have close ties to those lobbyists . "
Turley panned presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , who skipped the politically tricky and controversial Senate vote on the spy law Tuesday even though she had been campaigning in Washington that day .
" It really , I think is symbolic of this disconnect ... here you 've got someone who is campaigning for the President of the United States , making pitches to civil libertarians , but does n't even show up -- when she 's in the neighborhood -- to vote against telecom immunity , " Turley charged .
" I 'm not just dumping on her .
The fact is there has been a lot of really duplicitous work being done by both parties . "
Republican John McCain and Barack Obama both voted on amendments to the measure ; Obama opposed telecom immunity , while McCain supported it .
Clinton left town early to get to a campaign stop in Texas .
Although he voted to sustain a filibuster on the FISA update , Obama left Washington for a campaign stop in Wisconisn without voting on the final bill .
It is up to the House to decide whether to let telecoms off the hook in about 40 civil lawsuits alleging their participation in President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
A temporary extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance act expires at midnight Saturday , and the House on Wednesday failed to extend that deadline .
The ACLU is urging the House to let the temporary FISA extension , the Protect America Act , expire rather than let itself be bullied into caving again to Bush .
Olbermann and Turley had some especially harsh words for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" Harry Reid made some decisions that made it virtually impossible for civil libertarians to win , " Turley said .
This video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast February 13 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions :: when the original secretary of homeland security said he dint know why they told him to raise the terror level , we must acknowledge we live not in an age of terror , but when it 's exploited by politicians sworn to protect us from terror .
we have not had exploitation of terrorists since this morning .
the senate legalized ease dropping and to cover it up by not saying how it happened .
unlike the senate , democratic leaders in the house passed a version of the wiretapping law fisa , last year .
this morning , mr. bush said if the house does not yield and give them immunity , we will all die .
i'm para phrasing , but not by as much as you might think . :: good morning , at this moment , somewhere in the world , terrorists are planning attacks on our country .
their goal is to bring deskrux to our shore that is make september 11th pale by compareson .
there 's no reason , we cannot pass the senate bill immediately .
to not pass it will jeopardize the security of our citizens . :: this afternoon , the house leadership failed to pass the fisa act .
republicans want it to expire .
they also think the presidents statement was an exploitation of terrorist attacks . :: put the senate vote in perspective for us in terms of protecting the constitution for covering up white house crimes . :: the bill is trying to preserve .
it was designed to circumvent the fourth amendment .
it has no public interest value .
it 's there to extinguish dozens of suits before federal court .
it 's in contempt before they can say what the president did is illegal .
the senate is working with the white house to cover up a crime and you have this bizarre situation with the executive and legislative branch to shut down and keep judges from declaring an unlawful program . :: so , if every plausible argument got a proposed amendment yesterday , the fisa court would vet the lawsuits .
these are all rejected by the republicans .
is it purely to stop the lawsuits and stop information from getting out ?
there 's been some estimation that this is spinning forward to protect whatever the white house has next ? :: it 's not just republicans .
in case you noticed , there 's more than 31 democrats in the senate .
only 31 people voted against the immunity program .
the fix has been in a long time .
many democrats and republicans were aware of the program and they are actively helping the white house sto shut down a confrontation on the issue .
it 's helped by the fact the telecoms are one of the largest forces in washington .
many of them have ties to the lobbyist . :: if it passes , it may be unstoppable at this point , could the next congress revoke it and number two , could a democratic president have his or her attorney general investigate the bush officials who ordered the wiretapping in the first place ? :: it 's going to be hard to get it to walk back wards .
the question about the next president is a good one .
hillary clinton did n't show up to vote .
she was in the area campaigning .
her opponents mccain and obama showed up .
here you have someone campaigning for the president of the united states , but does n't show up when she 's in the neighborhood to vote against telecom immunity .
i'm not just dumping on her .
there 's been a lot of work being done by both parties to shield what has been a very fixed deal from the beginning on telecoms . :: let 's point the finger at one of the parties .
senator dodd has a filibuster .
harry reed let a democratic fail even though it has 57 votes .
a virtual filibuster without making them a filibuster .
where 's the democratic party on this .
:: you 're right .
this is a case where the democrats could n't make a claim they could n't block the vote .
they could have done it easily .
the republicans do it all the time .
harry reed made decisions that made it virtually impossible for them to win .
he favors the intel committee .
they concealed the program and he let them take the lead .
it made it difficult for them to prevail . :: jonathan , great thanks . :: thanks , keith .

NEW YORK–Shares of stun - gun maker Taser International Inc. climbed today after an analyst upgraded the stock and another said the Toronto Police Service could place a large order for Taser products next year .
Toronto police said this afternoon that there are no plans to make such a purchase .
Shares of the Scottsdale , Ariz . - based company picked up 82 cents ( dollar figures U.S. ) , or 8.5 per cent , to $ 10.52 in heavy midday trading .
The stock has ranged from $ 7.44 to $ 19.36 over the past year .
Feltl & Co. analyst Richard Ryan upgraded the stock to " Buy " from " Hold , " noting a recent pullback in share price .
At Yesterday 's close , the stock was down about half from its 52 - week high of $ 19.36 set in October , and has lost almost a third of its value in 2008 .
" This period of weakness could be related to a series of ( strange ) news releases primarily relating to old patent infringement issues from a couple of Taser competitors , combined with a rather direct response from Taser management , " Ryan wrote in a client note .
" During this same time , Taser enjoyed a successful PR campaign with its new consumer Taser at the Consumer Electronics Show " .
Earlier this month , Stinger Systems Inc. said it asked the U.S. Patent Office to review a patent related to Taser 's M26 stun gun .
The analyst said Taser 's new products have increased its revenue dramatically , and items like its C2 personal protection device should lead to more growth .
Jefferies & Co. analyst Matthew McKay said in a client note that the Toronto Police Service is asking for funding to provide Taser stun guns for 3,000 officers .
McKay kept a " Buy " rating on the stock , with a price target of $ 20 per share .
Late today , Mark Pugash , a spokesperson for Toronto Police , said reports of a Taser purchase being imminent are wrong .
" While Chief ( Bill ) Blair has said he would like to equip his front - line officers with Tasers , the law in Ontario would have to be changed before this could happen .
" Then , of course , there would be the issue of money being made available for such a purpose . "
Radiation from mobile phones delays and reduces sleep , and causes headaches and confusion , according to a new study .
The research , sponsored by the mobile phone companies themselves , shows that using the handsets before bed causes people to take longer to reach the deeper stages of sleep and to spend less time in them , interfering with the body 's ability to repair damage suffered during the day .
The findings are especially alarming for children and teenagers , most of whom – surveys suggest – use their phones late at night and who especially need sleep .
Their failure to get enough can lead to mood and personality changes , ADHD - like symptoms , depression , lack of concentration and poor academic performance .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The study – carried out by scientists from the blue - chip Karolinska Institute and Uppsala University in Sweden and from Wayne State University in Michigan , USA – is thought to be the most comprehensive of its kind .
Published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium and funded by the Mobile Manufacturers Forum , representing the main handset companies , it has caused serious concern among top sleep experts , one of whom said that there was now " more than sufficient evidence " to show that the radiation " affects deep sleep " .
The scientists studied 35 men and 36 women aged between 18 and 45 .
Some were exposed to radiation that exactly mimicked what is received when using mobile phones ; others were placed in precisely the same conditions , but given only " sham " exposure , receiving no radiation at all .
The people who had received the radiation took longer to enter the first of the deeper stages of sleep , and spent less time in the deepest one .
The scientists concluded : " The study indicates that during laboratory exposure to 884 MHz wireless signals components of sleep believed to be important for recovery from daily wear and tear are adversely affected . "
The embarrassed Mobile Manufacturers Forum played down the results , insisting – at apparent variance with this published conclusion – that its " results were inconclusive " and that " the researchers did not claim that exposure caused sleep disturbance " .
But Professor Bengt Arnetz , who led the study , says : " We did find an effect from mobile phones from exposure scenarios that were realistic .
This suggests that they have measurable effects on the brain . "
He believes that the radiation may activate the brain 's stress system , " making people more alert and more focused , and decreasing their ability to wind down and fall asleep " .
About half of the people studied believed themselves to be " electrosensitive " , reporting symptoms such as headaches and impaired cognitive function from mobile phone use .
But they proved to be unable to tell if they had been exposed to the radiation in the test .
This strengthens the conclusion of the study , as it disposes of any suggestion that knowledge of exposure influenced sleeping patterns .
Even more significantly , it throws into doubt the relevance of studies the industry relies on to maintain that the radiation has no measurable effects .
A series of them – most notably a recent highly publicised study at Essex University – have similarly found that people claiming to be electrosensitive could not distinguish when the radiation was turned on in laboratory conditions , suggesting that they were not affected .
Critics have attacked the studies ' methodology , but the new findings deal them a serious blow .
For they show that the radiation did have an effect , even though people could not tell when they were exposed .
It also complements other recent research .
A massive study , following 1,656 Belgian teenagers for a year , found most of them used their phones after going to bed .
It concluded that those who did this once a week were more than three times – and those who used them more often more than five times – as likely to be " very tired " .
Dr Chris Idzikowski , the director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre , says : " There is now more than sufficient evidence , from a large number of reputable investigators who are finding that mobile phone exposure an hour before sleep adversely affects deep sleep . "
Dr William Kohler of the Florida Sleep Institute added : " Anything that disrupts the integrity of your sleep will potentially have adverse consequences in functioning during the day , such as grouchiness , difficulty concentrating , and in children hyperactivity and behaviour problems . "
David Schick , the chief executive of Exradia , which manufactures protective devices against the radiation , called on ministers to conduct " a formal public inquiry " into the effects of mobile phones .

Trainee surgeons are turning to game consoles to hone their scalpel skills .
A study has found that students become more proficient at making the delicate and smooth movements needed in surgery after playing certain computer games .
Mark Marshall , director of simulation and training at the Banner Good Samaritan Medical Centre , in Phoenix , Arizona , asked eight trainee doctors to spend an hour playing games on a console before " performing surgery " in virtual reality - using a software system that recreates , on the computer screen , a human body in 3D and monitors surgeons ' hands as they " operate " electronically .
By recording the precision of the trainees ' hand movements , Marshall 's team could judge how good each was at a variety of procedures that would be used in real operations .
The researchers found that the students scored better at practice operations after playing games on Nintendo 's Wii console , an effect attributed to the wireless controllers used to direct the onscreen action .
The fine control needed to move a virtual marble around a 3D maze in one game was particularly applicable to laparoscopy , a form of keyhole surgery .
Students , Marshall pointed out , could now be practising " long before they get near the patients " .
Marshall found that the games players scored 48 % higher than other trainees who had not practised on the console first .
" Our trial shows this improves the skills of the surgeons when they are told to pick exercises within the games .
It makes their training much , much quicker .
How long depends on the surgical speciality , but usually it 's somewhere between four to six years . "
Researchers said it was crucial for the trainees to be given particular exercises to focus on while playing the games , and that not all games helped hone surgery skills .
" You do n't gain a lot from swinging an imaginary tennis racket , " Kanav Kohel , another researcher on the project , told New Scientist magazine .
" The whole point about surgery is to execute small , finely controlled movements with your hands , and that is exactly what you get with the Wii . "
Marshall said the games consoles were cheap enough to be used to train surgeons in poorer countries where cutting - edge virtual reality systems were not available .
The Marshall team is now designing software for the Wii that accurately simulates common surgical procedures .
They are to announce their work at the Medicine meets Virtual Reality conference in Long Beach , California , this month .
Britney Spears is out , Posh Spice is in - as a lyric for the Lady in the Lake in the Broadway musical Monty Python 's Spamalot .
Asked why the lyric was changed in the song Diva 's Lament , Spamalot author Eric Idle said today in an email : " Because we do n't laugh at sad people .
Mike Nichols ( the show 's director ) requested it and he 's right . "
" We changed the lyrics in London , on tour , on Broadway and in Las Vegas .
We think that it 's now too sad .
Britney Spears is being tortured to death and we do n't want to be on that side . "

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Coalition forces found 26 bodies buried in mass graves and a bloodstained " torture complex , " with chains hanging from walls and ceilings and a bed connected to an electrical system , the military said Wednesday .
Twenty - six bodies were found in mass graves near a " torture complex " discovered by coalition forces .

The troops made the discovery while conducting an operation north of Muqdadiya , Iraq .
From December 8 to 11 , the troops who found the complex also killed 24 people they said were terrorists and detained 37 suspects , according to a statement issued by Multinational Division North at Camp Speicher in Tikrit .
The moves were part of an operation called Iron Reaper that has been in progress across northern Iraq for the past few weeks .
The complex was in an area thought to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven and operating base , the military said .
Iraqis had told the military about the site during an earlier operation .
" Evidence of murder , torture and intimidation against local villagers was found throughout the area , " the military statement said .
Ground forces first found what appeared to be a detention facility , which was one of three connected to the torture complex , Multinational Division North said .
One of the facilities appeared to have been a headquarters building and a torture facility , it added .
As the area was cleared , the bodies were found .
Eventually , 26 bodies were uncovered in mass graves next to what were thought to be execution sites , the military said .
The bodies are believed to have been dead between six and eight months , according to a gruesome military video shot at the scene .
Some had their hands tied behind their backs .
Identification is proving to be a challenge because of advanced decomposition .
Photos given to the news media show a filthy bed wired to an electrical system , with an outlet hanging from wires on the wall .
In the video , troops point out rubber hoses and boxing gloves , a ski mask and a blood - covered sword and knives .
Other still photos show an entrance to the underground bunker and barbed wire stretched outside it .
A short distance away from the complex , troops found a bullet - riddled Iraqi police vehicle .
Some of the bodies may belong to Iraqi police , according to the military video .
The operation netted nine weapons caches , which have been destroyed , the military said .
They included anti-aircraft weapons , sniper rifles , more than 65 machine guns and pistols , 50 grenades and a surface - to - air missile launcher and platform , the statement said .
Also found were mines , pipe bombs , rocket - propelled grenades , mortar tubes and rounds and 130 pounds of homemade explosives .

Will 2007 be the year known as the year the corporate fraudsters were given a " walk " by the Supreme Court ?
Right now the fraudsters have been pitched four ball , and it certainly looks like a walk for the fraudsters :
Ball One : In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 127 S. Ct. 1955 ( May 21 , 2007 ) , the Supreme Court tossed the long standing pleading standard in corporate conspiracy cases , requiring injured parties to plead enough facts " to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement , ” noting that " discovery can be expensive ; " Ball Two : In Credit Suisse Securities v. Billing , 127 S. Ct. 2383 ( June 18 , 2007 ) , the Court tossed a private antitrust suit alleging anticompetitive activities by underwriters in the issuance of initial public offerings , stating in the most conclusory and broadly speculative terms , that " the threat of antitrust lawsuits , through error and disincentive , could seriously alter underwriter conduct in undesirable ways " and was , in essence , preempted by the securities laws ; Ball Three : In Tellabs , Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights , Ltd , 127 S. Ct. 2499 , 2007 WL 1773208 ( June 21 , 2007 ) , tossed the notion that at the pleading stage , before any discovery had begun , that the injured securities purchaser was entitled to all inferences being drawn in the plaintiffs favor .
Instead , “ to curb perceived abuses of the § 10 ( b ) private action — ‘ nuisance filings , targeting of deep - pocket defendants , vexatious discovery requests and manipulation by class action lawyers ’ ” a " complaint will survive ... only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged ; ” and BALL FOUR .... WALK : The U.S. Supreme Court decision today in Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific - Atlanta , where , by a vote of 5 - 3 , the Court tossed wide of home plate , any notion that " scheme liability " exists in the context of private causes of actions under the securities laws because investors cannot be said to rely on fraudulent schemes they do not know exist .
This leaves sole enforcement and recovery in the hands of that same under - funded , under - manned , out - gunned , SEC that now has to handle all those antitrust issues ( See Ball Three ) , at least until a new Congress and a new President , untethered to Corporate Lobbyists , come to the rescue , and rectify this unintelligible and illogical mess .
Of course I would not be so critical if this were anything other than a policy decision devoid of fact .
In throwing ball four , and hence a walk to corporate conspirators committing deceptive acts , the Court reasoned that even though the act may be deceptive , and intentionally so , the Court will not allow a presumption that investors rely upon a third party 's actions or statements .
Justice Kennedy wrote :
Though § 10 ( b ) is “ not ‘ limited to preserving the integrity of the securities markets , ’ ” Bankers Life , 404 U. S. , at 12 , it does not reach all commercial transactions that are fraudulent and affect the price of a security in some attenuated way .
To do so might sweep all conspiring suppliers and customers out of the game of accountability for the huge damage they contribute too .
The Court , in outright protectionism of Corporate Fraud , rejected the irrefutable fact and logic that :
in an efficient market investors rely not only upon the public statements relating to a security but also upon the transactions those statements reflect .
Were the Court to adopt petitioner ’s concept of reliance — i.e. , that in an efficient market investors rely not only upon the public statements relating to a security but also upon the transactions those statements reflect — the implied cause of action would reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business .
Whew !!!!
I did n't know that deception was such a part of our society that we needed to protect fraud conspirators from their own wrongdoing .
Rather , the Court decided , as a matter of unsupported fact and law that these conspiring vendors :
had no duty to disclose ; and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public .
[ please ignore the inflated revenues ]
No member of the investing public had knowledge , either actual or presumed , of [ the two companies ’ ] deceptive acts during the relevant times .
[ as long as the deceptive act is hidden the fraudsters can't be held liable ] [ Stoneridge ] , as a result , cannot show reliance upon any of [ the companies ’ ] actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability .
[ and what is the factual basis of this finding ? ]
So , even though the vendors knew their deceptive billings would inflate Stoneridge 's revenues , and that there was no other purpose for the deception , since the public only relied on the false aggregate revenue numbers and not the vendors bills themselves , the Court finds as a matter of law and fact that there can be no reliance ????
What happened to the requirement of evidentiary proof and the jury system ?
Ohhh , yes , I remember now what the Court said about that .
If we hold corporate conspirators liable :
[ o] verseas firms with no other exposure to our securities laws could be deterred from doing business here .
No , we would not want that .
We need foreign corporate conspirators to keep our economy running !!!!
Even more confusing is the Court 's implication that state law remedies are sufficient :
“ Were the implied cause of action to be extended to the practices described here , however , there would be a risk that the federal power would be used to invite litigation beyond the immediate sphere of securities litigation and in areas already governed by functioning and effective state - law guarantees . ”
What state law guarantees is the Court talking about ?
Has the Supreme Court forgotten about the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards
Act of 1998 that preempts class actions that allege fraud under state law " in connection with the purchase or sale " of securities ?
Today 's ruling will be followed soon by the Ernon case against the investment banking firms who helped Enron create the fraudulent financial vehicles that dupped investors to buy Enron stock —
California Regents v. Merrill Lynch , et al. ( 06 - 1341 ) ( " Enron " ) .
Can the Court find a difference where the wrongdoer is not a supplier or a customer ?
Can it be said that investors do not rely on fraudulent transactions with customers but do rely on fraudulent transactions with those more closely engaged in keeping the issuer involved in the securities market , such as lawyers , auditors , bankers and underwriters ?
Letting a customer off the hook , when the customer actually bought the goods is one thing , but letting off the lawyers , auditors , bankers and underwriters off the hook when they actually got paid to help commit the fraud , is another .
No one will riot over the first .
The second will rally a lot of troops as we sit in the middle of this subprime mortgage meltdown .
There is a hint that the Court is not dull and could pick off one or two of these corporate conspirators who take too big of a lead - off .
First , the Court notes , in talking about these supplier / customer defendants , that their actions were " beyond the securities markets — the realm of financing business – to purchase and supply contracts – the realm of ordinary business . "
Clearly a distinction would be drawn against the investment bankers in Enron .
Second , the Court states that :
nothing respondents did made it necessary or inevitable for Charter to record the transactions as it did .
Here respondents were acting in concert with Charter in the ordinary course as suppliers and , as matters then evolved in the not so ordinary course , as customers .
Unconventional as the arrangement was , it took place in the marketplace for goods and services , not in the investment sphere .
Charter was free to do as it chose in preparing its books , conferring with its auditor , and preparing and then issuing its financial statements .
In these circumstances the investors cannot be said to have relied upon any of respondents ’ deceptive acts in the decision to purchase or sell securities ; and as the requisite reliance cannot be shown , respondents have no liability to petitioner under the implied right of action .
***
It was Charter , not respondents , that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements ;
It may be arguable , in Enron , that the investment bankers misled or acted with the auditors , or did take action that that " made it necessary or inevitable for [ Enron ] to record the transactions the way it did . "
Or the Court may see what they did in Enron as being in the " investment sphere , " which it was .
Finally , in another good omen for investors , the Supreme Court rejected , out right , the oft repeated contention that one must make a deceptive statement to be liable under § 10 ( b ) :
The Court of Appeals concluded petitioner had not alleged that respondents engaged in a deceptive act within the reach of the § 10 ( b ) private right of action , noting that only misstatements , omissions by one who has a duty to disclose , and manipulative trading practices ( where “ manipulative ” is a term of art , see , e.g. , Santa Fe Industries , Inc. v. Green , 430 U. S. 462 , 476 – 477 ( 1977 ) ) are deceptive within the meaning of the rule .
443 F. 3d , at 992 .
If this conclusion were read to suggest there must be a specific oral or written statement before there could be liability under § 10 ( b ) or Rule 10 b –5 , it would be erroneous .
Conduct itself can be deceptive , as respondents concede .
In this case , moreover , respondents ’ course of conduct included both oral and written statements , such as the backdated contracts agreed to by Charter and respondents .
So the game is not over .
Traditional suppliers and customers of goods are safe on base and off .
The bankers , the lawyers , the accountants , and the underwriters better keep tight on base .... at least until the next pitch ....

Supreme Court Oral Argument Transcript
CBS broke the story three years ago : a high - ranking Pentagon analyst had been caught handing over highly classified information to a foreign government  sensitive intelligence about al - Qaeda , U.S. policy deliberations regarding Iran , and other top - secret information of particular interest to his two American handlers .
The spy ’s native - born confederates , top officials of one of Washington ’s most powerful lobbying groups , passed America ’s most closely guarded secrets directly to foreign government officials in hurried meetings in empty restaurants , outside a train station , and over the phone , whispering their treason in some of Washington ’s darkest corners so as not to leave a paper trail of purloined documents .
As clever as they were , however , these spymasters apparently outwitted themselves , because the FBI ’s counterintelligence unit was on to them from the very beginning : the two core members of the spy nest had been under surveillance for years , along with the foreign officials who operated out of their Washington embassy .
The FBI had everything on tape , and they let the Pentagon mole weave enough rope to hang himself with until they moved in on him : confronted with his treason , the mole  the Pentagon ’s top Iran analyst , working directly under then - undersecretary of defense for policy Douglas J. Feith  agreed to wear a wire to future meetings with his handlers .
An extensive record of treason was documented , until indictments were issued and charges brought against all three .
When the news first broke , it was a national scandal  and then the story sank like a stone , for three solid years , while the extensive litigation surrounding the case played out .
The analyst pled guilty to espionage and was sentenced to 13 years in prison and a substantial fine  with time off for his cooperation in the future trial of his two ex-cohorts .
The trial , as I ’ve said , has been delayed for nearly three years and is scheduled to finally begin on Jan. 14 .
But I would n’t count on that happening : the trial has been delayed on several occasions through the years , and recent developments augur ill for the speedy resolution of this case .
You might think this is odd : after all , it seems like an open - and - shut case .
With so much evidence accumulated by government prosecutors , one would think this would be a cakewalk .
And it would be , if the recipient of this stolen intelligence were n’t Israel .
It would be , except the two key figures in this cloak and dagger episode were top officials of AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , a Washington powerhouse whose former chief lobbyist once boasted to the New Yorker ‘s Jeffrey Goldberg : " You see this napkin ?
In twenty - four hours , we could have the signatures of seventy senators on this napkin . "
So said Steve Rosen , the spark plug behind AIPAC ’s legendary lobbying success  the very same Steve Rosen indicted for espionage , along with his top Iran specialist , Keith Weissman , on Aug. 4 , 2005 , and whose trial is scheduled for Jan. 14 , 2008 .
Rosen and Weissman contacted , cultivated , and befriended Pentagon analyst Larry Franklin for the specific purpose of culling classified information from him .
They even promised to put in a good word for him with top Washington officials as a partial reward for his betrayal .
However , Franklin , a committed neoconservative ideologue , did n’t need much material incentive : he was convinced that U.S. policy in the Middle East was n’t nearly as pro-Israel as it ought to be , and he was particularly concerned about Iran .
Starting in the late summer of 2002 and continuing until the late summer of 2004 , these three spun their web of subversion , gathering vital intelligence and passing it on to Israeli embassy officials .
And the FBI has a great deal of this on its surveillance tapes , so much of it  " four years of tracking AIPAC staffers , " according to the Jerusalem Post  that the footage could be made into a reality show with a unique " spy versus spy " theme .
The defense , in what would normally be an open - and - shut case , has been struggling frantically [ . pdf ] to avoid a trial at all costs .
That ’s understandable : after all , the FBI has the whole thing  the entire course of their crimes against America  on record .
The verbal transmission of classified information , the elaborate arrangements to avoid detection , the open boasting of the analyst ’s two handlers that they had a live one on the hook , it ’s all there : raw , naked treason .
Rather than come up against the incontrovertible facts , the defense has tried hard to divert the energies of the court away from actually bringing this to trial , in the hopes that the administration will back down and drop the charges .
The defense strategy has been to constantly up the ante , daring government prosecutors to present the full scope of the recorded evidence in open court  and thus compromise the sources and methods of U.S. clandestine services , such as the FBI ’s counterintelligence unit .
In addition , the nature and specific contents of various U.S. secrets stolen by the Rosen - Weissman - Franklin spy ring and transmitted to the Israelis could come out in open court .
This is why the government has made several attempts to mask the evidence , proposing that testimony made available to the public would be presented in a kind of code , but that was rejected byJudge T.S. Ellis , for the most part .
A mediation process was set up , and for months the lawyers have been haggling over what is admissible evidence and what has to be kept secret in the national interest  with the defense constantly pressuring the court to be as liberal as possible , and government prosecutors arguing for secrecy .
Now there has been a major development on this front .
No one took seriously the defense ’s motion , made a few months ago , that they be allowed to subpoena Condoleezza Rice , Paul Wolfowitz , National Security Council chief Stephen Hadley , and a whole platoon of government officials and former officials .
The motion was made on the grounds that these officials , too , had transmitted classified information to AIPAC , and that this is proof that such behavior was and is routine , part of the normal way of doing business in the world of Washington lobbyists .
The defendants ’ case has always been that they have a First Amendment right to commit espionage , and that their indictment amounted to a government assault on their right to " free speech . "
Gee , too bad the Rosenbergs never thought of this unique rationalization for treason , although I doubt it would ’ve gotten them anywhere .
The AIPAC defendants , however , may have more luck in this department
No judge had ever allowed such a thing , at least in recent memory , and no one expected Judge Ellis to look favorably on this request .
That he granted the defense motion in all but a few cases is bad news for the government  and good news for the Israel lobby , which may just be spared the embarrassment of having its essential nature as a fifth column for Israel exposed to the light of day .
In addition to Rice , Wolfowitz , and Hadley , the following can expect to be served with a summons to appear at a trial that may never happen : Larry Franklin ’s boss , Douglas J. Feith , former undersecretary of defense for policy ; Elliott Abrams , neocon par excellence and Iran - Contra alumnus , who served as Bush ’s " deputy national security adviser for global democracy strategy " ; Kenneth Pollack , a former National Security Council adviser to Bill Clinton and author of the now infamously influential book The Threatening Storm , which convinced so many liberal Democrats to support the invasion of Iraq ; Marc Grossman , former undersecretary of state for political affairs ; Marc Sievers , chief political affairs officer at the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and one of Rice ’s chief advisers on Iraqi affairs ; David Satterfield , a political officer at our Tel Aviv embassy ; William Burns , the American ambassador to Russia ; Lawrence Silverman , currently a deputy chief at the American embassy in the Slovak Republic ; Matthew Bryza , a deputy assistant secretary of state ; and Michael Makovsky , a former staff member of the Office of Special Plans , the policy shop where the " intelligence " pointing to Saddam Hussein ’s fabled " weapons of mass destruction " was cooked up into talking points .
Franklin also served in that policy shop .
The idea that the U.S. government is going to allow this is absurd .
Rather than expose the entire Israeli covert operation in its midst and permit testimony that would dramatize how much access the Israelis already have to our officials and the policy - making process , the Bush administration now has an ideal excuse to shut this case down .
Rice would n’t even show up to a congressional hearing to answer questions about prewar intelligence , and she similarly tried to defy the 9/11 Commission on the grounds of " executive privilege . "
In spite of her expressed willingness to " cooperate with our legal system , " I fully expect her to show the same disdain for Judge Ellis ’ court .
The recent book by John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt documenting the existence of a powerful Israel lobby has generated a storm of controversy , with the Lobby ’s advocates smearing the two professors as " anti-Semites " and the more reasonable members of the foreign policy community at least open to the argument that undue reverence for the Lobby  and its political clout  has distorted the policy - making process , perhaps fatally .
Yet even Mearsheimer and Walt go out of their way to emphasize that the Lobby is " not a cabal " and " not a conspiracy , " and , although they mention the AIPAC spy case briefly , they draw no conclusions from it .
Perhaps they thought they had enough of a burden in making the case they did make , without sinking the knife in deeper .
Yet this case shows that at the very core of the Lobby a cabal was operating , which was  and , for all we know , still is  engaged in a conspiracy to commit espionage on behalf of a foreign power .
This is undeniable to anyone who has followed the details of this case , and the embarrassment of a public trial would have rendered it irrefutable in the public mind : AIPAC would be ruined , its name and image forever associated with the stealing of U.S. secrets .
Almost certainly a trial would force AIPAC to register as an agent of a foreign power , namely Israel , in which case its political effectiveness would be seriously impaired , and for all intents and purposes ended .
There is going to be tremendous pressure now , coming from the White House as well as the Lobby , to quash this trial before it ruins them all .
The odds are that this effort will succeed , if only because the case has slipped beneath the media ’s radar .
It has been going on , after all , for nearly three long years , during which time the original memory of the FBI ’s two raids on AIPAC ’s Washington office and the sensational confession and conviction of Franklin have faded in the public mind .
Even the nearly unprecedented news that a judge has ordered such a personage as Rice to give testimony in this case has n’t garnered all that much notice .
If the case dies , it will die a largely silent death .
If it ever comes to trial , however , it will be the show of the decade , much more entertaining than anything remotely promised by the trial of Scooter Libby .
Rice ’s refusal to testify , and similar refusals by some or all of the currently serving U.S. officials , could torpedo the trial once and for all , or at least delay it indefinitely as the government appeals the judge ’s decision .
Douglas Feith will never be asked why he was in such a hurry to resign , and Wolfowitz and Hadley will be spared the embarrassment of having to explain how Israeli agents managed to penetrate the Pentagon .
The Lobby can breathe a sigh of relief , as can the White House  and , most importantly , from the Israeli point of view , their spy nest can continue to operate without further ado .
After all , you do n’t really believe that Franklin is the only neocon fish caught in AIPAC ’s web of espionage , do you ?
The existence of one spy implies the presence of others , and , in this case , it ’s a virtual certainty .
A public trial would expose the whole network to the blinding light of day , an ugly scene that both Washington and the Israelis would much rather avoid .
To obscure the implications of their espionage , the Lobby has done its best to sabotage this case  and it looks like they may have succeeded .

The police commissioner ’s office and a New York City police captain tried to convince the public that a marauding band of kids had gotten out of control and terrified residents , motorists and pedestrians on a street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn .
The cops were wrong .
And they must have known that they were wrong , that the picture they were creating of youngsters climbing on top of cars and blocking vehicular and pedestrian traffic was completely false .
The Brooklyn district attorney , Charles Hynes , carried the canard further .
That had to have been deliberate , too .
He went on the Brian Lehrer radio program on WNYC and said that his office had investigated the matter  had conducted what he described as an “ independent inquiry . ”
“ We had many , many interviews with local store owners and people who live in the neighborhood who are , frankly , scared to death of these kids , ” he said .
“ And they were not just walking on one car ; they were trampling on all sorts of cars .
It was almost as if they were inviting their arrest . ”
WASHINGTON  The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday denied California and 16 other states the right to set their own standards for carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles .
The E.P.A. administrator , Stephen L. Johnson , said the proposed California rules were pre-empted by federal authority and made moot by the energy bill signed into law by President Bush on Wednesday .
Mr. Johnson said California had failed to make a compelling case that it needed authority to write its own standards for greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks to help curb global warming .
The decision immediately provoked a heated debate over its scientific basis and whether political pressure was applied by the automobile industry to help it escape the proposed California regulations .
Officials from the states and numerous environmental groups vowed to sue to overturn the edict .
In an evening conference call with reporters , Mr. Johnson defended his agency ’s decision .
“ The Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution , not a confusing patchwork of state rules , ” he said .
“ I believe this is a better approach than if individual states were to act alone . ”
One of the hot topics of conversation lately is the idea of a mortgage “ put option . ”
There seem to be more than a few people — including those who do n’t exactly use the language of options contracts , like that weird couple featured recently on 60 Minutes — who are slightly confused about what the “ optionality ” of a mortgage contract is .
There are also lots of folks who are wondering what will happen to mortgage pricing in general should a substantial number of folks decide to “ exercise the put ” on their mortgages .
It seems wise to me to try to tease out what ’s going on here .
First , mortgage contracts in the U.S. are not , actually , options contracts .
You may peruse your note and mortgage at length now , if you did n’t do so when you signed them , and you will not find any “ put ” or “ call ” in there .
Your note is a promise to pay money you have borrowed , and your mortgage or deed of trust is a pledge of real estate you own ( or are buying with the borrowed money ) as security for that note .
That means , in short , that if you fail to keep your promise to pay the loan in cash , the lender can force you to sell your property at auction ( to produce cash with which to pay the loan in full ) .
Because the mortgage instrument gives your lender a “ lien , ” any sales proceeds are first applied to the mortgage debt before you get any of it .
People get very confused about this because it is often the lender who ends up buying the property at the forced auction .
When that happens , it is basically because the lender simply wants to put a “ floor ” bid in the auction : the lender bids an amount based on what it is willing to lose ( if any ) .
Typically , the lender bids its “ make whole amount ” or the loan amount plus accrued interest and expenses .
If someone else bids more than that , the lender is happy to let the property go to the higher bidder .
The lender might bid less than its make - whole amount ; it might bid its “ probable loss ” amount .
If the lender is owed $ 300,000 and does n’t think it could ever end up recovering more than $ 200,000 , it might bid $ 200,000 at the FC auction .
The lender does n’t actually want to win the auction ; lenders are not really in the business of real estate investment or property management .
However , the lender would rather buy the home at the auction and pay itself back eventually by re-selling the property later ( as a listed property in a private sale instead of a courthouse auction ) than let the property go for $ 50,000 ( meaning the lender would recover only $ 50,000 on a $ 300,000 loan instead of $ 200,000 ) .
Nothing ever stops any third party from bidding $ 1 more than the lender ’s bid and winning the auction ( except , of course , any third party ’s own inclinations ) .
We need to remember , then , right away , when anyone talks about “ giving the house back to the bank ” or “ mailing in the keys , ” we are already in the land of metaphorical language .
The only situation in which “ giving the house back to the bank ” would literally be possible is if you bought the house from the bank ( say , it was REO ) and the contract explicitly gave you an option to sell it back to the bank , whenever you wanted to , at a price equal to your loan balance .
Nobody writes REO sales contracts that way .
In most cases , of course , you bought the house from someone other than a bank .
You have no option to “ put the house back ” to the seller .
You win only if it's " heads . "
A “ put option , ” in the financial world , is a contract that gives the buyer of the put the right , but not the obligation , to sell something ( a commodity , a stock , a bond , etc. ) in the future at a predetermined price .
On the other side of the deal , the “ writer ” of the put is obligated to buy the thing in question if the put buyer exercises the option .
Some of you may already be a bit confused about “ buyer ” and “ seller ” here , but that ’s an important point .
You do n’t get “ free puts . ”
You buy puts .
There is a fee or a “ premium ” that you pay for the option contract .
If you do not exercise the option , the put - writer pockets that fee .
If you do exercise your option , the put - writer pockets that fee ( to offset his loss on the deal ) and your gains on the ultimate sale of the thing are net of the option premium .
The point of a put is that you buy them when you want to be protected from falling prices : if you think there is a good chance that the value of something will fall in the future , buying a put that allows you the option of selling it next month at this month ’s price might well be worth paying that option premium .
But you do always pay an option premium and you do not get it back .
The opposite of the put option is the call option : it is the option to buy something in the future at a predetermined price .
You buy calls when you think the value of the thing is likely to rise .
You also always pay some premium or fee for a call .
Residential real estate sales and mortgage loans do not , actually , literally , have puts and calls in them .
If you buy a home today , you assume the risk that its price may fall in the future .
Your contract does not include an option for you to sell the house at the price you paid for it .
Nor does the seller of the house have a “ call ” ; the seller cannot force you to sell the house back to him at the original price if its value rises .
Your mortgage loan contract does not give you the right to simply substitute the current value of the house for the current balance of the loan : you do , in fact , risk being “ upside down . ”
( The only time this is n’t true in the U.S. is with a reverse mortgage ; those are written explicitly to have this kind of a feature , where the balance due on the loan can never exceed the current market value of the property .
But of course reverse mortgages are n’t purchase - money loans . )
Nor does the mortgage contract give your lender the right to buy your house from you for the “ price ” of the loan amount when that is less than its value .
Mortgage lenders never do better than paid back .
If the real estate securing your loan increases in value , that appreciation belongs to you ( as long as you make your loan payments ) .
So why is it that people keep talking about “ puts ” and “ calls ” in terms of mortgage loans ?
That ’s because mortgage contracts have features that can affect their value to the writer of the contract ( the lender or investor ) in a way that is analytically comparable , in some ways , to classic options .
Options theory is applied to mortgages in order to price them as investments .
( Strictly speaking , this is a matter of analyzing them so that a price can be determined . )
The interest rate , then , that you get on a mortgage loan will depend , in part , on how the lender / investor “ priced ” the implied options in the contract .
The “ implied put ” in a mortgage contract is the borrower ’s ability to default ( walk away , send jingle mail , whatever you want to call it ) .
We do not , generally , consider “ distress ” ( that ’s actually the formal term in the literature , for you Googlers ) as an “ implied put . ”
Some borrowers will fall on hard times and be unable to fulfill their mortgage contracts .
This is a matter of “ credit risk ” and it is , analytically , a different matter of mortgage contract valuation .
The “ implied put ” analysis is trying to capture the possible cost to the lender / investor of what we call the “ ruthless ” borrower .
“ Ruthless ” is n’t really intended to be a casual insult ; it is in fact the term we use to describe borrowers who can pay their debts but choose not to , because there is a greater financial return to that borrower in defaulting as opposed to not defaulting .
It is “ ruthless ” precisely because there is not a contractual option to do this : the only way you can exercise the “ implied put ” is to default on your contract .
Many many people are very confused about this .
When we talk about the “ social acceptability ” of jingle mail , what we are talking about is at some level the extent to which there is or ought to be some rhetorical or social “ fig leaf ” over ruthlessness .
It seems to be true , after all , that most people are more likely to behave ruthlessly if they can call it something other than ruthlessness .
( There are always people who have no trouble with ruthlessness ; they often get the CEO job .
Most of us have at least moderately strong inhibitions about ruthless behavior . )
There is , therefore , a process in which the ruthless put is re-described in various alternative terms , or has alternative narrative contexts built up around it , such that it no longer “ feels ” ruthless .
The borrower was victimized ( by the lender , the original property seller , the media , the Man ) .
The put premium was actually paid ( “ they charge me so much they can afford this ” ) .
The ruthless borrower is actually the distressed borrower ( redefining what one can “ afford ” or what is necessary expense so that a payment you can make becomes a payment you “ can’t ” make ) .
Before anyone starts in on me , let me note that these fig leaf mechanisms are effective precisely because victimization , predatory interest rates , and truly distressed household budgets do really exist .
They would n’t be very convincing otherwise .
( Very few ruthless borrowers will claim it ’s because of , say , alien abduction or something equally implausible . )
I am not , therefore , asserting that all claims of predation or distress are “ false . ”
I am simply pointing out that it is , after all , a hallmark of the not - usually - ruthless person who is nonetheless acting ruthlessly to rationalize his conduct .
I do n’t offer that as some startling insight into human psychology .
I offer it as an attempt to get some analytic clarity .
When CR talks about lenders fearing that jingle mail will become socially acceptable , he ’s not exactly saying that lenders fear that society will no longer stigmatize financial failure ( “ distress ” ) .
They are afraid that rationalization mechanisms will become so effective that true ruthlessness ( which is historically pretty rare in home mortgage lending ) will become a significant additional problem ( in addition to true distress ) .
And they fear this because , delusions to the contrary , those loans did not have enough of a “ put premium ” priced into them to cover widespread “ ruthless default . ”
In fact , the very language of options theory can function , for a certain class of ruthless borrowers , as the fig leaf .
To say “ Hey , I ’m just exercising my put ” is a retroactive reinterpretation of your mortgage contract to “ formalize ” the “ implied put ” so that you do not have to describe what you ’re doing as “ defaulting . ”
This strategy is apparently popular with folks who have some modest exposure to financial markets jargon and an unwillingness to lump themselves in with the “ riffraff ” — victims of predators and financially failing households and other “ weaklings . ”
( Sadly , a lot of people who have a very high degree of exposure to financial markets jargon do n’t need no steenkin’ rationalization .
Like most sociopaths , they do n’t understand why “ ruthless ” would be considered insulting or what this term “ social acceptability ” might mean .
So if you ’re hearing the “ put ” excuse , you are probably in the presence of a relative amateur . )
The other side of the problem in valuation of mortgage loans and mortgage securities is the “ implied call . ”
The “ call - like feature ” in a mortgage contract is the right to prepay .
In the U.S. , all mortgage contracts have the right to prepay .
( Some , but not all , have a “ prepayment penalty ” in the early years of the loan , but “ penalty ” here means a prepayment fee , not an actual legal prohibition on prepayment . )
The reason the right to prepay functions like an implied call is that it gives the borrower the right to “ buy ” the loan from the lender at “ par , ” even if the value of the loan is much higher than “ par . ”
If you refinance your mortgage , you are required only to pay the unpaid principal balance ( plus accrued interest to the payoff date ) to the old lender in order to get the old lien released .
Unless the loan specifically has a prepayment penalty , you are not required to further compensate the old lender for the loss of a profitable loan .
So a loan with a prepayment penalty has an implied call and a real call exercise price .
A loan without a prepayment penalty , or past the term of its prepayment penalty , has a “ free call . ”
( In the original lender ’s point of view .
There is always some price to be paid to get a new refinance loan ; the borrower ’s calculation of the value of refinancing always has to take that into account .
Among other things , this fact results in mortgage “ call exercise ” being much less “ efficient ” than it is on actual call contracts , which makes the call much more difficult to value , analytically , for mortgages . )
While ruthless default might , historically , be rare , refinancing has been ubiquitous for decades now .
It was n’t always so easily available ; your grandparents might never have refinanced a loan not because their existing interest rates were never above market , but just because there were n’t lenders around offering inexpensive refinances .
In fact , refinances have been so ubiquitous for so long now that many people have come to think of the availability of refinancing money as somehow guaranteed .
This is n’t just a naïveté about interest rate cycles , although it is that too .
It is a belief that credit standards and operating costs of lenders never change , so that if someone thought you were “ creditworthy ” once , they ’ll automatically think of you as creditworthy again , and that lenders can always afford to refinance you without charging you upfront fees .
People who price mortgage - backed securities have always known that the prepayment behavior of mortgage loans is impacted not just by prevailing interest rates , but also by the borrower ’s creditworthiness , the lenders ’ risk appetites , and the cost ( time and money ) of the refinance transaction .
We were talking the other day about the prepayment characteristics of jumbo loans in comparison to conforming loans ; the fact is that people who have the largest loans are the most likely to refinance at any given reduction in interest rate , since a reduction in interest rate produces more dollars - per - month in savings on a larger loan than it does on a smaller loan .
Considering these types of things is very important to people who price MBS , because in fact prepayment behavior is both hard to “ price ” and absolutely critical to “ pricing ” mortgages as an investment .
MBS , unlike other kinds of bonds , are “ negatively convex . ”
I have been threatening to talk about convexity for a while and I keep chickening out .
It ’s actually useful to understand it if you want to understand why mortgage rates ( and the value of servicing portfolios ) behave the way they do .
The trouble is that convexity involves a whole bunch of seriously geeky math and computer models and normal people probably do n’t want to go there .
( I do n’t even want to go there . )
So as a compromise , this is a very quick and simple explanation of convexity .
The convexity of mortgages is a result of the “ implied options ” in them .
Most people understand intuitively that the higher the interest rate on a loan , the more an investor would pay for that loan : if you had the choice today of buying a bond that paid you 6.00 % and one that paid you 6.50 % , you would probably not offer the same price for each of them .
With a classic “ vanilla ” bond , the price you would offer would be a matter of looking at the term to maturity , the frequency of payments , the interest rate , and some appropriate discount rate .
The trouble with mortgages is that while they have a maximum legal term to maturity , they have an unpredictable actual loan life , because they have the prepayment “ calls ” implied in the contracts .
The return on a mortgage is uncertain , because you might get repaid early , forcing you to reinvest your funds at a lower rate .
On the other hand , the loans might just stay there until legal maturity , at an interest rate that is now below the market rate on a new investment .
The problem , obviously , is that borrowers refinance most often when prevailing market rates have dropped ( right when the investor might want the loans to be long - lived ) and do n’t refinance when prevailing rates have risen ( right when the investor would like to see you go away ) .
“ Vanilla ” bonds do n’t behave this way .
Vanilla bonds , like Treasury bonds and notes , are “ positively convex . ”
Mortgages are “ negatively convex . ”
Here ’s a comparative convexity graph prepared by Mark Adelman of Nomura ( do pursue the link if you want more detailed information about MBS valuation ) .
This graph plots three example instruments all with a face value of $ 1,000 and a price of par ( $ 1,000 ) at 6.00 % .
The vertical axis reflects the change in price of the bond .
The horizontal axis reflects the change in prevailing market yields .
As you move to the left of 6.00 % , you see that the price of the bond increases ( it has an above - market yield ) ; as you move to the right it decreases .
However , the three instruments do not increase or decrease in price in the same way .
The 30 - year bond has a steeper curve than the 10 - year note , which is a function of the difference in maturities of the two instruments .
The MBS is n’t just not as steep ; it is a different shape .
The 30 - year bond and the 10 - year note price functions create an upward - curving slope when you plot them against price / yield changes like this , and the MBS price functions create a downward - curving slope .
The term “ negative convexity ” means , exactly , that downward curving slope .
What ’s going on here is that when market yields fall ( moving to the left in the graph ) , average loan life in an MBS pool will shorten markedly , as borrowers are “ in the money ” to refinance .
At a relatively modest fall in market yields , the price of the MBS does increase ( but the increase is much less than the increase in the other bonds ) .
At a larger drop in market yields , the MBS price gets as high as it will ever get and then stops increasing at all .
What happens here is that the underlying mortgage loans have become so “ rate sensitive ” that any additional decrease in market yield ( increase in the spread between the bond ’s coupon of 6.00 % and current market coupons ) is entirely offset by shortened loan life : loans will pay off so fast at this point that this “ officially ” 30 - year bond really returns principal to the investor the way a 1 - year or even 6 - month Treasury bill would .
No investor is going to pay more for the MBS at this point than it would for the very shortest - term alternative .
On the other side of the graph , you see that the MBS price declines more slowly than the vanilla bonds , although its curvature at this point is very like the 10 - year .
At this side of the chart , average loan life is increasing .
( Mortgage bonds never go to zero prepayments or actual average loan life = 30 years . )
What all this implies is that , analytically , mortgages do have some sort of “ option price ” built in .
( There is actually a name for this , the OAS or Option Adjusted Spread , a method of comparing cash flows of a mortgage bond across multiple interest rate and prepayment scenarios .
It ’s heavy math and modeling . )
In the case of voluntary prepayment ( refinancing or selling your home , basically ) , your “ call ” option has , in fact , been priced — it ’s in the interest rate / fees you pay to get a refinanceable mortgage loan .
Investors accept the uncertainty of mortgage duration by ( attempting to ) price it in .
All that , however , is about trying to price the full return of principal ( which , in the case of a mortgage loan , is also the point at which interest payments cease ) .
It is n’t trying to model the return of less than outstanding principal , which is what the “ put ” or ruthless default is .
A refinancing borrower pays you back early at par .
A defaulting borrower pays you back early at less than par .
Standard MBS valuation models that were developed for GSE or Ginnie Mae securities ( that are guaranteed against credit loss ) do not “ worry ” about ruthless puts in terms of principal loss , since that loss is covered by the guarantor .
What is causing some trouble these days with the “ ruthless put ” in the prepayment models is simply that this is an unexpected source of prepayment that is n’t correlating with “ typical ” interest rate scenarios .
( We are seeing increased defaults in a very low - rate environment , because of the house price problem , which is n’t built into the prepayment models for guaranteed securities .
Historically , prepayment models “ expect ” non-negligible numbers of ruthless puts only in higher - rate environments . )
It may help you to understand that we have been talking about how an investor might price an MBS coupon , which is n’t the same thing as the interest rate on a loan .
In a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac MBS , the “ coupon ” or interest rate paid to the investor might be , say , 6.00 % .
That means that the weighted average interest rate on the underlying loans in the pool is substantially more than 6.00 % .
There is the bit that has to go to the servicer , and there ’s the bit that has to go to the GSE to offset the credit risk .
The mortgages must pay a high enough rate of interest to provide 6.00 % to the investor after the servicing and guarantee fees come off the top .
In essence , then , MBS traders set the “ current coupon ” or the coupon that trades at par , the GSEs set the guarantee fee and / or loan - level settlement fees that cover the credit risk , the servicer sets the required servicing fee , and all that adds up to the “ market rate ” for conforming mortgage loans ( plus mortgage insurance , if applicable , which is conceptually an offset to the guarantee fee ) .
One way of describing the situation we ’re currently in is that borrowers are continuing the short loan life of the boom ( which was made possible by easy refi money and hot RE markets ) by substituting jingle mail for refinancing .
That increases credit losses to whoever takes the credit loss ( the GSEs and the mortgage insurers ) , decreases servicer cash flow ( a refi substitutes a new fee - paying loan for the old loan ; a default substitutes a no - fee - payingfor the old loan ) , and makes everyone ’s prepayment models go whacky - looking .
This is one reason why it obviously was n’t a good time for MBS traders to be told they ’d be suddenly getting jumbos in their conforming pools ; at some level the response to that could be summed up as “ we do n’t need one more thing that defies analysis . ”
Ultimately , there is no way anyone can mobilize “ social acceptability ” as a defense against the ruthless put ( even if you wanted to ) .
The industry has , in fact , created the conditions in which it ’s rational , and as long as it ’s rational it will go on .
Just as it was rational to buy at 100 % LTV .
The only possible way to get back to an environment in which ruthless default is rare is to abandon the “ innovations ” that give rise to them : no - down financing , wish - fulfillment appraisals , underpriced investment property loans , etc .
The administration is currently pushing for increasing the FHA loan amounts and the FHA maximum LTV up to 100 % .
This is not likely to remove the incentive to take another reckless loan on a still - too - high - priced house .
If we are n’t going to ration credit with tighter guidelines and loan limits , then it will have to be rationed with pricing : eventually the models will “ solve ” the problem by increasing the costs of mortgage credit .
You cannot simply keep writing “ free puts . ”

LAS VEGAS , Dec. 8 --
The showdown had been billed and labeled as a potential fight of the year candidate .
Most mixed martial arts insiders figured the stylistic matchup between lightweights Roger Huerta and Clay Guida was a recipe for fireworks , a guarantee that fans would receive an early Christmas gift .
Both Huerta and Guida made the pundits look like experts .
In a fight that was as exhilarating as it was dramatic , once - beaten contender Huerta was forced to muster the strength of 10 tigers to score an unbelievable come - from - behind victory early in the third round .
For much of the contest -- check that :-- Huerta was bested by the grittier Guida , but the Mexican - American survived the scare , cleared his head and stormed out with his guns ablaze in the final round .
Guida had promised to bring the action , to make Huerta defend a relentless attack and keep the fan favorite on his back .
Guida stated that he'd do whatever it took to pummel Huerta , whether it would be strikes , submissions or simple ground and pound .
The Windy City fighter delivered on his promise , but for reasons nobody will truly understand , Guida could n't close the show despite dishing out a tremendous amount of punishment on the Sports Illustrated cover boy .
The two men locked horns immediately and never relented , each landing huge punches between slams and submission attempts .
Guida 's punches found their mark more frequently than did Huerta 's and though the Minnesotan continuously attempted subs , the Chicagoland native escaped them all and was able to hammer down furious barrages .
Late in the second , Guida tried once again to shoot in for a takedown but he bluffed , forcing Huerta to unnecessarily sprawl .
When Huerta dropped to his knees , Guida quickly closed the gap and unfurled a sinister right hand that hurt his opponent .
Guida , smelling blood and sensing a stunning stoppage , pounced all over the badly wounded Huerta and unloaded a hellish fury , almost sealing the deal .
Yet Huerta was somehow able to shake off the cobwebs and rode his guard until the bell sounded to end the second .
" I thought I had the first couple of rounds , " Guida said .
" And he came back .
He 's got a lot of heart -- that 's what it takes .
" With Huerta possibly losing the opening stanza and clearly dropping the second , it was obvious that he needed to let everything loose and gun for some sort of stoppage or at least a 10 - 8 round .
Once the third began , Huerta shot out of his corner and bombarded Guida , stunning him with several punches and a knee .
Guida was clearly rocked and in serious peril , but unlike his adversary , Clay would not survive the onslaught .
His bearings scrambled , Guida went down with Huerta on his back .
Sinking his hooks , Huerta secured a rear - naked choke just 31 seconds into the final round of an absolute war .
" I kept coming back , and kept fighting , " Huerta said .
" And that 's what everything is about man .
" Guida and Huerta delivered more than what most expected and the victor is clearly in the hunt for a shot at the UFC lightweight title , which will be contested for on Jan. 19 between B.J. Penn and Joe Stevenson
In the co-main event , seasoned veteran Mac Danzig firmly cemented his status as the best of the " The Ultimate Fighter 6 " welterweight cast as he quickly and easily dispatched relative newcomer Tom Speer in the first round .
Danzig scored an early takedown and utilized his immense experience en route to a rear - naked choke submission .
Speer was overmatched almost from the start and once Danzig secured the early takedown , Speer looked somewhat lost .
" He 's so big and so strong and he 's got such good wrestling , I knew I had to take him down , " Danzig said of the dairy farmer .
" That was kinda the game plan , to switch rolls on him and put him on his back .
That 's where I knew he'd be weakest .
" Danzig swarmed with a dizzying array of strikes and eventually seized the larger Speer 's back .
In a matter of moments , Danzig had sunk in the choke , forcing Speer to tap out .
" Mac , he deserves every bit of this , " Speer said .
" His experience showed .
" Danzig was the prohibitive favorite to be crowned the " champion " of the sixth season of Zuffa 's reality show and the Cleveland - born fighter proved why .
Danzig said after his victory that he planned on dropping back down to lightweight .
" That 's the toughest division in the sport , " he said .
In what was clearly the second best fight of the night ( and also a fight of the year candidate ) " War Machine " Jon Koppenhaver withstood too many furious barrages and massive exhaustion en route to a dramatic third round TKO over Jared Rollins
The two fighters stood toe - to - toe when they were on their feet and unleashed every possible form of attack when they were on the canvas , yet it was Koppenhaver 's miraculous out - of - nowhere sweep that led to the shocking stoppage .
Rollins badly wobbled and dropped Koppenhaver with a knee - punch combo and it seemed like the battered War Machine was toast , but when Rollins jumped into his opponent 's guard , it gave Koppenhaver a glimpse of survival .
Running on vapors only , Koppenhaver perfectly swept Rollins and immediately uncorked a series of crushing elbows and punches , knocking Rollins cold in the process .
The official time of the stoppage came at 2:01 of the third round , paving the way toward a potential rematch .
made quick work of Billy Miles as he submitted his opponent just 1:36 into the fight .
The Aussie quickly took the fight to the canvas and eventually secured a nifty rear naked choke .
Ben Saunders thwarted Dan Barrera once again , this time officially .
In what was the only fight Saturday at The Palms to go the distance , Saunders was awarded a unanimous decision victory via tallies of 30 - 27 ( twice ) and 29 - 28 .
The fight was competitive but not exactly a thrilling affair , though Saunders ' stand - up and submission attempts clearly won him the contest .
and Richie Hightower stood toe - to - toe for almost the entire first round , but " Rude Boy 's " punching power was too much for the colorful Hightower to handle .
Mandaloniz delivered a perfect straight left jab while Hightower launched a left hook and when Mandaloniz ' punch landed , Hightower crumbled to the canvas .
Mandaloniz pounced on the woozy Hightower and unloaded three bruising right hammer fists , ending the fight .
The official time of the knockout was 4:20 of the first .
It took him two guillotine and three armbar attempts , but Matt Arroyo finally forced opponent John Kolosci to tap out .
Kolosci showed a terrific ground defense game , but in the end , he could n't escape them all .
Arroyo was able to latch on perfect armbar at 4:42 of the opening round .
Roman Mitichyan , who was unable to actually fight on TUF 6 due to an injury , made quick work of Thai boxer Dorian Price , scoring a takedown and then ankle lock in just 23 seconds .
systematically broke down Paul Georgieff and wound up choking him completely out with a rear - naked choke .
The official time of the submission came at 4:42 of the first round and it signaled a terrific start to an excellent night of fights .
( CNN ) -- A New Zealand teenager has been questioned in connection with a scheme by hackers to remotely take over more than 1 million computers worldwide and use them for criminal activity , New Zealand police and the FBI said Thursday .
FBI Director Robert Mueller says botnets are " the weapon of choice for cyber criminals . "
The FBI has identified at least 2.5 million unsuspecting computer users who have been victims of so - called " botnet " activity .
Hackers install viruses , worms and other attack programs that allow them to take over the computers and use them to commit cyber crimes .
Industry numbers suggest there are as many as 5 million infected computers .
The FBI tracked down the teen and believes the 18 - year - old , known by the cyber alias " AKILL , " was the ringleader of an international botnet group know as the " A - team , " responsible for infecting more than 1 million computers .
Authorities seized computer equipment and questioned the teen , said New Zealand Police Detective Inspector Peter Devoy , but the person has not been identified , arrested or charged .
Watch how botnet attacks occur »
Internet addresses and information furnished by the FBI led to the teenager , Devoy told CNN .
" Today , botnets are the weapon of choice for cyber criminals , " said FBI Director Robert Mueller in a statement .
" They seek to conceal their criminal activities by using third - party computers as vehicles for their crimes . "
Personal computers can be compromised when users open an attachment , click on an advertisement or give personal information to a " phishing " site , or a fake site that looks legitimate .
The FBI advises users to protect themselves by updating their anti-virus software , installing a firewall , using non-common passwords and avoiding suspicious e-mail attachments and advertisers ' links .
In 2005 the FBI launched Operation Bot Roast to combat botnet attacks , which the bureau estimates have caused $ 20 million in losses and theft , including one scheme that bilked a Midwest financial institution out of millions .
Since June , eight people have been charged or convicted of crimes related to botnet activity .
Between January and June , Symantec Corp. , a leading computer security company , detected more than 5 million bot - infested personal computers carrying out at least one attack a day , according to the company 's September report .
That was a 17 percent decrease form the previous reporting period , according to Symantec , which said hackers appeared to be abandoning the technique because of strengthened security and law enforcement initiatives .
China had the most infected computers at 29 percent , followed by the United States at 13 percent , Symantec reported .
However , 43 percent of the servers used by hackers to operate the hijacked computers were located in the United States , Symantec said .

( CNN ) --
A powerful earthquake hit off the coast of Indonesia 's Sumatra island Monday afternoon , the U.S. Geological Survey 's Web site reported .
The quake was centered about 100 miles ( 160 km ) south - southwest of Padang and had a magnitude of 7.3 , making it a major earthquake .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a local tsunami watch .
It 's the fifth quake registering 5.0 or above to hit the area in the last 24 hours , and it comes four days after another major quake registering 7.5 in magnitude shook the region , killing three people .
That quake 's epicenter was also located off the Sumatran coast , about 300 to 400 miles south of where Sunday 's and Monday 's quakes registered .

It 's fitting , in a way , that a service that bills itself as " the world 's first free and legal peer - to - peer music service " does n't offer a single song .
Qtrax , the service in question , claimed last week to have deals in place with all four major labels to offer a free , ad - supported music service .
Qtrax admitted Monday that it lacks active deals with any of them , which might explain the total absence of downloadable songs on the service .
A quick test Monday revealed that the songs listed in Qtrax 's slick , Songbird - based interface cannot be downloaded , putting the service in more or less the same holding pattern it 's been in for four and a half years : waiting for label approval .
Download the Qtrax player , and you 'll be able to play the songs youalready own .
You 'll also see songs in the massive , over - 25 - million - songcatalog that Qtrax claims it will offer soon .
When – if ever – you 'llbe able to download those tunes from Qtrax remains to be seen .
Three of the four major labels confirmed on Monday that negotiations were ongoing , although neither they nor Qtrax would discuss the status of those negotiations .
The Big Four major labels have licensed other free , ad - supported services ( imeem , Last.fm , SpiralFrog ) ,
so Qtrax 's misleading launch announcement seemed plausible enough overthe weekend .
But , pending licensing deals the company says are coming " shortly , upon final execution of all pertinent contracts , " songscannot be downloaded from the service .
So was Qtrax 's announcement some sort of sick joke ?
Why did the company claim that the deals were in place ?
One answer lies in the massive amount of media attention garnered bythe announcement .
( Regrettably , I was an unwitting participant :
In thefuture , when a company claims to have deals with all four major labels ,
I 'll make at least four phone calls before writing a single word . )
But there are shreds of truth to Qtrax 's claims , despite itsconfounding launch strategy .
The company has signed deals with majorlabels in the past .
In one case ( EMI ) , the deal expired before thelaunch announcement , and in another ( Sony / BMG ) , the deal only coveredlimited - play downloads , not the unlimited - listening downloads Qtraxclaimed it would offer .
And in some cases , Qtrax has deals withpublishers allowing it to make and distribute copies of songs , butlacks deals with labels that would allow users to hear them .
Is n't copyright law great ?
Qtrax maintains that the labels will sign their contractssoon , and that users can expect to receive activation keys shortly thatwill allow downloading to begin .
We shall see .
Until then , Qtrax isjust another music playback program , albeit one developed by a companywith a questionable grip on reality .

The treatment could kill viruses while preserving human cells
Current ultraviolet light laser treatments can kill micro-organisms - but cannot be used in humans as they would also damage cells in the body .
But using infrared femtosecond lasers with carefully selected wavelengths , a US team targeted viruses and bacteria without harming other cells .
The Arizona research is reported in the Journal of Physics : Condensed Matters .
The technology is called Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering ( ISRS ) .
It produces lethal vibrations in the protein coat of micro-organisms , thereby destroying them .
The effect of the vibrations is similar to that of high - pitched noise shattering glass .
However , the line of attack can be perfected so that the proteins which coat human cells remain unaffected .
So far experiments have been done on E. coli bacterial cells , Tobacco Mosaic Virus cells , as well as human and hamster cells .
After several attempts , the researchers found a level which " inactivates both viruses and bacteria while leaving sensitive materials such as mammalian cells unharmed " .
Lead researcher Professor Kong - Thon Tsen , of Arizona State University , said : " The research so far suggests that ISRS will be ready for use in disinfection and could provide treatments against some of the worst , often drug - resistant , bacterial and viral pathogens . "
Dr Jean - Yves Maillard , senior lecturer in pharmaceutical microbiology at Cardiff University , said : " This is quite an interesting technology but it's at a very preliminary stage and any application in humans is a long way off . "
♣ SAN DIEGO , December 24th
It 's The Night Before Christmas , and I just received word that San Diego County 's own 20 - foot long “ Ron Paul Micro - Blimp ” is now floating serenely in the vicinity of Grossmont College , El Cajon .
Elizabeth Blane , the recently persuaded ( and already active ! )
Ron Paul supporter I told you about a few days back ( see original story about the micro - blimp here , ) told me this :
“ YES !
It is up !
If you drive south on 125 , you will see it flying at the Grossmont College offramp . ”
For those of you who may not be familiar with the San Diego area , this is an excellent high - traffic location ( <- click for a map ) immediately adjacent to a major freeway .
Elizabeth additionally had this to say :
“ Thank you everyone for your generous donations and encouragement !
Together we are powerful !
Think of how many years Ron Paul stood alone in front of congress and voted his lonely “ no ” votes again and again and he never gave up !
What a man !
Let 's make him proud ! ”
This writer is personally encouraged to note that Elizabeth first heard Dr. Paul 's powerful message of Freedom less than two months ago .
She found the message so clear and compelling that she has responded with immediate and creative action .
Many thousands of San Diegans now have some of the exposure to Ron Paul 's name that establishment media has so egregiously denied them .
As have others , many more will now have the opportunity to see , hear , embrace , and take action for Liberty .
How fitting it is that the message of Ron Paul , a Most Noble candidate for office , is being held aloft by the noble gas helium !
Thanks so much Elizabeth !
Thank you , San Diegan Ron Paul supporters , who have already paid in full the cost of this “ Blimpette ” as well as the cost of the helium to loft it !
For those of you inspired to do something similar in your neighborhood , here are a couple of possible sources of Ron Paul Micro - Blimps :

Also please be mindful of supporting the full - sized and very costly Ron Paul Blimp with your advertising dollars – remember , these expenses are not counted against your FEC campaign expenditure limit of $ 2300 !
Viva la rEVOLution !

THE SIX POSTULATES OF EQUIVALENCE
PERSPECTIVE
Perspective is how objects appear in relation to other objects , and the effect it can have on the image is dramatically demonstrated with these examples .
For a given scene and framing , perspective is a function only of the position the photo was taken from .
A good way to think of perspective is to consider two objects , one 10 ft from the camera , the other 30 ft from the camera .
If both objects are in the frame with the subject being the closer object , and we shoot at 50 mm from 10 ft away , then the further object is three times as far away as the subject .
If , however , we step back another 10 ft and use 100 mm so that the subject is framed the same , then , if the the further object is even still in the frame , the subject will be 20 ft away and the other object 40 ft away -- only twice as far .
Conversely , if we get twice as close and frame use 25 mm for the same framing of the subject , now the subject is 5 ft away , and the other object is 25 feet away -- five times as far .
Not only does the subject - camera distance change the perspective by changing the relative distances of subjects within the frame , it also changes , in a similar fashion , how widely separated they are in the frame .
In fact , when we use a longer perspective , we will often find that much of what was in the frame of a closer perspective is now outside the frame ( the tree photos here are an excellent example of this ) .
Inasmuch as the scene as a whole matters , rather than simply the actual subject , perspective can be one of the most striking elements of a photograph .
FRAMING
For a given perspective , the framing can be thought of as the whole of the captured scene , and is synonymous with the FOV ( field of view ) , which is a combination of the horizontal and vertical AOV ( angle of view ) .
Unless otherwise specified , the term " AOV " refers to the diagonal AOV .
The distinction between AOV and FOV need not be made when systems share the same aspect ratio , but the greater the difference in aspect ratios , the more important the distinction between the terms .
In addition , it is important to note that the focal length ( and f- ratio ) marked on a lens is for infinity focus ( magnification , m , is equal to zero ) .
As the magnification increases ( subject - camera distance decreases ) , both the AOV and f-ratio will increase in the same proportion , which is an especially important point for macro , and near macro , photography , and discussed further down .
We can compute the horizontal , vertical , and diagonal AOVs for infinity focus with the following formula : AOV = 2 · tan - 1 [ s / [ ( 2 · FL ) ] where AOV = angle of view ( degrees )
s = sensor dimension ( mm )
FL = focal length ( mm ) For example , the diagonal , horizontal , and vertical AOV for infinity focus ( m=0 ) on 35 mm FF at 50 mm is : Diagonal AOV for 50 mm on 35 mm FF = 2 · tan - 1 [ 43.3 mm / ( 2 · 50 mm ) ] ~ 47°
Horizontal AOV for 50 mm on 35 mm FF = 2 · tan - 1 [ 36 mm / ( 2 · 50 mm ) ] ~ 40
°
Vertical AOV for 50 mm on 35 mm FF = 2 · tan - 1 [ 24 mm / ( 2 · 50 mm ) ]
~ 27° Solving the AOV formula for focal length , we have : FL = s / [ 2 · tan ( AOV / 2 ) ]
Let 's now compute the focal length for 35 mm FF , 1.5x , 1.6x , and 4/3 for a diagonal AOV of 47 ° at infinity ( m=0 ) : FL for FF = 43.3 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 47 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 50 mm
FL for 1.5x = 28.4 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 47 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 33mm
FL for 1.6x = 26.7 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 47 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 31mm
FL for 4/3 = 21.6 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 47 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 25 mm
Note that these focal lengths are all proportional to the sensor ratio : 50 mm / 1.5 ~ 33mm
50 mm / 1.6 ~ 31mm
50 mm / 2 ~ 25 mm
Now we 'll repeat for a horizontal AOV of 40 ° at infinity ( m=0 ) : FL for FF = 36 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 40 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 50 mm
FL for 1.5x = 23.7 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 40 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 33mm
FL for 1.6x = 22.2 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 40 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 31mm
FL for 4/3 = 17.3 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 40 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 24 mm
Once again , we see these are proportional to the sensor ratio : 50 mm / 1.5 ~ 33mm
50 mm / 1.6 ~ 31mm
50 mm / 2.08 ~ 24 mm
And for a vertical AOV of 27 ° at infinity ( m=0 ) : FL for FF = 24 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 27 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 50 mm
FL for 1.5x = 15.7 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 27 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 33mm
FL for 1.6x = 14.8 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 27 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 31mm
FL for 4/3 = 13 mm / [ 2 · tan ( 27 ° / 2 ) ] ~ 27 mm
And , again , these focal lengths are proportional to the sensor ratio : 50 mm / 1.5 ~ 33mm
50 mm / 1.6 ~ 31mm
50 mm / 1.85 ~ 27 mm
The effective focal length ( EFL ) of the lens for a subject at a distance d ( mm ) from the aperture is given by : EFL = FL · ( 1 + m / p ) where m = image magnification ( ratio of the height of the image on the sensor to the height of the actual object )
p = pupil magnification ( the ratio of the diameter of the exit pupil to the diameter of the entrance pupil ) Symmetric lenses have equal entrance pupil and exit pupil diameters .
Thus , p=1 for a symmetric lens and we can disregard it .
Normal lenses tend to be closer to symmetric designs , as a general rule , longer lenses tend to have larger entrance pupils than exit pupil , thus p < 1 ( progressively smaller the longer the lens ) , and wider lenses ( especially retrofocal ) are the opposite , with p> 1 .
The following table demonstrates the effect of focal distance on the EFL of a symmetric 50 mm lens ( p=1 ) : Magnification EFL for a symmetric 50 mm lens 1 : ∞ m = 0 50 mm 1 : 20 m = 0.05 52.5 mm 1 : 10 m = 0.1 55 mm 1 : 5 m = 0.2 60 mm 1 : 3 m = 0.33 67 mm 1 : 2 m = 0.5 75 mm 1 : 1 m = 1 100mm
A useful relationship between focal length , sensor size , subject to aperture distance , and the height or width of the focal plane in the photo is : EFL / d = s / ( s + h ) where all variables below are given in mm ( 1 m = 1000 mm , 1 ft = 304.8 mm ) EFL = effective focal length
s = sensor dimension ( sensor height for landscape orientation , sensor length for portrait orientation -- given in the table just a bit further down )
d = distance to subject
h = height of frame
For low magnifications , the formula reduces to : FL / d ≈ s / h
For example , let 's say we have a landscape oriented photo of a model who is 5 ' 8 " ( 1727 mm ) tall , takes up 2/3 of the frame from bottom to top , and wish to know what distance the model was from the camera if taken on FF with an 85 mm lens .
The calculation is as follows : 85 / d = 24 / ( 1727 / ⅔ ) → d = 9175 mm = 30 ft. Listed below are tables of common ERs ( equivalence ratios -- crop factors ) in relation to 35 mm FF for images using the same AOV ( see here for a more complete list ) .
When given in stops , the ER is rounded to the nearest 1/3 stop .
The reason that 35 mm FF ( 24 mm x 36 mm ) is chosen as a standard is due to its popularity in the days of film and the fact that there are more lenses made for this particular format which many of the smaller sensor DSLRs also use , but we can use any format as a reference .
Due to different aspect ratios , when cropping to the dimensions of the more square sensor , we use the ratio of the shorter dimensions of the sensor to compute the ER , and when cropping to the dimensions of the more elongated sensor , we use the ratio of the longer sensor dimensions .
In the case of 3:2 being cropped to 4:3 , or vice - versa , this will result in less than a 1/3 stop difference .
One side effect of cropping 3:2 images to 4:3 is that it greatly mitigates any softness that might show in the extreme corners .
However , we must also realize that this comes at the expense of removing 1/9 of the pixels from the image .
But as 3:2 systems generally have more pixels than 4:3 systems of the same generation , this can be done without any detail penalty when comparing systems .
Realistically , however , the extreme corners make up so little of the image , and are so close between systems anyway at the same DOF that it is only a consideration for the most hardcore of " pixel - peepers " .
Please see this image as an example of what would be called a " huge " difference in the corners of different systems at the same DOF .
I simply see it as a non-issue , especially considering that the differences elsewhere in the frame matter more by far , but others see it as a serious disadvantage .
In any event , framing slightly wider and cropping to 4:3 will basically eliminate even that extreme case .

Rather than relate to an arbitrary standard , such as 35 mm FF , the ER between any two systems using the lengths of their respective sensors , or , more simply , either divide the ERs of the respective systems , or subtract their sensor ratios when using stops , using the values in the table above .
For example , the SR between a Canon 40D and Olympus E3 can be computed ( for the same AOV ) as 2.00 / 1.62 ~ 1.23 ( 2/3 of a stop to the nearest 1/3 stop , or , more simply : 2 stops - 1 1/3 stops = 2/3 of a stop ) .
Thus , 25 mm f/2 ISO 100 on 4/3 would have the same AOV , DOF , and shutter speed as 31 mm f/ 2.5 ISO 160 on 1.6x , since 25 mm x 1.23 ~ 31 mm , f/2 x 1.23 ~ f/2.5 , and ISO 100 x 1.23 ² ~ ISO 160 ( or , alternatively , f/2 + 2/3 stops = f/2.5 and ISO 100 + 2/3 stops = ISO 160 ) .
DOF / Diffraction / Total Amount of Light on the Sensor The DOF , diffraction , and total amount of light projected on the sensor are all intimately related to the aperture diameter .
This section will begin by discussing DOF , followed by a discussion on diffraction .
The discussion on the total amount of light projected on the sensor is a different section , Exposure , Lightness , and Total Light .
The DOF ( depth of field ) is the distance between the near and far points from the focal plane that appear to be in critical focus and is a central player in the amount of detail rendered in an image .
It is also important not to confuse DOF with background blur ( which is discussed further down ) .
Photos with : the same perspective ( subject - camera distance )
the same framing
the same aperture diameter
the same display size
the same viewing distance
viewed with the same visual acuity will have the same DOF ( and diffraction ) .
Alternatively , photos with : the same perspective ( subject - camera distance )
equivalent focal lengths
equivalent relative apertures
using the equivalent CoC will also have the same DOF ( and diffraction ) .
Note that neither number of pixels nor the size of the pixels figure into the CoC at all , except inasmuch as the size we display a photo depends on the size and / or number of pixels that make up the photo , such as when viewing 100 % crops on a computer monitor .
The mathematics demonstrating the equivalencies is worked out a bit further down -- do try to contain your excitement ! ; )
Moving right along , only an infinitesimally small portion of the image is actually in focus ( the focal plane ) , but as our eyes and brain cannot see with infinite precision , the focal plane is perceived to have some depth .
As we enlarge the image , we can more clearly see that less and less of the image is within focus , and this is how the DOF changes with enlargement .
Of course , no lens is perfect , so the focal plane is not a plane at all , but rather a surface .
In some instances , the curvature of the focal plane ( field curvature ) can be extreme enough that what appears to be edge softness is actually a flat surface falling outside the focal " plane " .
In addition , the focus falloff is gradual -- the closer elements in the scene are to the focal surface , the sharper they will appear .
The DOF is the depth from an ideal focal plane in which we consider elements of the scene to be " sharp enough " .
The number of pixels , or sharpness of the lens , on the other hand , have nothing to do with DOF .
These are independent factors in the sharpness of the photo -- a low resolution image displayed with large dimensions does not necessarily have low DOF -- the blur is a result of the lower resolution .
The difference between the blur due to limited DOF and the blur due to other factors ( soft lens , low pixel count , camera shake , diffraction , etc. ) is that these other sources of blur affect the entire photo equally , whereas the blur associated with shallow DOF will be greater for the portions of the scene further from the focal plane .
Blur do to motion , of course , will selectively affect objects that have the greatest relative motion in the frame ( that is , a slow moving object close to the camera may have greater blur than a fast moving object far from the camera ) and blur due to field curvature will increase as we move away from the focal point , which in many cases may mimic a more shallow DOF .
Most , if not all , online DOF calculators ( as well as DOF tables ) are based on " standard viewing conditions " of an 8x10 inch photo ( or any photo displayed with a 12.8 inch -- 325 mm -- diagonal ) viewed from a distance of 10 inches with 20 - 20 vision .
Change any of those parameters ( and please note that the pixel size is not one of the parameters ) , and you 'll change the DOF ( although , for example , if you double both the display dimensions and the viewing distance , these two effects will cancel each other out ) , and these parameters are accounted for with the CoC ( circle of confusion ) in the DOF formula(s ) .
Let 's compute the CoC for the " standard viewing conditions " with FF , APS-C , and mFT ( 4/3 ) : Viewing distance = ( 10 in ) · ( 2.54 cm / in ) = 25 cm
( 2.54 cm / in ) = 25 cm Final image resolution for 20 - 20 vision with a viewing distance of 10 in ( 25 cm ) = 5 lp / mm
Enlargement : 325 mm / 43.3 mm = 7.5 for FF , 325 mm / 28.4 mm = 11.4 for 1.5x , 325 mm / 26.8 mm = 12.1 for 1.6x , and 325 mm / 21.6 mm = 15 for mFT ( 4/3 ) Plugging into the CoC Formula , CoC ( mm ) = viewing distance ( cm ) / desired final - image resolution ( lp / mm ) for a 25 cm viewing distance / enlargement / 25 , we get : FF : CoC = ( 25 cm ) / ( 5 lp / mm ) / 7.5 / 25 = 0.027 mm
1.5x : CoC = ( 25 cm ) / ( 5 lp / mm ) / 11.4 / 25 = 0.018 mm
1.6x : CoC = ( 25 cm ) / ( 5 lp / mm ) / 12.1 / 25 = 0.017 mm
mFT : CoC = ( 25 cm ) / ( 5 lp / mm ) / 15 / 25 = 0.013 mm
Let 's compute one more example for the CoC using a 20x30 inch photo viewed from 2 ft away with 20 - 20 vision taken with a FF camera ( 24 mm x 36 mm sensor ) : Viewing distance = ( 2 ft ) · ( 12 in / ft ) · ( 2.54 cm / in ) = 61 cm
( 12 in / ft ) ( 2.54 cm / in ) = 61 cm Final image resolution for 20 - 20 vision = 5 lp / mm
Enlargement = ( 30 in x 25.4 mm / in ) / 36 mm = 21.2 Plugging into the CoC Formula , CoC ( mm ) = viewing distance ( cm ) / desired final - image resolution ( lp / mm ) for a 25 cm viewing distance / enlargement / 25 , we get CoC = ( 61 cm ) / ( 5 lp / mm ) / ( 21.2 ) / 25 = 0.023 mm , which is what we would expect , since viewing a 20x30 inch photo at 2 ft is equivalent to viewing a 8.3x12.5 inch photo at 10 inches ( very close to " standard viewing conditions " ) .
More simply , however , there is the Zeiss Formula for calculating the CoC , which is simply the sensor diagonal divided by 1730 .
In the examples worked above , it comes out to the same as if we used the sensor diagonal divided by 1600 : FF : CoC = 43.3 mm / 1600 = 0.027 mm ( Zeiss : 43.3 mm / 1730 = 0.025 mm )
1.5x : CoC = 28.4 mm / 1600 = 0.018 mm ( Zeiss : 28.4 mm / 1730 = 0.016 mm )
1.6x : CoC = 26.8 mm / 1600 = 0.017 mm ( Zeiss : 26.8 mm / 1730 = 0.015 mm )
mFT : CoC = 21.6 mm / 1600 = 0.013 mm ( Zeiss : 21.6 mm / 1730 = 0.012 mm )
In any case , what this demonstrates is that the CoC is proportional to the sensor diagonal for a given display size , viewing distance , and visual acuity and independent of the pixel count .
A popular online DOF calculator , DOFMaster , uses sensor diagonal / 1400 for the CoC .
This online calculator allows you select the CoC ; however , for comparative purposes across formats , the CoC will scale by the equivalence ratio ( crop factor ) .
On the other hand , the DOF formulas do not include how closely we scrutinize a photo .
In other words , two photos might have the same DOF per the mathematical formulas , but if we scrutinize one photo more closely than another ( perhaps it is more interesting , for example ) , then the DOFs may appear different :
Scrutinizing one image more critically than another has the same effect as looking at that image with a higher visual acuity than the another .
However , for two photos of the same scene displayed at the same size and viewed from the same distance that have the same computed DOF , then whatever the subjective impression of the DOF is for one photo , it will be the same for the other photo ( although , as discussed above , it 's easy to confuse " blurry " with " less DOF " ) .
As the DOF deepens , more of the image is rendered sharply , both because more of the image is within the DOF , and because the aberrations of the lens lessens as the aperture gets smaller -- up to a point .
Depending on the sensor pixel size and display size of an image , the effects of diffraction softening will begin to degrade the sharpness of the image more than the deeper DOF and lesser aberrations increase the sharpness .
However , the point diffraction softening outweighs a deeper DOF and lesser aberrations depends tremendously upon the scene and the lens sharpness .
It is common to read about " diffraction limited apertures " , but these are based on a " perfect " lens and images where the whole of the scene lies within the DOF .
In other words , it is quite common to achieve a sharper and more detailed image that is past the " diffraction limited " aperture due to the deeper DOF including more of the scene .
At the opposite end of the DOF spectrum , shallow DOFs serve to isolate the subject from the background .
However , while a more shallow DOF does lead to a greater background blur , it is not the only , or , in many instances , even the major player in the quantity of background blur , much in the same way that many confuse the bokeh ( the quality of the out - of - focus areas of an image ) with the quantity of the blur .
For example , if the subject is 10 ft from the camera , 50 mm f/ 2 will have the same framing and DOF on the same format as 100 mm f / 2 for a subject 20 ft away .
That is , the same distance from the focal plane will be considered to be in critical focus .
But the nature of the background blur will be very different -- the longer focal length will magnify the background blur .
In fact , we can be more specific .
The amount of background blur ( assuming the background is well outside the DOF ) is proportional to the ratio of the aperture diameters .
For example , while the DOF for 50 mm f / 2 and 100 mm f / 2 will be the same for the same framing ( in most circumstances ) , the background blur will be double for 100 mm f / 2 since the aperture diameter is twice as large for 100 mm f / 2 than for 50 mm f/2 ( 100 mm / 2 = 50 mm , 50 mm / 2 = 25 mm ) .
A good tutorial on this can be found here and here is an excellent blur calculator / demonstrator .
We can now make the following generalizations about the DOF of images on different formats for non-macro situations ( when the subject distance is " large " compared to the focal length ) , keeping in mind that aperture diameter = focal length / f-ratio , and assuming that all images are viewed from the same distance with the same visual acuity :
For the same perspective , framing , relative aperture , and display size , larger sensor systems will yield a more shallow DOF than smaller sensors in proportion to the ratio of the sensor sizes .
For the same perspective , framing , aperture diameter , and display size , all systems have the same DOF .
If both formats use the same focal length and relative aperture ( and thus also the same aperture diameter ) , but the larger sensor system gets closer so that the subject occupies the same area of the frame , and the photos are displayed at the same dimensions , then the larger sensor system will have a more shallow DOF in proportion to ratio of the sensor sizes .
For the same perspective and focal length , larger sensor systems will have a wider framing .
If the same relative aperture is used , then both systems will also have the same aperture diameter .
As a result , if the photo from the larger sensor system is displayed at a larger size in proportion to ratio of the sensor sizes , or the photo from the larger sensor system is cropped to the same framing as the image from the smaller sensor system and displayed at the same size , then the two photos will have the same DOF .
Let 's give examples for each scenario using mFT ( 4/3 ) , 1.6x , and FF ( forgive me for leaving out 1.5x , as it is so close to 1.6 x as to be all but redundant to use for the purpose of examples , as I am repeating the process several times ) .
As noted earlier , the condition of " same display size " only requires the same diagonal length , rather than the same length and width .
This distinction is unnecessary when the systems have the same aspect ratio , but can sometimes be a factor when the aspect ratios are not the same ( for example , if we display a photo with a 15 inch diagonal , then a 4:3 photo would be 9 x 12 inches and a 3:2 photo would be 8.3 x 12.5 inches ) .
In all cases , we assume the same viewing distance and visual acuity : Let 's say we are taking a photo of a subject 10 ft away , and use 40 mm f /2.8 on mFT ( 4/3 ) , 50 mm f/2.8 on 1.6x , and 80 mm f/2.8 on FF .
All will have the same perspective , since the subject - camera distance is the same , and all will have the same AOV , since 40 mm x 2 = 50 mm x 1.6 = 80 mm .
Since all are using f/2.8 , then if we display the photos at the same size , FF will have the least DOF , 1.6 x will have 1.6 x more DOF than FF , and mFT ( 4/3 ) will have the twice the DOF of FF ( 1.25 x more DOF than 1.6x ) .
Again , let 's say we are taking a photo of a subject 10 ft away , but this time use 40 mm f / 4 on mFT ( 4/3 ) , 50 mm f/5 on 1.6x , and 80 mm f/8 on FF .
Once again , all will have the same perspective since the subject - camera distances are the same , and all will have the same AOV since 40 mm x 2 = 50 mm x 1.6 = 80 mm .
The aperture diameters will also be the same since 40 mm / 4 = 50 mm / 5 = 80 mm / 8 = 10 mm .
In this case , all photos will have the same DOF when displayed at the same dimensions .
This time , let 's shoot the subject from 20 ft at 40 mm f /4 on mFT ( 4/3 ) , 16 ft at 40 mm f / 4 on 1.6x , and 10 ft at 40 mm f / 4 on FF .
While the perspectives are different ( since the subject - camera distances are not the same ) , the AOVs are the same since 20 ft / 2 = 16 ft / 1.6 = 10 ft , but FF will have the most shallow DOF , 1.6 x will have a DOF 1.6 x deeper , and mFT ( 4/3 ) will double the DOF .
We now shoot the same subject from 10 ft away with all formats , but this time use the same focal length and same f-ratio as well ( for example , 50 mm f / 2.8 ) .
If we display the mFT ( 4/3 ) photo with a 12 inch diagonal , the 1.6 x photo with a 15 inch diagonal , and the FF photo with a 24 inch diagonal , and view the images from the same distance , then all will have the same DOF .
Note how the diagonals correspond to the focal multipliers of the respective systems : 12 in x 2 = 15 in x 1.6 = 24 in , which means that if we cropped the photos to the same framing , they would all be the same dimensions .
Let 's now demonstrate the DOF equivalence mathematically .
As stated earlier , the DOF is the distance from the focal plane where objects in this zone are considered to be critically sharp .
However , the distance from the focal plane is not always an even split .
When the subject distance ( d ) is " large " compared to the focal length of the lens ( non-macro distances ) , the far limit of critical focus ( d f ) , near limit of critical focus ( d n ) , and DOF can be computed as : d f ~ [ H · d ] / [ H - d ]
d n ~ [ H · d ] / [ H + d ]
DOF = d f - d n ~ [ 2 · H · d² ] / [ H² - d² ] where d is the distance to the subject and H is the hyperfocal distance .
We can now compute the DOF behind the subject and the DOF in front of the subject : DOF behind = d f - d = d² / [ H - d ]
DOF in front = d - d n = d² / [ H + d ]
Note that the smaller the subject - camera distance ( d ) becomes in comparison to the hyperfocal distance ( H ) , the more evenly the DOF is split in front and behind the subject , since ( H - d ) and ( H + d ) are nearly equal for values of d that are small compared to H .
In other words , the common wisdom that 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and 2/3 of the DOF is behind the subject is not always true .
This " rule " is valid when only when the subject - camera distance , d , is equal to 1/ 3 the hyperfocal distance , H . As the subject distance changes from that particular value , the 1/3 - 2/3 DOF split becomes a progressively less accurate description of the split of the DOF in front and behind the subject .
In another scenario , it is also interesting to note that as subject distance approaches the hyperfocal distance , the far distance of critical focus approaches infinity , and the near distance of critical focus approaches half the hyperfocal distance , thus giving infinite DOF beyond half the hyperfocal distance .
Another interesting scenario to consider is that when the subject - camera distance , d , is small compared to the hyperfocal distance , H , then , for the same format , the DOF will be essentially the same for the same framing and f-ratio .
For example , 50 mm at 10 ft has the same framing as 100 mm at 20 ft on 35 mm FF .
If we shoot the scene at f / 2 in each case , we will get the same DOF since the hyperfocal distance is 137 ft for a CoC of 0.03 mm ( the value used in most DOF calculators for 35 mm FF , which corresponds to an 8x10 inch print viewed from a distance of 10 inches ) , which is much larger than the subject distance of 10 ft .
However , were we instead to compare 24 mm f /2 at 30 ft to 48 mm f /2 at 60 ft ( same framing ) , we would get a different DOF since the hyperfocal distance works out to 30 ft ( for a CoC of 0.03 mm ) , which is the same , rather than much larger , than the subject - camera distance .
In any case , we can see that the DOF is a function only of the hyperfocal distance ( H ) and the subject distance ( d ) .
The role of the focal length ( FL ) , f-ratio ( f ) , and CoC ( c ) are contained in the hyperfocal distance : H ~ FL² / ( f · c )
If we scale the focal length , f-ratio , and CoC by the equivalence ratio ( R ) , the hyperfocal distance remains the same : H' ~ ( FL·R ) ² / [ ( f · R ) · ( c · R ) ] = [ FL² · R² ] / [ ( f · c ) · R² ] = FL² / ( f · c ) = H Consequently the DOF is invariant for the same perspective , framing , and aperture diameter .
By expressing H in terms of aperture diameter ( a ) , angle of view ( AOV ) , and the proportion of the sensor diagonal that the CoC covers ( p ) , we get a format independent expression for the hyperfocal distance , and consequently DOF : H ~ a / [ 2 ·p·tan ( AOV /2 ) ]
Thus , for non-macro situations , the DOF for the same perspective , framing , and output size is also the same .
A consequence of a larger sensor means that a longer focal length is required for the same perspective and framing , as well as a larger f-ratio to obtain the same aperture diameter .
For example , let 's consider images taken of the same scene from the same position with the same framing : A7R2 at 80 mm , f/8 ( aperture diameter = 80 mm / 8 = 10 mm )
D500 at 53 mm , f/5 ( aperture diameter = 53 mm / 5 ~ 10 mm )
80D at 50 mm , f/5 ( aperture diameter = 50 mm / 5 = 10 mm )
EM1.2 at 40 mm , f/4 ( aperture diameter = 40 mm / 4 = 10 mm )
Since the perspective , framing , and aperture diameters are all the same , then for the same display size and viewing distance , their DOFs will also be the same .
As a side , if the shutter speeds are also the same ( which will require a higher ISO for the higher f-ratios to maintain the same lightness ) , then the images will be made with the same total amount of light as well , which will result in the same relative noise if the sensors have the same efficiency .
Another reason that DOF is so important , even if DOF , per se , is not an issue to the photographer , is that it is also intimately connected with sharpness , diffraction softening , and vignetting .
The reason that DOF affects sharpness is twofold .
First of all , as shown above , the DOF is directly related to the aperture , and the larger the aperture diameter , the greater the aberrations , and , in some instances , the greater the field curvature .
Secondly , a more shallow DOF means that less of the scene will be within the DOF , and , by definition , elements of the scene outside the DOF will not be sharp .
This second point is especially important , since , as noted earlier , DOF calculators usually base their calculations off a CoC for an 8x10 print viewed from 10 inches away .
Since so many now evaluate the sharpness of the lens on the basis of 100 % crops on a computer monitor , the DOF that is seen at 100 % on the computer screen is significantly more narrow than the DOF computed by the calculators .
In addition to DOF and sharpness , the aperture is also intimately connected to diffraction .
Diffraction softening is the result of the wave nature of light representing point sources as disks ( known as Airy Disks ) , and is most definitely not , as is misunderstood by many , an effect of light " bouncing off " the aperture blades .
The diameter of the Airy Disk is a function of both the f-ratio and the wavelength of light : d ~ 2.44 · λ·f , where d is the diameter of the Airy Disk , λ is the wavelength of the light , and f is the relative aperture .
Larger relative aperture ( deeper DOFs ) result in larger disks , as do longer wavelengths of light ( towards the red end of the visible spectrum ) so not all colors will suffer from diffraction softening equally .
The wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum differ by approximately a factor of two , so that means , for example , that red light will suffer around twice the amount of diffraction softening as blue light .
Diffraction softening is unavoidable at any aperture , and worsens as the lens is stopped down .
However , other factors mask the effects of the increasing diffraction softening : the increasing DOF and the lessening lens aberrations .
As the DOF increases , more and more of the photo is rendered " in focus " , making the photo appear sharper .
In addition , as the aperture narrows , the aberrations in the lens lessen since more of the aperture is masked by the aperture blades .
For wide apertures , the increasing DOF and lessening lens aberrations far outweigh the effects of diffraction softening .
At small apertures , the reverse is true .
In the interim ( often , but not always , around a two stop interval ) , the two effects roughly cancel each other out , and the balance point for the edges typically lags behind the balance point for the center by around a stop ( the edges usually suffer greater aberrations than the center ) .
In fact , it is not uncommon for diffraction softening to be dominant right from wide open for lenses slower than f /5.6 equivalent on FF , and thus these lenses are sharpest wide open ( for the portions of the scene within the DOF , of course ) .
The optimum DOF is often more a matter of artistic intent than resolved detail .
Clearly , more shallow DOFs have less of the scene within critical focus , but this is by design .
What is not by design is that , at very wider apertures , lens aberrations reduce the detail even for the portions of the scene within the DOF , so even if the photographer prefers the more shallow DOF , they may choose to stop down simply to render more detail where detail is important .
Likewise , while a photographer may stop down with the intent to get as much of the scene as possible within the DOF so as to have a more detailed photo overall , portions of the scene that were within the DOF at wider apertures will become softer due to the effects of diffraction .
Thus , the photographer must balance the increase in detail gained by bringing more of the scene within the DOF against detail lost for portions of the scene that were within the DOF at wider apertures .
In addition , deeper DOFs require smaller apertures , which means either longer shutter speeds ( increasing the risk / amount of motion blur and / or camera shake ) or greater noise since less light will fall on the sensor at more narrow apertures for a given shutter speed .
A common myth is that smaller pixels suffer more from diffraction than larger pixels .
On the contrary , for a given sensor size and lens , smaller pixels always result in more detail .
That said , as we stop down and the DOF deepens , we reach a point where we begin to lose detail due to diffraction softening .
As a consequence , photos made with more pixels will begin to lose their detail advantage earlier and quicker than images made with fewer pixels , but they will always retain more detail .
Eventually , the additional detail afforded by the extra pixels becomes trivial ( most certainly by f/32 on FF ) .
See here for an excellent example of the effect of pixel size on diffraction softening .
In terms of cross - format comparisons , all systems suffer the same from diffraction softening at the same DOF .
This does not mean that all systems resolve the same detail at the same DOF , as diffraction softening is but one of many sources of blur ( lens aberrations , motion blur , large pixels , etc. ) .
However , the more we stop down ( the deeper the DOF ) , diffraction increasingly becomes the dominant source of blur .
By the time we reach the equivalent of f/32 on FF ( f/ 22 on APS -C , f/16 on mFT and 4/3 ) , the differences in resolution between systems , regardless of the lens or pixel count , is trivial .
For example , consider the Canon 100 / 2.8L IS macro on a 5D2 ( 21 MP FF ) vs the Olympus 14 - 42 / 3.5 - 5.6 kit lens on an L10 ( 10 MP 4/3 ) .
Note that the macro lens on FF resolves significantly more ( to put it mildly ) at the lenses ' respective optimal apertures , due to the macro lens being sharper , the FF DSLR having significantly more pixels , and the enlargement factor being half as much for FF vs 4/3 .
However , as we stop down past the peak aperture , all those advantages are asymptotically eaten away by diffraction , and by the time we get to f/32 on FF and f/16 on 4/3 , the systems resolve almost the same .
For the same color and f-ratio , the Airy Disk will have the same diameter , but span a smaller portion of a larger sensor than a smaller sensor , thus resulting in less diffraction softening in the final photo .
On the other hand , for the same color and DOF , the Airy Disk spans the same proportion of all sensors , and thus the effect of diffraction softening is the same for all systems at the same DOF .
Let 's work an example using green light ( λ = 530 nm = 0.00053 mm ) .
The diameter of the Airy Disk at f/8 is 2.44 · 0.00053 mm·8 = 0.0103 mm , and the diameter of the Airy Disk at f / 4 is half as much -- 0.0052 mm .
For FF , the diameter of the Airy Disk represents 0.0103 mm / 43.3 mm = 0.024 % of the sensor diagonal at f /8 and 0.005 mm / 21.6 mm = 0.012 % of the diagonal at f / 4 .
For mFT ( 4/3 ) , the diameter of the Airy Disk represents 0.0103 mm / 21.6 mm = 0.048 % at f/8 and 0.005 mm / 21.6 mm = 0.024 % at f / 4 .
Thus , at the same f-ratio , we can see that the diameter of the Airy Disk represents half the proportion of a FF sensor as mFT ( 4/3 ) , but at the same DOF , the diameter of the Airy Disk represents the same proportion of the sensor .
In other words , all systems will suffer the same amount of diffraction softening at the same DOF and display dimensions .
However , the system that began with more resolution will always retain more resolution , but that resolution advantage will asymptotically vanish as the DOF deepens .
In absolute terms , the earliest we will notice the effects of diffraction softening is when the diameter of the Airy Disk exceeds that of a pixel ( two pixels for a Bayer CFA ) , but , depending on how large the photo is displayed , we may not notice until the diameter of the Airy Disk is much larger .
Typically , the effects of diffraction softening do not even begin to become apparent until f/11 on FF ( f/7.1 on APS -C and f /5.6 on mFT -- 4/3 ) , and start to become strong by f/22 on FF ( f/14 on APS -C and f/11 on mFT -- 4/3 ) .
By f/32 on FF ( f/22 on APS -C , f/16 on mFT -- 4/3 ) the effects of diffraction softening are so strong that there is little difference in resolution between systems , regardless of the lens , sensor size , or pixel count .
We can now summarize the effects of diffraction softening as follows : Diffraction is always present .
As the lens is stopped down , optical aberrations lessen and diffraction softening increases .
All else equal , more pixels will always resolve more detail , regardless of other sources of blur , including diffraction .
The " diffraction limited aperture " is the relative aperture where the effects of diffraction softening overcome the lessening lens aberrations , and will vary from lens to lens as well as where in the frame we are looking ( e.g. center vs edges , where the edges typically , but not always , lag around a stop behind the center ) .
The pixel count has a very minor effect on the diffraction limited aperture .
For example , if the diffraction limited aperture on a 12 MP sensor is f /5.6 , it may be at f / 4 on a 36 MP sensor , all else equal ( but the 36 MP sensor will certainly resolve more at f /5.6 than the 12 MP sensor ) .
All systems suffer the same diffraction softening at the same DOF , but do not necessarily resolve the same detail at the same DOF , as diffraction softening is merely one of many forms of blur ( e.g. lens aberrations , motion blur , large pixels , etc. ) .
As the DOF deepens , all systems asymptotically lose detail , and by f/32 on FF ( f/22 on APS -C , f/16 on mFT -- 4/3 ) , the differences in resolution between systems is trivial , regardless of the lens , sensor size , or pixel count .
It is worth noting that some lens tests show much greater discrepancies in the effects of diffraction softening that we would expect .
Per the lens tests at www.slrgear.com, we can see huge disparities between f / 16 and f / 22 even with high end lenses like the Zuiko 50 / 2 macro ( 7 blades ) and Zuiko 150 / 2 ( 9 blades ) , which are far greater than can be accounted for by the minor differences in the aperture shapes .
In fact , the Canon 100 / 2.8 macro and the Sigma 105 / 2.8 macro both have 8 blades , but show the same huge differences in sharpness from f / 22 to f / 32 on 1.6 x as the Zuikos .
The most likely explanation for this is that at the minimum aperture , not all lenses are equally accurate .
For example , consider a 50 mm lens and a constant " aperture bias " of - 0.5 mm , that is , the lens always sets the aperture 0.5 mm smaller than it should be ( whether as a result sloppy quality control or sloppy design ) .
At f/4 , the aperture diameter should be 50 mm / 4 = 12.5 mm .
However , a bias of - 0.5 mm would make the aperture diameter 12 mm instead , resulting in a true f-ratio of 50 mm / 12 mm = f / 4.17 -- 1/9 of a stop off -- which is insignificant .
At f / 8 , the aperture diameter should be 50 mm / 8 = 6.25 mm .
Again , a bias of - 0.5 mm would make the aperture diameter 5.75 mm resulting in a true f-ratio of 50 mm / 5.75 mm = f / 8.7 -- 1/4 of a stop off -- bordering on significant , but still small enough to go unnoticed by most people .
At f / 22 , however , the error becomes much more of an issue .
The aperture diameter should be 50 mm / 22 = 2.27 mm .
This time , the - 0.5 mm bias would make the aperture diameter 1.77 mm for a true f-ratio of 50 mm / 1.77 mm = f / 28 -- 2/3 of a stop different -- very noticeable , and resulting in a considerable difference in diffraction softening at such small apertures .
Furthermore , the " aperture bias " need not be constant , and could vary depending on the selected f-ratio , producing even greater differences at small apertures .
Of course , this hypothesis for the discrepancies in the effects of diffraction softening in the SLR Gear tests would need to be verified by comparing the exposures at different f-ratios .
In addition , the effects of vignetting can confound the issue at wide apertures , but , as demonstrated above , small errors in the aperture diameters are insignificant at wider apertures anyway .
Thus , we would test at small apertures , such as f / 22 and smaller , where the discrepancies due to aperture bias error are most noticeable .
Unfortunately , SLR Gear does not host ( or even still have ) these images to make such a comparison , so this conjecture needs to be verified .
Furthermore , it is not unlikely that an " aperture bias " could have been an issue with the particular lens they tested , but not endemic to all ( or most ) copies of the lens .
Furthermore , while it is well - known that the shape of the aperture plays a role in how the bokeh is rendered , it is unlikely that it plays any role in the degree of diffraction softening so long as the area of the aperture is the same .
Regardless , the effects of diffraction softening are not particularly significant until very small apertures .
To get a DOF larger than what the lens can stop down to achieve , we either use a shorter lens and TC ( teleconverter ) , or frame wider and crop to the desired framing .
The effect of a TC is to multiply the relative aperture by the same factor as the focal length .
For example , by using a 50 mm macro at f/22 with a 2x TC , we would effectively be at 100 mm f/45 .
While more convenient than using a TC , the downside to framing wider and cropping is that it costs us pixels .
However , since the lenses for all systems can stop down to the diffraction limited resolution of the sensor , much of the detail lost by cropping would have been lost from diffraction softening regardless .
For example , an image at 100 mm f/32 will have the same DOF and nearly the same detail as an image at 50 mm f/16 taken from the same distance and then cropped to the same framing , despite having 1/ 4 the number of pixels on the subject .
This is because the f/32 image has already lost almost the same amount of detail due to diffraction softening , although it will still retain slightly more detail , due to the oversampling of a greater number of diffraction limited pixels still renders slightly more detail than a fewer number of larger pixels .
Of course , it would be nice if we did n't have to stop down to increase sharpness for the portions of the image within the DOF , especially as this helps us avoid the effects of diffraction softening .
For example , let 's say we are taking a photo of a landscape where the entire scene is within the DOF , even at f /2.8 .
Thus , there would be no reason to shoot at a different f-ratio on different systems to maintain the same DOF .
However , the aberrations for larger apertures are more problematical than the aberrations for smaller apertures , and , once again , we realize that larger sensor system will require a higher f-ratio to maintain the same aperture diameter .
Thus , even though the DOF may not an issue per se , the aberrations , as well as vignetting , most certainly can be .
Of course , one might ask why we simply do n't choose the settings on each system that produce the " best " results for each .
Well , of course that is how we would use the systems .
The section on partial equivalence talks more about this .
Putting it all together in terms of AOV , DOF , and shutter speed , let 's look at some examples of equivalent settings from common cameras ( using the same AOV ) with all f-ratios and ISOs rounded to the nearest 1/3 stop , which show how the available DOFs on different formats differ :
Camera Focal Multiplier Focal Length ( mm ) f-ratio Shutter Speed ISO Canon S3 6.02 x 8.3 f / 2.8 1/400 100 Canon G7 4.84 x 10.3 f / 3.2 1/400 125 Canon Pro1 3.93 x 12.7 f / 4 1/400 160 Olympus E3 2.00 x 25 f / 8 1/400 800 Sigma SD14 1.74x 29 f / 9 1/400 1000 Canon 40D 1.62x 31 f / 10 1/400 1250 Nikon D300 1.52x 33 f / 11 1/400 1250 Canon 1DIII 1.26 x 40 f / 13 1/400 1600 Canon 5D 1.00 x 50 f / 16 1/400 3200 Leica S2 0.80 x 62.5 f / 20 1/400 5000 Mamiya ZD 0.72x 67 f / 21 1/400 6400 EXPOSURE
TIME
The exposure time ( shutter speed ) , obviously , is the length of time the shutter remains open to achieve the desired exposure .
The reason Equivalent photos have the same shutter speed is because the amount of motion blur will be the same for a given shutter speed .
However , there are many times when we would not compare formats with the same shutter speed since there is enough light to stop down to achieve the desired DOF and still have a fast enough shutter so that motion blur is a non-issue .
Under these circumstances , the larger sensor system can deliver both deliver more detail subject to lens sharpness and pixel count ) in addition to a cleaner image since the lower shutter speed results in more light falling on the sensor for a given DOF .
For example , let 's say we are shooting a landscape .
The following settings would be likely candidates for a particular scene : A7R2 at 24 mm , f/11 , 1/100 , ISO 100
D500 at 16 mm , f/7.1 , 1/250 , ISO 100
80D at 15 mm , f/7.1 , 1/250 , ISO 100
EM1.2 at 12 mm , f/5.6 , 1/400 , ISO 100
While landscapes are a common scenario , and such a comparison is of practical value to most photographers , we must take care to note that this partially equivalent scenario is only valid when the shutter speeds are sufficiently high to avoid motion blur , and , if a tripod is not being used , to avoid camera shake .
If , instead , we were engaged in street photography near dusk , we would need to compare with fully equivalent settings since a sufficient shutter speed would be crucial to stopping motion blur for the required DOF : A7R2 at 24 mm , f/11 , 1/100 , ISO 400
D500 at 16 mm , f/7.1 , 1/100 , ISO 250
80D at 15 mm , f/7.1 , 1/100 , ISO 250
EM1.2 at 12 mm , f/5.6 , 1/100 , ISO 100 Alternatively , if one system has IS and the other system does not , then if motion blur is not an issue , then the IS system will be able to use the lower shutter speed if a tripod is not used on the non-IS system .
In this case , the system with IS will have the noise advantage for a given DOF since more light will fall on the sensor .
So if we are using anything other than base ISO , then we cannot discount the importance of shutter speed in comparing systems , since the only time we would not be at base ISO is when shutter speed is a factor .
Under these circumstances , the only way for the larger formats to achieve less relative noise than the smaller formats is by using a more shallow DOF , rather than raising the ISO , to maintain the necessary shutter speed .
LIGHTNESS
The lightness of the photo is the how bright the photo appears , and is usually adjusted by the ISO setting of the camera .
Let 's say we have a perfect sensor that is a photon counter .
That is , each photon that falls on the pixel is recorded so that if 100 photons fell on a pixel , the image file would record a value of 100 at base ISO .
Then at ISO 400 , the image file would record a value of 400 , at ISO 1600 , the image file would record a value of 1600 , etc. , where " brighter " values would be displayed on a computer monitor or printed on a printer with greater " lightness " .
See here for a much more in depth discussion .
DISPLAY DIMENSIONS
The display dimensions is the physical size of the viewed image , whether it be a print or on a computer monitor People , including reviewers , tend to compare IQ at the pixel level , rather than the image level , which leads to incorrect conclusions about the image , unless the images are made from the same number of pixels .
If two images are made from a different number of pixels , if we are to compare them at the pixel level , then we need to properly resample the images to a common number of pixels .
We can increase the IQ of an image by increasing either the native pixel count or increasing the quality of the individual pixel .
Thus , if we compare two images with unequal pixel counts at the pixel level ( often referred to as a " 100 % comparison " ) , we are disregarding the increase in IQ that comes from the additional pixels , which is discussed in more detail in the Megapixels : Quality vs Quantity section of the essay .
For example , let 's say we wish to compare the Canon 1DsIII ( 21 MP ) and the Nikon D3 ( 12 MP ) .
Comparing images from the two systems at the pixel level is the same as comparing 16x24 inch prints from the 1DsIII to 12x18 inch prints from the D3 , which is hardly a fair comparison .
The best way to compare images is to compare in the manner that they will be displayed .
For example , if you are going to print the images , then print them and compare .
Of course , this is impractical to do unless we already had access to both systems .
And , even if the reviewer provides us with the files to print ourselves , that is a bit of a pain , and certainly not a basis for an objective conclusion that we can share with others as all will not be using the same printer .
So , what to do ?
The easiest solution is to resample both images to a common dimension that is at least as large as the larger image and then compare at the pixel level .
The reason to compare at a dimension at least as large as the larger image is because downsampling the larger image will cause it to lose detail , which , I presume , is one of the qualities of IQ being measured in the comparison .
In addition , if we are comparing relative noise , it only makes sense to do so at the same level of detail , so we would apply NR to the more detailed image to match the level of detail of the less detailed image .
Of course , care need be taken in the resampling process , since a poor resampling method can lead to incorrect conclusion about the comparative IQ between systems .
This is especially true when comparing relative noise .
We simply cannot downsample the larger file to the dimensions of the smaller file .
We first need to apply NR ( or a specific form of blur ) and then downsample .
In any event , it is better to upsample the smaller image rather than downsample the larger image .
Again , using the example of the 1DsIII vs D3 comparison , we could resample both images to 54 MP ( 300 PPI for a 20x30 inch print ) and then compare at the pixel level .
Of course , there 's nothing magical about 54 MP , but we would like to incorporate some kind of " future - proofing " for comparisons with future cameras , and need some value larger than 21 MP , so 300 PPI for a 20x30 inch print sounds like a good " standard " , as very few would print larger than this , no matter what pixel counts the future holds or what format they shoot .
Of course , for those that do print larger , they would , of course , want to compare at the larger output size .
Another option would be for a reviewer to print the images at a variety of sizes ( e.g. 4x6 , 8x12 , 12x18 , 16x24 , and 20x30 inches ) on a top - of - the - line printer , scan the prints , and then compare the scans from the same size prints .
' Tis a pain , but probably the most fair way to compare , although I honestly do n't know if it would produce different results than resampling the two images to the " appropriate " PPI for each print size .
And , of course , we cannot discount the effects of viewing images on non-calibrated monitors ( I 've seen more than one comparison where someone claimed the highlights of the image to be blown with several others chiming in that they need to calibrate their monitor ) .
Thus , comparing images that have different pixel counts at the pixel level is a very poor way to compare the IQ between systems .
However , the closer the pixel counts are , the better such a comparison will approximate the actual differences .
For example , it 's reasonable to say that a comparison between the 12.1 MP Nikon D700 , 12.1 MP Nikon D3 , 12.3 MP Nikon D300 , and the 12.7 MP Canon 5D would be easily " close enough " without resampling .
But when comparing the 10.1 MP Canon 40D , 10.1 MP 1DIII , or the 10.1 MP Olympus E3 to the aforementioned cameras at the pixel level , we are beginning to stretch a bit ( 12 % difference in linear pixel count ) , and we are certainly stretching when comparing the 1DsIII to any of the above cameras at the pixel level for native image sizes ( 32 % difference in linear pixel count between the 1DsIII and the D3 , for example ) .
So , while no comparison is without its potential problems , the easiest mistake to correct is to carefully resample images to a common dimension , as well as applying NR as necessary for comparing relative noise , before comparing at the pixel level .

Last night I talked at PDXfunc a bit about Erlang .
The slides were pretty minimal , so I do n’t think I ’m going to post them publicly at this point .
We spent more time looking at code and demonstrating features that way .
I showed a very similar IRC bot as in the talk I gave to PDX.pm on POE and Erlang , although I had actually made a change that introduced a small bug ( and failed to test the code before my live demo ) .
But , this worked out to be a positive because I got to demonstrate hot code updates and fixed the bug while keeping the bot up and running .
I also showed some code I ’ve been working on in the last couple days , once again writing a web spider , this time in Erlang .
Unfortunately , I found some problems in xmerl that required heinous workarounds , and I still had some bugs by the time of the talk , but I got to demonstrate the important bit , at least , which was that by replacing a single map with pmap , I could make my sequential program concurrent , proven by the fact that it hit one of the remaining bugs and crashed much faster :-) .

Computer geeks have their own niche in pop culture .
Sometimes , something crazed from that niche escapes and runs rampant among the masses .
It 's happened before , with the " I Kiss You " guy , Mahir Cagri ( www.ikissyou.org); the " All Your Base " fad ( www.allyourbasearebelongtous.com); and , more recently , the Diet Coke - and - Mentos experiments ( www.eepybird.com).
Now working its way into the popular consciousness is something far more bizarre and — depending on your point of view and sense of humor — either very funny or irritatingly cutesy .
For the last few months , online regulars have been seeing on various Web sites and blogs pictures of cats and other animals in strange poses , with large type captions embedded in the photos .
The grammar and syntax in the captions are atrocious by design .
The pictures are called LOLcats , named after the abbreviation for " laughing out loud " used by fans of text and instant messaging .
The origin of LOLcats is murky at best .
From what I can tell based on various blog posts — the most authoritative at LinguisticMystic.com , written by a Colorado linguistics student — they may have evolved from a practice called Caturday , in which cat lovers posted photos of their felines with funny captions on Saturdays .
The cat - photo fad then merged with some other geek jokes .
The mangled spelling associated with texting and gaming known as leetspeak — teh for the , ur for your , hai for hi , 1337 for " leet " or elite , and so on — became part of the gag .
A line used in online strategy games such as Starcraft became a common meme .
While one player is off building and acquiring supplies and weapons for a battle , his opponent sneaks into his headquarters and starts killing his virtual minions .
The perpetrator gleefully declares , " I 'm in ur base , killin ur d00dz . "
Now there are dozens of pictures of cats on the Web with captions that take the form , " Im in ur X , Y - ing ur Z. "
So , a picture of a cat lying on its back in front of a window has the caption , " I 'm in ur windoze , flashing ur nayberz . "
A menacing - looking group of cats approaching the camera has a caption that reads , " In ur yardz , starten a gang . "
The best collection of LOLcats can be found at a site called I Can Has Cheezburger ?
( www.icanhascheezburger.com).
The title comes from one of the earliest , most popular LOLcat pictures , which features a dark - gray cat that seems to grin expectantly .
You can see the original by going to the site and clicking on the " First Post — # 1 " link on the right .
Time to kill
The site has hundreds of images , almost all submitted by site visitors .
Some are funnier than others , as you 'd expect .
But do n't visit it unless you have plenty of time to kill .
It 's a serious threat to your productivity .
It 's run by two 20 - something tech - industry workers who do n't want their names or even their locations used .
Instead , they go by handles found on the site — he 's Cheezburger , she 's Tofuburger .
" This could all go away tomorrow , and we both want to do other things in the future , " he said .
In other words , they do n't want to be known just for a Web site that aggregates funny pictures of cats .
The site has exploded in popularity since they posted that first image in January .
Originally , Cheezburger told me , it was to be " one of these sites that just has one picture on it . "
But Tofuburger convinced him to turn it into a blog .
Now , the site gets between 350,000 and 500,000 page views a day .
Site visitors submit 300 - 500 LOLcat images a day , the vast majority of which are n't worth posting .
" For every 25 we get , maybe one is postable , " Cheezburger said .
The flow has become unmanageable for the two of them , so they 're planning on turning it into a site similar to Digg , in which submitted images are voted on , and the best move to the front page .
Not the only one
The popularity of the site has spawned others .
There 's LolCatBuildr at http://kscakes.com/LolCats/Default.aspx , ( when last checked , site was down ) which lets you upload and caption your own photos .
If you do , however , make sure you follow the informal grammatical rules .
Yes , even though LOLcats ' language is decidedly fractured , conventions have evolved into what legendary blogger Anil Dash has called " kitty pidgin . "
Then there 's LOLCODE , at www.lolcode.com, which is an attempt by software developer Adam Lindsay to create a programming language built around kitty pidgin .
He 's even got a few programs already on the page , including this one , which anyone who has taken a beginning course in computer science will recognize :
HAI
CAN HAS STDIO ?
VISIBLE ' HAI WORLD !''
KTHXBYE
What makes the LOLcats phenomenon so intriguing is how fast it has evolved , and how it has grown into its own subculture , complete with conventions and subgenres .
It wo n't be long before it 's so ubiquitous that even your gramma will get the joke .
Its in ur culture , makin u LOL !!!1 !

The Mouse That Roared Liechtenstein Furious at Germany Over Tax Probe
The tiny principality of Liechtenstein , a major European tax haven , has threatened Germany with legal action because German authorities paid an informant for stolen financial data on hundreds of investors who now face prosecution for alleged tax evasion .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Hollywood writers finally returned to work on Wednesday with a brighter future in new media but facing uncertainty about whether their 14 - week strike will cost them lucrative TV work .
The Writers Guild of America hailed its new contract with major studios as a deal that secured writers a stake in the evolving market for movies and TV shows on the Web .
But the promise of those revenues may not offset the $ 3 billion lost to the local economy or changes to the way Hollywood runs its TV pilot season , long a lucrative source of income for writers .
“ I think it ’s a good deal , not a great deal .
It gets the writers a beachhead on the Internet , which was critically needed , but in the short term there were definitely losses , ” said Jonathan Handel , lawyer with the Los Angeles - based Troy Gould firm and a former WGA counsel .
Some 10,500 WGA members went on strike against major film and TV studios in November in a dispute centering largely on fees they wanted when their work was distributed on the Internet .
But the walkout could dramatically change the way the TV industry works .
Media giants News Corp and Walt Disney
Co have already said they would scale back TV pilots due to the strike , while Jeff Zucker , chief executive of NBC Universal , the media wing of General Electric Co , said he wanted to largely exit the business of developing pilots .
TV networks use pilot episodes to decide whether to schedule a series , but the industry has long lamented the process as too expensive and said pilots often led nowhere .
Members of The Writers Guild of America talk outside the Writers Guild Theater after voting in a special election in Beverly Hills , California , February 12 , 2008 .
Film and television writers voted on Tuesday whether to immediately end a 14 - week strike against major studios pending formal ratification of a contract deal , but there was little doubt the walkout would be lifted .

“ There are going to be fewer development deals , fewer pilots made and that is money ( for writers ) that wo n’t come back , ” Handel said .
LONG - TERM GAIN , SHORT - TERM PAIN
WGA West President Patric Verrone said it could take five to 15 years for the fruits of the new contract to become apparent .
“ I think it ’s going to take a long time to really look back and see how much the Internet is worth , ” he said .
The writers were not the only people feeling the financial pain .
Jack Kyser , chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp , estimates the strike cost the local economy more than $ 3 billion , including $ 981 million in lost production spending on scripted TV series that were shuttered .
About $ 1.3 billion was lost to caterers , valets and other industry - related businesses , $ 772 million in direct writing and crew wages , and $ 60 million from a downsized Golden Globe Awards show , said Kyser .
He sees more pressure ahead as the media giants reduce the number of pilot episodes produced .
“ It ’s going to be more competitive for writers , if you do n’t have all these pilots being produced .
The ground rules have changed , ” said Kyser .
Still , Handel noted that writers ’ achievements were not to be underestimated , particularly after the studios initially balked at their demands for new media fees .
Writers scored important victories by increasing the rates they will be paid for downloads and in winning first - ever residuals for ad - supported streaming of shows .
“ This contract will make it easier three years from now for the parties to be on the same page to negotiate , ” he said .

Bonjour !
Comme vous l’avez remarqué , le forum est actuellement hors d’usage .
Le site a été piraté il y a quelques semaines et nous allons passer sur une nouvelle plateforme .
En attendant , nous avons ouvert un discord , et vous pouvez également discuter sur Twitter ou ...
The past year has been both tempestuous and exciting — from pet food , E. coli and toy poisoning scares to political fireworks over embryonic stem cell research to forest fires ravaging California .
A controversial Nobel scientist ( James Watson ) went down in a blaze of infamy , tumbling from grace after putting his foot in his mouth one time too many , whereas a former vice president and defeated presidential candidate ( Al Gore ) rose from the ashes to become a Nobel Peace prize ( and Oscar ) winner for raising awareness on the urgency of global warming .
The honor came on the heels of official worldwide recognition that climate change is not only a pressing problem , but one that was almost completely caused by humans — and one , too , that humans must fix .
On a related note , we discovered that the North Pole is melting , beloved freshwater dolphins are practically extinct and nuclear power — feared since the 1979 near - meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuke plant in Middletown , Pa. — has become the clean - energy alternative du jour that even has the backing of some enviros .
For the first time , too , we enjoyed ( depending on how you look at it ) an extra month of daylight saving time , thanks to Congress , which made the move to save energy and , lawmakers said , to cut down on traffic accidents — and , perhaps most important , to make Halloween more special and safe .
Alas , 2007 was the year in which hopes were dashed that human growth hormone might be the key to eternal youth .
It was also when parents everywhere became alarmed as school kids began contracting an antibiotic - resistant superbug ( MRSA ) , and air travelers found themselves wondering whether their fellow passengers harbored serious contagious illnesses after it was revealed that a man with a virulent form of tuberculosis flouted official warnings to stay home , instead flying to Italy to get married .
It was the year , too , when an American pastime became an American tragedy — a report on steroid use by pro baseball players revealed that even sports heroes are flawed .
The past year was one filled with mysteries as well , such as disappearing honeybees and the fate of famed computer scientist James Gray , who departed one fine day from San Francisco on a sailing trip never to be seen again , despite a massive , high - tech all - out search by friends and colleagues .
There were ethical dilemmas that came to light , too , such as the decision by the parents of a severely disabled girl dubbed " Pillow Angel , " who , after consulting a panel of doctors and ethicists , decided to have their daughter undergo surgery to stunt her growth , thereby keeping her small so that they could continue to care for her themselves .
But there were also some exciting new developments and discoveries : human skin cells were transformed to stem cells ; primates came within a hair of being successfully cloned ; scientists found that if they killed the virus behind some cancers , they might also kill the cancer ; the discovery of a new planet with the most Earth - like characteristics yet observed ; and , the unveiling of the first quantum computer .
On the political science front , Libya finally freed five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor , each of whom had served eight years of life sentences for allegedly deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV , despite evidence of their innocence .
And who could forget the long - awaited debut of the Apple iPhone — and the dramatic price cut for the nifty new device that soon followed , angering early purchasers ?
Or robots sent in to help in the fruitless search for trapped miners after a deadly Utah mine collapse ?
Or the first wireless power transmission ?
There was some promising genetic news on autism , Parkinson 's and other elusive disorders , not to mention the discovery that Neandertals may well have spoken and , what 's more , may have been redheads .
Plus , 2007 is the year that getting parts of one 's own genome mapped became as simple as plunking down a few hundred bucks ( closer to $ 1,000 , but still … ) .
The editors and reporters of SciAm.com have listed our top 25 science and health news picks of 2007 below ( in no particular order ) , with the understanding that these are but a small sampling of the many notable stories of the year .

Home Staging Tips - How to Stage a House for Sale
By Brandon Cornett | © 2019
All rights reserved
This tutorial on home staging was created to give sellers a competitive advantage in their respective real estate markets .
By using the home staging tips and advice offered below , you will have a much greater chance of selling your home quickly and for maximum price .
If you 're here because you want to stage your own home prior to listing it , then we have plenty of helpful tips for you as well .
The staging tips that follow will help you evaluate your home one room at a time , while making note of " hot spots " that are in need of home staging .
Enjoy !
Part 1 - What is home staging ?
Before we dive into home staging tips for a quick sale , we first need to define what exactly staging is — just so we are on the same page .
Definition :
Home staging is the act of preparing a home ( and the contents of the home ) for sale , with a special emphasis on presentation and appearance .
It 's important to realize that preparing a home for sale and staging a home is not always the same thing .
For example , as part of your pre-sale preparations , you might go through the home to make small repairs where needed .
This is an essential step in preparing your home for the market , but it 's not the same as home staging .
Staging a home for sale normally involves things of an aesthetic nature , such as design , organization and overall appearance ( as opposed to mechanical or functional improvements ) .
The goal of home staging then is to improve the home 's appearance in the eyes of potential buyers , with the ultimate goal of selling the home more quickly and for the highest possible price .
If you are selling a home , then you 've obviously been on the other side of the process as a home buyer .
Think back to your home buying experience .
Try to recall the difference between the homes you thought were " just okay " and the homes that made you say " wow ! "
Professional home staging can help you turn your " okay " house into a " wow " house .
So to sum up our introduction :
You can think of home staging as presenting your house in a way that appeals to the largest possible audience , in order to ensure a quick sale for the best possible price .
It bears repeating .
The key to this whole thing is appealing to the largest audience — that 's what it 's all about .

Part 2 - Benefits of staging your home
Why should I bother staging my home ?
What do I get back for all the time and effort I put in ?
This is one of the most common home staging questions among sellers , especially those who are selling in a seller 's market .
Here 's the bottom line : Staging your home can benefit you regardless of what type of real estate market you are in .
In a buyer 's market , you will need every advantage you can get in order to sell your home for a decent sale price , so it 's extra important to stage your home effectively .
But even in a seller 's market staging can help you achieve a quick sale for the maximum sale price .
So no matter what kind of real estate market you are in , it 's always wise to stage your home for the market .
Here are some of the primary benefits you will get out of it :
Home Staging Benefits
Staging forces you to think like a buyer .
When you set out to stage your home for the market , you will be looking at the home as if you were a buyer .
Adopting this perspective early on will help you in many ways when preparing your home for the market .
Staging forces you to organize and de-clutter .
Clearing away shelves , closets and cabinets is a big part of the home staging process .
It also helps with moving , because you 'll have to pack things away at some point anyway .
So when you stage your home , you will also get a head start on packing to move .
Staging increases likelihood of a sale .
When selling your home , you must do everything within your power to increase your chances of selling — and I mean everything .
These techniques can give you an extra edge in selling the home quickly .
Staging reduces the home 's time on market .
When you put in the extra effort to stage your home effectively , you will move closer to a quick sale .
Anyone who has sold a home before can attest to the fact that the least time the home is on the market , the better .
This is especially important if you will be paying two mortgages until the home sells ( as is the case when you buy a new home before selling the old one ) .
Staging helps justify the asking price .
If you are in a seller 's market and you price your home correctly , you probably wo n't have to haggle over the asking price .
But in a market that leans toward the buyer , you need everything in your favor to justify the asking price .
Proper home staging can help you justify the asking price by positioning the home more favorably in the buyer 's mind .
Staging can be fun !
It may sound like all work and no play at first .
Granted , you will certainly be putting some elbow grease into the process .
But staging a home can be a creative process as well , and many people find they enjoy it once they 've begun .

Part 3 - Staging the exterior for maximum curb appeal
When most people hear the phrase staging a home they immediately think of preparing the home 's interior — painting , arranging furniture and the like .
While the interior is certainly important , the home 's exterior is an equally important ( but often overlooked ) home staging hot - spot .
Curb appeal is exactly what it sounds like .
When potential buyers pull up to the curb in front of your home , you want the home to appeal to them as much as possible .
This gives a good first impression , so it should part of your home staging checklist .
Here are some tips to help you stage your home 's exterior for maximum curb appeal .
Staging the Exterior
Start by creating a list of items needing attention .
Go out to the curb in front of your house with a notepad and pen .
Jot down anything that " leaps " out at you .
Have a friend perform the same type of inspection .
It will only take them 10 or 15 minutes to spot areas that need attention .
Add their list to your list .
If the home 's paint is chipped or faded , give it a fresh coat .
Pay particular attention to shutters , doors and trim .
If the door and shutters are different colors , you may want to make them the same color .
Choose the color that 's the more neutral of the two and standardize the color scheme .
Keep the lawn mowed and neatly edged .
A nicely mowed lawn does wonders for curb appeal , so you might have to mow every few days while the home is on the market ( depending on where you live , season , etc. ) .
If your lawn is in really bad shape from years of neglect , you might have to lay down fresh sod .
Do this at least a month before listing the home , so the new grass has some time to grow in and look nice .
Mulch is your best friend when trying to boost your curb appeal .
Adding fresh mulch to your existing flower / plant beds can make a big difference in appearance .
Best of all , it cheaps and readily available at your local garden store , Home Depot , etc .
Weather and season permitting , plant or pot some fresh flowers outside the front door .
For simplicity , you might want to stick to potted plants .
This will allow you to place them wherever you need them , and with less effort .
Bright plants or flowers do a lot to enhance the entry .
Think " yellow " when adding accent plants to your home 's entry .
Yellow is a great color for this purpose .
It draws the eye and makes people feel at ease , which is exactly how you want them to feel when entering your home .
Check your flower beds and lawn for weeds every day while your house is on the market .
Remove any weeds you find .
It 's important to check daily , because weeds can literally sprout up overnight .
In the fall , be sure to rake leaves from your lawn and also from flower beds .
Do this every couple of days , or as needed to keep the lawn free of leaves .
Trim bushes and trees as needed to give a tidy appearance .
In particular , make sure they are not blocking windows or doors .
Speaking of windows , make sure they are spotless .
This includes the frames around the windows , as well as the shutters .
This adds a lot of sparkle to your overall curb appeal .
If you have vinyl railings outside your home 's entrance , give them a good washing .
All you need is a bucket , a hose , and some concentrated car wash liquid .
You might want to rent a power washer if you have a lot of dirt and grime .
It 's an easy way to clean everything at once -- the siding , sidewalks , doors and shutters , etc .
If you have wood railings , consider giving them a fresh coat of paint .
Do you have a large porch that 's ideal for sitting ?
Add a nice bench , or a pair of chairs , to help people see themselves relaxing on the porch .
You 'll find more tips and ideas for creating curb appeal in this related article .
Remember , people will see the outside of your house before they see the inside .
Unless , of course , you escort them in with a blindfold . :-)
If the home 's exterior makes a bad first impression on potential buyers , they will carry that negativity inside the house with them .
So when you stage your home prior to listing , work on the outside as well .

Part 4 - Stage the entryway for maximum effect
Your home 's entrance is part of its overall curb appeal , because people will see it when they pull up to the house .
But the entrance is doubly important because it marks a threshold — literally and figuratively — between the outside world and what could possibly be the buyer 's new home .
So you can consider the entryway another home staging hot - spot that deserve special attention .
Here are some tips to help you stage the entry area of your home .
Staging the Entry
The " entry " includes those areas people see when they first open the front door .
This picks up where curb appeal leaves off .
It 's a critical area , because it represents the potential buyer 's first impression upon walking into the house .
Keep the entryway open and free of clutter .
This will make the house seem larger , right from the get - go .
Clear away all of those spider webs and any other " natural touches " to the entry area .
It 's a dirty job , but it must be done .
Make sure the entry has plenty of light .
This is for safety reasons as well as general appearances .
A bright entryway gives the initial impression of a warm , inviting home .
Get rid of that worn welcome mat and buy a new , high - quality welcome mat .
It 's a home staging essential ... and well worth the $ 20 you 'll spend .
Remember , professional home staging focuses on the house as a whole , but also on key " hot spots " that have a bigger impact .
Your home 's entryway is a natural magnet for people 's eyes , so give the entry some extra attention when you stage your home for sale .

Part 5 - Staging living rooms and family rooms
People spend a lot of time in their living room and family room areas , especially when they have children .
The family room / living room is also an entertainment area of the home .
So when buyers walk through the living room or family room area of your home , they will want to envision these two activities — spending time as a family and entertaining guests .
Stage the living room / family room area with this in mind .
Make it warm and inviting , with good use of space and a conversational arrangement .
Here are some specific tips to help you stage this key area of your home .
Staging the Family Room / Living Room
Clear the room of family portraits and other items that say " you do n't live here " to buyers .
Arrange the room in a conversational way , if it 's not that way already .
Try different furniture arrangements until you get the best fit .
Choose a nice and warm paint color for the living room .
Use neutral tones in this space .
That does n't mean you are limited to beige .
There are plenty of warm colors that will neutralize the space , while also adding visual interest .
These include the softer shades of green , blue and brown .
" Neutral " does not have to be boring .
You can liven up a neutral color scheme with colorful accent items , such as pillows and rugs .
Color - coordinate these items for a professional and " put together " appearance .
Let the room breathe .
If it 's crowded or hard to walk through due to having too much furniture , remove some items and place them in storage .
Consider renting furniture for staging purposes .
If your family room ensemble consists of that old couch from college days and a cheap table with wobbly legs , replace them with some nice rental pieces .
If the furniture is a bit worn but otherwise intact , use a slip cover as a low - cost way to enhance the appearance of your couch and chairs .
Slip covers can also help you neutralize overly bright or " loud " fabric colors .
If you have a mantle , make sure it 's not overloaded with knick knacks .
A couple of well - placed items ( like a vase or flower arrangement ) are all you need .
If you have a fireplace in this room , make it the focal point and the star of the show .
Arrange seating to face the fireplace .
Remove the TV if it's too large -- a huge television will draw attention away from the fireplace .
Remember , people want a living room or family room area that seems open and inviting .
Make the room airy and bright , and arrange furniture for the best possible flow .
Replace or cover worn furniture as needed .
When people naturally want to sit down and spend time in the room , you 've achieved your home - staging goals for the room !
Back to top
Part 6 - Stage the kitchen to wow buyers
The kitchen is a key area of the home for many reasons .
Kitchens have a lot to do with resale value , so the buyers will want to be impressed with this area of the home .
People also spend a lot of time in their kitchens , so a nicely staged kitchen will help them see themselves in the home .
All of these things will help you increase the likelihood of a sale , and that 's the whole point of home staging in the first place .
With that in mind , here are some ways to stage your home 's kitchen in order to wow buyers .
Staging the Kitchen
Spend some extra time de-cluttering .
Kitchens are notorious for being full of clutter .
So when you stage this area of your home , be ruthless about removing unnecessary items .
This includes countertop appliances , utensils , the coffee pot , etc .
Clean like the sale of your home depended on it ... because is does .
Pay particular attention to the sink , counters , stove , etc. " Clean and bright " should be your motto for kitchen staging .
Turn the lights on and open the curtains to showcase the sparkle .
Shed some light on the subject .
If you have dark areas of your kitchen , you might even consider adding supplemental lighting , such as recessed lighting around the edges .
Remember your kitchen staging motto — clean and bright .
Consider making upgrades .
If you 're in a buyer 's market , it might be wise to go beyond cleaning and actually upgrade some of your kitchen features .
Cabinets and counters is the rule of thumb here .
If your cabinets and counters are outdated or ugly , an upgrade can make a huge difference in resale .
If , based on your circumstances , it does n't make sense to pour extra money into cabinetry , you might try staining the cabinets .
This can make a big improvement at a fraction of the cost .
In addition to staining , you could also paint the cabinets .
If your cabinets are in decent shape , you can modernize them simply by updating the knobs and handles , or adding them if you do n't have any .
This is a low - cost way to improve a kitchen , and that 's what home staging is all about .
The same goes for your kitchen faucets , lights and other fixtures .
You can make the entire space more modern just by updating these items .
Give the walls a fresh coat of paint , following the paint tips mentioned previously .
If the kitchen is connected to the family / living room , use the same color paint -- or one shade lighter or darker .
This will make the eye flow from one room to the next , making the entire place seem more spacious .
Do you have an eat - in kitchen ?
If so , accentuate it by setting a small table .
This will showcase the fact that the space serves double duty .
Do n't leave it up to the buyers to envision the eat - in kitchen — show it to them !
Remember , people spend a lot of time in their kitchens , and most people realize that they are a resale value item of importance .
If you spend some extra time or money anywhere while staging your home for sale , the kitchen is probably the place to do it .

Part 7 - Staging bathrooms for function
" Kitchens and baths " ... that 's the expression used by real estate folks to indicate the areas of a home that carry the most resale value .
Kitchens and baths .
We already talked about staging your kitchen .
But what about those bathrooms ?
How do you carry your home staging efforts in there ?
I can sum up your bathroom plan - of - attack with two simple words — cleaning and updating .
If you remember , " clean and bright " was our motto for staging the kitchen area .
That same motto applies to the bathrooms .
Bathrooms should be sparkling clean and well - lit ( but not overly bright ) .
If you add " luxurious " onto that motto , you 'll score extra points with home buyers .
Clean , bright and luxurious .
Those are the keys to staging a bathroom .
Here are some specific tips for carrying your home - staging efforts into the bathrooms of your house .
If your bathroom fixtures ( handles , spigots , etc. ) are outdated , replace them with sleek and modern fixtures .
Stay away from brass fixtures — they bring the 1980's to mind .
Put some high - quality plush towels on the towel rack .
Color - coordinate them with the bathroom 's color scheme ( matching them to the rug , flower arrangement , etc. ) .
Fresh flower arrangements do a lot for a bathroom , both in appearance and aroma .
Before showing the home , clean those bathrooms until they look like they 're in a model home .
Signs of use , such as soap scum and recently used sinks , will turn buyers off .
Glass shower door a little gross ?
Remove it and take it outside for cleaning .
Use a solution of one part muriatic acid to 10 parts water ( wear goggles when mixing ) .
Scrub it with steel wool , rinse it clean , and replace the door .
If you have the budget and you really want to increase your home 's appeal , consider installing a pedestal sink .
They are very popular with buyers right now , and they make the bathroom seem larger by freeing up space .
Remember , when potential buyers tour your home their agents will probably be whispering " kitchens and baths " in their ears .
So when staging your home to sell put some extra effort into those bathrooms .
Your motto is clean , bright and luxurious .

Part 8 - Stage those bedrooms for comfort
When potential buyers enter the bedrooms of your home , they want to see one thing about all else ... comfort .
Bedrooms do not have appliances or fixtures .
Not usually , anyway .
So home staging in a bedroom usually consists of painting , furniture arrangement and some light decor .
Think " neutral , comfortable and spacious " when you stage your bedrooms for buyers .
Keep those words in mind during your staging process , and you will be in good shape .
Here are some specific home staging tips for the bedrooms .
Use soft , neutral colors with paints and color schemes .
Earth tones are always a safe color that will appeal to the majority .
Make bedrooms appear larger by limiting furniture to a bed , dresser and a couple of small items .
Too much furniture makes a bedroom seem cramped .
Remove the bulk of your clothes from closets and pack them away in storage .
You will have to pack them soon anyway , and doing it early will make your closets appear larger .
Invest in some new and luxurious bedding ( comforter , sheets , accent pillows ) .
You can take them with you when you move , and they will improve the look of the current bedrooms while it's on the market .
Remove personal items such as photos .
Remember , you want buyers to see themselves in the home ... not you and your family .
Remember , your motto when staging those bedrooms — neutral , comfortable and spacious .
Open up the room be reducing the amount of furniture items .
Neutralize the overall color scheme and add a little bit of " controlled color " with accessories like pillows .
Update your bedding if needed .
Make your bedrooms relaxing and tranquil .
Conclusion & Going Forward
This tutorial on professional home staging only scratches the surface .
The number and scale of improvements you make to your home prior to selling are only limited by your time and budget .
Just keep in mind that there is a fine line between spending enough for staging and spending too much .
After all , the goal of home selling is to make money , not spend it .
Here 's a financial home staging tip to take away with you :
You should only spend as much on home staging as needed to achieve the desired effect .
The desired effect , of course , is to sell the home quickly and for a good price .
In a seller 's market , you wo n't have to do as much work to sell your home .
In a buyer 's market , you 'll have to do more work .
The key is finding the right balance .
The effort was seen last week when the DNC held a conference call with local reporters in early states to review the foreign policy proposals and positions of the GOP field .
A party official said the goal is to prompt reporters to then ask the candidates about some critical issues that are n't getting a lot of attention because of the overwhelming focus on polls and the traditional horse - race story .
" We see our job as getting the candidates on the record about these things , " said a Democratic official .
By making these conference calls to local reporters , the party believes it can help steer coverage to important questions .
" We 're trying to educate people on where the candidates are , " said the official .
In addition , the party is sending out " extreme statements " by Republicans on issues such as the economy , the war , foreign policy , and healthcare as it builds a case to portray the candidates as " Bush Republicans . "
Said a top DNC official , " We know we can't run against Bush , but these folks are very similar , and we want to make that case . "
1860 : French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier announces the discovery of Vulcan , a planet orbiting between Mercury and the sun , to members of the Académie des Sciences in Paris .
Le Verrier , who used Vulcan to explain an anomaly in Mercury 's orbit , already enjoyed a stellar reputation among astronomers , having discovered Neptune in 1846 using only mathematic principles to detect its presence .
Turns out Le Verrier was a bit hasty this time , not to mention gullible , basing his claim on some pretty dubious observations by one Edmond Modeste Lescarbault , a provincial physician and amateur astronomer working from a homemade observatory .
Le Verrier interviewed Lescarbault at length , though , and was convinced that the good doctor knew what he was talking about .
Doubts about this " new " planet surfaced immediately and the professionals set to work attempting to either confirm or debunk Vulcan 's existence .
Although numerous reports of " transits " by heavenly bodies passing in front of the sun were received , no reliable observation of Vulcan was ever made .
( Le Verrier also theorized the existence of a second asteroid belt in the solar system .
He got that one wrong , too . )
Le Verrier steadfastly maintained Vulcan 's existence to his dying day in 1877 .
The hubbub pretty much died with him and the idea was put to rest for good with the publication of Albert Einstein 's theory of relativity in 1915 , which explained Mercury 's eccentric orbit as a byproduct of the sun 's gravitational pull rather than the presence of a nearby planet .

The Hacker 's Diet Online
How to lose weight and hair
through stress and poor nutrition
Introduction
The computer tools associated with my 1991 book The Hacker 's Diet were originally developed as spreadsheets and macros for Microsoft Excel .
In 2000 , I released a version of the computer tools for PalmOS handheld devices , with a desktop component able to create HTML documents from weight and exercise logs kept on the handheld .
For a long time , I 've wanted to move away from these proprietary platforms , and given the ubiquity of the Web , a browser - based Web application seemed an attractive solution — no longer would the user be tied to a particular computer or PDA ; log entries could be updated and consulted from any machine with access to the Web .
After a protracted on - and - off development process occupying more than a calendar year , The Hacker 's Diet Online is now available .
Creating an Account and Signing In
To create an account , visit the main Hacker 's Diet Online Sign
In page :
https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/
Click the “ Create a New Account ” button , and the new account form will be displayed .
Choose a user name and password , which is entered twice to ensure it 's correct ( the “ Match ” box will be checked if the password and confirmation agree ) .
The “ Strength ” field displays an estimate of the security of the password on a scale of 0 to 10 .
Your E- mail address is required so that a replacement password can be supplied in case you forget your original password .
Your E- mail address will not be disclosed to third parties , and Fourmilab will not send you junk mail .
You can , if you wish , enter your name ; this is optional .
If you enter your height , it will be used to compute the scientifically dubious Body Mass Index .
You can keep your log entries in units of kilograms , pounds , or stones and pounds , and you can change the unit in which weights are entered and displayed independent of units in the database .
Similarly , energy balance can be expressed in ( kilo ) calories or kilojoules .
You can choose whether numbers are displayed with a period or comma as the decimal separator character .
If you want to make your logs visible to the public under an automatically - assigned pseudonym , check the “ Public name ” box .
All of these items , with the exception of the User Name , can be changed from the Settings form , so if you 're unsure about any of the optional items , you can leave them until later .
All text items in The Hacker 's Diet Online , including user names and passwords , can contain any Unicode graphic characters whatsoever ; if your name happens to be “ 成吉思汗 ” or you fancy a password of “ الجبر Лобаче́вский ” , go right ahead — if you can type it , and your browser can display it , The Hacker 's Diet Online can handle it .
After creating your new account , log in using the user name and password you selected .
You 'll be taken to a blank monthly log for the current month .
Checking the “ Handheld device ” box selects formatting appropriate to devices with small screens such as personal digital assistants and mobile telephones .
On such devices you can bookmark the special URL :
https://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/HackDiet/?handheld=y
which automatically checks the “ Handheld device ” box and displays a sign in page adapted for a small screen .
The “ Remember me ” box causes a “ cookie ” to be stored in your browser which permits you to sign in without entering your user name and password ; do n't select this option if you are signing in from a public terminal or somebody else 's computer .
At the top of every page in The Hacker 's Diet Online is a navigation bar .
The following sections show the functions available on the various pages accessible from the bar .
This form is used to enter items in a monthly log .
When you sign in , the current month 's log is displayed .
When you enter a weight , the trend is calculated for that day and the Variance ( difference between today 's weight and the trend ) appears in the “ Var. ” field , positive if the weight is above the trend , negative if below .
Weight and variance are displayed to one decimal place for kilograms and pounds .
When stones ( a predominantly British unit of weight equal to 14 pounds ) are chosen as the weight unit , weight is shown in stones and pounds separated by a space ; for example , a weight of 152.7 pounds would appear as “ 10 12.7 ” .
When weight is set to stones , variance continues to be shown in pounds — a variance of one or more stones would indicate something seriously amiss !
If you 're following the exercise program presented in The Hacker 's Diet , use the “ Rung ” field to record which rung on the exercise ladder you completed that day .
You can use the “ Flag ” field to mark any recurrent event you 're interested in keeping track of on an ongoing basis , for example , whether you found the time for a game of tennis or had an ice cream snack before turning in for the night .
The “ Comments ” field can be used to record any text you like ( up to 4096 characters ) .
To duplicate the previous nonblank item in a column , enter a single period in the field .
This is handy for entering exercise rung entries , which change infrequently and rarely at all once you 've reached your goal .
If you use the comments field to note when you 're out of town , you can just enter a period when you 're in the same place as the day before .
If you must enter a comment consisting of a single period , enter a space after the period .
Abbreviated Weight Entry .
Weight generally changes little from day to day , but if your scale reads to the nearest 100 or 200 grams ( or the equivalent in pounds ) , a given day 's weight will rarely be identical to that of the day before .
This limits the utility of the field copying trick discussed in the last paragraph .
The monthly log permits you to abbreviate weight entries which differ slightly from the last .
If you enter a decimal point followed by a single digit , the previous weight entry will be copied with the decimal digit replaced by the digit you specified .
For example , if yesterday 's weight was 73.8 kg and you enter “ .6 ” , today 's weight will be entered as 73.6 kg .
Similarly , entering a single digit followed by a decimal point and another digit copies the previous weight , replacing its units and decimal place with those you entered .
If yesterday you weighed 158.2 pounds and today you tipped the scale at a mere 157.9 , you need only enter “ 7.9 ” for today 's weight .
If the decimal place is zero , you need not enter it — simply enter the units digit followed by a decimal point .
Previous
Weight You
Enter New
Weight 11 9.3 6 . 11 6.0 11 6.2 4.8 11 4.8 10 11.7 2 . 10 12.0 10 11.5 9 . 10 9.0 10 9.9 10.2 10 10.2
When the weight unit is set to stones you may use the abbreviations above to change the pounds and decimal place of the previous stone and pound display .
In addition , when the display unit is set to stones , if the previous entry has a pounds field between 10 and 13 and you enter a single digit , decimal point , and optional decimal digit , the action taken depends on the units digit you enter .
If it 's between 0 and 3 , it replaces the last digit of the pounds in the last entry , but if the digit is 4 or greater ( which is invalid in a stones and pounds display ) , that digit replaces the two digit pounds field in the previous entry .
This reduces the typing required if your weight happens to fluctuate around X stones 10 .
In addition , when the display unit is stones , you may enter two digits followed by a decimal point and an optional decimal digit to replace the pounds field of the last stones and pounds entry ; you must enter the decimal point to distinguish the entry from one denoting an even number of stones .
The examples in the table at the right should clarify how this works in practice .
Incrementing and Decrementing Exercise Rung .
To increment the exercise rung by one from the most recent entry , enter a plus sign in the Rung field .
To decrement the rung by one , enter a minus sign .
Each monthly log page includes a chart .
The weight and trend are plotted in the “ Floats and Sinkers ” form described in the book : the trend is drawn as a solid red line with each day's weight shown as a diamond attached to the trend by a green line which shows the extent to which it is above or below the trend .
Days for which the “ Flag ” box is checked in the log are shown as yellow diamonds ; days not flagged are filled with white .
The vertical axis at the left gives the weight scale and the days of the month are shown on the horizontal axis .
Below the chart , a snapshot analysis of last week 's weight gain / loss and calorie excess / deficit is given ; for a longer term analysis visit the Trend page .
If one or more days of the month have the Flag box checked , the percentage of flagged days follows the calorie balance .
If the monthly log contains any entries in the exercise Rung column , a blue line is plotted showing daily exercise level ( blank for any day the Rung is not filled in ) with a Rung scale from 1 to 48 at the right of the chart .
The scale is adjusted so the last rung in the chart is explicitly labelled .
If the month displayed is within or after the conclusion of a diet plan created by the Diet Calculator , and the user has indicated the plan should appear in the chart , the plan is drawn as a dashed yellow line , with dates after the end of the plan shown as a horizontal line at the plan 's goal weight .
By comparing the actual trend as it evolves with the plan , you can evaluate your progress toward the goal .
After arriving at the goal , the constant goal weight provides a reference for evaluating the subsequent evolution of the trend .
You can navigate to earlier and later months by clicking the navigation buttons to the left and right of the month title .
The “ History ” item on the navigation bar displays a calendar of monthly logs present in the database .
Click on any month to display its monthly log .
Historical charts , covering standard periods of one month , a quarter ( three months ) , six months , and one year ending at the present , or a custom interval of your choosing can be displayed by setting the controls below the chart .
An historical chart showing the trend over the requested duration ( assuming the requisite log entries are present ) is plotted and a trend analysis for the period charted is shown at the bottom of the chart .
As with monthly charts , the exercise rung ( if used ) is plotted as a blue line and the Diet Plan ( if it covers any portion of the charted period and the user has checked the box to request it be plotted ) is shown as a dashed yellow line .
Historical charts covering a one month interval differ from charts in the monthly log in that the latter always show days of a single month , while one month historical charts display a period which may span month boundaries .
In the early days of a month a one month historical chart may give you a better perspective on the evolution of the trend than a monthly chart which only shows a handful of days .
Short term historical charts plot weight and flag entries as “ floats and sinkers ” in the same form as monthly charts , but these are excluded from longer - term charts in which they would create such clutter as to render them useless .
In such charts , as in the example above , the weight is plotted as a grey line .
Over periods of a quarter or longer , only the trend really matters anyway .
The Trend Analysis page uses information in current and prior monthly logs to calculate your average weekly weight loss or gain and the corresponding average daily calorie deficit or excess .
For each time period linear regression is used to fit a straight - line trend and the rate of change in weight and calorie balance are determined from its slope as described in the book .
For each interval , the minimum , average ( arithmetic mean ) , and maximum values of the weight trend are shown .
The standard intervals all end at the present .
You can analyse the trend between any two dates in the database by checking the “ Custom ” box and specifying the starting and ending dates .
The “ Modify Account Settings ” page allows you to change any of the settings you specified when you created your account apart from the User Name , which is the fundamental identification of the account .
Password
To change your password , enter the desired new password in the “ Password ” and “ Retype password ” fields .
The “ Match ” box indicates if the two fields match , as required .
The “ Strength ” field shows an estimate of the degree of security of the password on a scale of one to ten .
E-mail address
The E - mail address is used in case you forget your password .
By entering your user name and this E - mail address , a new password will be generated and sent to you at this address .
The E - mail address is also used as the address to which replies to feedback messages will be sent .
Unlike every other text field in The Hacker 's Diet Online , the E- mail address is restricted to characters valid in an Internet E-mail address .
First , Last , and Middle Name / Initial
These optional fields allow you to specify your real name or a fantasy pseudonym , if you prefer ; you can change them at any time , and you 're free to use whatever convention you like for your name , and any Unicode character within it .
Height
You can specify your height in either centimetres or feet and inches .
If specified , the height will be used to compute the so - called Body Mass Index , which is notorious for deeming champion athletes in a variety of demanding sports “ obese ” due to their muscle mass .
Still , some people give credence to this number , and if you 'd like to see it , we 'll be happy to compute it .
Weight unit Log
This item selects the unit of weight in which monthly logs are kept .
Set it to the unit you use most frequently .
You 're free to change the log unit at any time , but the change only affects logs created subsequent to the change .
Existing logs remain in the unit in effect at the time of their creation .
Display Regardless of the log unit , you can display weight in the Monthly Log , Chart , and Trend Analysis forms in any of the available units .
Changing the Display unit does not convert the log to that unit , so you may change it as often as you wish without fear of losing precision .
When the Display unit differs from the Log unit , be sure to enter weight in the Monthly Log form in the Display unit — it would n't make sense to write a number in kilograms at the end of a table displayed in pounds !
Your entry is stored , however , in the log unit .
Energy unit
In Europe , the energy content of food is often given in kilojoules , the SI unit of energy , instead of ( kilo ) calories ; one calorie is equal to about 4.18 kilojoules .
If you 're used to thinking in kilojoules instead of calories , set the energy unit accordingly .
When the energy unit is set to kilojoules ( abbreviated " kJ " ) , energy balance values in the Monthly Log , Chart , Trend Analysis , and Diet Calculator will use that unit .
( When a kJ value is entered in the diet calculator , it will be rounded to the nearest integral calorie equivalent . )
Changing the energy unit only affects how food values are displayed in the various forms — you may change it as frequently as you wish without loss of precision in the database .
Decimal character
You can choose whether numbers are displayed with a period ( “ . ” ) or comma ( “ , ” ) as the separator between units and decimal places .
Regardless of this setting , you can always enter numbers with either a period or comma as the decimal separator .
Public name
If the “ Pseudonym ” box is checked , your logs ( with comments elided ) , charts , and trend information will be visible to other users under the indicated automatically generated pseudonym .
To keep your information private , uncheck the box .
If you 'd like to have a new pseudonym assigned , check the “ Assign new pseudonym ? ” box and see if you like the result any better .
The “ Utilities ” page provides access to all of the functions of The Hacker 's Diet Online : those available directly from the navigation bar and less frequently used facilities linked only to this grab - bag of a page .
Only functions available exclusively from the Utilities page are discussed below .
The Diet Calculator allows you to plan a change in weight , either loss or gain , exploring the relationship between the calorie deficit or excess and the duration of the diet .
The resulting diet plan can optionally be shown in the monthly and historical charts , allowing you to monitor your progress and to display a constant target weight at the conclusion of the diet .
The Diet Calculator is displayed from “ Utilities ” page of the navigation bar .
When you first display the Diet Calculator , the daily calorie balance is set to −500 calories per day ( which results in the loss of about a pound per week , as discussed in the book ) , and the initial weight to the most recent trend value , rounded to the nearest whole number .
Weights are shown in the display unit selected in the account settings , which may be temporarily changed with the selection box to the right of the “ Initial Weight ” .
The initial goal weight is arbitrarily set to 5 kilograms or 10 pounds less than the starting weight ; adjust this to your personal weight goal .
The default starting date of the diet is the current date ;
The “ Diet duration ” fields will then show the duration of the diet in weeks and months and the “ End date ” when you may expect to achieve the goal weight .
This form is fully associative — you may change any quantity and the form will recalculate the others accordingly .
Setting the daily calorie balance adjusts the weight change per week , duration , and end date of the diet .
The calorie balance should be negative if you wish to lose weight and positive if your intention is to gain weight .
You may change the initial weight and goal weight to any values you wish , which adjusts the desired weight change and recomputes the duration of the diet .
If you change the desired weight change , the goal weight is modified to reflect the new difference from the initial weight and the diet duration recalculated .
Changing the start date adjusts the end date based on the estimated duration of the diet .
Adjusting the weight change per week , weeks or months to go , or the end date modifies the daily calorie balance to achieve the desired weight change in the specified period of time .
The values you specify in the Diet Calculator are saved and reappear when you return to the Diet Calculator .
If you check the “ Plot plan in chart ” box , the course of the planned diet is shown as a dashed yellow line in the chart displays for the duration of the diet and subsequently as a horizontal dashed line representing your weight maintenance goal .
If you find this distracting , simply uncheck the box .
To plot the goal weight in charts without the sloping diet plan , set the initial and goal weights to the same value and the start date before the first month in the log .
If you 'd like to make your progress visible to visitors of your Web page or log , this item allows you to configure a “ badge ” in the form of a small , dynamically generated image which you can include on your personal Web pages .
The image appears like the sample to the right and shows the date of your most recent weight log entry and the weight as of that date .
Below , the analysis of a trend whose duration you can select between one week and one year is presented , with the daily energy ( calorie or kilojoule ) excess or deficit and weekly weight gain or loss estimated from the trend .
Badge generation is initially disabled ; when you enable it by choosing a trend analysis duration , you 're provided with XHTML / HTML code which you can copy and paste into your Web page to display the badge .
The badge image is automatically updated when you make any relevant change to a log ; the image displayed on your page will automatically reflect your most recent log entry .
You can disable badge generation at any time by setting the trend interval to “ Disable badge ” .
Many people , myself included , prefer to log their weight and exercise on paper and then transfer the data to the computer later .
To generate paper log forms , click the “ Print paper log forms ” item .
A form will appear which allows you to specify the first and last month and year of the logs to be printed .
When you click “ Generate ” , a document containing the requested log forms opens in a new window , and a print request is automatically queued a second later ( allowing the document to render in the browser ) .
( If JavaScript is disabled , you 'll have to manually print the document and navigate back to the request page with the “ Back ” button . )
The paper log form document uses a paged media style sheet to insert page breaks between each monthly log ; it 's up to your browser to handle this style element properly — if it does n't , there 's nothing I can do about it .
The trend at the start of a month depends upon the trend at the end of the preceding month , and so on all the way back to the first month in the database .
Because trend computation is a computationally intensive task , The Hacker 's Diet Online stores the trend carried forward from the previous month with the log data for each month , avoiding the need to compute the trend for previous months except in unusual situations ( for example , if you import a CSV or XML file containing data for a month in the past , or enter or modify data for a prior month ) .
This is all handled automatically .
These stored trend values are “ fragile ” in the sense that if a hardware or software error should manage to clobber the trend , it will result in incorrect trend and variance computation for all entries for the month , and there 's no direct way to enter the correct trend carry forward to replace the bad value .
To guard against such an eventuality , The Hacker 's Diet Online provides the ability to completely recompute all trends from the fundamental log entries .
You 'll probably never need to use this feature , but just in case you do , it 's there .
When you check the “ Remember me ” box on the Sign In page , a “ persistent login cookie ” is stored in your Web browser so that you may subsequently log in from that browser and computer without specifying your user name and password .
If you use multiple browsers and / or computers , separate persistent logins are maintained for each .
This item invalidates all stored persistent logins for your account .
The next time you wish to sign in from any computer or browser , you will have to specify your user name and password .
You can use this item when you 've accidentally signed in from somebody else 's computer or a public terminal with “ Remember me ” and wish to make sure somebody can't access your account from that machine .
You can export your Hacker 's Diet Online databases in a variety of formats , including CSV files which you can import into the Palm Eat Watch application and even the legacy Excel spreadsheets .
If your interest is in making a local backup of your files on the Fourmilab server , the best choices are The Hacker 's Diet Online 's native XML and extended CSV formats , which preserve all information in the online databases .
The XML export format is specified by a Document Type Definition which permits it to be used with a validating XML parser and includes a style sheet which allows XML export files to be displayed in an XML - aware browser .
The following links show examples of single - month exports in the various formats .
If you 've been keeping Hacker 's Diet logs in Excel or another spreadsheet or database package , you may want to transfer your existing logs to the online application .
To do this , save the logs you wish to upload in Comma Separated Value ( .csv ) format .
If you 're using a different program to keep your logs , be careful the columns in the CSV file are the same as those used by the Excel macros or the Palm Eat Watch program .
Only the Date , Weight , Rung , Flag , and Comment columns are imported — the other fields are recomputed as required .
In logs using the conventions of the Excel macros , comments appear as non-numeric entries in the Weight column ; it is n't possible to attach a comment to a day for which a weight is entered .
You can import logs in any of the four export formats described above .
For CSV imports , you can even mix formats within a single import , as long as the header records are included before each sequence being imported .
An XML export file must be imported by itself , but may contain any number of months of log entries .
By default , items from the file being imported will not overwrite existing log entries ; to permit imported data to override entries in the online database , check the “ Allow overwrite ” box in the import section you 're using .
The data you enter into The Hacker 's Diet Online is stored on the Fourmilab server farm , which has multiple redundant components to prevent single - point failures .
All data are backed up nightly to tapes , which are kept off - site and never reused .
Still , it 's nice have your own private copy of the original data , and you can obtain one with this item , which allows you to download a ZIPped archive named “ hackdiet_log_backup_
YYYY - MM - DD .zip ” which contains a collection of YYYY - MM .hdb files , one for each monthly log you 've entered .
These files are in the native data format used by The Hacker 's Diet Online , and contain all the information present on the server .
Users who wish to install
The Hacker 's Diet Online application on their own server can install these files directly into their user directory on that machine .
Ever since writing The Hacker 's Diet , I have frequently remarked that one of the best things about writing a diet book is that it provides a tremendous incentive not to regain the weight you lost ; if you do , you 'll be the laughingstock of all your readers .
The Hacker 's Diet Online provides a similar incentive to confident participants — they can , if they wish , make their progress visible to other users of the application ( but not the general public ) under an automatically assigned pseudonym .
( You can't choose the pseudonym , but if you do n't like the one you were given , you can request a different one from the “ Settings ” page . )
Users browsing a public account can view logs , plot historical charts , and perform trend analyses .
Private information , for example comments in log entries , is hidden from those browsing the account and , of course , public access is entirely read - only .
You are free to revoke public access to your account at any time ; just uncheck the “ Pseudonym ” box in the “ Settings ” page .
While all public access is via pseudonyms , really confident users are perfectly free to disclose their pseudonym on a personal Web page or log .
To make this application the best it can be , your problem reports , suggestions for improvements , feature requests , reactions to the documentation , and general comments are essential .
You can send them easily using the Send Feedback page accessible from the “ Utility ” menu .
Please specify an appropriate category for your message .
If you 'd like a copy of the feedback message sent to the E - mail address for your account , check the box at the bottom .
The complete source code for The Hacker 's Diet Online application , written in the Perl language using the Literate Programming methodology , is available for people with their own Web servers who wish to install a private copy , or for developers and other curious folks who'd like to look under the hood to see how it works or re-use components in other Web applications .
The source code is in the public domain and may be used in any manner without any restrictions whatsoever , but it is utterly unsupported — you are entirely on your own .
This is a large and reasonably complex application : more than 27,000 lines of code and documentation , with components in the Perl , JavaScript , Cascading Style Sheet , XML Document Type Definition , and LaTeX languages .
Installing it on a different server requires substantial work in changing settings for the server environment and establishing the initial database structure .
If you decide to undertake this task , you 'll have to puzzle it out yourself — I cannot offer any assistance .
The goal of Literate Programming is to create programs which can be read as an essay as well as run on a computer .
The process of building the program automatically creates a PDF file which contains all of the code and documentation .
This document is presently in excess of 610 pages , and may be read with any PDF viewer application .
The formatting of this document is somewhat flawed at present : some long lines and sequences of code overflow the page .
I am in the process of cleaning these up on a “ time available ” basis .

The secret first draft of the notorious Iraq dossier that helped to take Britain to war is expected to be released tomorrow , in a victory for freedom of information campaigners .
The early version written by John Williams , then director of communications at the Foreign Office , has been the subject of a three - year legal wrangle amid hopes that it could reveal whether the supposedly intelligence - led dossier was actually based on a press officer 's script - and whether it was subsequently ' sexed up ' by Alastair Campbell .
The draft is understood not to contain the infamous claim that Saddam Hussein could launch a strike with ' weapons of mass destruction ' within 45 minutes , a claim that was central to the final ' dodgy dossier ' .
Yesterday Williams attacked the decision to withhold the document for so long .
' If the government withholds a piece of paper , it immediately makes it significant ; it almost does n't matter what it says , ' he argued .
' That 's what I said at the time : why are we withholding it ?'
A former journalist , who left Whitehall in May , Williams said the row was particularly frustrating as he had never wanted the government to produce a dossier .
He had argued , he said , that rather than attempting to prove that Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction , the government should have challenged him to prove he did not : ' I was against the idea of a dossier because I thought it was wrong . '
The Hutton inquiry into the road to war on Iraq identified the existence of an early draft by Williams , but was told by Campbell that it had become ' redundant ' when John Scarlett , then chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee linking Downing Street to the security services , took charge of the process .
However , an information tribunal last month ruled that the Williams draft should be disclosed .
Anti-war campaigners regard it as key evidence of who introduced the most contentious material into the final draft , and whether Scarlett was too heavily influenced by aides with an interest in making a case for war .
Williams said that critics of the war were likely to find significant similarities between his draft and Scarlett 's version , but insisted that should not be surprising since both were working with ' the same assumptions , the same policy , with much of the same material ' .
David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , is expected to confirm in a statement to the Commons tomorrow that the government will bow to the information tribunal 's ruling , rather than exercising ministerial powers to veto it or challenge it in court .
Ministers had argued that the draft should not be disclosed because it jeopardised the confidentiality - and therefore candour - of advice given to them by civil servants .
The release is in response to pressure by Chris Ames , a former charity worker from Surrey , who began pursuing the document early in 2005 .
The government will hope that the publication finally draws a line under the sorry saga of the dossier , which led indirectly to the suicide of scientist David Kelly after he was identified as the apparent source of BBC reports that the dossier had been ' overspun ' by Campbell .
Most of the news you hear about the dollar these days is doom and gloom .
But the fact is , there ’s hope for the American currency still .
Read on to see what 10 experts say is the way to pull the dollar back on its feet .
Gary North , president of the Institute for Christian Economics : " To save the dollar , save a dollar . "
Gary North believes that Americans need to get back to a personal finance policy of thriftiness .
He argues that by saving , consumers would spend less on foreign goods , and therefore help close up the trade deficit that brings the dollar down .
Todd Wenning , The Motley Fool : " We should n’t forget that the currency markets are cyclical .
The dollar will strengthen , then weaken , and then strengthen again , ad infinitum . "
Tod Wenning believes that there ’s nothing to be worried about .
According to his belief , the dollar will rebound because the forces keeping it down currently will " reach equilibrium or even reverse the trend . "
Robert Rubin , former US Treasury Secretary : " Our objective ought to be to have a strong currency based on sound policy . "
Rubin ’s solution is to keep government spending down while raising revenue .
This means curbing entitlements like Social Security and Medicare , while increasing productivity though support of education , research and infrastructure .
Minos Zombanakis : " The dollar can no longer act as the sole reserve currency in the world . "
Although Minos Zombanakis ’ comment hails from 1979 , his idea still holds true today .
This banker , an expert on dealing with the Saudis , argues that " the dependence of the world on the dollar is not a blessing but a curse for America . "
Its status as a world currency allows US banks to flood the world market with dollars , so much so that they lose value .
Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research : A weaker dollar is " the solution , not the problem . "
Dean Baker sees little trouble from a faltering dollar , and argues that it ’s just what we need .
He argues that it helps keep trade balanced , and cheaper dollars create an incentive for foreigners to buy US goods .
Alternately , a more expensive dollar is a boom to importers , making their goods cheaper .
David Malpass , Bear Stearns Chief Economist : " The Fed ’s in a good position if it wanted to strengthen the dollar . "
David Malpass believes the Federal Reserve can rebound the dollar by cutting rates .
He explains , " by cutting rates well before economic weakness , it has room to express stronger interest in the dollar ’s recovery . "
This , according to Malpass , would show a preference for the dollar and increase demand .
Ron Paul , Congressman and Presidential Candidate : " The root of this crisis , as with past financial and economic crises , results from federal government intervention into the economy . "
Dr. Paul believes the trouble with the US economy and dollar is government intervention .
In one of his most recent writings , he points to federal assistance as the culprit for the mortgage crisis , citing programs that allowed consumers to buy homes when they really were n’t prepared to do so .
His answer to our money troubles is to let them work themselves out in the market by putting an end to government muddling .
Andrew Milligan , Standard Life Investments global strategy head : " The dollar will continue to go down until finally the rest of the world responds . "
Although Andrew Milligan seems to express hope for the dollar , he does n’t think the dollar ’s rescue will come from the US .
His prescription is to get foreign central banks to cut their interest rates .
According to Milligan , this will happen when the dollar ’s decline starts to impact corporate earnings in Europe .
Jim Rogers , Chairman of Beeland Interests : " Do your patriotic duty and help them get the dollar down . "
Jim Rogers believes that in order to save the dollar , we have to drive its value down .
He argues that we have to stop printing too many dollars and stop inflation .
Otherwise , investors wo n’t support a currency that ’s shooting itself in the foot .
The exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin , who is accused of insulting Islam , will be allowed to stay in India it emerged today – but only if she remains in a government flat in a secret location in Delhi , unable to receive visitors or step outside her door .
The Indian foreign affairs ministry justified the conditions saying that as a " guest " Nasrin should not " undertake actions that could hurt the sentiments of the many communities that make up our multi-religious and multi-ethnic nation . "
Speaking via email from her safe house in Delhi today , Nasrin rejected the Indian government 's description of her as a " guest " , emphasising that she has been a resident in India since 2004 .
" The Indian constitution upholds democracy , secularism , human rights and freedom of expression , exactly what I have been fighting for , " she said .
" I think this warning goes against freedom or expression , which is a vital part of democracy . "
Nasrin fled her adopted home of Kolkata in November after Muslims protested violently against " anti-Islamic " passages in her works .
The rioting was brought to an end only when the army was deployed in the city – and the writer forced to flee .
The 45 - year - old told the Guardian that she had been told her " residency permit " would be extended just days before it expired , but for an unspecified time .
Her only company is a television and her laptop .
" I can not live a normal life like this .
[ Officials ] said because if I went outside 10 people would die in riots .
I do n't believe them , " said Nasrin .
" I want to stay in India but I do n't know how long they will allow me to remain . "
Nasrin said she was a " prisoner without prisoner rights " .
" I get food and medicines bought to me .
It is prison food .
I want prisoners ' rights .
Let me have visiting hours . "
Lawyers today questioned whether such a " detention " was legal under Indian law .
Indira Jaisingh , a supreme court lawyer , said the government had probably used a 1946 " foreigners ' act " to restrict the writer 's movements .
" I think it is almost certainly illegal and could be challenged in the courts .
The act is usually used for criminals wanted by the police .
Here it has been used pre-emptively but not proportionately .
The constitution guarantees freedom of life and liberty to anyone on Indian soil . "
The British author Hari Kunzru , who is an executive member of the writers ' organisation English PEN and has been in regular contact with Nasrin during the last few months , described the Indian government 's position as a " mixed blessing " .
" She 's not being put back into immediate danger , " he said , " but there seems to be a lack of political will to do anything about her situation .
The Indian government is trying to kick this problem into the long grass rather than deal with its responsibility to uphold freedom of expression . "
He said he held out little hope that her state of " suspended animation " would improve .
" Unless somebody in the Indian government is prepared to take a political risk , standing up to say why she should be defended , " he said , " this could go on indefinitely .
I 'm frankly not very hopeful that somebody will do that . "
" She 's a defiant , strong woman who has lived for a long time with a real threat of violence , so she 's used to it , " he continued , but " indefinite detention is a form of torture . "
Earlier in the week , intellectuals had called on the government to give the writer citizenship and permanent residency in India , saying it was the state duty to protect " freedom of speech " .
Nasrin , who has lived in India since 2000 , has been targeted by radical Muslim groups in the past six months over her autobiography , Dwi-Khandita , where she commented on the relationship the prophet Muhammad had with his dozen wives and also said that the Qur'an had advised against friendships with non-Muslims .
The book had been recalled and the passages deleted at the end of 2007 .
" [ Dwi - Khandita ] was basically defaming the Prophet , " said Mohammad Anwer , spokesman for the Jamia Ulama - i- Hind which runs thousands of religious schools in India .
" It is best she is forgotten about .
Let her abide by the government 's conditions . "
The reason why even professional basketball and soccer players sometimes miss an easy shot may be partly explained by spontaneous fluctuations of electrical activity within the brain , a study suggests .
An experiment conducted by researchers at Washington University , in Missouri , US , found that fluctuations in brain activity caused volunteers to subconsciously exert slightly less physical force when pressing a button on cue .
Crucially , this activity is independent of any external stimulus and does not appear related to attention or anticipation .
The scientists involved say it is the first direct evidence that internal instabilities – so - called “ spontaneous brain activity ” – may play an important role in the variability of human behaviour .
From the mid-1990s onwards , brain - scanning techniques have revealed variable brain activity that appears unrelated to external stimuli and occurs even when a person is asleep or anaesthetized .

But just how such fluctuations in neuronal firings may influence physical behaviour has proven different to untangle .
To explore the issue , Michael Fox at Washington University and colleagues designed an experiment that involved monitoring volunteers ’ brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) as they performed a simple finger - tapping task .
Weaker response
The 17 volunteers were asked to push a button with their right hand as soon as they saw an on - screen prompt and the timing and force of each button press were recorded .
As expected , the brain scans revealed increased activity within the left motor cortex – the region associated with controlling movement of the right hand – shortly after each button - pushing prompt .
Fox and colleagues also monitored spontaneous activity within the left motor cortex by analysing its “ mirror image ” in the right motor cortex .
This allowed them to see how spontaneous brain activity affected each button press , independent of the “ task - related ” brain signals .
The researchers found that volunteers pressed the button with about half the force , on average , if spontaneous activity occurred a few seconds before each prompt .
Missed goals
“ This is the first clear evidence that [ spontaneous brain activity ] has some behavioural significance , ” says Rasmus Birn of the National Institute of Health in Maryland , US , who was not involved with the research .
Fox admits that it remains unclear how spontaneous activity in the motor cortex might cause people to tap their fingers more gently , but speculates that it could be because the activity fools the brain into thinking the finger has already moved partly towards the button .
He suggests that spontaneous brain activity may perhaps explain why people engaging in sports sometimes miss an apparently easy goal or basket , by altering the force with which they kick or throw a ball .
However , Birn cautions that , “ it remains to be seen whether this result holds for more complex cognitive tasks or other brain regions or networks ” .

OTTAWA – Conservatives and Liberals duelled today for the favour of women voters but it was the NDP that fired the most sensational shot .
However , it eventually turned out that Irene Mathyssen , a New Democrat MP from London , Ont. , was firing blanks .
Mathyssen stunned all sides by complaining that she 'd seen Tory MP James Moore checking out a " scantily clad " woman on his laptop computer in Parliament .
Moore , a parliamentary secretary from British Columbia , vehemently denied the claim .
And late Wednesday , Mathyssen apologized to Moore .
NDP spokesman Ian Capstick said Mathyssen phoned Moore and he explained to her that the photos she 'd seen on his laptop were of his girlfriend .
" Ms. Mathyssen has accepted the explanation and offered her apology to Mr. Moore , " Capstick said .
" Ms. Mathyssen will be making a formal statement in the House of Commons at her earliest opportunity . "
Mathyssen 's titillating assertion capped a day in which Liberals and Tories competed over which party cares most about Canadian women – all of it occurring on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the massacre of 14 women at Montreal 's Ecole Polytechnique .
Liberals set off the contest by unveiling the second volume of their so - called pink book , a set of policy proposals developed by their female MPs aimed improving the lot of abused , aboriginal , immigrant and rural women .
Liberals hope the proposals will help cement the party 's position as the favourite among women voters , well ahead of the Tories in most opinion polls .
In the Commons , Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion blasted the Tory government for ignoring women 's issues .
" Women continue to suffer discrimination , they continue to suffer abuse and violence , they continue to struggle for basic equality and on all of this the government 's track record is abysmal , " Dion charged .
He rattled off a litany of Conservative sins , including removing the word equality from the mandate of Status of Women Canada , abolishing the previous Liberal government 's child - care program , cutting women 's programs and eliminating the Court Challenges Program .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper shot back by noting that Dion has not committed to adopting the pink book proposals in the Liberal platform for the next election .
" I wonder if this is just another example of him retreating from his own positions , " Harper scoffed .
Dion later said he does n't want to disclose his platform before an election but added that the pink book gives " a good idea " of what will be in it .
Harper argued that his government has given new child - care benefits directly to parents and has " taken programs that used to spend money on offices and bureaucracy and spent it directly on Canadian women . "
The Liberals , he added , would end all that .
" That is why men and women are going to vote against that party and re-elect this government , " he declared .
The Tories also charged that the worst cuts to social programs , including those aimed at helping women , were made by the Liberals in 1995 , in a bid to tame the national deficit .
The jousting between Liberals and Tories dominated question period .
With the exception of Dion , all Liberal questioners Wednesday were women .
But Mathyssen stole the show shortly after question period with her accusation that she saw " an image of a scantily clad woman " on the screen of Moore 's laptop – in clear view of other MPs and the public gallery on Tuesday evening .

" This is not only disrespectful of women , but it is disrespectful of this House , " she said .
" It reflects an attitude of objectifying women and we know that when women and other human beings are objectified and dehumanized , they become the object of violence and abuse . "
Mathyssen , who sits several rows behind Moore in the Commons , later described the image she saw as " soft porn , Playboy type stuff , " a full - screen view of a woman dressed in " very flimsy lingerie . "
She said no one else saw the image .
When Moore noticed her whispering about it to a colleague , Mathyssen said he closed the window and she saw what appeared to be 16 to 20 similar pictures in the file .
Moore flatly denied spending his time in Parliament viewing risqué photos .
" I do n't have the faintest idea what my colleague is talking about , " he told the Commons .
" I 've taken great efforts throughout all of my political career to treat all of my colleagues with the deepest of respect , " he said .
" I do n't know where this attack is coming from ; where these allegations are coming from .
It is utterly baseless ; utterly nonsensical .
" I would never do anything that is being ascribed to me today .
I take great offence to what 's being alleged here . "
Speaker Peter Milliken refused to pursue Mathyssen 's complaint , saying it is " not a matter of House procedure . "
Tory whip Jay Hill said he takes Moore at his word and will not check his laptop .
The matter became moot a few hours later when Mathyssen apologized .

High - rise dwellers know the challenges of living in a densely stacked box with a bunch of strangers , and have undoubtedly experienced the alarming realization that one ’s neighbours often behave in mysterious ways .
We ’ve heard stories of elevator flatulence , human poop in stairwells , and discarded ironing boards jamming tiny garbage chutes .
As reported by passiveaggressivenotes.com , one Toronto resident has had enough with the small talk , and posted this constructive rant in their apartment building ’s elevator .
Surely more practical than staring at the floor numbers or declaring how it ’s hot ( but a dry heat ) , these topics of discussion could either brand you a busybody or find company for your misery .
What we wanna know is why the lobby always smells weird .
A NEW fad is sweeping across Silicon Valley , causing excitement , confusion and hyperbole not seen since the dotcom bubble .
It began in May , when Mark Zuckerberg , ten days after turning 23 , took the stage in a San Francisco warehouse and announced that he was opening up Facebook , the social network he founded at Harvard University , to outside programmers .
Anyone can now build little programs , or “ widgets ” , into the network .
To illustrate his idea , Mr Zuckerberg projected onto the wall behind him a “ social graph ” — a pattern of nodes representing Facebook users and the links among them .
Since then Facebook and the idea of the social graph have become the favourite , if not the only , topic of conversation among the valley 's geeks , venture capitalists and internet moguls .
Mr Zuckerberg compares his graphing of human connections to the work of Renaissance mapmakers .
Facebook is growing furiously and may catch up with MySpace , the biggest social network .
Outside programmers have added about 5,000 widgets .
One of Facebook 's investors estimates the social network 's revenues in 2007 at only $ 100 m , mostly from selling ad space , with tiny profits .
Nevertheless , the internet 's giants — Yahoo ! , Microsoft and Google — are offering to buy Facebook or a stake in it for a price that would value the firm at many billions .
At a Facebook conference on “ Graphing social patterns , ” panellists said the firm may be worth $ 100 billion and that it is the new Google .
How much of this is hype ?
Facebook has made two genuine breakthroughs .
The first was its decision to let outsiders write programs and keep all the advertising revenues these might earn .
This has led to all kinds of widgets , from the useful ( comparing Facebookers ' music and film tastes , say ) to the inane ( biting each other to become virtual zombies ) .
The entire internet industry reckons this was clever and is planning to copy it .
This week MySpace said it would open its site to outside programmers .
Google , which owns Orkut , a social network extremely popular in Brazil and parts of Asia , is expected to do the same soon .
Facebook 's second masterstroke is its “ mini - feed ” , an event stream on user pages that keeps users abreast of what their friends are doing — uploading photos , adding a widget and so on .
For many users , this is addictive and is the main reason they log on so often .
Jerry Michalski , a consultant , calls the mini-feed a “ data exhaust ” that gives Facebook users “ better peripheral vision ” into the lives of people they know only casually .
This mini-feed is so far the clearest example of using the social graph in a concrete way .
Silicon Valley 's craze for the “ social graph ” , however , is overdone .
The term has been around in computer science for decades , says Eric Schmidt , Google 's chief executive , so it is puzzling that Mr Zuckerberg should get any special credit for using it .
“ We have address books , and the sum of the address books is the social graph , ” he says .
Companies such as Plaxo , which help to synchronise address books , and Google itself , which has a primitive address book in its web - mail service , plan to turn these books into fully fledged social graphs that can do useful and productive things , perhaps including new variants of mini-feeds .
This analogy to address books points to an important limitation for social networks , such as Facebook , compared with older sorts of network , such as the postal or telephone systems .
These benefit from Metcalfe 's Law , which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users .
In other words , the more people have phones , the more useful they become .
This “ network effect ” leads to rapid adoption and puts up barriers for new entrants .
But unlike other networks , social networks lose value once they go beyond a certain size .
“ The value of a social network is defined not only by who 's on it , but by who 's excluded , ” says Paul Saffo , a Silicon Valley forecaster .
Despite their name , therefore , they do not benefit from the network effect .
Already , social networks such as “ aSmallWorld ” , an exclusive site for the rich and famous , are proliferating .
Such networks recognise that people want to hobnob with a chosen few , not to be spammed by random friend - requests .
This suggests that the future of social networking will not be one big social graph but instead myriad small communities on the internet to replicate the millions that exist offline .
No single company , therefore , can capture the social graph .
Ning , a fast - growing company with offices directly across the street from Facebook in Palo Alto , is built around this idea .
It lets users build their own social networks for each circle of friends .
So are Facebook and its graph really worth many billions ?
From an advertiser 's point of view , says Rishad Tobaccowala , the boss of Denuo , the new - media unit of Publicis Groupe , an advertising company , Facebook is so far anything but the new Google .
The search giant does have traditional network effects in its advertising system , he says : it aggregates advertisers and sends them to potential customers who have expressed specific intentions by typing search queries .
But Facebook has only “ large crowds who are communicating without expressing specific interests ” , says Mr Tobaccowala .
On Google , advertisements are valued ; on Facebook they are an annoyance that users ignore .
Facebook might nonetheless be suited for other sorts of marketing .
Reuben Steiger , the founder of Millions of Us , a marketing agency for social networks and virtual worlds , says that brands need to design “ experiences ” that use the social graph to engage groups of friends .
If a wrestling association , say , wants to drum up ticket sales for an upcoming bout , it could build a widget that turns users into wrestlers and lets them fight bad guys and win gifts , while making them aware of the brand and the match .
But that possibility hardly justifies the sorts of valuations bandied around for Facebook and other social networks .
Such valuations , indeed , may reflect a misunderstanding of the social graph .
For bigger companies such as Google , the graph is simply the web of links among its many users .
It can be used to make existing services more useful .
But Google increasingly views such utilities as “ features , not products , ” says Sergey Brin , its co-founder .
Facebook , like many hot start - ups in Silicon Valley , has some fantastic features , but maybe not much more .

Palm unveiled a new smart - phone Thursday that will be available next month for about $ 100 .
That ’s the lowest introductory price yet for a Palm handset and will make the phone , dubbed the Centro , the least expensive smart - phones on the market .
Despite having a different name from its
Treo siblings , the Centro will share with them the Palm operating system , a color touch screen , a full keyboard and the ability to access e–mail and surf the Web .
Initially , Palm will offer the phone exclusively through Sprint for about three months , and it will be able to tap into the carrier ’s high - speed EVDO network .
The phone can be bought for $ 100 after a $ 100 mail - in rebate and is available only to customers who sign up for a two - year service agreement that includes data access plan of more than $ 25 a month .
Although rumors of the Centro ’s imminent launch have been circulating for weeks , investors cheered its official debut , sending Palm ’s stock up as much as $ 1.02 , or 6.6 percent , in trading today .
While Palm jump - started the smart - phone industry with its
Treos , the company has struggled in recent years amid competition from Nokia , Motorola , Research in Motion and Apple .
The Centro is the Sunnyvale company ’s first new U.S. product since it killed its Foleo notebook - like device earlier this month .

BAGHDAD ( AFP ) – Iraq said on Sunday it has no evidence that Iran was supplying militias engaged in fierce street fighting with security forces in Baghdad .
Government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said there was no “ hard evidence ” of involvement by the neighbouring Shiite government of Iran in backing Shiite militiamen in the embattled country .
Asked about reports that weapons captured from Shiite fighters bore 2008 markings suggesting Iranian involvement , Dabbagh said : “ We do n’t have that kind of evidence …
If there is hard evidence we will defend the country . ”
Dabbagh said an Iraqi parliamentary delegation which visited Iran last week had useful discussions with authorities there and secured assurances of support and understanding of the crisis .

This bus , often mired in controversy since the IVAW " Dirty South " tour that left Philly in June , and had Active Duty BBQ's @ Ft Meade , Ft Jackson , Camp Lejeune , Ft Benning , and other Southern Military Posts ( Including an IVAW benefit by Tom Morello , of Rage Against the Machine , and AudioSlave , in Virginia ) as well as backdrop for many a Demonstration , and Ft Drum , NY , organizing parties , has finally died .
This photo shows the huge " Do n't Attack Iran " and " Impeach Bush " logos , that let everybody on the highway know just how the occupants felt about the state of the state .
Owner ~Operator ~ Driver ( and Veteran ) Jim Goodnow pulled into a South Jersey Truck Stop , to catch a 3 or 4 hour nap .
Jim saw , in retrospect , some suspicious activity outside the bus , and about 20 minutes later , the entire engine compartment , and back of the bus was engulfed in flames .
Mr Goodnow speculates that the cause could have been anything from ARSON , to ATTEMPTED MURDER .
He plans to notify the ATF Arson Squad on Saturday morning .

Americans ’ ever - enduring , catatonic sleepwalk through the Empire ’s vast array of bread and circus , as always produced by the Ministry of Truth and the Department of Propaganda , better known as the corporatist media , has succeeded in the creation of an ignorant , incurious and dumbed down populace completely bereft of knowledge of what is done in its name .
With no concern for or understanding of geography , cultures , history , alien societies , the outside world and of the imperial aspirations of the Empire , Americans have proved easy targets to the manipulations and deceptions of the corporatist world .
Seemingly unwilling to gain knowledge of anything outside American Idol or the weekly NASCAR rat race , the soldier ants and worker bees of the Empire are content to circumvent the horrors of war and the myriad crimes against humanity committed in their name in order to maintain their beautiful minds at peace .
Indeed , the corporatist media has triumphed in completely erasing America ’s two disastrous occupations of Muslim lands from the peoples ’ conscious and concern , in effect shifting the ongoing debacles away from the daily reality of Americans and towards the abyss of a most cavernous memory hole .
Methodically and systematically , the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan , with all their inconvenient truths , with all their disturbing realities , with all their corresponding death , suffering and destruction , have virtually vanished into a vacuum of nothingness , transported by the corporatist state into a clandestine and secretive reality , making of these disasters non-existent nightmares that vanish upon the waking of a new day .
This propaganda by omission , this “ out of sight , out of mind ” machination has virtually erased from American reality the disasters unfolding in Iraq and Afghanistan , thus guaranteeing in the public mind a complete ignorance in or understanding of a barbaric continuation to occupations stuck in the quicksand of fierce resistance and never - ending guerilla warfare .
Thus , America ’s aggressive wars , its imperial occupations , its crusade of surge and siege that has done so much harm to millions of people , not to mention to the moral standing of the nation , have become non-existent memories under cover of fog and haze .

Outside a Maryland high school gym last Wednesday , sophomore Brandon Bennett got into a small altercation with a fellow student .
It was after a basketball game and tempers were high , but the the two were separated by officials and students without much problem .
Only then did things get really violent .
According to Julius Bennett , the student 's father , Deputy Anthony Lenzi fired a Taser at his son after being told twice by a senior officer it was not necessary .
" He left two puncture wounds just above his heart in his chest , " says Bennett .
" And [ Brandon ] said to me that he was in quite a bit of pain because he could feel electric shocks going throughout his whole body . "
The father says he has written proof Sgt. Mathew Kempel twice ordered Lenzi to holster the weapon , but Lenzi fired anyway , hitting the teen in the chest .
" Brandon did absolutely nothing wrong , " says Bennett , " and there was no reason to use that type of force on my son . "
The Queen Anne's County Sheriff 's Office says Lenzi has been reassigned to internal duties while authorities investigate the allegations .
Bennett is hoping fair punishment is given .
" I will not be satisfied until I know that Deputy Lenzi will be in a position to never to this to anyone else 's child ever again . "

CV readers , ahead of the curve as usual , are well aware of the notion of Boltzmann 's Brains -- see e.g. here , here , and even the original paper here .
Now Dennis Overbye has brought the idea to the hoi polloi by way of the New York Times .
It 's a good article , but I wanted to emphasize something Dennis says quite explicitly , but ( from experience ) I know that people tend to jump right past in their enthusiasm :
Nobody in the field believes that this is the way things really work , however .
The point about Boltzmann 's Brains is not that they are a fascinating prediction of an exciting new picture of the multiverse .
On the contrary , the point is that they constitute a reductio ad absurdum that is meant to show the silliness of a certain kind of cosmology -- one in which the low - entropy universe we see is a statistical fluctuation around an equilibrium state of maximal entropy .
According to this argument , in such a universe you would see every kind of statistical fluctuation , and small fluctuations in entropy would be enormously more frequent than large fluctuations .
Our universe is a very large fluctuation ( see previous post ! ) but a single brain would only require a relatively small fluctuation .
In the set of all such fluctuations , some brains would be embedded in universes like ours , but an enormously larger number would be all by themselves .
This theory , therefore , predicts that a typical conscious observer is overwhelmingly likely to be such a brain .
But we ( or at least I , not sure about you ) are not individual Boltzmann brains .
So the prediction has been falsified , and that kind of theory is not true .
( For arguments along these lines , see papers by Dyson , Kleban , and Susskind , or Albrecht and Sorbo . )
I tend to find this kind of argument fairly persuasive .
But the bit about " a typical observer " does raise red flags .
In fact , folks like Hartle and Srednicki have explicitly argued that the assumption of our own " typicality " is completely unwarranted .
Imagine , they say , two theories of life in the universe , which are basically indistinguishable , except that in one theory there is no life on Jupiter and in the other theory the Jovian atmosphere is inhabited by six trillion intelligent floating Saganite organisms .
In the second theory , a " typical " intelligent observer in the Solar System is a Jovian , not a human .
But I 'm a human .
Have we therefore ruled out this theory ?
Pretty clearly not .
Hartle and Srednicki conclude that it 's incorrect to imagine that we are necessarily typical ; we are who we observe ourselves to be , and any theory of the universe that is compatible with observers like ourselves is just as good as any other such theory .
This is an interesting perspective , and the argument is ongoing .
But it 's important to recognize that there is a much stronger argument against the idea that Boltzmann 's Brains were originally invented to counter -- that our universe is just a statistical fluctuation around an equilibrium background .
We might call this the " Boltzmann 's Universe " argument .
Here 's how it goes .
Forget that we are " typical " or any such thing .
Take for granted that we are exactly who we are -- in other words , that the macrostate of the universe is exactly what it appears to be , with all the stars and galaxies etc .
By the " macrostate of the universe , " we mean everything we can observe about it , but not the precise position and momentum of every atom and photon .
Now , you might be tempted to think that you reliably know something about the past history of our local universe -- your first kiss , the French Revolution , the formation of the cosmic microwave background , etc .
But you do n't really know those things -- you reconstruct them from your records and memories right here and now , using some basic rules of thumb and your belief in certain laws of physics .
The point is that , within this hypothetical thermal equilibrium universe from which we are purportedly a fluctuation , there are many fluctuations that reach exactly this macrostate -- one with a hundred billion galaxies , a Solar System just like ours , and a person just like you with exactly the memories you have .
And in the hugely overwhelming majority of them , all of your memories and reconstructions of the past are false .
In almost every fluctuation that creates universes like the ones we see , both the past and the future have a higher entropy than the present -- downward fluctuations in entropy are unlikely , and the larger the fluctuation the more unlikely it is , so the vast majority of fluctuations to any particular low - entropy configuration never go lower than that .
Therefore , this hypothesis -- that our universe , complete with all of our records and memories , is a thermal fluctuation around a thermal equilibrium state -- makes a very strong prediction : that our past is nothing like what we reconstruct it to be , but rather that all of our memories and records are simply statistical flukes created by an unlikely conspiracy of random motions .
In this view , the photograph you see before you used to be yellow and wrinkled , and before that was just a dispersed collection of dust , before miraculously forming itself out of the chaos .
Note that this scenario makes no assumptions about our typicality -- it assumes , to the contrary , that we are exactly who we ( presently ) perceive ourselves to be , no more and no less .
But in this scenario , we have absolutely no right to trust any of our memories or reconstructions of the past ; they are all just a mirage .
And the assumptions that we make to derive that conclusion are exactly the assumptions we really do make to do conventional statistical mechanics !
Boltzmann taught us long ago that it 's possible for heat to flow from cold objects to hot ones , or for cream to spontaneously segregate itself away from a surrounding cup of coffee -- it 's just very unlikely .
But when we say " unlikely " we have in mind some measure on the space of possibilities .
And it 's exactly that assumed measure that would lead us to conclude , in this crazy fluctuation - world , that all of our notions of the past are chimeric .
Now , just like Boltzmann 's Brain , nobody believes this is true .
In fact , you can't believe it 's true , by any right .
All of the logic you used to tell that story , and all of your ideas about the laws of physics , depend on your ability to reliably reconstruct the past .
This scenario , in other words , is cognitively unstable ; useful as a rebuke to the original hypothesis , but not something that can stand on its own .
So what are we to conclude ?
That our observed universe is not a statistical fluctuation around a thermal equilibrium state .
That 's very important to know , but does n't pin down the truth .
If the universe is eternal , and has a maximum value for its entropy , then we it would ( almost always ) be in thermal equilibrium .
Therefore , either it's not eternal , or there is no state of maximum entropy .
I personally believe the latter , but there 's plenty of work to be done before we have any of this pinned down .
This is a guest post from Jon Morrow .
Tell me if this sounds familiar .
You sit down in the computer for a few minutes , hoping to whip up a quick blog post .
Then an idea hits you .
It ’s vague at first , but it has a certain sparkle of possibility .
You start constructing a post , becoming more convinced with every word that you ’re onto something .
The feeling grows and grows until your fingers are flying across the keyboard .
The words are flowing , and you ’re saying exactly what you want to say , exactly the way you want to say it .
You bring the post to a close with an ending that you can only describe as , “ Perfect , ” and then pause to read what you ’ve written .
A smile spreads across your face .
It ’s clever , original … brilliant .
You only hesitate for a second before posting it to your blog .
“ I ca n’t wait to see what they say about that , ” you think .
You walk away from the computer , sure you ’ve written a masterpiece .
A couple of hours pass and you come back to reread your post .
As you scan through it , you feel a weight in the pit of your stomach .
This post is n’t brilliant .
It ’s arrogant , disconnected , and desperate for attention .
“ What was I thinking ? ” you ask yourself .
And I ’ll tell you : you were n’t thinking .
You were drunk on your own words .
Writing Can Make You Feel Drunk
Master copywriters have long described good writing as hypnotic .
It draws readers in , using its flow and rhythm to put people in a state of higher suggestibility , making it easier for you to sell them something .
It ’s a dirty analogy , but it ’s similar to getting them drunk .
Each point you make is like pouring them another glass , slowly washing away their objections , tugging on their emotions , and leading them toward the sale without them even realizing it .
But it ’s a two - way street .
When you ’re writing , you can put yourself into the same state .
Like a brewer drinking your own product , you can intoxicate yourself during the act of creation .
It ’s happened to me lots of times .
Fortunately though , I ’ve learned to recognize it and walk away before posting something foolish to my blog .
Here are the 7 warning signs that you should look for :
1. You Think the Post Is Brilliant
I ’ve noticed that , whenever I finish a post and think it ’s brilliant , there ’s at least a 50 % chance that it ’s not .
Frequently , it ’s just pandering for attention , and I ’ll regret posting it later .
2. You Think the Post Is Hilarious
Humor is dangerous .
Not only do people have drastically different opinions on what ’s funny , but there ’s a fine line between making your readers laugh and offending them to a point where they unsubscribe .
The only way to know for sure is to run it by someone .
Comedy writers work as a team for a reason .
Sometimes , you ’re being funny .
Other times , you ’re just being an ass .
3 . You ’re Actually Drunk ( or High )
Alcohol and marijuana are the best friends of many a writer .
We can argue all day about whether it really helps or not , but both can impair your judgment on whether you ’ve written something worth publishing to the world .
Be forewarned .
4. Your Heart Is Pounding
If your heart is pounding , then you ’re definitely in some sort of heightened state , and it ’s easy to move too fast .
Whenever I drink lots of caffeine , for instance , my heartbeat and writing output both speed up , but the posts do n’t make as much sense .
Writing after watching a good movie or reading a powerful piece of writing can create the same effect .
5. You Ca n’t Wait to See How People React
Thoughts like , “ I ca n’t wait to see what kinds of comments I get ” and , “ This should get some conversation going ” are surefire indicators that you ’ve written something risky .
It could be bold , but it might just be brash .
6. Your Stomach Tightens up
Sometimes , you ’re writing something that makes absolute sense , but you notice your stomach starting to tighten up .
This is your subconscious trying to tell you that a part of you disagrees with what you are saying .
Pay attention .
7. You Hesitate before Clicking “ Post ”
If your mouse hovers over the “ Post ” button , hesitating for a moment before putting it out for the world to see , then you ’ve written something that you know is risky .
You should probably hold off and figure out what ’s bothering you about it .
Do n’t Drink and Drive
If you ’re going to drink , you ’re eventually going to get drunk .
Similarly , if you ’re going to write , you ’re eventually going to say something stupid .
Nothing in the world can change it , and you might as well accept it .
You can , however , take responsibility for your words and avoid subjecting your readers to that stupidity .
Just like you should n’t drive if you think there ’s even a chance that you ’re drunk , you should n’t post your writing if you think there ’s even a chance that it ’s not what you really want to say .
Instead , you should :
Sober up – Walk away from the post for a few hours and give your internal editor a chance to wake up .
He ’ll tell you whether the post is good or not .
Find a driver –
If you ca n’t afford to wait , ask a friend to read the post and give you honest feedback .
Regardless of how euphoric you are about it , trust their judgment .
Sometimes , the post really will be as good as you thought it was , but frequently , you ’ll scrap it , or at least make some revisions .
Either way , your writing will be better , and you ’ll avoid the embarrassment of posting something you should n’t .
If you hate get rich quick schemes , penny pinching , and advice without substance , you might just love Jon ’s blog , On Moneymaking .

In many ways , hard drives are the bane of our existence .
Although they can store plenty of data , data access remain ( relatively ) slow .
Furthermore , the moving parts make hard drives vulnerable to various types of failure .
Nevertheless , in the past 40 years , they 've been irreplaceable because it is very hard to make nonvolatile memory as cheaply as a hard drive .
Now , some new research on nanowires may point the way towards a new kind of high - density , nonvolatile storage .
In the past few years , researchers have begun exploring phase changes as a method for storing data .
Phase changes are currently used for rewritable CDs and DVDs , so this is n't exactly a new idea .
In these storage media , discrete points in a crystalline material are heated and rapidly cooled to make the material amorphous .
This change in the physical structure creates a sufficiently large change in reflectivity that ones and zeros can be distinguished by shining a laser beam onto the disk .
Using a superficially similar approach , researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have constructed a memory device based on a nanowire .
The information is stored in the physical structure of the material , and the physical structure is altered by pulses of current .
The research , published in Nature Nanotechnology , details the growth of single crystal wires made from a semiconductor alloy .
It was found that a sufficiently short and intense burst of current caused the material to lose its crystalline structure , at which point the material became amorphous and highly resistant .
A second , longer , lower amplitude burst of current would allow the crystalline structure to form again .
The research demonstrates that these memory gates last for more than 105 operations and have read / write times between 50 to 100ns , which is certainly competitive with hard drives ( though RAM is still much faster ) .
You wo n't find devices based on this tech in your store within the next year , though , or even in the next five years .
The problem is that growing these wires is difficult , and growing them in a controlled manner is nearly impossible .
Although the researchers suggest several ways through which more controlled growth and placement may be obtained , it is clear that simply making the raw material for these devices is the big unsolved problem .
In fact , this is the big unsolved problem with almost everything associated with nanotechnology .

Richard Nixon , say what you will of this criminally minded president , was a keen observer of politics .
But he seems to have underestimated fellow Republican Ronald Reagan ( or the American public ) .
On the morning of November 17 , 1971 , Nixon , while meeting with National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office , shared a few sharp–and negative –comments about California Governor Ronald Reagan , who had recently told Kissinger that Nixon had a “ real problem ” with conservatives who believed Nixon was not sufficiently hawkish on foreign policy matters .
For years , the Presidential Recordings Program of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia has been transcribing and analyzing the tape recordings Nixon secretly made in the White House .
Even though it ’s been 33 years since a disgraced Nixon left office , his tapes are still being processed by the National Archives , and the Miller Center has only recently gotten to the tape of this particular conversation .
According to the newly created transcript of the meeting , both Nixon and Kissinger believed Reagan was not the brightest bulb in the GOP .
Here are some key excerpts :
President Nixon :
What ’s your evaluation of Reagan after meeting him several times now .
Kissinger :
Well , I think he ’s a–actually I think he ’s a pretty decent guy .
President Nixon :
Oh , decent , no question , but his brains
Kissinger : Well , his brains , are negligible .
I–
President Nixon :
He ’s really pretty shallow , Henry .
Kissinger :
He ’s shallow .
He ’s got no…he ’s an actor .
He–When he gets a line he does it very well .
He said , “ Hell , people are remembered not for what they do , but for what they say .
Ca n’t you find a few good lines ? ” [ Chuckles . ]
That ’s really an actor ’s approach to foreign policy –to substantive … .
President Nixon : I ’ve said a lot of good things , too , you know damn well .
Kissinger : Well , that too .
Later in the 24 - minute - long discussion , the two discussed the possibility of Reagan running for president :
President Nixon : Can you think though , Henry , can you think , though , that Reagan with certain forces running in the direction could be sitting right here ?
Kissinger : Inconceivable .
So much for Kissinger ’s powers of prognostication .
As they were finishing up–after discussing other matters –Nixon slammed Reagan again :
President Nixon : Back to Reagan though .
It shows you how a man of limited mental capacity simply does n’t know what the Christ is going on in the foreign area .
He ’s got to know that on defense–does n’t he know these battles we fight and fight and fight ?
Goddamn it , Henry , we ’ve been at –
Kissinger : And I told him–he said , “ Why do n’t you fire the bureaucracy ? ” I said , “ Because there are only so many battles we can fight .
We take on the bureaucracy now , they ’re going to leak us to death .
Name me one thing that we have done that the bureaucracy made us do . ”
President Nixon :
The bureaucracy has had nothing to do with anything .
Kissinger : No , no .
They ’ve made our lives harder .
They ’ve driven us crazy .
But that does n’t affect him .
Shallow , negligible brains , limited mental capacity ?
Well , Reagan did manage to get elected twice , and he served out his two terms–a feat Nixon did not accomplish .
And Kissinger happily served on Reagan ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board .

Yet another “ coalition partner ” has announced plans to withdraw from Iraq .
According to UPI , the new Labor government in Australia has decided to bring home its 550 soldiers by mid-2008 .
The announcement was made by Foreign Minister Stephen Smith several days after his visit to Washington , where he met privately with Dick Cheney , Robert Gates , and Condoleezza Rice .
Where does that leave the Multinational Force Iraq ( aka the Bush administration ’s “ Coalition of the Willing ” ) ?
Well , let ’s take a look …
Countries other than Australia to have withdrawn their troops : Slovakia , Lithuania , Italy , Ukraine , Netherlands , Spain , Japan , Thailand , Honduras , Dominican Republic , Hungary , Nicaragua , Singapore , Norway , Portugal , New Zealand , Philippines , Tonga , and Iceland .
Countries so far “ staying the course ” : United States , United Kingdom ** , Poland , South Korea , Romania , El Salvador , Czech Republic , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Denmark , Mongolia , Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Estonia , Macedonia , Kazakhstan , Moldova , Bulgaria , Armenia , and Latvia .
** It should be noted that the British withdrew from central Basra last year and are now huddled in a secure base outside the city , under regular attack from insurgents .
It is widely thought they will withdraw from Iraq sometime during 2008 .

Watching senator Clinton attempt to regain some lift as she paraglides into history is almost enough to evoke pity .
Almost .
The Clintons come with their own boundless reserves of self - pity so further reinforcements seem unnecessary to me .
And I suppose they could somehow still find a brutal , soul - grinding path to the nomination .
But we 've learned something important these past couple of weeks .
Clinton is a terrible manager of people .
Coming into a campaign she had been planning for , what , two decades , she was so not ready on Day One , or even Day 300 .
Her White House , if we can glean anything from the campaign , would be a secretive nest of well - fed yes - people , an uncontrollable egomaniac spouse able and willing to bigfoot anyone if he wants to , a phalanx of flunkies who cannot tell the boss when things are wrong , and a drizzle of dreary hacks like Mark Penn .
Her only genuine skill is pivoting off the Limbaugh machine ( which is now as played out as its enemies ) .
Her new weapon is apparently bursting into tears .
I mean : really .
It 's staggering to me that she blew through so much money for close to nothing ( apart from the donuts ) .
Without that media meltdown in New Hampshire , she would have been forced to bow out much earlier .
She did n't plan for contests after Super Tuesday .
She barely planned for any before that .
She was out - organized in Iowa and South Carolina , and engaged in the pettiest form of politics in Florida and Michigan .
Her fundraising operation was very pre-Internet .
She has no message that is n't about her and the Republicans .
Her trump card - Bill - managed to foment a 27 point loss in South Carolina .
The Clintons , we can now safely say , got lazy .
Or rather their old and now forgotten lackadaisical attitude toward governing returned like a persistent flu to campaigning .
We tend to forget that their entire governing agenda after 1994 was essentially finessing Gingrich and battling impeachment .
( Their entire agenda before 1994 was successful Eisenhower economics , and disastrous Hillarycare ) .
It 's been fifteen years since the Clintons actually stood for a coherent message , and it turns out they had forgotten that you kind of need that for a presidential run .

Marty St Clair 's breakthrough saved lives
It is 20 years since the world 's first HIV / Aids drug came onto the market in the US .
There were complaints AZT was expensive and could have toxic side effects .
But it offered hope .
Not of a cure , but at least of a longer life for the 15,000 Americans then living with the disease .
Hope too for governments worldwide who watched as the pandemic began .
The scientist who first realised AZT could tackle HIV was Marty St Clair .
She is still working in the field for British pharmaceutical giant GSK .
Unexpected result
" It absolutely woke me up , " she told me , describing that day in November 1984 .
It was the first ray of hope
Ms Marty St Clair
She was doing drug trials on cells in petri dishes .
" You can imagine this was rather a boring task I was doing . "
She put living cells in petri dishes .
Then she added the virus .
A series of different drugs were then put in 350 samples .
If the drug failed to work the cells died and dropped off , making a hole or plaque .
Ms St Clair had to count every single plaque on every single dish .
" I was holding them up to the window , " she said .
" I came to 16 dishes , none of which had any plaques . "
All were labelled as containing AZT .
Eureka moment
Ms St Clair did n't believe it .
If it were n't for AZT I do n't know where we'd be today
Marty St Clair
" I rang my supervisor , then I said : ' I wonder if I forgot to put the virus in these 16 ? ' " she recalls .
" He looked at them and said : ' That 's stupid , out of 350 plates you forgot to put virus in these ?
Of course you did n't screw up ' .
" He actually believed this was the eureka moment more than I did . "
It was late on Friday night .
She told a few people and went home to bed .
" Monday morning - I had five or six messages saying , ' did I hear it right ?
Do we have something that could be used against Aids ? ' "
It took just three years to get AZT licensed .
" Today it 's 10 or more years to get a drug to market , " said Ms St Clair .
" But remember people were dying , people were being diagnosed with Aids and within just a matter of months were dead . "
" It was the first ray of hope . "
Expensive drugs
But it cost $ 188 for 100 pills - out of reach for many people .
" It was frustrating , " Ms St Clair confesses .
" But we were doing our very best to make it available as easily as we could . "
It also had side effects .
" It was very toxic .
We did n't have the battery of trials that drugs today have .
We very quickly realised that was a toxic dose and reduced it over time . "
HIV / Aids was spreading faster in Africa then anywhere else .
The price of the drug and poor health care systems placed it out of reach of most sufferers .
" I do believe that where you are born should n't determine the quality of your health care , " said Ms St Clair .
" Therapies truly are out reach of a lot of patients .
" Our company has really made inroads into making drugs available for patients in developing nations . "
AZT is still in use across the world , and Ms St Clair says she 'll always be associated with it .
" It 's our passion , it is our life 's work , " she said .
" If it were n't for AZT I do n't know where we'd be today .
" You always have to start with one - and AZT was the first . "
1. Carbonated Fruit
While enjoying a nice , crisp apple or a ripe , juicy pear , do you ever think to yourself , " This would be so much better with a little carbon dioxide " ?
Well , apparently you are n't the only one .
Fizzy Fruit , the world 's first carbonated fruit , is now hitting grocery store shelves near you .
Neurobiologist Galen Kaufman got the idea for carbonating fruit when he bit into a pear that had been hanging out in a cooler filled with dry ice .
The carbon dioxide from the dry ice had mixed with the water content of the fruit , resulting in a carbonated effect .
Together with the Food Innovation Center , a research facility at Oregon State University , Kaufman developed this idea into Fizzy Fruit .
It 's been a hit at pilot schools across the country and is now served in more than 600 school districts .
And if the carbonation in the fruit does n't have enough fizz factor for you , maybe you should think about adding your fizzy fruit to your fizzy yogurt " ¦
2. Carbonated Yogurt
First came drinkable yogurt .
Then Go-Gurt , in tubes .
Now , carbonated yogurt ?
Yep .
It 's called Fizzix and it comes in flavors that sound suspiciously like Pop Rocks , including Blue Raspberry Rage , Strawberry Lemonade Jolt and Fruit Punch Charge .
Brigham Young food scientist Lynn Ogden came up with the idea similar to the way Fizzy Fruit was conceptualized " “ after adding dry ice to yogurt it was filled with CO2 when the ice broke down .
He and his students messed around with the idea for years before perfecting the technique ( yogurt is prone to exploding when carbonated ) and receiving a patent .
Ogden started selling " Sparkling Yogurt "  on the BYU campus and eventually sold the idea to General Mills in 2006 .
Although kids apparently love Fizzix , it did n't win any fans when Fortune magazine did a taste - test on the product " “ one tester referred to Fizzix as " Yuck - plait . " 
3. Caffeinated Donuts
If your idea of breakfast is more along the lines of a jelly donut and a Diet Coke or three , soon you can cut combine the two .
Dr. Robert Bohannon , a molecular scientist who graduated from the Baylor College of Medicine , is the brains behind Encaff , an additive that inserts caffeine into everyday foods while hiding the bitter caffeine taste .
Bohannon has already developed Buzz Donuts and Buzzed Bagels and is working with companies to inject Encaff into gum , breakfast bars and smoothies .
Food that has been Encaffienated will contain somewhere between 50 to 100 mg of caffeine , which is a pretty typical amount " “ a standard cup of coffee contains about 50 mg .
4. Caffeinated Beer
One area of the market Bohannon can't corner , though , is beer .
Caffeinated beer has been on the shelves since 2005 , when Anheuser - Busch launched BE ( pronounced " B to the E "  ) .
BE contains 54 mg of caffeine and smells like " blackberry and a little bit of cherry "  , according to the creator of BE , Nathaniel Davis .
But one bartender says it tastes like tangerine .
I guess it 's one of those things you will just have to try for yourself " “ that is , if mixing a stimulant and a depressant does n't concern you at all .
BE " “ also known as Bud Extra " “ is now just one of many caffeinated beers available to consumers , including Labatt 's Shok ( 60 mg of caffeine ) , and Molson 's Kick ( 55 mg of caffeine ) .
5. Bacon-Flavored Salt
Bacon
Salt is a product that was just launched by self - titled " Bacontrepreneurs " 
Justin Esch and Dave Lefkow .
It 's a zero- calorie , zero - fat , zero - carb , zero - meat seasoning that tastes just like bacon .
It 's even kosher .
Justin and Dave came up with the idea while discussing their mutual love for bacon , and shortly thereafter , Bacon Salt was born .
They held a taste - test amongst friends early in 2007 and received rave reviews , except for the maple - flavored bacon salt .
However , the original , hickory and peppered flavors were big hits .
Justin and Dave say that Bacon Salt is delicious on everything from grilled meats to veggies to , yes , bacon .
Dave 's father - in - law claims to like it on ice cream and a Bacon Salt fan sent a picture of Bacon Salt on watermelon .
If anyone tries Bacon Salt on ice cream , be sure to let me know .
6. Sliced Jelly
Sliced jelly is for those days when you really do n't have the energy to open up a jar and get out a knife to make your PBJ .
John M. Codilis is president and CEO of P.J. Squares LLC , a company that makes a sandwich slices with strawberry or grape jelly on one side and peanut butter on the other .
Hungry consumers just have to unwrap a slice , throw it on some bread and enjoy .
No jars , no knives , no muss , no fuss !
Although it might sound a little unnecessary and , OK , more than a little lazy , it does have practical origins : the inventor of peanut butter slices ( plain peanut butter without a side made of jelly ) , John Bogan , was watching his young son attempt to make himself lunch .
He was completely destroying his slices of bread in the peanut butter spreading process , so Bogan thought he would invent something easy for small kids to use .
Codilis says about 40 percent of P.J. Squares buyers unwrap the slices and eat them solo , no bread required .
I 'm sure these few examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to bizarre products on the market .
What have you seen ?
Better yet , what have you tried ?

Notorious NBA bad boy Yao Ming has done it again .
He ’s late for national team training — and China ’s official sports association has made it clear they are sick and tired of his Rodmanesque antics :
The Houston Rockets ’ star was faulted for taking too much time off to recover from his last NBA season .
The government ’s All - China Sports Federation also said he spent too much time planning his wedding and making appearances for the Special Olympics and 2008 Beijing Olympic Games .
“ No matter how lofty public welfare activities are , they ca n’t be allowed to take first place in a player ’s life , ” the China Sports Daily , a federation - owned newspaper , said in an article appearing Tuesday .
“ No matter how sweet personal life is , it ca n’t be compared to the exultation of capturing glory for one ’s nation , ” the article said .
Chinese Web sites later said Yao reported for national teaming training on Wednesday .
It ’s really sad to see pro athletes go off the deep end like this .
Special Olympics ?!?!?
Beijing Olympics ??!?!?!
Getting married ?!??!?
What self - destructive and unpatriotic activities will this prima donna get messed up in next ?
Yao , please stop embarrassing your fellow countrymen with your reckless behavior !
If only Yao could be a true stand up guy like Yi Jianlian .
On that topic , we tend to agree with this Shanghaiist commenter .

We have n't heard of Dutch design outfit Crealev before , but the company says it 's developed a " new levitation concept which is able to produce a very high levitation height combined with a low power dissipation and excellent stability " -- and apparently the best way to show that off is this series of levitating lamps .
Unveiled at last week 's Dutch Design Week event , the lamps are the product of designer Angela Jansen .
We 're assuming they 're magnetic in some way , but Crealev 's website is pretty cagey with the details , only saying that it 's a " proprietary technology . "
Either way , we want one .

But a spokeswoman for the Minister for Home Affairs , Bob Debus , confirmed the issue of " whether or not to allow an R18 + classification " for games would be discussed by censorship ministers at the next Standing Committee of attorneys - general ( SCAG ) meeting on March 28 .
It will be the first time the issue is discussed since November 2005 .
Claire Bowdler , spokeswoman for the Classification Board , said 18 games had been banned since 2001 .
Eight of the games had their bans lifted after they were modified and resubmitted .
The most recent game to be axed by the board was the sci - fi themed shooting game Dark Sector , which was refused classification this month .
The reason given by the Classification Board was that it contained graphic violence including " decapitation , dismemberment of limbs accompanied by large blood spurts , neck breaking spurts , neck breaking twists and exploded bodies with post-action twitching body parts " .
Last year , Blitz : The League was banned because it contained drug use related to incentives or rewards , while Soldier of Fortune : Payback was banned for excessive violence .
The ban on the latter was lifted after content changes by its publisher , Activision .
Other recently banned games include Mark Ecko's Getting Up : Contents Under Pressure ( for promoting graffiti ) , BMX XXX ( for sexual content ) and Reservoir Dogs ( for high levels of violence including the ability to shoot the heads off of hostages during a bank heist ) .
After learning of the ban on his game , millionaire New York fashion designer Mark Ecko said : " ... to blame gaming for everything that is inherently wrong in our homes , in our schools and on our streets is much easier to do than to actually figure out ways to fix the systemic problems that exist within our culture . "
The games industry has long argued that the censorship regime is unnecessarily draconian and prevents adults from making their own decisions as to the type of content they consume .
It has called for the classification system to be harmonised across all types of media .
Research conducted by Bond University in Queensland for the industry body , the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia ( IEAA ) , found that the average age of Australian gamers is 28 and over 50 per cent of gamers are over 18 .
Another survey of 1601 Australian households , conducted by the university in 2005 , found 88 per cent of Australians supported an R18 + classification for games .
Bond University associate professor Jeffrey Brand , who authored the research , said Australia was the " only developed democracy " that did not have an adult classification for games .
He said the lack of an R18 + rating meant some games deserving of adult classification were being let through by the Classification Board as MA15 +.
And Australians who wanted to obtain banned games could easily source them from the internet or overseas , he said .
" These games are entering the marketplace despite the classification restriction , and so very often parents , who in some cases are the least savvy in the household about games , are unaware that this adult content exists , " Dr Brand said .
But Angela Conway , spokeswoman for the Australian Family Association , said even M-rated games currently on the market had " concerning " levels of violent and sexual content .
" We would be opposed to the adoption of an R - rated category because we believe that research is pointing to the fact that these games actually do impact behaviour and psychology more easily than a film , " she said .
" Our big concern is that there is a continual [ positive ] reinforcement for players actually acting out violent and sexual impulses ... this sort of technology has actually been used to desensitise soldiers ... and retrain them and break down their defences against killing . "
Ron Curry , CEO of the IEAA , said it would be up to states and territories and games retailers to ensure those under 18 could not purchase R18 + games .
He said he would " absolutely support " compulsory ID checks by stores .
THE mortgage crisis has put “ for sale ” signs in front of houses across the country  including so - called McMansions  the large , expensive , often tasteless homes that have taken up so much suburban space over the last couple of decades .
But frantic selling is just the beginning , according to Christopher B. Leinberger , a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan .
“ Signs of physical and social disorder are spreading ” thro'gh cul - de-sac suburbia , he writes in the March issue of The Atlantic .
And it is not just because of the mortgage mess .
A “ structural change ” is occurring in the housing market  a “ major shift in the way many Americans want to live and work , ” moving social problems out of the city and into the suburban fringe .
Mr. Leinberger cites the work of Arthur C. Nelson , the director of Virginia Tech ’s Metropolitan Institute , who has predicted that , by 2025 , there will be a surplus of 22 million large - lot homes ( those built on at least one - sixth of an acre ) .
This , Mr. Leinberger writes , is a result of “ the pendulum swinging back toward urban living , ” thanks to a set of economic , social , and demographic trends .
The result , he says , could be that low - density suburbs “ may become what inner cities became in the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s  slums characterized by poverty , crime , and decay . ”
In the 1950s , using the marriage license as a shorthand way to distribute benefits and legal privileges made some sense because almost all adults were married .
Cohabitation and single parenthood by choice were very rare .
Today , however , possession of a marriage license tells us little about people ’s interpersonal responsibilities .
Half of all Americans aged 25 to 29 are unmarried , and many of them already have incurred obligations as partners , parents or both .
Almost 40 percent of America ’s children are born to unmarried parents .
Meanwhile , many legally married people are in remarriages where their obligations are spread among several households .
Using the existence of a marriage license to determine when the state should protect interpersonal relationships is increasingly impractical .
Society has already recognized this when it comes to children , who can no longer be denied inheritance rights , parental support or legal standing because their parents are not married .
As Nancy Polikoff , an American University law professor , argues , the marriage license no longer draws reasonable dividing lines regarding which adult obligations and rights merit state protection .
A woman married to a man for just nine months gets Social Security survivor ’s benefits when he dies .
But a woman living for 19 years with a man to whom she is n’t married is left without government support , even if her presence helped him hold down a full - time job and pay Social Security taxes .
A newly married wife or husband can take leave from work to care for a spouse , or sue for a partner ’s wrongful death .
But unmarried couples typically cannot , no matter how long they have pooled their resources and how faithfully they have kept their commitments .
Possession of a marriage license is no longer the chief determinant of which obligations a couple must keep , either to their children or to each other .
But it still determines which obligations a couple can keep — who gets hospital visitation rights , family leave , health care and survivor ’s benefits .
This may serve the purpose of some moralists .
But it does n’t serve the public interest of helping individuals meet their care - giving commitments .
Perhaps it ’s time to revert to a much older marital tradition .
Let churches decide which marriages they deem “ licit . ”
But let couples — gay or straight — decide if they want the legal protections and obligations of a committed relationship .

Adam Bloom is a stand - up comic , an extreme extrovert who admits he thrives on stimulation .
He is one of six volunteers who have agreed to be shut inside a cell in a nuclear bunker , alone and in the dark .
And for Bloom it will be particularly hard .
Within half an hour of being locked up at the start of the experiment , all of the subjects lie down and go to sleep .
But the real ordeal will begin when they wake up and find they have no idea what time it is .
I remember one occasion waking up and having to squeeze my face and my chest and thinking to myself am I still alive
Brian Keenan
Throughout the 48 hours they are being monitored by a psychologist and filmed for a BBC Horizon documentary .
As the hours pass , seeing and hearing nothing , they become increasingly disoriented .
After 24 hours Bloom is suffering .
The subjects have been encouraged to describe how they are feeling but know that while their words may be heard , no one will respond .
" Its really hard to stimulate your brain with no light .
It 's blanking me .
I can feel my brain just not wanting to do anything , " he says .
Psychological tests
Sensory deprivation is a controversial subject , with allegations the technique has been used at Guantanamo Bay as an interrogation strategy .
And thousands of prisoners around the world are kept in solitary confinement , often with a significant degree of sensory deprivation .
The tests are exploring the theory that sensory deprivation makes subjects much more suggestible .
I 'm hallucinating !
I thought I could see a pile of oyster shells
Adam Bloom
Some of the first research on this subject was carried out after the Korean War in the 1950s .
The Canadian military wanted to investigate what had happened to POWs who appeared at international press conferences confessing that they were war criminals .
It was thought they had been brainwashed following solitary confinement .
North American scientists paid students to stay in conditions of sensory deprivation for varying lengths of time .
Most dropped out after 72 hours , and very few were able to stay more than four or five days .
The boredom and oppression of the experiments ' conditions became overpowering .
After just 30 hours of the same treatment , Adam is one of several inmates who are pacing up and down their cells , again a common reaction .
" This behaviour of pacing up and down is something we see in animals as well as people when they are kept in confinement , " says Prof Ian Robbins , a clinical psychologist at St George 's Hospital who is supervising the experiment .
" It could be just seen as something you can do without thinking about it , it may be in part attempting to exercise , but I think it is reaction to the lack of input and you provide the input physically . "
Trauma of captivity
Brian Keenan is all too familiar with some of what they are experiencing .
He spent four years as a hostage in Lebanon .
" I reckon I was in the dark about seven or eight months .
I can't be sure ; it 's very hard to tell the time .
" The nothingness , that was extremely hard .
Because the question in your head is how am I going to get through the next 10 minutes ?
Or months later , how am I going to get through the next day ?
Is there enough left in my head ? "
" I remember one occasion waking up and having to squeeze my face and my chest and thinking to myself ' Am I still alive ? ' "
Brian Keenan was held in the dark for over seven months
" I 'm hallucinating !
I thought I could see a pile of oyster shells , five thousand oyster shells , empty , to represent all the nice food I could have eaten while I was inside here . "
Keenan also experienced periods when his brain conjured up images .
One particularly unpleasant time involved musical instruments getting louder and louder .
" I got really afraid and that 's when I kind of started banging my head against the wall , just to make this go away .
" You would try and engage your mind forcefully in something else .... it was not comforting .
And it went on for a very , very long time . "
Back in the nuclear bunker , some of the other guinea pigs have also been hallucinating .
Strange presences
Mickey , a postman is seeing mosquitoes and fighter planes buzzing around his head and it 's frightening him .
Claire a psychology student does n't mind the little cars , snakes and zebras .
But she gets scared when she suddenly feels somebody is in the room .
" In the dark room there is nothing to focus on , " says Prof Robbins as he monitors their behaviour .
" In the absence of information the human brain carries on working and processing information even if there is no information to process and after a while it starts to create that information itself . "
Comedian Adam Bloom is used to stimulation and interaction
Finally Adam and the others are released and given the psychological tests .
Suggestibility is measured as the subjects are asked to read out what colour is printed on a card although the letters appear in a different colour , for instance the word black printed in red .
Several of the subjects including Adam show very high levels of suggestibility .
The results give Prof Robbins an insight into " what can happen to people kept in solitary confinement over possibly many months and even years " .
" Evidence that has accumulated in those places must be considered very unreliable because people will after a while start to take on board the views of their interrogators , " he says .
" Our volunteers were in a sensory deprivation environment for 48 hours and being treated humanely . "
After just 48 hours , Adam wanted to kiss the man who opened the door to let him out .
" I was let outside and saw the sun and the sky , for the first time in 48 hours .
My senses were overwhelmed totally and utterly by the sights , sounds and smells . "
He is glad he did it and proud he did n't give up early .
But he would not do it again .
" It was an amazing experience that was very much worth going through once .
It taught me to appreciate my senses and all forms of interaction . "
Horizon : Total Isolation is on BBC Two at 2100GMT on Tuesday 22 January .
I spent five hours in asesory deprevation experiment whilst at university .
Thirty years later I still remeber the disorientation and discomfort .
I had to keep count of buzzers and bleeps .
In that short time I overcounted by almost double and halucinated about parents and conversations .
Quite terrible .
I guess that it is used as part of an interrogation because it does make you feel disorientated and thereore reliant on your interrogator .
Part of " being broken " .
Having said that , I would really prefer this as an alternative to permanent physical damage .

Wonderful concept .
For my thoughts , it opens the door to how we understand information , and the thought of , if it is our thoughts that make us or do we make our thoughts .
Howard Palmer , Atlanta , Ga
Our mind is an amazing " computer " that manages all the information given to it .
It then starts making it's own information when other the input is lacking .
We must not abuse our system

As a claustrophobic , subway / elevator avoiding new yorker , I can't think of a more horrible experiment to be part of .
Deborah , New York
I can't agree with this part : " Suggestibility is measured as the subjects are asked to read out what colour is printed on a card although the letters appear in a different colour , for instance the word black printed in red .
Several of the subjects including Adam show very high levels of suggestibility .
"
The task ( aka Stroop Task ) measures attention - it requires a good deal of forced attention to overcome the automatic process of reading the word .
If you 've been hallucinating and ( presumably ? ) food deprived for days on end , then your attention is going to be low , and hard to focus .
I do n't agree with the methodology cited here .

Israel is a small country with seven million people , unfriendly neighbors , and relatively high taxes .
So why does it have the second - largest concentration of startups per capita after Silicon Valley ?
Jon says the two places are more similar than one would think .
BEIT SHEMESH - " Israel 's ten thousand miles from Silicon Valley ; but it takes a nanosecond to get there , " says Jon Medved , one of Israel 's leading high - tech venture capitalists and CEO of a new startup called Vringo , which allows users to share video ringtones on their cell phones .
He knows from life experience .
He was born in San Diego , raised in Los Angeles , and went to UC Berkeley for college .
That 's where he first got interested in Israel , arguing Israel 's case against campus colleagues during the 1973 Arab - Israeli War .
Not long after graduating , Jon 's father offered him the chance to go to Israel to help open the Israeli market for his father ’s optical technology company .
He went , and found the entrepreneurial spirit of Israel to be much like that of burgeoning California .
In both locales , he found tightly - knit geographical communities , informal work atmospheres , a pioneering , risk - taking ethos , and a large number of immigrants .
He says these elements are key to entrepreneurial success , and have only grown more pronounced in both places over the past two decades .
Wearing a button - down Hawaiian shirt and slurping Nescafe , he now sits in Vringo 's headquarters in Beit Shemesh , a small town just one mile from where the Bible 's David is said to have conquered the giant Goliath .
Despite its ties to the past , this place is helping define the world 's technological future , Jon says .
Israeli venture capitalists support over 400 startups per year , more than any European nation .
After America , Israel has more stocks traded on NASDAQ than any other country .
High tech makes up 50 % of the country 's exports , worth about US $ 15 billion per year .
Israeli startups provided crucial technology to develop the flash drive , the call center , and instant messaging software .
This does n't surprise Jon. Silicon Valley and Israel are very similar , he says .
" Silicon Valley pioneered the open office , " he says , which makes it easier to know your colleagues and to meet the real " movers and shakers " in a company .
Israel 's tech sector companies caught on to the benefits of that informal work atmosphere , which gives young people with ideas that chance to meet old people with money .
That culture also resists entrenched hierarchies , encouraging youth to challenge superiors and raise new ideas .
Add that to a larger popular culture that glorifies successful risk - takers in business , and a pioneering attitude , and you have a recipe for successful innovation .
But in both locations , Jon says the most important ingredient is the immigrants .
" Being an immigrant is like being the CEO of your own mini- start - up , " he says .
" You 're taking huge risk to improve your life . "
Moreover , immigrants bring Diaspora connections from their homelands that help new companies establish transnational partnerships and open up markets .
In Jon 's industry , many of the most valuable immigrants are American managers , whom he recruits to lead his companies .
He says they know America 's specialties best : eCommerce ( buying and selling goods online ) , entertainment content ( like movies and music TV ) , and social networking ( like MySpace ) .
They 're all driving towards the goal of taking what America does well and positioning themselves to do it even better .
With a tiny domestic market but a prime location between Asia and Europe , Israeli entrepreneurs are constantly drumming up international business - and to survive , they must do some much earlier in their development than American companies would have to .
In Jon 's view , that 's a core strength .
He also thinks Israeli companies have easier access to Asian markets , which do n't view small Israeli startups as competitors like they do with some American corporate giants .
Mathematicians and number buffs have their records .
And today , an international team has broken a long - standing one in an impressive feat of calculation .
On March 6 , computer clusters from three institutions – the EPFL , the University of Bonn and NTT in Japan -- reached the end of eleven months of strenuous calculation , churning out the prime factors of a well - known , hard - to - factor number that is a whopping 307 digits long .
" This is the largest ' special ' hard - to - factor number factored to date , " explains EPFL cryptology professor Arjen Lenstra .
( The number is ' special ' because it has a special mathematical form -- it is close to a power of two . )
The news of this feat will grab the attention of information security experts and may eventually lead to changes in encryption techniques .
Although it is relatively easy to identify huge prime numbers , factoring , or breaking a number down into its prime components , is extremely difficult .
RSA encryption , named for the three individuals who devised the technique ( Ronald Rivest , Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman ) , takes advantage of this .
Using the RSA method , information is encrypted using a large composite number , usually 1024 bits in size , created by multiplying together two 150 - or - so digit prime numbers .
Only someone who knows those two numbers , the " keys " , can read the message .
Because there is a vast supply of large prime numbers , it 's easy to come up with unique keys .
Information encrypted this way is secure , because no one has ever been able to factor these huge numbers .
At least not yet .
The most recent factoring record is RSA200 , a 200 - digit ' non- special ' number whose two prime factors were identified in 2005 after 18 months of calculations that took over a half century of computer time .
The international team factored the current 307 - digit behemoth using the " special number field sieve , " a method devised in the late 1980s by Lenstra ( then at Bellcore ) , his brother Hendrik , then a professor at UC Berkeley , English mathematician John Pollard and Mark Manasse from DEC .
The 11 - month job took a century of computer time .
A feat like this would have been unthinkable back in 1990 when Lenstra started applying number theory and distributed computing to the task of breaking factoring records .
Increased computer power and refined computational techniques have raised the bar , and will continue to do so .
" We have more powerful computers , we have come up with better ways to map the algorithm onto the architecture , and we take better advantage of cache behavior , " Lenstra explains .
Is the writing on the wall for 1024 - bit encryption " " The answer to that question is an unqualified yes , " says Lenstra .
For the moment the standard is still secure , because it is much more difficult to factor a number made up of two huge prime numbers , such as an RSA number , than it is to factor a number like this one that has a special mathematical form .
But the clock is definitely ticking .
" Last time , it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a non-special hard - to factor number ( 155 digits ) .
I wo n't make predictions , but let 's just say it might be a good idea to stay tuned . "

REUTERS / China Daily
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese lunar obiter entered the moon ’s orbit on Monday , 12 days after takeoff , a feat hailed as a new milestone in China ’s exploration of space .
Chang’e
One was given instructions to slow down by mission control when the probe was 200 km from the moon , so it could be captured by the moon ’s gravity , Xinhua news agency said .
Chang’e
One is scheduled to scan the lunar surface from Wednesday in preparation for an unmanned moon vehicle planned for 2012 and a manned landing within 15 years .
Sun Laiyan , head of the China National Space Administration , hailed the probe as a new milestone in China ’s space programme .
“ We are all very excited .
The orbiter has completed all its moves perfectly ... This marks the first step in exploring deeper space , ” Sun told state television .
In 2003 , China became only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to launch a man into space aboard its own rocket .
In October 2005 , it sent two men into orbit and plans a space walk by 2008 .
But China ’s space plans have faced increasing international scrutiny .
Fears of a potential space arms race with the United States and other powers have mounted since it blew up one of its own weather satellites using a ground - based missile in January .
Japan plans to launch its first mission to land a spacecraft on the moon in the next decade -- a feat so far achieved only by the former Soviet Union and the United States .
The Chang’e One , named after a legendary Chinese goddess who flew to the moon , blasted off on a Long March 3A carrier rocket on Oct. 24 from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in the southwestern province of Sichuan .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , scientists have discovered that cocaine - related images trigger the emotional centers of the brains of patients addicted to drugs , even when the subjects are unaware they ’ve seen anything - and the regions of the brain activated by drug images overlapped substantially with those activated by sexual ones .
A team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania , led by Dr. Anna Rose Childress and Dr. Charles O’Brien , showed cocaine patients photos of drug - related cues like crack pipes and chunks of cocaine .
The images flashed by in just 33 milliseconds - so quickly that the patients were not consciously aware of seeing them .
Nonetheless , the unseen images stimulated activity in the limbic system , a brain network involved in emotion and reward , which has been implicated in drug - seeking and craving .
“ This is the first evidence that cues outside one ’s awareness can trigger rapid activation of the circuits driving drug - seeking behavior , ” said NIDA director Dr. Nora Volkow .
“ Patients often can’t pinpoint when or why they start craving drugs .
Understanding how the brain initiates that overwhelming desire for drugs is essential to treating addiction . ”
Both cocaine ( A ) and sexual ( B ) cues produced activation in amygdala and ventral striatum / ventral pallidum / substantia innominata , and insula , as well as the OFC ( OFC not shown ) .
Statistical parametric t maps were generated by SPM 2 thresholded for display ( color bar : 2 t 5 ) on the single - subject MNI brain template ( “ Colin ” ) in MRICro .
Coronal brain sections on the left in ( a ) and ( b ) are at y = − 6 mm ; images on the right in ( A ) and ( B ) are at y = 10 mm and y = 6 mm , respectively .
The response to “ unseen ” cocaine cues in a large bilateral ventral pallidum / left amygdala cluster ( C ) strongly predicted ( peak voxel , MNI x , y , z coordinates : − 14 , −6 , − 6 ; t = 7.11 ; p = 0.000 uncorrected - p = 0.015 cluster - corrected ) future affective response to visible cocaine cues ( D ; r = 0.92 ) .
Brain response to 33 msec “ unseen ” aversive cues ( not shown ; see Figure S1 in Supporting Materials ) varied across individuals , with increased activity in the insula predicting the later affective response to visible aversive cues .
Abbreviations : R : right , L : left , v : ventral , amyg : amygdala , si : substantia innominata , tp : temporal pole .
NOTE : The ventral boundary of the BOLD acquisition plane for the current studies is z = − 40 ; temporal pole activations may extend ventrally below the acquisition plane .
To verify that the patterns of brain activity triggered by the subconscious cues reflected the patients ’ feelings about drugs , Childress and her colleagues gave the patients a different test two days later , allowing them to look longer at the drug images .
The patients who demonstrated the strongest brain response to unseen cues in the fMRI experiment also felt the strongest positive association with visible drug cues .
Childress notes , “ It ’s striking that the way people feel about these drug - related images is accurately predicted by how strongly their brains respond within just 33 milliseconds . ”
Because Childress and her colleagues also found that the regions of the brain activated by drug images overlapped substantially with those activated by sexual images , it supports the scientific consensus that addictive drugs usurp brain regions that recognize natural rewards needed for survival , like food and sex .
According to Childress , these results could improve drug treatment strategies .
“ We have a brain hard - wired to appreciate rewards , and cocaine and other drugs of abuse latch onto this system .
We are looking at the potential for new medications that reduce the brain ’s sensitivity to these conditioned drug cues and would give patients a fighting chance to manage their urges . ”

THE PORT OF PLYMOUTH in southwestern England is no longer listed among the scenic towns of the British Isles , although prior to World War II it would have qualified .
During six nights of March and April 1941 , Nazi bombs destroyed seventy - five thousand buildings in what is remembered as the Plymouth Blitz .
When the annihilated city center was rebuilt , a modern concrete grid was superimposed on Plymouth ’s crooked cobbled lanes , burying its medieval past in memory .
But the main history of Plymouth lies at its edge , in the natural harbor formed at the confluence of two rivers , the Plym and the Tamar , where they join the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean .
This is the Plymouth from which the Pilgrims departed ; they named their American landfall across the sea in its honor .
All three of Captain Cook ’s Pacific expeditions began here , as did Sir Francis Drake ’s circumnavigation of the globe .
And , on December 27 , 1831 , H.M.S.
Beagle set sail from Plymouth Harbor , with twenty - two - year - old Charles Darwin aboard .
University of Plymouth marine biologist Richard Thompson spends a lot of time pacing Plymouth ’s historic edge .
He especially goes in winter , when the beaches along the harbor ’s estuaries are empty — a tall man in jeans , boots , blue windbreaker , and zippered fleece sweater , his bald pate hatless , his long fingers gloveless as he bends to probe the sand .
Thompson ’s doctoral study was on slimy stuff that mollusks such as limpets and winkles like to eat : diatoms , cyanobacteria , algae , and tiny plants that cling to seaweed .
What he ’s now known for , however , has less to do with marine life than with the growing presence of things in the ocean that have never been alive at all .
Although he did n’t realize it at the time , what has dominated his life ’s work began when he was still an undergraduate in the 1980s , spending autumn weekends organizing the Liverpool contingent of Great Britain ’s national beach cleanup .
In his final year , he had 170 teammates amassing metric tons of rubbish along eighty - five miles of shoreline .
Apart from items that apparently had dropped from boats , such as Greek salt boxes and Italian oil cruets , from the labels he could see that most debris was blowing east from Ireland .
In turn , Sweden ’s shores were the receptacles for trash from England .
Any packaging that trapped enough air to protrude from the water seemed to obey the wind currents , which in these latitudes are easterly .
Smaller , lower - profile fragments , however , were apparently controlled by currents in the water .
Each year , as he compiled the team ’s annual reports , Thompson noticed more and more garbage that was smaller and smaller amid the usual bottles and automobile tires .
He and another student began collecting sand samples along beach strand lines .
They sieved the tiniest particles of whatever appeared unnatural , and tried to identify them under a microscope .
This proved tricky .
Their subjects were usually too small to allow them to pinpoint the bottles , toys , or appliances from which they sprang .
He continued working the annual cleanup during graduate studies at Newcastle .
Once he completed his PhD and began teaching at Plymouth , his department acquired a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer , a device that passes a microbeam through a substance , then compares its infrared spectrum to a database of known material .
Now he could know what he was looking at , which only deepened his concern .
“ Any idea what these are ? ” Thompson is guiding a visitor along the shore of the Plym River estuary , near where it joins the sea .
With a full moonrise just a few hours off , the tide is out nearly two hundred meters , exposing a sandy flat scattered with bladderwrack and cockle shells .
A breeze skims the tidal pools , shivering rows of reflected hillside housing projects .
Thompson bends over the strand line of detritus left by the forward edge of waves lapping the shore , looking for anything recognizable : hunks of nylon rope , syringes , topless plastic food containers , half a ship ’s float , pebbled remains of polystyrene packaging , and a rainbow of assorted bottle caps .
Most plentiful of all are multicolored plastic shafts of cotton ear - swabs .
But there are also the odd little uniform shapes he challenges people to identify .
Among twigs and seaweed fibers in his fistful of sand are a couple dozen blue and green plastic cylinders about two millimeters high .
“ They ’re called nurdles .
They ’re the raw materials of plastic production .
They melt these down to make all kinds of things . ”
He walks a little farther , then scoops up another handful .
It contains more of the same plastic bits : pale blue ones , greens , reds , and tans .
Each handful , he calculates , is about 20 percent plastic , and each holds at least thirty pellets .
“ You find these things on virtually every beach these days .
Obviously they are from some factory . ”
However , there is no plastic manufacturing anywhere nearby .
The pellets have ridden some current over a great distance until they were deposited here — collected and sized by the wind and tide .
IN THOMPSON’S LABORATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY of Plymouth , graduate student Mark Browne unpacks foil - wrapped beach samples that arrive in clear zip - lock bags sent by an international network of colleagues .
He transfers these to a glass separating funnel , filled with a concentrated solution of sea salt to float off the plastic particles .
He filters out some he thinks he recognizes , such as pieces of the ubiquitous colored ear - swab shafts — to check under the microscope .
Anything really unusual goes to the FTIR Spectrometer .
Each takes more than an hour to identify .
About one - third turn out to be natural fibers such as seaweed , another third are plastic , and another third are unknown — meaning that they have n’t found a match in their polymer database , or that the particle has been in the water so long its color has degraded , or that it ’s too small for their machine , which analyzes fragments only to twenty microns — slightly thinner than a human hair .
“ That means we ’re underestimating the amount of plastic that we ’re finding .
The true answer is we just do n’t know how much is out there . ”
What they do know is that there ’s much more than ever before .
During the early twentieth century , Plymouth marine biologist Alistair Hardy developed an apparatus that could be towed behind an Antarctic expedition boat , ten meters below the surface , to sample krill — the ant - sized , shrimplike invertebrate on which much of the planet ’s food chain rests .
In the 1930s , he modified it to measure even smaller plankton .
It employed an impeller to turn a moving band of silk , similar to how a dispenser in a public lavatory moves cloth towels .
As the silk passed over an opening , it filtered plankton from water passing through it .
Each band of silk had a sampling capacity of five hundred nautical miles .
Hardy was able to convince English merchant vessels using commercial shipping lanes throughout the North Atlantic to drag his Continuous Plankton Recorder for several decades , amassing a database so valuable he was eventually knighted for his contributions to marine science .
He took so many samples from around the British Isles that only every second one was analyzed .
Decades later , Richard Thompson realized that the ones that remained stored in a climate - controlled Plymouth warehouse were a time capsule containing a record of growing contamination .
He picked two routes out of northern Scotland that had been sampled regularly : one to Iceland , one to the Shetland Islands .
His team pored over rolls of silk reeking of chemical preservative , looking for old plastic .
There was no reason to examine years prior to World War II because until then plastic barely existed , except for the Bakelite used in telephones and radios , appliances so durable they had yet to enter the waste chain .
Disposable plastic packaging had n’t yet been invented .
By the 1960s , however , they were seeing increasing numbers of increasing kinds of plastic particles .
By the 1990s , the samples were flecked with triple the amount of acrylic , polyester , and crumbs of other synthetic polymers than had been present three decades earlier .
Especially troubling was that Hardy ’s plankton recorder had trapped all this plastic ten meters below the surface , suspended in the water .
Since plastic mostly floats , that meant they were seeing just a fraction of what was actually there .
Not only was the amount of plastic in the ocean increasing , but ever smaller bits of it were appearing — small enough to ride global sea currents .
Thompson ’s team realized that slow mechanical action — waves and tides that grind against shorelines , turning rocks into beaches — were now doing the same to plastics .
The largest , most conspicuous items bobbing in the surf were slowly getting smaller .
At the same time , there was no sign that any of the plastic was biodegrading , even when reduced to tiny fragments .
“ We imagined it was being ground down smaller and smaller , into a kind of powder .
And we realized that smaller and smaller could lead to bigger and bigger problems . ”
He knew the terrible tales of sea otters choking on poly - ethylene rings from beer six - packs ; of swans and gulls strangled by nylon nets and fishing lines ; of a green sea turtle in Hawai ’i dead with a pocket comb , a foot of nylon rope , and a toy truck wheel lodged in its gut .
His personal worst was a study on fulmar carcasses washed ashore on North Sea coastlines .
Ninety - five percent had plastic in their stomachs — an average of forty - four pieces per bird .
A proportional amount in a human being would weigh nearly five pounds .
There was no way of knowing if the plastic had killed them , although it was a safe bet that , in many , chunks of indigestible plastic had blocked their intestines .
Thompson reasoned that if larger plastic pieces were breaking down into smaller particles , smaller organisms would likely be consuming them .
He devised an aquarium experiment , using bottom - feeding lugworms that live on organic sediments , barnacles that filter organic matter suspended in water , and sand fleas that eat beach detritus .
In the experiment , plastic particles and fibers were provided in proportionately bite - sized quantities .
Each creature promptly ingested them .
When the particles lodged in their intestines , the resulting constipation was terminal .
But if the pieces were small enough , they passed through the invertebrates ’ digestive tracts and emerged , seemingly harmlessly , out the other end .
Did that mean that plastics were so stable that they were n’t toxic ?
At what point would they start to naturally break down — and when they did , would they release some fearful chemicals that would endanger organisms some time far in the future ?
Richard Thompson did n’t know .
Nobody did , because plastics have n’t been around long enough for us to know how long they ’ll last or what will happen to them .
His team had identified nine different kinds in the sea so far , varieties of acrylic , nylon , polyester , polyethylene , polypropylene , and polyvinyl chloride .
All he knew was that soon everything alive would be eating them .
“ When they get as small as powder , even zooplankton will swallow them . ”
TWO SOURCES OF TINY PLASTIC PARTICLES had n’t before occurred to Thompson .
Plastic bags clog everything from sewer drains to the gullets of sea turtles that mistake them for jellyfish .
Increasingly , purportedly biodegradable versions were available .
Thompson ’s team tried them .
Most turned out to be just a mixture of cellulose and polymers .
After the cellulose starch broke down , thousands of clear , nearly invisible plastic particles remained .
Some bags were advertised to degrade in compost piles as heat generated by decaying organic garbage rises past one hundred degrees Fahrenheit .
“ Maybe they do .
But that does n’t happen on a beach , or in salt water . ”
He ’d learned that after they tied plastic produce bags to moorings in Plymouth Harbor .
“ A year later you could still carry groceries in them . ”
Even more exasperating was what his PhD student Mark Browne had discovered while shopping in a pharmacy .
Browne pulls open the top drawer of a laboratory cabinet .
Inside is a cornucopia of feminine beauty aids : shower massage creams , body scrubs , and hand cleaners .
Several are by boutique labels : Neova Body Smoother , SkinCeuticals Body Polish , and DDF Strawberry Almond Body Polish .
Others are international name brands : Neutrogena , Clearasil , Pond ’s Fresh Start , even a tube of Colgate Icy Blast toothpaste .
Some are available in the United States , others only in the United Kingdom .
But all have one thing in common .
“ Exfoliants : little granules that massage you as you bathe . ”
He selects a peach - colored tube of St. Ives Apricot Scrub ; its label reads : 100 % natural exfoliants .
“ This stuff is okay .
The granules are actually chunks of ground - up jojoba seeds and walnut shells . ”
Other natural brands use grape seeds , apricot hulls , coarse sugar , or sea salt .
“ The rest of them , ” he says , with a sweep of his hand , “ have all gone to plastic . ”
On each , listed among the ingredients are “ micro - fine polyethylene granules , ” or “ polyethylene micro- spheres , ” or “ polyethylene beads . ”
Or just polyethylene .
“ Can you believe it ? ” Richard Thompson demands of no one in particular , loud enough that faces bent over microscopes rise to look at him .
“ They ’re selling plastic meant to go right down the drain , into the sewers , into the rivers , right into the ocean .
Bite - sized pieces of plastic to be swallowed by little sea creatures . ”
Plastic bits are also increasingly used to scour paint from boats and aircraft .
Thompson shudders .
“ One wonders where plastic beads laden with paint are disposed .
It would be di;cult to contain them on a windy day .
But even if they ’re contained , there ’s no filter in any sewage works for material that small .
It ’s inevitable .
They end up in the environment . ”
He peers into Browne ’s microscope at a sample from Finland .
A lone green fiber , probably from a plant , lies across three bright blue threads that probably are n’t .
He perches on the countertop , hooking his hiking boots around a lab stool .
“ Think of it this way .
Suppose all human activity ceased tomorrow , and suddenly there ’s no one to produce plastic anymore .
Just from what ’s already present , given how we see it fragmenting , organisms will be dealing with this stuff indefinitely .
Thousands of years , possibly .
Or more . ”
IN ONE SENSE , PLASTICS HAVE BEEN AROUND for millions of years .
Plastics are polymers : simple molecular configurations of carbon and hydrogen atoms that link together repeatedly to form chains .
Spiders have been spinning polymer fibers called silk since before the Carboniferous Age , whereupon trees appeared and started making cellulose and lignin , also natural polymers .
Cotton and rubber are polymers , and we make the stuff ourselves , too , in the form of collagen that comprises , among other things , our fingernails .
Another natural , moldable polymer that closely fits our idea of plastics is the secretion from an Asian scale beetle that we know as shellac .
It was the search for an artificial shellac substitute that one day led chemist Leo Baekeland to mix tarry carbolic acid –- phenol — with formaldehyde in his garage in Yonkers , New York .
Until then , shellac was the only coating available for electric wires and connections .
The moldable result became Bakelite .
Baekeland became very wealthy , and the world became a very different place .
Chemists were soon busy cracking long hydrocarbon chain molecules of crude petroleum into smaller ones , and mixing these fractionates to see what variations on Baekeland ’s first man-made plastic they could produce .
Adding chlorine yielded a strong , hardy polymer unlike anything in nature , known today as PVC .
Blowing gas into another polymer as it formed created tough , linked bubbles called polystyrene , often known by the brand name Styrofoam .
And the continual quest for an artificial silk led to nylon .
Sheer nylon stockings revolutionized the apparel industry and helped to drive acceptance of plastic as a defining achievement of modern life .
The intercession of World War II , which diverted most nylon and plastic to the war effort , only made people desire them more .
After 1945 , a torrent of products the world had never seen roared into general consumption : acrylic textiles , Plexiglass , polyethylene bottles , polypropylene containers , and “ foam rubber ” polyurethane toys .
Most world - changing of all was transparent packaging , including self - clinging wraps of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene , which let us see the foods wrapped inside them and kept them preserved longer than ever before .
Within ten years , the downside to this wonder substance was apparent .
In 1955 , Life magazine coined the term “ throwaway society . ”
However , Stanford archaeologist William Rathje , who has made a career of studying garbage in America , finds himself continually disabusing waste management officials and the general public of what he deems a myth : that plastic is responsible for overflowing landfills across the country .
Rathje ’s decades - long Garbage Project , wherein students weighed and measured weeks ’ worth of residential waste , reported during the 1980s that , contrary to popular belief , plastic accounts for less than 20 percent by volume of buried wastes , in part because it can be compressed more tightly than other refuse .
Although increasingly higher percentages of plastic items have been produced since then , Rathje does n’t expect the proportions to change , because improved manufacturing uses less plastic per soda bottle or disposable wrapper .
The bulk of what ’s in landfills , he says , is construction debris and paper products .
Newspapers , he claims , again belying a common assumption , do n’t biodegrade when buried away from air and water .
“ That ’s why we have three - thousand - year - old papyrus scrolls from Egypt .
We pull perfectly readable newspapers out of landfills from the 1930s .
They ’ll be down there for ten thousand years . ”
He agrees , though , that plastic embodies our collective guilt over trashing the environment .
Something about plastic feels uneasily permanent .
The difference may have to do with what happens outside landfills , where a newspaper gets shredded by wind , cracks in sunlight , and dissolves in rain — if it does n’t burn first .
What happens to plastic , however , can be seen most vividly in places where trash is never collected .
Humans have continuously inhabited the Hopi Indian Reservation in northern Arizona since AD1000 — longer than any other site in today ’s United States .
The principal Hopi villages sit atop three mesas with 360 - degree views of the surrounding desert .
For centuries , the Hopis simply threw their garbage , consisting of food scraps and broken ceramic , over the sides of the mesas .
Coyotes and vultures took care of the food wastes , and the pottery sherds blended back into the ground they came from .
That worked fine until the mid-twentieth century .
Then , the garbage tossed over the side stopped going away .
The Hopis were visibly surrounded by a rising pile of a new , nature - proof kind of trash .
The only way it disappeared was by being blown across the desert .
But it was still there , stuck to sage and mesquite branches , impaled on cactus spines .
SOUTH OF THE HOPI MESAS rise the 12,500 - foot San Francisco Peaks ; east of the peaks are the even taller Rockies ; and to their west are the Sierra Madres , whose volcanic summits are higher still .
Impossible as it is for us to fathom , all these colossal mountains will one day erode to the sea — every boulder , outcrop , saddle , spire , and canyon wall .
Every massive uplift will pulverize , their minerals dissolving to keep the oceans salted , the plume of nutrients in their soils nourishing a new marine biological age even as the previous one disappears beneath their sediments .
Long before that , however , these deposits will have been preceded by a substance far lighter and more easily carried seaward than rocks or even grains of silt .
Captain Charles Moore of Long Beach , California , learned this one day in 1997 when , sailing out of Honolulu , he steered his aluminum - hulled catamaran into a part of the western Pacific he ’d always avoided .
Sometimes known as the Horse Latitudes , it is a Texas - sized span of ocean between Hawai’i and California rarely plied by sailors because of a perennial , slowly rotating high - pressure vortex of hot equatorial air that inhales wind and never gives it back .
Beneath it , the water describes lazy , clockwise whorls toward a depression at the center .
Its correct name is the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre , though Moore soon learned that oceanographers had another label for it : the Great Pacific Garbage Patch .
Captain Moore had wandered into a sump where nearly everything that blows into the water from half the Pacific Rim eventually ends up , spiraling slowly toward a widening horror of industrial excretion .
For a week , Moore and his crew found themselves crossing a sea the size of a small continent , covered with floating refuse .
It was not unlike an Arctic vessel pushing through chunks of brash ice , except what was bobbing around them was a fright of cups , bottle caps , tangles of fish netting and monofilament line , bits of polystyrene packaging , six - pack rings , spent balloons , filmy scraps of sandwich wrap , and limp plastic bags that defied counting .
Just two years earlier , Moore had retired from his wood - furniture - finishing business .
A lifelong surfer , his hair still ungrayed , he ’d built himself a boat and settled into what he planned to be a stimulating young retirement .
Raised by a sailing father and certified as a captain by the U.S. Coast Guard , he started a volunteer marine environmental - monitoring group .
After his hellish mid-Pacific encounter with the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , his group ballooned into what is now the Algita Marine Research Foundation , devoted to confronting the flotsam of a half century , since 90 percent of the junk he was seeing was plastic .
What stunned Charles Moore most was learning where it came from .
In 1975 , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences had estimated that all oceangoing vessels together dumped 8 million pounds of plastic annually .
More recent research showed the world ’s merchant fleet alone shamelessly tossing around 639,000 plastic containers every day .
But littering by all the commercial ships and navies , Moore discovered , amounted to mere polymer crumbs in the ocean compared to what was pouring from the shore .
The real reason that the world ’s landfills were n’t overflowing with plastic , he found , was because most of it ends up in an ocean - fill .
After a few years of sampling the North Pacific gyre , Moore concluded that 80 percent of mid-ocean flotsam had originally been discarded on land .
It had blown off garbage trucks or out of landfills , spilled from railroad shipping containers and washed down storm drains , sailed down rivers or wafted on the wind , and found its way to this widening gyre .
“ This , ” Captain Moore tells his passengers , “ is where all the things end up that flow down rivers to the sea . ”
It is the same phrase the geologists have uttered to students since the beginning of science .
However , what Moore refers to is a type of runoff and sedimentation that the Earth had hitherto never known in 5 billion years of geologic time - but likely will henceforth .
DURING HIS FIRST THOUSAND - MILE CROSSING of the gyre , Moore calculated half a pound for every one hundred square meters of debris on the surface , and arrived at 3 million tons of plastic .
His estimate , it turned out , was corroborated by U.S. Navy calculations .
It was the first of many staggering figures he would encounter .
And it only represented visible plastic : an indeterminate amount of larger fragments get fouled by enough algae and barnacles to sink .
In 1998 , Moore returned with a trawling device , such as Sir Alistair Hardy had employed to sample krill , and found , incredibly , more plastic by weight than plankton on the ocean ’s surface .
In fact , it was n’t even close : six times as much .
When he sampled near the mouths of Los Angeles creeks that emptied into the Pacific , the numbers rose by a factor of one hundred , and kept rising every year .
By now he was comparing data with University of Plymouth marine biologist Richard Thompson .
Like Thompson , what especially shocked him were plastic bags and the ubiquitous little raw plastic pellets .
In India alone , five thousand processing plants were producing plastic bags .
Kenya was churning out four thousand tons of bags a month , with no potential for recycling .
As for the little pellets known as nurdles , 5.5 quadrillion — about 250 billion pounds — were manufactured annually .
Not only was Moore finding them everywhere , but he was unmistakably seeing the plastic resin bits trapped inside the transparent bodies of jellyfish and salps , the ocean ’s most prolific and widely distributed filter feeders .
Like seabirds , they ’d mistaken brightly colored pellets for fish eggs , and tan ones for krill .
And now God - knows - how - many quadrillion little pieces more , coated in body - scrub chemicals and perfectly bite - sized for the little creatures that bigger creatures eat , were being flushed seaward .
What did this mean for the ocean , the ecosystem , the future ?
All this plastic had appeared in barely more than fifty years .
Would its chemical constituents or additives — for instance , colorants such as metallic copper — concentrate as they ascended the food chain , and alter evolution ?
Would it last long enough to enter the fossil record ?
Would geologists millions of years hence find Barbie doll parts imbedded in conglomerates formed in seabed depositions ?
Would they be intact enough to be pieced together like dinosaur bones ?
Or would they decompose first , expelling hydrocarbons that would seep out of a vast plastic Neptune ’s graveyard for eons to come , leaving fossilized imprints of Barbie and Ken hardened in stone for eons beyond ?
MOORE AND THOMPSON BEGAN consulting materials experts .
Tokyo University geochemist Hideshige Takada , who specialized in EDCs — endocrine - disrupting chemicals , or “ gender benders ” — had been on a gruesome mission to personally research exactly what evils were leaching from garbage dumps all around Southeast Asia .
Now he was examining plastic pulled from the Sea of Japan and Tokyo Bay .
He reported that in the sea , nurdles and other plastic fragments acted both as magnets and as sponges for resilient poisons like DDT and PCBs .
The use of aggressively toxic polychlorinated biphenyls — PCBs — to make plastics more pliable had been banned since 1970 ; among other hazards , PCBs were known to promote hormonal havoc such as hermaphroditic fish and polar bears .
Like time - release capsules , pre-1970 plastic flotsam will gradually leak PCBs into the ocean for centuries .
But , as Takada also discovered , free - floating toxins from all kinds of sources — copy paper , automobile grease , coolant fluids , old fluorescent tubes , and infamous discharges by General Electric and Monsanto plants directly into streams and rivers — readily stick to the surfaces of free - floating plastic .
One study directly correlated ingested plastics with PCBs in the fat tissue of puffins .
The astonishing part was the amount .
Takada and his colleagues found that the plastic pellets eaten by the birds concentrated poisons to levels as high as 1 million times their normal occurrence in seawater .
By 2005 , Moore was referring to the gyrating Pacific dump as 10 million square miles — nearly the size of Africa .
It was n’t the only one : the planet has six other major tropical oceanic gyres , all of them swirling with ugly debris .
It was as if plastic exploded upon the world from a tiny seed after World War II and , like the Big Bang , was still expanding .
Even if all production suddenly ceased , an astounding amount of the astoundingly durable stuff was already out there .
Plastic debris , Moore believed , was now the most common surface feature of the world ’s oceans .
How long would it last ?
Were there any benign , less - immortal substitutes that civilization could convert to , lest the world be plastic - wrapped evermore ?
THAT FALL , MOORE , THOMPSON , AND TAKADA convened at a marine plastic summit in Los Angeles with Dr. Anthony Andrady .
A senior research scientist at North Carolina ’s Research Triangle , Andrady is from Sri Lanka , one of South Asia ’s rubber - producing powers .
While studying polymer science in graduate school , he was distracted from a career in rubber by the surging plastics industry .
An eight - hundred - page tome he eventually compiled , Plastics in the Environment , won him acclaim from the industry and environmentalists alike as the oracle on its subject .
The long - term prognosis for plastic , Andrady told assembled marine scientists , is exactly that : long term .
It ’s no surprise that plastics have made an enduring mess in the oceans , he explained .
Their elasticity , versatility ( they can either sink or float ) , near invisibility in water , durability , and superior strength were exactly why net and fishing line manufacturers had abandoned natural fibers for synthetics such as nylon and polyethylene .
In time , the former disintegrate ; the latter , even when torn and lost , continue “ ghost fishing . ”
As a result , virtually every marine species , including whales , is in danger of being snared by great tangles of nylon loose in the oceans .
Like any hydrocarbon , Andrady said , even plastics “ inevitably must biodegrade , but at such a slow rate that it is of little practical consequence .
They can , however , photodegrade in a meaningful time frame . ”
He explained :
When hydrocarbons biodegrade , their polymer molecules are disassembled into the parts that originally combined to create them - carbon dioxide and water .
When they photodegrade , ultraviolet solar radiation weakens plastic ’s tensile strength by breaking its long , chainlike polymer molecules into shorter segments .
Since the strength of plastics depends on the length of their intertwined polymer chains , as the UV rays snap them , the plastic starts to decompose .
Everyone has seen polyethylene and other plastics turn yellow and brittle and start to flake in sunlight .
Often , plastics are treated with additives to make them more UV - resistant ; other additives can make them more UV - sensitive .
Using the latter for six - pack rings , Andrady suggested , might save the lives of many sea creatures .
However , there are two problems .
For one , plastic takes much longer to photodegrade in water .
On land , plastic left in the sun absorbs infrared heat , and is soon much hotter than the surrounding air .
In the ocean , not only does it stay cooled by water , but fouling algae shield it from sunlight .
The other hitch is that even though a ghost fishnet made from photodegradable plastic might disintegrate before it drowns any dolphins , its chemical nature will not change for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years .
“ Plastic is still plastic .
The material still remains a polymer .
Polyethylene is not biodegraded in any practical time scale .
There is no mechanism in the marine environment to biodegrade that long a molecule . ”
Even if photodegradable nets help marine mammals live , he concluded , their powdery residue remains in the sea , where the filter feeders will find it .
“ EXCEPT FOR A SMALL AMOUNT that ’s been incinerated , ” says Tony Andrady the oracle , “ every bit of plastic manufactured in the world for the last fifty years or so still remains .
It ’s somewhere in the environment . ”
That half century ’s total production now surpasses 1 billion tons .
It includes hundreds of different plastics , with untold permutations involving added plasticizers , opacifiers , colors , fillers , strengtheners , and light stabilizers .
The longevity of each can vary enormously .
Thus far , none has disappeared .
Researchers have attempted to find out how long it will take polyethylene to biodegrade by incubating a sample in a live bacteria culture .
A year later , less than 1 percent was gone .
“ And that ’s under the best controlled laboratory conditions .
That ’s not what you will find in real life , ” says Tony Andrady .
“ Plastics have n’t been around long enough for microbes to develop the enzymes to handle it , so they can only biodegrade the very - low - molecular - weight part of the plastic ” — meaning , the smallest , already broken polymer chains .
Although truly biodegradable plastics derived from natural plant sugars have appeared , as well as biodegradable polyester made from bacteria , the chances of them replacing the petroleum - based originals are n’t great .
“ Since the idea of packaging is to protect food from bacteria , ” Andrady observes , “ wrapping leftovers in plastic that encourages microbes to eat it may not be the smartest thing to do . ”
But even if it worked , or even if humans were gone and never produced another nurdle , all the plastic already produced would remain — how long ?
“ Egyptian pyramids have preserved corn , seeds , and even human parts such as hair because they were sealed away from sunlight with little oxygen or moisture , ” says Andrady , a mild , precise man with a broad face and a clipped , persuasively reasonable voice .
“ Our waste dumps are somewhat like that .
Plastic buried where there ’s little water , sun , or oxygen will stay intact a long time .
That is also true if it is sunk in the ocean , covered with sediment .
At the bottom of the sea , there ’s no oxygen , and it ’s very cold . ”
He gives a clipped little laugh .
“ Of course , ” he adds , “ we do n’t know much about microbiology at those depths .
Possibly anaerobic organisms there can biodegrade it .
It ’s not inconceivable .
But no one ’s taken a submersible down to check .
Based on our observations , it ’s unlikely .
So we expect much - slower degradation at the sea bottom .
Many times longer .
Even an order of magnitude longer . ”
An order of magnitude — that ’s ten times — longer than what ?
One thousand years ?
Ten thousand ?
No one knows , because no plastic has died a natural death yet .
It took today ’s microbes that break hydrocarbons down to their building blocks a long time after plants appeared to learn to eat lignin and cellulose .
More recently , they ’ve even learned to eat oil .
None can digest plastic yet , because fifty years is too short a time for evolution to develop the necessary biochemistry .
“ But give it a hundred thousand years , ” says Andrady the optimist — he was in his native Sri Lanka when the Christmas 2004 tsunami hit , and even there , after those apocalyptic waters struck , people found reason to hope .
“ I ’m sure you ’ll find many species of microbes whose genes will let them do this tremendously advantageous thing , so that their numbers will grow and prosper .
Today ’s amount of plastic will take hundreds of thousands of years to consume , but , eventually , it will all biodegrade .
Lignin is far more complex , and it biodegrades .
It ’s just a matter of waiting for evolution to catch up with the materials we are making . ”
And should biologic time run out and some plastics remain ?
“ The upheavals and pressure will change it into something else .
Just like trees buried in bogs a long time ago — the geologic process , not biodegradation , changed them into oil and coal .
Maybe high concentrations of plastics will turn into something like that .
Eventually , they will change .
Change is the hallmark of nature .
Nothing remains the same . ”
Facebook should have fired their development team the minute they became successful .
If you ’re a startup and you just made it big you should take a long hard look at your software team and make some changes .
I ’ve worked for two startups and consulted at several more .
I ’m not just talking about software startups , this applies to many industries — transportation , web 2.0 , shopping , digital media , government — where the guys who built v1 of your web site , order tracking software , customer service tool , batch processing system , whatever , are unequivocably not the people you should rely on to take you from Startup to Enterprise .
When you ’re a startup , time - to - market and user base are absolutely the most important success factors .
For an aviation startup , flying your planes , selling your tickets and generating a loyal customer base are the most important things .
As a computer manufacturer , you hire ex-military types to run your logistics and can custom build a PC and get it to a customer ’s doorstep in four days .
In general , an IT / programming competency is not required for a startup to be successful .
In fact , “ enterprise ” engineering practices can actually slow you down .
As someone who ’s written software at startups I know the pressures to get the next demo ready , to release the next feature for the web site .
At that stage in the life of a startup we do n’t even know if the company will survive another month .
Heavyweight testing , deployment and release processes just slow you down .
I ’d argue that most development teams actually do the right thing at this point .
Get the software done , fast , and make it mostly work .
The problem I ’ve found when working at startups - turned - enterprises is that the guys who built v1 of that web site are now running the IT department .
The operations guy who originally managed the company ’s one web site is now in charge of your entire data centre .
The v1 codebase has been hacked and patched into v2 and v3 , and everything is in a mess .
Let ’s talk about the codebase .
When trying to get stuff out the door as fast as possible developers will often find out that a design decision they made is no longer appropriate .
Given enough time they could fix that problem , but they do n’t because the demo is happening tomorrow .
And this is the right decision !
But letting that patched , hacked , copy - and - pasted codebase live any longer than it takes for the company to declare itself stable is a really bad idea .
Most software developers do n’t know how to engineer large enterprise systems .
Most large enterprise systems are engineered badly .
I know , I ’ve seen a lot of them .
Even with a resume with years of experience on appropriate sounding systems , most developers wo n’t know a well engineered app from a hole in the head .
Now give these guys a couple of years hacking some code together for your startup and promote them to Chief Architect .
Hire an expensive consulting company to help you build your systems better , and allow Chief Architect dude to ignore their recommendations .
What ?
Seriously .
The minute you ’re successful , plan to rewrite your software from scratch .
Plan to hire enterprise quality developers .
Move anyone with decent business knowledge ( like Chief Architect dude ) into business - related roles .
They ’ll be much more valuable there and cause you less problems .
Hire a new development manager with proven experience engineering enterprise software .
Pay them market rate +30 % ( you ’re successful , remember ? ) .
Keep your developers but explain to them that you ’re no longer a startup and they ’re going to have to raise their game .
At the same time you ’ll be putting that old codebase in maintenance mode and starting with a clean slate .
This will require planning with your business — you wo n’t be giving them new features for a while until you can rewrite your software .
Believe me , you ’ll end up with much better engineered software that can respond to change faster than your existing stuff .
Do n’t believe me ?
As a successful startup looking to become an enterprise , try the following exercises :
n May 28 , 1998 , in response to unscheduled underground tests , weeks earlier , of several nukes by the Indians , the Pakistanis somehow managed to prepare for and test , underground , up to six " Islamic " nukes , most of them based on almost - pure Uranium - 235 , but at least one of them probably based on almost - pure Plutonium - 239 and  according to the Pakistanis  " boosted . "
Great Zot !
It had been assumed that Pakistan had a few gun - type nukes .
In a gun - type nuke  like the Little Boy we dropped on Hiroshima  you just shoot one sub-critical mass of U - 235 at another sub-critical mass .
It hardly needs testing .
We never tested the Little Boy , which contained about 140 pounds of U - 235 , but weighed about 10,000 pounds .
In 1993 , it had been revealed that South Africa had developed  and then completely dismantled  an indigenous cradle - to - grave gun - type nuke capability .
During the 1980s they stockpiled a half - dozen such nukes , each requiring 120 pounds of U - 235 , and each weighing about 2,000 pounds .
The South African nukes were much lighter than Little Boy , but still too heavy to be delivered by intermediate - range ballistic missile .
[ The Fat Man  the Pu-239 implosion - type nuke we dropped on Nagasaki  also weighed about 10,000 pounds and was deliverable only by specially modified B - 29s .
It took us about ten years to get that weight down to a thousand pounds , still too heavy to be delivered by ballistic missile or by fighter - bombers . ]
The International Atomic Energy Agency discovered after the first Gulf War that Saddam had tried  but failed  to produce a U - 235 - based implosion - type nuke .
Saddam had an indigenous nuke computer - design  which he turned over to the IAEA  but he never had the necessary U - 235 .
His primitive design probably would n’t have worked , anyway .
But Pakistan did have the necessary U - 235 ( and Pu-239 ) and several of their multiple designs apparently did work .
Furthermore , the Pakistanis claim that at least one of their tested nukes was " boosted . "
[ You can read about " boosting " in the Cox Committee Report .
It ’s the " secret " of warhead miniaturization that some Chinese mole at Los Alamos National Laboratory is alleged to have given the Chinese Commies , circa 1995 . ]
The Pakistanis claim their nukes are small enough to be delivered by ballistic missile but there is increasingly reason to doubt that claim .
A couple of weeks ago , Joby Warrick reported in the Washington Post , that the Bush - Cheney administration has long viewed those Islamic nukes to be a " security threat " to the Homeland " in the event of any theft or diversion to terrorist groups . "
But , not to worry .
According to two un-named " knowledgeable " Bush - Cheney " intelligence officials , " we " have long had contingency plans for intervening to obstruct such a theft . "
According to some Warrick - styled " nuclear weapons expert " named Matt Bunn , the fissile " core " of a Pakistani nuke is removable and is stored at a different site than the rest of the nuke .
Hence , according to Bunn , would - be thieves would have to " knock over two buildings to get a complete bomb . "
In effect , Bunn and other " nuclear weapons experts " claim that Pakistani nukes are similar to our first - generation removable - core nukes [ both gun - type and implosion - type ] , which entered stockpile in the early 1950s .
But now comes Adrian Levy , co-author of Deception : Pakistan , the United States , and the Secret Trade in Nuclear Weapons to claim otherwise .
According to the publisher ’s synopsis ;
" On December 15 , 1975 , A. Q. Khan  a young Pakistani scientist working in Holland  stole top - secret blueprints for a revolutionary new process to arm a nuclear bomb .
His original intention , and that of his government , was purely patriotic  to provide Pakistan a counter to India ’s recently unveiled nuclear device .
However , as Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott - Clark chillingly relate in their masterful investigation of Khan ’s career over the past thirty years , over time that limited ambition mushroomed into the world ’s largest clandestine network engaged in selling nuclear secrets  a mercenary and illicit program managed by the Pakistani military and made possible , in large part , by aid money from the United States , Saudi Arabia , and Libya , and by indiscriminate assistance from China . "
Top - secret blueprints for a revolutionary new process to arm a nuclear bomb ?
Surely , Levy did n’t make such ridiculous charges .
Khan was employed in the Netherlands by a sub-contractor to Urenco , a multi-national private sector entity , which , then , as now , was the world ’s leader in providing cost effective uranium enrichment services .
Urenco was , and is , also the world ’s leader in the development of gas - centrifuge isotope - separation technology .
Urenco does have industrial secrets , which are protected by law in the states in which Urenco operates , but they cannot properly be described as " Top - Secret . "
Furthermore , Urenco has nothing whatever to do with the " arming " of a nuclear bomb .
Nevertheless , in a recent interview conducted by Amy Goodman on " Democracy Now , " Levy essentially repeats those charges , claiming that Khan stole " some critical blueprints on a revolutionary method of using uranium to arm a nuclear device . "
Since Levy obviously does n’t have the foggiest idea how nuclear weapons are constructed , armed and detonated ( according to General Musharraf , metallurgist AQ Khan does n’t either ) perhaps we ought not go on listening .
But forewarned , let ’s continue ;
" In ’79 , of course , the Soviets invade Afghanistan and prior to that , the U.S. ally , the Shah , in Iran , flees , enabling Khomenei , the Ayatollah , to come back .
And the CIA loses its listening stations .
It loses a great ally .
" And suggestions are made to Carter by Brzyzenski , the National Security Adviser that America reconsider for the first time the " gold standard of nonproliferation " and shove it down the agenda in order to begin a new relationship with Pakistan that was struggling to obtain nuclear weapons .
" So the suggestion by Brzyzenski was the beginning of turning a blind eye , let ’s say .
But Carter runs out of steam .
It will only be when Reagan comes in 1981 that effectively can lead to this [ permissive ] policy being implemented .
" And then we will see ten years of what State Department people describe as U.S. permissiveness ( but I think what the rest of us would describe as collaboration , covertly ) , between the Reagan administration and the Pakistan military , to cement security relationship , enabling their nuclear program and over that ten years , the whole [ nuke ] program would be facilitated .
" They [ ? ] would cold test a bomb , which means computer simulate one in ’ 82 .
In ’83 they ’d repeat that process .
" In 1984 , the Chinese would take that bomb and hot test it , actually set it off in a [ inaudible ] test site .
" By 1987 , that bomb , the Pakistani bomb , had been fixed under a US - supplied F - 16 fighter jet and was ready to deploy . "
So , according to Levy , way back in 1987 , Pakistan had  courtesy those Dirty Chinese Commies and Ronald Reagan  nukes that could be delivered via F - 16 figher - bomber ?
Well , either nuke " expert " Bunn does n’t know what he ’s talking about , or Levy does n’t , or  what is most likely  none of the so - called experts know what the hell they ’re talking about .
Of course , Musharraf probably does .
Do n’t you feel better already ?

CHICAGO -- A new genus and species of dinosaur from the Early Jurassic has been discovered in Antarctica .
The massive plant - eating primitive sauropodomorph is called Glacialisaurus hammeri and lived about 190 million years ago .
The recently published description of the new dinosaur is based on partial foot , leg and ankle bones found on Mt. Kirkpatrick near the Beardmore Glacier in Antarctica at an elevation of more than 13,000 feet .
" The fossils were painstakingly removed from the ice and rock using jackhammers , rock saws and chisels under extremely difficult conditions over the course of two field seasons , " said Nathan Smith , a graduate student at The Field Museum .
" They are important because they help to establish that primitive sauropodomorph dinosaurs were more broadly distributed than previously thought , and that they coexisted with their cousins , the true sauropods . "
The findings were published online Dec. 5 in the Acta Palaeontologica Poloncica ( see http://www. app. pan. pl / ) .
Diego Pol , a paleontologist at the Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio in Chubut , Argentina , is the other co-author of the research .
Sauropodomorph dinosaurs were the largest animals to ever walk the earth .
They were long - necked herbivores and include Diplodocus and Apatosaurus .
Their sister group is the theropods , which include Tyrannosaurus , Velociraptor , and modern birds .
Glacialisaurus hammeri was about 20 - 25 feet long and weighed about 4 - 6 tons .
It was named after Dr. William Hammer , a professor at Augustana College who led the two field trips to Antarctica that uncovered the fossils .
Glacialisaurus belongs to the sauropodomorph family Massopsondylidae , which may represent a secondary radiation of basal sauropodomorphs during the Early Jurassic .
Currently , the development and evolutionary relationships of the sauropodomorph dinosaurs are hotly debated by paleontologists .
This discovery , however , helps to resolve some of this debate by establishing two things .
First , it shows that sauropodomorphs were widely distributed in the Early Jurassic -- not only in China , South Africa , South America and North America , but also in Antarctica .
" This was probably due to the fact that major connections between the continents still existed at that time , and because climates were more equitable across latitudes than they are today , " Smith said .
Second , the discovery of Glacialisaurus hammeri shows that primitive sauropodomorphs probably coexisted with true sauropods for an extended period of time .
The recent discovery of a possible sauropod at roughly the same location in Antarctica lends additional evidence to the theory that the earliest sauropods coexisted with their basal sauropodomorph cousins , including Glacialisaurus hammeri , during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic , Smith and Pol conclude in their research findings .

( Readers of Planet Haskell may want to avert their eyes from this compendium of Perl introspection techniques .
Moreover , a very naughty four - letter word appears , a word that begins with " g " and ends with " o " .
Let 's just leave it at that . )
Przemek Klosowski wrote to offer me physics help , and also to ask about introspection on Perl objects .
Specifically , he said that if you called a nonexistent method on a TCL object , the error message would include the names of all the methods that would have worked .
He wanted to know if there was a way to get Perl to do something similar .
There is n't , precisely , because Perl has only a conventional distinction between methods and subroutines , and you Just Have To Know which is which , and avoid calling the subroutines as methods , because the Perl interpreter has no idea which is which .
But it does have enough introspection features that you can get something like what you want .
This article will explain how to do that .
Here is a trivial program that invokes an undefined method on an object : use YAML ; my $ obj = YAML -> new ; $ obj->nosuchmethod ;
When run , this produces the fatal error : Ca n't locate object method " nosuchmethod " via package " YAML " at test.pl line 4 . ( YAML in this article is just an example ; you do n't have to know what it does .
In fact , I do n't know what it does . )
Now consider the following program instead : use YAML ; use Help ' YAML ' ; my $ obj = YAML -> new ; $ obj->nosuchmethod ;
Now any failed method calls to YAML objects , or objects of YAML 's subclasses , will produce a more detailed error message : Unknown method ' nosuchmethod ' called on object of class YAML Perhaps try : Bless Blessed Dump DumpFile Load LoadFile VALUE XXX as_heavy ( inherited from Exporter ) die ( inherited from YAML : : Base ) dumper_class dumper_object export ( inherited from Exporter ) export_fail ( inherited from Exporter ) export_ok_tags ( inherited from Exporter ) export_tags ( inherited from Exporter ) export_to_level ( inherited from Exporter ) field freeze global_object import ( inherited from Exporter ) init_action_object loader_class loader_object new ( inherited from YAML : : Base ) node_info ( inherited from YAML : : Base ) require_version ( inherited from Exporter ) thaw warn ( inherited from YAML : : Base ) ynode Aborting at test.pl line 5
Some of the methods in this list are bogus .
For example , the stuff inherited from Exporter should almost certainly not be called on a YAML object .
Some of the items may be intended to be called as functions , and not as methods .
Some may be functions imported from some other module .
A common offender here is Carp , which places a carp function into another module 's namespace ; this function will show up in a list like the one above , without even an " inherited from " note , even though it is not a method and it does not make sense to call it on an object at all .
Even when the items in the list really are methods , they may be undocumented , internal - use - only methods , and may disappear in future versions of the YAML module .
But even with all these warnings , Help is at least a partial solution to the problem .
The real reason for this article is to present the code for Help.pm , not because the module is so intrinsically useful itself , but because it is almost a catalog of weird - but - useful Perl module hackery techniques .
A full and detailed tour of this module 's 30 lines of code would probably make a decent 60 - or 90 - minute class for intermediate Perl programmers who want to become wizards .
( I have given many classes on exactly that topic . )
Here 's the code : package Help ; use Carp ' croak ' ; sub import { my ( $ selfclass , @classes ) = @_ ; for my $ class ( @classes ) { push @ { " $ class\ :: ISA "} , $ selfclass ; } } sub AUTOLOAD { my ( $ bottom_class , $ method ) = $ AUTOLOAD =~ /(.* ) ::(.*) / ; my % known_method ; my @classes = ( $ bottom_class ) ; while ( @classes ) { my $ class = shift @classes ; next if $ class eq __PACKAGE__ ; unshift @classes , @ { " $ class\ : : ISA " } ; for my $ name ( keys % { " $ class \ : : " } ) { next unless defined &{ " $ class \ : : $ name " } ; $ known_method { $ name} ||= $ class ; } } warn " Unknown method ' $ method ' called on object of class $ bottom_class
" ; warn " Perhaps try :
" ; for my $ name ( sort keys % known_method ) { warn " $ name " .
( $ known_method { $name} eq $ bottom_class ? " " : " ( inherited from $ known_method{$name} ) " ) . "
" ; } croak " Aborting " ; } sub help { $ AUTOLOAD = ref ( $ _ [ 0 ] ) . '::( none ) ' ; goto &AUTOLOAD ; } sub DESTROY {} 1 ; use Help ' Foo '
When any part of the program invokes use Help ' Foo ' , this does two things .
First , it locates Help.pm , loads it in , and compiles it , if that has not been done already .
And then it immediately calls Help - > import ( ' Foo ' ) .
Typically , a module 's import method is inherited from Exporter , which gets control at this point and arranges to make some of the module 's functions available in the caller 's namespace .
So , for example , when you invoke use YAML ' freeze ' in your module , Exporter 's import method gets control and puts YAML 's " freeze " function into your module 's namespace .
But that is not what we are doing here .
Instead ,
Help has its own import method : sub import { my ( $ selfclass , @classes ) = @_ ; for my $ class ( @classes ) { push @ { " $class\ :: ISA "} , $ selfclass ; } } The $ selfclass variable becomes Help and @classes becomes ( ' Foo ' ) .
Then the module does its first tricky thing .
It puts itself into the @ISA list of another class .
The push line adds Help to @ Foo : : ISA .
@ Foo :: ISA is the array that is searched whenever a method call on a Foo objects fails because the method does n't exist .
Perl will search the classes named in @ Foo : : ISA , in order .
It will search the Help class last .
That 's important , because we do n't want Help to interfere with Foo 's ordinary inheritance .
Notice the way the variable name Foo:: ISA is generated dynamically by concatenating the value of $ class with the literal string ::ISA .
This is how you access a variable whose name is not known at compile time in Perl .
We will see this technique over and over again in this module .
The backslash in @ { " $class\ :: ISA " } is necessary , because if we wrote @ { " $class : : ISA " } instead , Perl would try to interpolate the value of $ ISA variable from the package named class .
We could get around this by writing something like @{$class .
':: ISA'} , but the backslash is easier to read .
AUTOLOAD
So what happens when the program calls $ foo-> nosuchmethod ?
If one of Foo 's base classes includes a method with that name , it will be called as usual .
But when method search fails , Perl does n't give up right away .
Instead , it tries the method search a second time , this time looking for a method named AUTOLOAD .
If it finds one , it calls it .
It only throws an exception of there is no AUTOLOAD .
The Help class does n't have a nosuchmethod method either , but it does have AUTOLOAD .
If Foo or one of its other parent classes defines an AUTOLOAD , one of those will be called instead .
But if there 's no other AUTOLOAD , then Help 's AUTOLOAD will be called as a last resort .
$ AUTOLOAD
When Perl calls an AUTOLOAD function , it sets the value of $ AUTOLOAD to include the full name of the method it was trying to call , the one that did n't exist .
In our example , $ AUTOLOAD is set to " Foo: : nosuchmethod " .
This pattern match dismantles the contents of $ AUTOLOAD into a class name and a method name : sub AUTOLOAD { my ( $ bottom_class , $ method ) = $ AUTOLOAD =~ /(.* ) ::(.*)/;
The $ bottom_class variable contains Foo , and the $ method variable contains nosuchmethod .
The AUTOLOAD function is now going to accumulate a table of all the methods that could have been called on the target object , print out a report , and throw a fatal exception .
The accumulated table will reside in the private hash % known_method .
Keys in this hash will be method names .
Values will be the classes in which the names were found .
Accumulating the table of method names
The AUTOLOAD function accumulates this hash by doing a depth - first search on the @ISA tree , just like Perl 's method resolution does internally .
The @classes variable is a stack of classes that need to be searched for methods but that have not yet been searched .
Initially , it includes only the class on which the method was actually called , Foo in this case : my @classes = ( $ bottom_class ) ;
As long as some class remains unsearched , this loop will continue to look for more methods .
It begins by grabbing the next class off the stack : while ( @classes ) { my $ class = shift @classes ;
Foo inherits from Help too , but we do n't want our error message to mention that , so the search skips Help : next if $ class eq __PACKAGE__ ; ( __PACKAGE__ expands at compile time to the name of the current package . )
Before the loop actually looks at the methods in the current class it 's searching , it looks to see if the class has any base classes .
If there are any , it pushes them onto the stack to be searched next : unshift @classes , @ { " $class\ :: ISA " } ;
Now the real meat of the loop : there is a class name in $ class , say Foo , and we want the program to find all the methods in that class .
Perl makes the symbol table for the Foo package available in the hash % Foo : : .
Keys in this hash are variable , subroutine , and filehandle names .
To find out if a name denotes a subroutine , we use defined ( &{ subroutine_name} ) for each name in the package symbol table .
If there is a subroutine by that name , the program inserts it and the class name into % known_method .
Otherwise , the name is a variable or filehandle name and is ignored : for my $ name ( keys % { " $ class \ : : " } ) { next unless defined &{ " $ class \ : : $ name " } ; $ known_method { $ name} ||= $ class ; } } The ||= sets a new value for $ name in the hash only if there was not one already .
If a method name appears in more than one class , it is recorded as being in the first one found in the search .
Since the search is proceeding in the same order that Perl uses , the one recorded is the one that Perl will actually find .
For example , if Foo inherits from Bar , and both classes define a this method , the search will find Foo : : this before Bar : : this , and that is what will be recorded in the hash .
This is correct , because Foo 's this method overrides Bar 's .
If you have any clever techniques for identifying other stuff that should be omitted from the output , this is where you would put them .
For example , many authors use the convention that functions whose names have a leading underscore are private to the implementation , and should not be called by outsiders .
We might omit such items from the output by adding a line here : next if $ name =~ /^_/;
After the loop finishes searching all the base classes , the % known_method hash looks something like this : ( this =>
Foo , that =>
Foo , new =>
Base , blookus => Mixin :: Blookus , other => Foo )
This means that methods this , that , and other were defined in Foo itself , but that new is inherited from Base and that blookus was inherited from Mixin : : Blookus .
Printing the report
The AUTOLOAD function then prints out some error messages : warn " Unknown method ' $ method ' called on object of class $ bottom_class
" ; warn " Perhaps try :
" ; And at last the payoff :
It prints out the list of methods that the programmer could have called : for my $ name ( sort keys % known_method ) { warn " $ name " .
( $ known_method { $name} eq $ bottom_class ? " " : " ( inherited from $ known_method{$name} ) " ) . "
" ; } croak " Aborting " ; } Each method name is printed .
If the class in which the method was found is not the bottom class , the name is annotated with the message ( inherited from wherever ) .
The output for my example would look like this : Unknown method ' nosuchmethod ' called on object of class Foo : Perhaps try : blookus ( inherited from Mixin : : Blookus ) new ( inherited from Base ) other that this Aborting at YourErroneousModule .pm line 679 Finally the function throws a fatal exception .
If we had used die here , the fatal error message would look like Aborting at Help. pm line 34 , which is extremely unhelpful .
Using croak instead of die makes the message look like Aborting at test.pl line 5 instead .
That is , it reports the error as coming from the place where the erroneous method was actually called .
Synthetic calls Suppose you want to force the help message to come out .
One way is to call $ object -> fgsfds , since probably the object does not provide a fgsfds method .
But this is ugly , and it might not work , because the object might provide a fgsfds method .
So Help.pm provides another way .
You can always force the help message by calling $ object ->
Help : : help .
This calls a method named help , and it starts the inheritance search in the Help package .
Control is transferred to the following help method : sub help { $ AUTOLOAD = ref ( $ _ [ 0 ] ) . '::( none ) ' ; goto &AUTOLOAD ; } The Help : : help method sets up a fake $ AUTOLOAD value and then uses " magic goto " to transfer control to the real AUTOLOAD function .
" Magic goto " is not the evil bad goto that is Considered Harmful .
It is more like a function call .
But unlike a regular function call , it erases the calling function ( help ) from the control stack , so that to subsequently executed code it appears that AUTOLOAD was called directly in the first place .
Calling AUTOLOAD in the normal way , without goto , would have worked also .
I did it this way just to be a fusspot .
DESTROY
Whenever a Perl object is destroyed , its DESTROY method is called , if it has one .
If not , method search looks for an AUTOLOAD method , if there is one , as usual .
If this lookup fails , no fatal exception is thrown ; the object is sliently destroyed and execution continues .
It is very common for objects to lack a DESTROY method ; usually nothing additional needs to be done when the object 's lifetime is over .
But we do not want the Help : : AUTOLOAD function to be invoked automatically whenever such an object is destroyed !
So Help defines a last - resort DESTROY method that is called instead ; this prevents Perl from trying the AUTOLOAD search when an object with no DESTROY method is destroyed : sub DESTROY {} This DESTROY method restores the default behavior , which is to do nothing .
Living dangerously Perl has a special package , called UNIVERSAL .
Every class inherits from UNIVERSAL .
If you want to apply Help to every class at once , you can try : use Help ' UNIVERSAL ' ; but do n't blame me if something weird happens .
About use strict
Whenever I present code like this , I always get questions ( or are they complaints ? ) from readers about why I omitted " use strict " .
" Always use strict ! " they say .
Well , this code will not run with " use strict " .
It does a lot of stuff on purpose that " strict " was put in specifically to keep you from doing by accident .
At some point you have to take off the training wheels , kiddies .
