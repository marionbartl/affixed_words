Good for Obama !
He 's on the Bus !
Greg Sargent :
It 's official : Obama will back a filibuster of any Senate FISA legislation containing telecom immunity , his campaign has just told Election Central .
The Obama campaign has just sent over the following statement from spokesman Bill Burton : " To be clear : Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies . "
C&L's Action

Hillary Clinton ....
We need clear and decisive leadership on this issue .
The French government yesterday initiated moves to protect crisis - ridden Société Générale from a foreign takeover as shares in France 's second - largest bank rose steeply on rumours of a pending merger with a domestic rival .
Playing the " economic patriotism " card , the prime minister , François Fillon , said : " The government is determined that SocGen remains a great French bank , a player in globalisation . "
He added that ministers would not allow the bank to be prey to " hostile raids by other companies " .
Political observers said President Nicolas Sarkozy was trying to engineer an all - French merger behind the scenes to prevent what one of his closest advisers has called " the very substance of France 's economy " being put at risk .
SocGen , facing losses of € 4.9bn ( £ 3.7 bn ) due to rogue trader Jérôme Kerviel , had lost half its value since June last year , and was worth € 34bn .
But its stock rose 10 % on speculation that BNP Paribas would launch a bid at € 92 a share .
BNP , which made an abortive bid for SocGen in 1999 , refused to comment .
But sources said the idea of an imminent bid was " fantasist " as others suggested BNP , prodded by Sarkozy , could be contemplating a takeover in the medium term .
SocGen insiders insist that now , in the throes of a crisis , is the wrong time for a merger and this could take place only under political duress .
Analysts have linked BNP with SocGen 's retail business and Crédit Agricole with its investment banking division , now severely damaged by Kerviel 's € 50bn gamble on stock futures .
Others say a merger with BNP would mean thousands of job losses among SocGen 's 130,000 staff - who Fillon has pledged to defend .
The government is thought likely to stay its hand until SocGen completes a € 5.5 bn capital raising to cover losses incurred when it unwound Kerviel 's positions last week and an extra € 2.05 bn hit on its exposure to the US sub - prime crisis .
Daniel Bouton , SocGen 's chairman , has offered to resign .
Sarkozy and his ministers have made plain that he will have to go in any " rescue " and he could leave at a board meeting today .
Directors are to discuss a report on the Kerviel scandal completed by external auditors yesterday .
" In a difficult moment , the board members are there to decide if the person in charge is the best placed to run the ship when it is pitching a bit , or whether they should change the captain , " said Christine Lagarde , the finance minister .
It is widely thought that Philippe Citerne , co-chief executive , and Jean - Pierre Mustier , investment banking head , are so implicated by the evident lack of controls on traders such as Kerviel that neither could succeed Bouton .
An outsider from within France 's politico - commercial elite is viewed as the obvious solution .
Lagarde has summoned Christian Noyer , governor of the Bank of France , and Michel Prada , chairman of the AMF , the French financial markets authority , for an update on their investigations into how the SocGen scandal erupted .
Noyer , who chairs the banking commission , the main regulator , and Prada will be questioned by the French senate 's financial committee this morning and are due to present their report to Lagarde on Monday .
Fillon said he would immediately publish its findings in full .
Separately , the AMF said it had begun a formal inquiry into allegations of insider trading at SocGen before the bank disclosed its losses last Thursday .
Both Adam , the minority shareholders ' lobby , and lawyers acting for 100 small investors had called for investigations into share dealings by Robert Day , an American director on the SocGen board , which amounted to almost € 100 m on January 9 and 10 .
The bank reiterated that neither Day nor any other person had knowledge of the losses when they sold their shares .
Kerviel 's defence
Jérôme Kerviel , the 31 - year - old rogue trader , has accused his superiors at SocGen of deliberately " turning a blind eye " to his mammoth operations in equity derivatives trading and of being part of a culture of fear .
Transcripts of his interrogation , carried out last weekend by the " brigade financière " and published last night by Le Monde and MediaPart on their websites , are a fresh blow to SocGen as Kerviel claims he was allowed to proceed as long as he made money .
The alleged loner , labelled a " fraudulent genius " and " demon hacker " by the bank 's executives , was released on bail late on Monday after being charged with the lesser offences of breach of trust and forgery - and appeared to have gone to ground yesterday .
" I can't believe that my superiors were unaware of the amounts I was committing , it 's impossible to generate such profits with small positions , " he told the police after giving himself up on Saturday .
He claimed to have made a " profit " of € 1.4bn ( £ 1 bn ) by the end of 2007 but to have taken steps to conceal this and instead declare one of € 55 m in the hope of winning a € 600,000 bonus .
" As long as we are winning and that 's not too obvious , that it fits in , one says nothing , " he added .
Kerviel , who insisted his techniques of concealment were " not at all sophisticated " and should have been picked up by correct controls , sums up the bank 's culture as " Not seen , not taken .
If taken , you 're hanged . "
SocGen said it had improved its controls after being alerted to a " fishy " trade by Eurex , the derivatives market , in November 2007 and caught Kerviel out this month .
The FBI is denying the existence of a file that details a program whereby US officials stole nuclear weapons secrets for eventual sale to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia — but there 's plenty of evidence for the file 's existence :
Edmonds , a 37 - year - old former Turkish language translator , listened into hundreds of sensitive intercepted conversations while based at the agency 's Washington field office .
She says the FBI was investigating a Turkish and Israeli - run network that paid high - ranking American officials to steal nuclear weapons secrets .
These were then sold on the international black market to countries such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
One of the documents relating to the case was marked 203A - WF - 210023 .
Last week , however , the FBI responded to a freedom of information request for a file of exactly the same number by claiming that it did not exist .
But The Sunday Times has obtained a document signed by an FBI official showing the existence of the file .
Edmonds believes the crucial file is being deliberately covered up by the FBI because its contents are explosive .
She accuses the agency of an " outright lie " .
But now the trend of opening coffee shops inside bookstores has fallen foul of the authorities amid a general clampdown on social and intellectual freedoms .
Four bookshops in Tehran this week closed their coffee shops after receiving a 72 - hour ultimatum from Amaken-e Omoomi , a state body governing the retail trade .
The order has led to the closure of the cafe in one of the city 's best - known bookshops , Nashr-e Sales , which has hosted reading sessions by writers , including the Nobel prize - winning Turkish author , Orhan Pamuk , and become a popular meeting point for literary types .
Amaken justified the closures by declaring that the coffee shops constituted an illegal " mixing of trades " .
However , critics suspect the move is aimed at restricting the gathering of intellectuals and educated young people .
The reformist newspaper , Etemad-e Melli , pointed out that Ahl-e Ghalam , a bookstore linked to the culture and Islamic guidance ministry , had been allowed to keep its cafe .
" When we pointed this out to the authorities , their argument was that just because other people make a mistake does n't mean you have to repeat it , " one bookshop owner told the Guardian .
" We are trying through our trade association to find a remedy . "
The closure order comes amid an offensive against liberal trends by the Islamist government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which has included the banning of western books .

Is a real or fake tree better for the environment ?
You may be surprised .
Dec. 9 , 2007  --
Is that smell of fresh pine really worth a floor full of needles ?
It 's an age old dilemma , but nowadays phony firs are in fashion .
Last year , 9.3 million artificial trees were sold in the United States .
That 's an increase of two million from just five years ago , according to the National Christmas Tree Association .
Some consumers have been buying the artificial alternative because they want to be " green . "
Despite their good intentions , real trees , particularly when recycled , are typically better for the environment .
Many artificial trees contain the toxic chemical PVC and it's worth checking twice what the tree is made of before bringing it home .
Here are some of the pros and cons to consider when you 're picking out a tree this season .
Plastic Pros
Dried - up trees cause almost 200 house fires every year , while artificial trees can be fire - resistant and allergen - free .
Artificial trees can be re-used or donated , even if they 're not biodegradable .
Fake trees do n't need maintenance , like constant watering when the dog keeps drinking up its water bowl .
Re-using a tree year after year can save money over buying a new one each season .
Natural Benefits
You just can't match the smell of freshly - cut pine .
Christmas tree farming provides an important carbon offset for the environment .
More than 45 million trees were planted on farms in North America last year that will help absorb CO2 in the atmosphere .
Recycling a tree into compost can provide valuable fertilizer , mulch and erosion defense .
It 's a Christmas classic .
Even if those needles drive you crazy , it 's all part of the holiday ritual .

Pune , Dec. 19
The much - awaited Rs 1 - lakh car from Tata Motors will be launched in manual and automatic ( continuous variable transmission ) versions , and will also be manufactured at its Uttarakhand facility , where a separate assembly line is being installed , in addition to the plant at Singur .
According to industry sources , work on the new small car assembly line at Tata Motors ’
Ace plant at Uttarakhand , which involves a financial outlay of Rs 400 crore , commenced a couple of months ago .
The line will have an installed capacity to manufacture 60,000 cars annually , and is expected to be ready for trial production by early April .
The plan to manufacture the car at Tata Motors ’
Uttarakhand plant seems logical as it has around 20 per cent of the components in common with the Ace , that is already being manufactured there .
The remaining components will be sourced from Pune , sources say , adding that the initial plan is to produce 30,000 cars .
Responding to queries on the continuous variable transmission ( CVT ) version of the small car , a Tata Motors spokesperson said , “ We will not share any information on our People ’s Car ’s features ” .
The spokesperson also declined to comment on whether it would also be manufactured at Uttarakhand , stating that the company was setting up the first plant for the car at Singur and that it expects “ to commence production by the middle of the next financial year ” .
However , those close to its development here reveal that it has a rear engine , weighs around 600 kg and is powered by a 32 - HP engine .
The cars will be Euro 3 compliant , and a version that will meet Euro 4 norms is also on the cards subsequently , they added .
Both manual and CVT versions are to be unveiled at the forthcoming auto expo in New Delhi , in January .
Ruby のMatzさん がBruce Eckelのエントリを紹介している。この2:8の法則を掛け合わせるという論法は他にもいろいろ使えそうな感じ。例えば、8割のプロジェクトは失敗と見なされており、成功した残り2割のプロジェクトを牽引したのはそのうちの2割なのだ、とか。8割の開発者は結果を出し得るプロジェクトに携われておらず、結果を出し得るプロジェクトに携わっている開発者のうち8割は実際の成果を上げられていないとか。
それらの比喩が実際どうかは別として、一握りの成功は極端な能力の違いではなく小さな確率の掛け合わせで簡単に生じるにも関わらず、周囲の人々は結果そのものを大きな能力の違いと勘違いしてしまいがちであることを的確に風刺している。
ところで日本のソフトウェア産業が飛躍できないのは天才を大切にしないからだという説がある。20倍の生産性を持つ人々を発掘して活躍させれば、シリコンバレーのように新しい技術ベンチャーが次々と新事業を開拓するのではないかと期待したのである。未踏ソフトウェア創造事業は、そういうスーパーハッカーをプロジェクトマネージャが発掘し、スーパーハッカーの目利きとしてプロジェクトマネージャもベンチャーキャピタリストから発掘される、という筋書きでつくられた。決まりきった大企業にカネを撒くよりもずっと創造的な事業だったが、ハッカー・コミュニティらしきものを日本に創ったものの、彼らがシリコンバレーのように産業を興すには至らず、最近はGoogleに転職したり、シリコンバレーで起業している。
飲んだり一緒に仕事する機会もあるから、彼らがとても優秀なハッカーであることは知っている。未踏で採択されるにはプログラミング能力だけでなくプレゼンテーション能力にも長けていなければならないし、1年以内で成果を出すには高いプロジェクト管理能力も求められる。そういう意味で優秀な開発者の中で特に成功に近いところにいる人々だし、実際ビジネス的な成功を収めている連中も少なからずいるけれども、彼らの立ち上げた企業がソフトバンクや楽天のように大きな雇用を生んだとは寡聞にして知らない。
それが何故かとずっと考えるんだけれども、結局のところ米国で天才プログラマーが頻出するのは、もちろん世界中から優秀で野心的な連中を集めていることも大きいけれども、それ以上に産業構造そのものが常に天才を必要としているのではないかという風に考え直した。天才がいっぱいいるんじゃなくって、産業を回すために多くの人が常に天才をつくろうとしているから、たくさんのシンデレラボーイが生まれてくる。産業を回すためにというのは、日本がど田舎に立派な箱物をいっぱいつくったり、年末いつも道路工事しているのと同じように、毎年のように華々しく天才をデビューさせていくべく、利害関係者が予定調和的に働きかけている訳だ。
田舎にできた立派な道路が本当に必要か分からないように、シンデレラボーイたちが本当に天才かは二の次なのである。けれども本当の天才もそういったインフラを利用できる機会が充分にあることは、きっと新しい産業を生む上で重要なのだ。バブルとか過大評価は、そういった循環を維持するための必要経費なのだろう。かつて日本の公共事業が「落ちぶれても工事現場で働けば食える」というカタチで労働へのエンカレッジと社会福祉とを両立したように。いっけん無駄で馬鹿げたことににみえても社会の辻褄を合わせるために必要だったりする訳だ。
振り返って日本は、ベンチャーが活躍して競争のルールを塗り替えることは、基本的に番狂わせだから、まず叩く。孫さんとか、三木谷さんのようなタイプの経営者が生き残るのって、結局のところ叩かれても叩かれても挫けずに事業を遂行し、従業員を引っ張っていく持続力が求められるからではないか。プロ野球騒動の時に梅田望夫さんが楽天やライブドアを評して「生活密着型サービス産業」たるダイエーの末裔と指摘したけれども、この国で新参者に優しいのは産業界ではなく消費者なのだ。何故ってたぶん、消費者は企業と違って従業員を抱えていないから。事業者にしてみれば、できることなら競争のルールなんて変えてくれるな。環境が激変した時のリスクヘッジで 変人 天才も飼い殺しにしておくか。天才だからったって社内で波風を立てないでくれよ、みたいな。
出る杭は打つというか、同調圧力というか、日本社会ではもともと強いんだけれども、こと学生については昔よりだいぶ恵まれているように感じる。例えば未踏の採択者って結構な割合でAO入試を使って大学に入ってるんだけど、コンピュータに強ければ一流大学で楽しい仲間に囲まれて高度な講義を受けられるって正直かなり羨ましい。僕なんかSFCをAO入試で受けようとしたら大検の点数で足切りを食らっちゃったもんね。僕が受け損ねて数年後からSFCのAO入試では足切りがなくなったらしい。やっぱ成績で足切りすると、 僕のように 面白い奴を採り損ねちゃうかな、とか閑話休題。
ともかく最近の子たちは物心ついた頃からネット上でゴロゴロ教材が転がっていて、オープンソースで世界最高水準のソースコードにアクセスできて、一芸に秀でていれば受け入れてくれる一流大学も結構あって、実に羨ましい。羨ましいんだけど、就職活動の話なんか聞いてると結構コンサバで、こっちが驚いてしまう。コンサルっぽい皮を被ったSIをやってる会社とか、結構人気みたいだし。Blogger諸氏が嘆いている割に大手SIerも就職ランキングで上位に来ているよね、とか学生に聞いてみると、あれは調べ方が悪いという。ともかく希望する会社を筆記で書かせる訳だが、思いつくのって有名な会社ばかりになっちゃうし、みたいな。
どっちにしても彼らって恵まれている割に夢がないようにみえるんだけど、僕らナナロク世代のことを「彼らの時代は未開拓のチャンスがあったけど、僕らは整地された後に運び込まれた兵隊だよね」という風にみているのかも知れない。けど、90年代後半はあの時代で閉塞感があったんだよ。山一證券とか長銀とかバタバタ潰れて、新興市場はまだなくて、信用収縮で商売うまくいってる会社でさえ金策に奔走していたり。Webビジネスなんてものになるのか、いつまで続くのか見えなかったしね。
未踏コミュニティの連中は流石に業界耳年増になっているから、あまり大企業志向を感じない。Google幻想とかは結構あるようだけど。ただ彼らが工房のような身軽なベンチャーを立ち上げるのも、結局のところこれまでのような生活を続けたいっていう保守性からきているのではないか、と感じることもある。会社を大きくすると、自分のやりたいことできなくなっちゃうよね、僕が豊かに暮らしていく分には効率的な働き方だってあるからね、と。だいたい産業界の方が活躍の場を用意しないんだから、せっかく税金を突っ込んで育てた連中が小さくまとまっていても、Googleに転職しても、シンデレラボーイを夢見てシリコンバレーに渡っても、文句をつける筋合いじゃない。
と嘆けるくらいに、5%でいいから20倍も儲かっている会社が出てくると、この業界にも夢が出てくるんじゃないかな。今は受託モデルでやっていると、人だけ採って事業リスクを取らず研究開発にも投資できないし、事業リスクを取り人を採っているサービス企業は、そうそう中長期の研究開発に投資できない。かといって中長期の研究開発に取り組む技術ベンチャーは少数精鋭で大企業と組んだり政府の補助金にぶら下がって事業リスクを抑えていたり。あちらが立てばこちらが立たず。
90年代末からのベンチャー育成とか、ハッカー発掘といった取り組みは一定の成果を収めた一方で、日本がどう米国を簡単には真似られないかを浮き彫りにした。最近は京速コンピュータとか、時代は再び大企業による大規模プロジェクトに揺り戻しつつあるようにもみえるが、日本の産業構造をもっとベンチャーに優しくしていくのか、或いは日本の産業構造に合わせた技術革新への適応の仕方、世界市場での立ち位置があるのか、真面目に考えるべき時期にきているのではないか。
blogの賑やかしにそういう大上段の話をしつつ、僕らは僕らでグローバルに考えてローカルに行動するとか、ナショナリストとして国内問題に取り組みつつコスモポリタンとしてのコンピテンシーを磨くとか、そういった自助努力を通じて、業界を嗤うんじゃなくて業界で笑えるようでありたい。できれば日本に根を下ろしたまま世界に目を向けて。

Date Fri , 18 Jan 2008 09:36:38 - 0800 From Arjan van de Ven <> Subject [ Announce ]
Development release 0.1 of the LatencyTOP tool The Intel Open Source Technology Center is pleased to announce the
release of version 0.1 of LatencyTOP , a tool for developers to visualize
system latencies .
http://www.latencytop.org
Slow servers , Skipping audio , Jerky video -- everyone knows the symptoms
of latency .
But to know what 's really going on in the system , what 's causing
the latency , and how to fix it ... those are difficult questions without
good answers right now .
LatencyTOP is a Linux tool for software developers ( both kernel and
userspace ) , aimed at identifying where system latency occurs , and what
kind of operation / action is causing the latency to happen .
By identifying
this , developers can then change the code to avoid the worst latency
hiccups .
There are many types and causes of latency , and LatencyTOP focus on type
that causes audio skipping and desktop stutters .
Specifically , LatencyTOP
focuses on the cases where the applications want to run and execute useful
code , but there 's some resource that 's not currently available ( and the
kernel then blocks the process ) .
This is done both on a system level and
on a per process level , so that you can see what 's happening to the system ,
and which process is suffering and / or causing the delays .
Rather than spending a thousand words on describing what LatencyTOP is ,
I 'll let the numbers speak ..
Here 's some output of LatencyTOP , collected for a make - j4 of a kernel
on a quad core system :
Cause Maximum Average
process fork 1097.7 msec 2.5 msec
Reading from file 1097.0 msec 0.1 msec
updating atime 850.4 msec 60.1 msec
Locking buffer head 433.1 msec 94.3 msec
Writing to file 381.8 msec 0.6 msec
Synchronous bufferhead read 318.5 msec 16.3 msec
Waiting for buffer IO 298.8 msec 7.8 msec
This shows that during the kernel build , one fork ( ) system call had
a > 1 second latency , as did a read from a file .
Updating the atime
of a file ( in memory ! ) had 850 milliseconds , etc etc .
With a small change to the EXT3 journaling layer to fix a priority
inversion problem that was found with LatencyTOP the following results
for the exact same test were achieved [*]
( http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2007/10/15/343499 )
Cause Maximum Average
Writing to file 814.9 msec 0.8 msec
Reading from file 441.1 msec 0.1 msec
Waiting for buffer IO 419.0 msec 3.4 msec
Locking buffer head 360.5 msec 75.7 msec
Unlinking file 292.7 msec 5.9 msec
EXT3 ( jbd ) do_get_write_access 274.0 msec 36.0 msec
Filename lookup 260.0 msec 0.5 msec
As you can see from the results , the maximum observed latency is down
from 1097 to 814 msec , and the other top latencies are down as well
( although some have shifted around some , such as writing to a file ) .
Kernel patches
--------------
LatencyTOP requires some kernel patches to work .
These patches are
available from the website for review and I will be posting them as
reply to this announce email as well .
The patches are n't quite ready for mainline inclusion yet
( assuming they are n't hated universally in the first place ) .
For example ,
the locking is still rather coarse grained .
However , it will be easy
to split the lock in a reasonable way .
I 'd rather incorporate all other
feedback first before doing more fancy locking though .
Annotations
-----------
The kernel patch is needed in part to allow the kernel to annotate certain
operations for tracking of latency .
The idea for an annotation is that the
kernel keeps track of what high level operation it is doing , which is
subsequently used from the low level scheduler code to account the actual
observed latency to .
The good news is that the number of annotations needed
is limited ; for one , all low level functions that sleep directly do n't need
annotation ( this gets dealt with automatically ) , and there 's only a finite
number of higher level operations that are relevant .
The most basic annotation looks like this ( in the patches more complex
versions can be seen ) :
asmlinkage long sys_sync( void )
{
+ struct latency_entry reason ;
+ set_latency_reason (" sync system call " , &reason ) ;
do_sync( 1 ) ;
+ restore_latency_reason( &reason ) ;
+
return 0 ;
}
This annotation tells the kernel that for anything that sleeps in the
entire do_sync ( ) codepath , the latency introduced by that should be
accounted as " sync system call " .
The nesting of this annotation is
very simple : latency gets accounted to highest level annotated ; so
even if there 's another annotation inside the do_sync codepath
somewhere , the blocking latency that happens in this codepath counts
towards the sync function call .
At this point , I would like to invite comments and reviews of the
concept and the code to see if people consider this tool useful ,
what they would like the tool to do in addition to its current
functionality , and what kind of code improvements people would like
to see .
I also fully realize that not everyone will like the way the
annotations are done and I 'm open to better ways of achieving the same
goals .
Known TODO list :
* More finegrained reporting of scheduler based ( CFS ) statistics
* Improve locking granularity
[ *]
I 'm not trying to get this patch merged , Jens Axboe had many
valid comments about it and it needs to be redone for mainline
inclusion .
The patch and it's effect are for illustration
purposes only .
Did you know that High Eye Pressure may lead to Glaucoma and even Blindness ?
BiCOM Inc. , with its new Tonometer Diaton now allows to painlessly test eye pressure through the Eyelid without contact with the cornea , use of anesthesia , or risk of infection .
BiCOM Inc. , as well as the American Academy of Ophthalmology ( AAO ) with 27,000 members worldwide http://www.aao.org and American Optometric Association ( AOA ) representing 34,000 members
http://www.aoa.org urge you to get your eyes checked regularly .
According to the National Eye Institute ( NEI ) , risk factors for glaucoma include age 40 + , race , steroid use , past eye injuries , as well as a history of diabetes , cardiovascular disorders , migraine headaches and nearsightedness .
" Glaucoma is treatable if detected early .
What better month than January , Glaucoma Awareness Month , to visit your eye doctor , ask them about Tonometry , and get your eyes fully checked . "
Diaton tonometer , through the eyelid Tonometry Exam , can be found and performed in 1000's of locations worldwide such as Hospitals , Emergency Rooms , Nursing & Elderly Homes .
It has been noted that even General & Specialty Practitioners are joining Ophthalmologists and Optometrists in the Fight with Glaucoma .
Tonometry is the name of the procedure to test Eye pressure or IOP and can be done by most Ophthalmologists and Optometrists .
" With the introduction of our unique Tonometer Diaton - tonometry through the Eyelid , we 're proud to challenge Glaucoma , a ' silent thief of sight ' , that carries an ever increasing threat of causing blindness as the aging population is growing in the U.S. and abroad , " said Roman Iospa , CEO of BiCOM Inc .
By 2020 , 43 million Americans will suffer significant vision loss or even blindness , the Academy predicts .
Aside from protecting the eyes from accidents , early detection and treatment of vision - threatening problems is the Key to protecting one 's sight and quality of life for later years .

A Few Humble Suggestions to Get Out of this Recession
Let 's face the harsh truth .
The United States of America is probably in a recession maybe even a depression .
To get out of this recession , we must first understand why the United States is in a recession .
So in no particular order , here are the 8 main reasons why the United States ' economy is faltering :
War : The United States is spending an estimated 2 billion dollars a day on the Iraqi war .
Manufacturing : Most of the factories and manufacturing jobs have already left the country and more jobs are following .
Off - shoring / Outsourcing : Even high paying jobs , such as engineering , medical , architecture , insurance , and technical support , are moving overseas at an alarming rate .
This rate is much higher than the creation rate of new high paying jobs .
Housing Credit : Most of the home loan banks are in financial trouble and are less willing to issue new mortgages and loans until their financial situation improves drastically .
Personal Debt : A lot of people in the United States have purchased more than they can afford .
Their credit cards are maxed out , and they are only able to pay the minimum each month .
Furthermore , a huge number of people are no longer able to pay their mortgage either and could lose their homes .
Consumer Confidence : Even those people who can afford to purchase goods are less willing because consumer confidence in the economy is low .
People also have low confidence in their jobs , so they are spending less .
Energy : Each year , trillions of dollars are sent to other nations , sometimes even to our enemies , for our oil requirements .
National Debt : The United States owes other countries a lot of money to support the war and our standard of living .
With a huge trade deficit , our already enormous national debt is increasing also at an alarming rate .
Luckily , the government of the United States has realized that the economy is in serious trouble and is pushing for two economic stimulus packages .
First , the Federal Reserve is lowering interest rates quickly .
The theory is that with interest rates lower , companies will be more willing to borrow money to grow their businesses and thus stimulating the economy .
Even the Federal Reserve agrees this has limited effects on the economy , since companies have low confidence and are less willing to borrow money or grow their businesses .
On the other hand , this may actually help alleviate some mortgage holders by lowering their adjustable rate mortgages , thus maybe helping both the housing credit and personal debt issues .
As you can plainly see , lowering interest rates will not directly resolve any of the root problems with the economy .
At most , this plan will only temporarily stimulate the economy , since it does not have a long term solution to fix any of the problems mentioned above .
The second stimulus package is that President Bush is trying to push a $ 600 tax rebate ( $ 1200 for couples ) .
The theory is that if taxpayers have more cash in their pockets , then the consumer confidence would increase .
Unfortunately , these types of stimulus packages have had little effect on the economy in the past .
I predict that most taxpayers would use their tax rebates to help pay off their personal debts , loans , and mortgages .
Other taxpayers will try to save this money as an emergency fund for the recession .
And the consumers that do spend this money will not contribute enough to significantly increase the consumer confidence level of the entire nation .
As a result , I predict that this stimulus package will have limited impact , since it does not attempt to resolve the root causes of any of the economy 's problems .
To best solve the economic problems of the United States , each of the above 8 reasons needs to be addressed .
This does not mean that each problem needs to be fixed ; but rather , the best action plan is to try to fix as much as possible .
So , here are my humble suggestions to pull the United States of America out of this recession .
But first , a brief history lesson is necessary .
The Great Depression of the 1930s basically ended because of World War 2 .
To support the war , a huge number of manufacturing industries increased production and were created .
As a result , tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs were created .
This eventually stimulated the economy successfully and even improved consumer confidence too .
This also fixed the personal and housing debt issues of the time .
Therefore , it can be concluded that creating more jobs was instrumental in pulling the nation out of a depression .
And it will be necessary again .
Unfortunately , it no longer makes sense to create traditional manufacturing or high tech jobs in the United States any more , because these jobs would quickly relocate to other nations where labor is cheaper .
And since only jobs that stay in the country have long lasting effects , it is best to create jobs that can not be outsourced or off - shored .
My first suggestion is construction on a massive scale .
Imagine replacing every single power plant in the country with a brand new renewable power plant and building additional renewable power plants to offset all of our energy needs that we import into the country .
First , this would create a huge number of high paying construction jobs in the country for a very long time .
Second , this would solve the problem of all the money leaving the country when we purchase oil from other countries .
Third , this would make the United States self sufficient in terms of energy , thus more secure financially and militarily .
Forth , it is now believed to be cost effective to implement renewable energy sources in the long term , since some alternative fuels are now cheaper than oil .
Fifth , this would be environmentally friendly ; since solar , hydro , and wind power plants would create significantly less pollution .
Even new nuclear power plants could be created , if long term storage of radioactive waste can be decided upon .
Sixth , once constructed , this would increase the number of permanent high paying maintenance jobs to support these power plants .
Finally , maybe we could eventually even export energy to narrow the trade deficit and maybe even decrease the national debt .
My second suggestion for stimulating the economy is to increase research and development ( R&D ) .
In the next 10 years , the four technological fields that are predicted to have major breakthroughs are biotech , robotics , nanotech , and alternative fuels ( my personal favorite is fusion power ) .
Hopefully each of these technologies will eventually spin off a multitude of industries that will benefit all of mankind and not just by creating thousands of jobs .
Therefore , I recommend accelerating these advancements by significantly increasing grants and funding to local researchers and scientists in these fields .
I am fully aware that most of the jobs created from these future industries will mostly be in other nations , but the huge potential economic benefits would still be enormous locally .
Again , this should help the decrease the national debt and trade deficit with a large number of successful startup businesses in the United States .
My third suggestion is actually an idea from a friend of mine .
Currently , several parts of the United States are suffering from droughts for several years .
Climate changes , increases in population , and bad luck have drastically and dangerously lowered our fresh water supplies with no sign of relief in the near future .
Therefore , we need to construct several water desalination plants to offset this problem .
Again , this construction and maintenance will create more high paying local jobs too .
If you have been keeping track , the only problem with the economy that my suggestions have not addressed is the Iraqi war .
The simplest solution is to immediately end the war or at least end it as soon as possible .
First , there are no clear long term goals for the war .
It is widely believed that once the Iraqi government and military is self sufficient , the American military would leave .
At that time , whatever terrorists or freedom fighters that remain in Iraq will be taken care of by the Iraqi people .
For a multitude of reasons , the Iraqi government and military have not been successful in taking over their country .
I believe they would be much more successful if they did not have the U.S. military as a crutch that they can support on .
As a result , I believe that ending the war immediately will help both Iraq and the economy of the United States .
In conclusion , I believe getting the United States of America out of this recession is extremely important .
Whatever solutions our government takes to resolve our economic problems , these problems need to be addressed immediately .
I can only hope that my suggestions will help spur changes in the positive direction .
Please remember that the entire world needs the United States to pull itself out of recession to pull the world out of their recession too .

Texan kills burglars next door , citing ' castle doctrine ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 16 , 2007

This A so - called " castle doctrine " law recently passed in Texas allows people to use deadly force to protect their homes and property .
However , a case in which a Houston - area man in his 70's killed two apparent burglars he observed breaking into his neighbor 's house has raised new questions about how far that doctrine might extend .
The man called an emergency dispatcher when he first saw the alleged burglars , saying " I 've got a shotgun , do you want me to stop them ? "
" Nope , do n't do that , " replied the dispatcher .
" Ain't no property worth shooting somebody over , ok ? ... I 've got officers coming out there .
I do n't want you to go outside that house . "
" I understand that , " the caller replied , " but I have a right to protect myself too , sir , and you understand that .
And the laws have been changed in this country since September the 1st , and you know it and I know it . "
After five minutes , the dispatcher was no longer able to restrain the caller , who stepped outside and shot both men , reporting , " Here it goes , buddy .
You hear the shotgun clicking and I 'm going .
...
Boom , you 're dead .
... I had no choice . "
A grand jury will decide whether the man can be charged with a crime .
He will probably be found to have acted legally if it is determined that the neighbor whose house was broken into had asked him to protect his property , but not otherwise .
The Texas state senator who wrote the law said it was not meant to apply to anyone 's property but your own and " is not designed to have kind of a ' Law West of the Pecos ' mentality or action . "
Similar laws are on the books in other states and have already given rise to a number of controversial incidents .
The following video is from CBS 's Early Show , broadcast on November 15 , 2007 .
( CNN ) --
A study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that 151,000 Iraqis died of violent causes between March 2003 , when the war began , and June 2006 .
An Iraqi mourner carries the coffin of a relative killed by a car bomb in Baghdad .
This is much lower than a national survey published in the Lancet journal that put the number during the same period at more than 600,000 , but higher than the figures compiled from media reports by the Iraq Body Count , which registered more than 47,000 deaths , the study said .
" Although the estimated range is substantially lower than a recent survey - based estimate , it nonetheless points to a massive death toll , only one of many health and human consequences of an ongoing humanitarian crisis , " the study said , referring to the large numbers in the Lancet report .
The World Health Organization provided technical assistance for the journal survey , and interviewers were employees of Iraq 's Health Ministry .
The study was paid for by the U.N. Development Group Iraq Trust Fund , the WHO and the European Commission .
The study , which also included a mental health survey , cost $ 1.6 million .
The estimate , part of a larger survey of family health in the war - torn country , was gleaned from interviews conducted in 9,345 households in nearly 1,000 neighborhoods and villages .
" Assessment of the death toll in conflict situations is extremely difficult and household survey results have to be interpreted with caution , " said study co-author Mohamed Ali , a WHO statistician quoted in a WHO news release about the study .
" However , in the absence of comprehensive death registration and hospital reporting , household surveys are the best we can do . "
Violence became a " leading cause of death for Iraqi adults and was the main cause of death in men between the ages of 15 and 59 years during the first three years after the 2003 invasion , " the study said .
The study indicated that " on average , 128 Iraqis per day died of violent causes in the first year following the invasion " and that the daily average violent death toll was 115 in the second year and 126 in the third year .
More than half of the violent deaths occurred in Baghdad .
Before the war started , from January 2002 to March 2003 , about a half - dozen violent deaths were reported daily , the study said .
WHO makes reference to the Lancet study conducted by Johns Hopkins University and Baghdad 's University and published in October 2006 .
The organization said that involved 1,849 households in 47 clusters , a lower number of samples than the new study .
It also refers to the Iraq Body Count , saying it " is likely to underestimate violent deaths " because a substantial number " do n't show up in the media being monitored .
At the same time , it says " trends seen in the Iraq Body Count figures are consistent with those observed in our survey . "
In the WHO / Iraqi Health Ministry study , violent deaths are considered " intentional " or attributable to " armed conflict . "
Suicides , road accident deaths and unintentional deaths are not included .
The authors of the latest study indicate that there probably is underreporting in the study because of population movement , inherent errors posed by dealing with samples , and inability to visit some households because of security problems .

Let ’s imagine we live in a late binding world , a programming world of messages , what should that look like ?
What does it look like in the large ?
The Smalltalk notion of this is many , many independent referencable objects .
Objects all the way down .
So you might get something like buddies do : [ buddy | buddy sendMessage : myMessage ] .
At runtime this means something like :
Send the buddies object ( some reference we obtained elsewhere ) the do : message , with the argument [ buddy | buddy sendMessage : myMessage ] .
Except remember that that [...] is a block ( aka closure ) , and it ’s also an object .
Which only makes sense , because buddies does n’t know what my Message means .
So all buddies knows is that it gets an argument .

Except remember that that is a block ( aka closure ) , and it ’s also an object .
Which only makes sense , because does n’t know what means .
So all knows is that it gets an argument .
The buddies object receives this do : message , with an argument we ’ll call block ( that [...] stuff ) .
By convention do : is sent to sequence - like things , and calls its argument multiple times .
So buddies figures out some items — maybe it ’s a concrete sequence ( like an Array ) or maybe it looks it up in a database , or does a call over the net , or whatever .

So buddies figures out some items — maybe it ’s a concrete sequence ( like an ) or maybe it looks it up in a database , or does a call over the net , or whatever .

That is , it sends a message back to the object , with the argument .

message .
The block would n’t have to be that syntactic construct , it just usually is .
So it receives that value , and locally binds the variable to the argument and evaluates the inside of that block .
Our expression then sends the sendMessage : message to that buddy object , with another object as the argument .
That argument might be a string , but it also might be markup , or a richer object that itself does all sorts of magical things .
Maybe the buddy object sends the object over the net to your remote buddy , then the remote buddy calls message displayOn : myScreen , and the message object reponds to displayOn : by sending screen showText : someString withColor : #blue .
This can go on for a while .
As you can see , there can be a lot of tracing through code in this style .
This has been called Ravioli code .
Many people lean heavily on concepts like classes and methods to make sense of this kind of code , though if you look through my description you ’ll notice they do n’t show up ; it is apparently somewhat frustrating for Alan Kay that he first used the term “ object - oriented ” when he would have preferred this message - oriented concept .
Classes and methods are just implementation details .
Messages and object references are the true fundamental concept .
Doing this in the large means that a lot of these messages go over the network .
It means we can get a handle to an object that lives on another computer .
It might result in a system that is very chatty ( many systems with transparent RPC do end up being unintentionally chatty ) .
But it does n’t have to .
You can make this asynchronous to facilitate these kinds of efficiencies .
That said , there is another distinct technique for programming in the large : document oriented programming .
This is what REST is focused on : transmitting state in as complete a form as feasible , with explicit references whenever referring to another resource .
Resources and objects are in many ways similar , but in other ways completely opposite .
An object has behavior but no visible state .
It responds to messages , passing more objects along .
Resources themselves have no behavior .
They are just bare state .
REST and the web kind of adds behavior , but strict REST avoids even that .
PUT is not behavior .
PUT is almost like a declaration of fact .
When you PUT to a resource you are claiming that the new state of the resource represents the truth of that resource .
Any behavior that occurs because of that is hidden .
Other resources may change as a result of the PUT , but this is not exposed in any way .
To find out what ’s changed you simply have to refresh all the state you ’ve acquired — re-GET the resources .
( POST , except when used simply to create a resource , is more like a verb than a statement of truth ; the HTTP model is not pure in this respect . )
For programming on a web scale resources have become the dominant technique .
REST was really an acknowledgement of this idea , not the invention of it .
It ’s also an advocacy effort that our future work should be built on this past success .
It ’s been focused very clearly on advocating resources over the object / message - based systems of WS -* , but the WS -* design is hardly the first or only object based system of its kind ; anything called “ RPC ” comes from that line of thinking .
But now that WS -* is n’t king of the hill anymore maybe we can more be more thoughtful about how REST relates to other programming techniques .
A way to describe the difference in terms of programming language design is that with resources everything we do is call by value .
Resources are values , and we pass them around in their complete form .
You can pass around a reference value ( a URI ) , but this is like calling a function with a pointer argument .
Object / RPC techniques are call by reference ( though at some level there are true “ values ” , things like integers and strings , as things would simply be too chatty otherwise ) .
One interesting place where objects and resources can overlap is in functional programming .
Thinking in terms of call by value or call by reference , in a functional programming language these are identical .
Because values are not mutable a value and a copy of the value are equivalent .
You can also pass an object between systems by reference , in whole , or some lazy compromise where the object is only incrementally communicated between the processes .
Resources are in a sense immutable regardless of your programming language .
When you retrieve a resource you cannot modify it in place , as the result is no longer representative of what the resource really is .
You can put a new resource in a named location ( PUT ) , and you can copy resources ( maybe making an internal copy ) .
Incidentally this is why I think literal document models are best .
It would probably be useful to have a native representation of what a “ resource ” really is in programming languages , though usually this is not done .
A resource should really be a document ( content type , some bytes , perhaps a cache of parsed representations ) plus the name ( URI ) and the time .
Resources are n’t eternal , but given a time and URI there is ( in a REST world ) a single canonical representation .
Further investigations of functional programming languages would probably be useful here .
I believe strict functional languages have interesting metaphors for handling this kind of information ; the eternal immutable sense of what a thing is at a point in time , and a way to reconcile the incomplete knowledge of what a resource is right now .
I do n’t think this is a clear pattern in Erlang , but is in Haskell .
One useful aspect of resources is the ability to spy on the process , to get a snapshot of it , to understand it in a kind of literal way .
This is view source in a browser , or just poking around with curl .
You can feel a certain confidence that you can get a real sense of what the truth is using these tools .
In an object - based system you can only poke around with a process of 20 questions , hoping that there is n’t some hidden truth that you are unaware of .
For instance , talking to a proxy that is almost exactly like the original object , but with some small replacement .
Of course internally a server can be peculiarly coupled as well , with relationships between the resources that are n’t explicit or obvious .
But at least the faces it projects are fully formed .
I still have n’t fully figured out what distinguishes a document model from an object model , but I think the distinction between the two contains some interesting stuff worth exploring .
What Do Declining Abortion Rates Mean for Crime in the Future ?
The abortion rate in the United States is at a thirty year low — though even with the decline , we are still talking about a large number of abortions in absolute terms , or 1.2 million per year .
To put this number into perspective , there are about 4 million births per year in the U.S .
John Donohue and I have argued that the legalization of abortion in the 1970s reduced crime in the 1990s .
The logic is simple : unwanted children have an increased risk of growing up to be criminals , and legalized abortion reduces the number of unwanted children .
Consequently , legalized abortion lowers crime in the future .
So what does the steady decline in abortions performed in recent years predict for future crime patterns ?
The answer is not obvious , because it depends on why abortion rates are falling , and I ’m not sure we know the answer to that question .
If abortion rates are falling because it has become harder or more costly to get an abortion , then a falling abortion rate is bad news for crime .
As the “ price ” ( whether in monetary terms , social stigma , having to travel a long distance , etc. ) rises , women who otherwise would have sought an abortion will not get one .
This suggests that more unwanted children are being born , and thus crime rates may rise in the future .
On the other hand , there are other reasons why the number of abortions might fall , and none of these have dire crime implications .
For instance , because abortion has been legalized since the 1970s , there may be fewer women today who are seeking abortions — the women who might have been at highest risk for unwanted pregnancies today may never have been born .
A second scenario in which low abortion rates do n’t lead to high crime is an increase in reliable birth control .
For instance , following the increased spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases in the 1990s , condom use may have risen .
More condoms would lead to fewer conceptions , including fewer unwanted conceptions .
The result would be both a lower abortion rate and a lower number of unwanted births .
A third possibility is that the demographic most likely to obtain abortions is conceiving less for other reasons — including , possibly , less sex .
My student Amee Kamdar has a fascinating paper in which she shows that incarceration of twenty - something males greatly reduces the number of teenage births .
Indirectly , the continuing rise in incarceration may be contributing to reduced rates of both teen births and teen abortions .
As this discussion points out , the relationship between abortion rates and future crime is subtle .
Subtle enough , in fact , that I believe that many researchers studying this issue do not understand it themselves .
Donohue and I present evidence that the rise in abortions in the years immediately following legalization was due to the fact that abortions got “ cheaper . ”
As such , during that period , more abortions implied less crime .
Whether that is still true today is quite questionable .
My hunch is that the recent declines in abortion are not really a result of abortions becoming more expensive .
There are fewer abortion providers today , so maybe that makes it harder to obtain an abortion .
On the other hand , when demand for a good ( in this case , abortions ) falls , you expect the number of providers to shrink .
It is unclear which is causing which .
Perhaps more importantly , one might think that the introduction of RU - 486 represents an important technological shock that lowers the cost of getting an abortion .
Yet there are fewer abortions .
So , ultimately , although this is a bit of a guess , I would surmise that the low abortion rate today is being driven by a decrease in unwanted conceptions .
If that is true , then these low abortion rate statistics are good news for future crime rates .

A federal appeals court has refused to give New York City immunity from the lawsuits of thousands of city workers and construction laborers who say they now suffer from respiratory illnesses after they helped clean up ground zero in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
The lawsuits claim that the city failed to ensure that ground zero was a safe work place .
High among the claims is the assertion that the city failed to enforce rules requiring workers to wear respirators while working amid the toxins and rubble .
Citing the unprecedented nature of the disaster , New York City and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , both defendants in the suits , have argued that they are entitled to immunity from the claims .
The defendants say they cannot be required to pay out to the workers what could amount to billions of dollars in damages .

Well , it looks like Google is cracking down on paid links , and some people are being hit hard with their rank dropping .
The Stanford Daily saw their PageRank drop from an incredible PR 9 to a PR 7 .
I have yet to hear one person say that their rank has gone up .
This does n’t mean that people wo n’t see their rankings rise over the next while , but Google is on the warpath against paid links .
It looks like Text - Link - Ads and similar companies might have a huge issue on their hand , and if nothing else , it ca n’t be good publicity , since the majority of their pricing is based on Google ’s PageRank , and people buy these links in hopes of gaining PageRank to their own sites .
I have yet to experience any negative side effects on any of my blogs , but I am a very lightweight advertising sales person .
I think I currently have one text link sold amongst all my blogs .
So far many of the sites owners I have talked to are n’t concerned about their dropping rankings as they continue to focus on bringing good content and an abundance of traffic to their sites , but over time this could become a competitive edge for those willing to forgo selling text links , and monetizing their blogs other ways .
These sites that find these alternative revenue builders , could then eventually rank higher in Google , causing those selling links to re-think their lack of concern .
The question I have been getting quite often by people just entering the world of advertising sales is , “ how does Google know I am selling text links ? ”
Well , with systems like Text - Link - Ads and other text link sales companies , they have you put code on your site , and that leaves a footprint that Google can then search for , and once identified , and probably checked by a real person , they can adjust your PageRank accordingly .
The whole paid link market has to change , Google is forcing them to .
It is a very interesting time to be an Internet marketer .
My thoughts , assertions and observations on issues important to me as a Jew , a Zionist , a Revenant in Yesha and as an inquisitive human being .
At a meeting in February 2005 , scores of parents from the two majority white elementary schools complained of overcrowding and discipline problems in the middle school their children were sent to outside of the northern enclave .
Ms. Tucker said she , another board member and a teacher were the only blacks present .
The white parents clamored for a new middle school closer to their homes .
They also urged Dr. Levey to consider sending some students being bused into northern cluster schools back to their own neighborhood , Ms. Tucker said .
Dr. Levey did not dispute the broad outlines of Ms. Tucker ’s account .
“ That was the origin of this whole rezoning , ” Ms. Tucker said .
Months later , the school board commissioned a demographic study to draft the rezoning plan .
J. Russell Gibson III , the board ’s lawyer , said the plan drawn up used school buildings more efficiently , freeing classroom space equivalent to an entire elementary school and saving potential construction costs of $ 10 million to $ 14 million .
“ That ’s a significant savings , ” Mr. Gibson said , “ and we relieved overcrowding and placed most students in a school near their home .
That ’s been lost in all the rhetoric . ”
Others see the matter differently .
Gerald Rosiek , an education professor at the University of Alabama , studied the Tuscaloosa school district ’s recent evolution .
“ This is a case study in resegregation , ” said Dr. Rosiek , now at the University of Oregon .

The rezoning plan will force an estimated 880 students in Tuscaloosa to change their schools .

In his research , he said , he found disappointment among some white parents that Northridge , the high school created in the northern enclave , was a majority - black school , and he said he believed the rezoning was in part an attempt to reduce its black enrollment .
The district projected last spring that the plan would move some 880 students citywide , and Dr. Levey said that remained the best estimate available .
The plan redrew school boundaries in ways that , among other changes , required students from black neighborhoods and from a low - income housing project who had been attending the more - integrated schools in the northern zone to leave them for nearly all - black schools in the west end .
Slice , the pizza blog , has a good roundup of US regional pizza styles , tracing the hereditary links between different styles as different groups of Italian immigrants spread across the nation .
( My favorite slice ?
Hands down , no question , absolutely Massimo's on College Street in Toronto , a slice so good that I do n't think I 've ever eaten a slice of pizza one tenth as delicious , nothing even in the running .
Truly in a league of its own .
My mouth just flooded with saliva as I typed those words , and I 'm presently 6,000 miles from Massimo's )
Midwest - Style Variations , I believe , are found throughout the Midwest–from Ohio to Milwaukee to Chicago to wherever .
I 'd even go so far as to say that the " Chicago - style " pizza just above is really a variation of " Midwest - style . "
The Midwest style is round , thin , very crisp yet tender - flaky , and is party - or tavern - cut into the grid .
Sauces and topping preference may differ from city to city and region to region , but this style seems to crop up often in the heartland .

TIGERVILLE , S.C. — Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee yesterday continued to move to the right on immigration during this year ’s presidential campaign , signing a pledge to enforce immigration laws and to make all illegal aliens go home .
The pledge , offered by immigration control advocacy group Numbers USA , commits Mr. Huckabee to oppose a new path to citizenship for current illegal aliens and to cut the number of illegal aliens already in the country through attrition by law enforcement — something Mr. Huckabee said he will achieve through his nine - point immigration plan .
“ Some would say it ’s a tough plan .
It is , but it ’s also fair and reasonable , ” Mr. Huckabee said .
Mr. Huckabee signed the pledge in South Carolina , whose Saturday Republican primary is shaping up as the most important contest so far .
Unlike the previous primaries and caucuses , which have been contested usually by just two candidates , four Republicans are making all - out efforts here : Mr. Huckabee , former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts .
Mr. Romney campaigned in South Carolina fresh off his Tuesday win over Mr. McCain in Michigan ’s primary .
And though he held a lead here earlier last year , he tried to lower expectations yesterday , telling reporters that the pressure is really on Mr. McCain , who now leads in the polls here .
As the front - runner , Mr. McCain finds himself playing defense .
Yesterday , he had one surrogate challenge charges on abortion and other issues from Common Sense Issues , a Colorado - based group that the Associated Press said is conducting push - polling here , and had another group of surrogates respond to charges from a group called Vietnam Veterans Against McCain .
The McCain campaign said the veterans group is circulating fliers that say Mr. McCain turned his back on fellow prisoners of war in order to receive special treatment while in captivity in Vietnam .
One issue that continues to hurt Mr. McCain here is immigration .
Many voters say he supports amnesty for illegal aliens , and they point to his partnership with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat , to try to pass a bill to legalize illegal aliens .
Mr. McCain has said he “ got the message ” from his bill ’s defeat last year in the Senate — when a majority of senators voted to filibuster his bill .
He says that as a senator from a border state , he knows how to secure the borders and says border governors would have to certify that fact before a guest - worker program and legalization could go forward .
But Mr. McCain still supports a pathway to citizenship , and it ’s not clear how different his new stance is from the bill that failed .
Mr. Huckabee has faced some of the same questions , and yesterday ’s pledge — signed at a press conference with Numbers USA Executive Director Roy Beck — was an effort to provide answers .
It ’s a major reversal from less than two months ago , when Mr. Beck told The Washington Times that Mr. Huckabee was “ an absolute disaster ” on immigration during his time as governor .
Americans for Better Immigration , another group Mr. Beck runs , has rated Mr. Huckabee ’s record as “ poor . ”
Mr. Huckabee fought for tuition breaks for illegal - alien college students , failed to complete an agreement to let state police enforce federal immigration law and criticized enforcement efforts both at the federal and state level .
But Mr. Beck yesterday said Mr. Huckabee has made a number of key promises going forward , including to not grant illegal aliens long - term legal status ; to reject a guaranteed right of return for those who go home voluntarily under his nine - point plan ; and to not increase green cards as a way of allowing them to come back more quickly .
“ Probably , this is the strongest no -amnesty , attrition plan of any of the candidates , ” Mr. Beck said .
Numbers USA does not plan to endorse a candidate .
The group has asked all of the candidates to sign the pledge , but Mr. Huckabee is the only one to do so .
Mr. Beck said doing so will improve Mr. Huckabee ’s rating on the issue , bringing him in line with Mr. Thompson , Mr. Romney and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California .
On the campaign trail , Mr. Huckabee continued tapping into the network of Christian conservatives that served him well in winning the Iowa caucuses .
He signed his immigration pledge at North Greenville University , a Christian school in the state ’s far northwestern corner , after holding a rally with hundreds of students there .
In his speech to the students , Mr. Huckabee took a swipe at Mr. McCain on immigration , though he did n’t mention the senator by name .
“ I do n’t think electing somebody who ’s part of the Washington scene makes a lot of sense , because if they could ’ve fixed it , they would have , ” Mr. Huckabee said .
“ It ’s the principle that says that if you ’re faithful in little [ things ] , you ’re given responsibility over greater things .
But if you ’re not faithful with what you have , we do n’t give you greater responsibility , we take that responsibility and we give it to someone who might exercise it more responsibly . ”
At the end of the rally , the students held a group prayer led by school President James B. Epting .
“ You ’ve got to be pleased that one who loves
You is running for such an important position , ” Mr. Epting said in his prayer .

A few months ago , Mahesh Prakriya stopped by Amazon to discuss the recently merged IronPython project and the changes that it inspired in Microsoft ’s .NET implementation .
We exchanged email , and he invited me to this year ’s Lang.NET symposium .
I plan to look for volunteers to contribute to a Perl 6 implementation targeted to the CLI .
I ’ve been talking to some folks on the freenode # perl6 channel about the prospect of a .NET - based implementation .
They seem to think that kp6 could be used to make something realistic with little effort ( for some value of “ little ” ) .
The most mature kp6 back end implementation is currently Perl5. pm , so the work would involve modifying the p5 visitor / emitter so that it outputs IL bytecode rather than perl5 .
After a quick review of kp6’s Visitor : : Emit:: Perl5.pm , it seems as if the code used to emit the perl5 back end should be re-factored so that the emitted perl5 code snippits live in their own template files , named after the classes for which they emit code .
The emit_perl5 ( ) methods ( which should probably be re-named ) of the various Visitor : : Emit :: Perl5 classes could open the template file for the current class and then substitute values using sprintf ( ) or the like .
This would allow other back ends to merely inherit from Visitor : : Emit:: Perl5 .
They would then only need to re-write the various template files in order to act as an alternate back end .
Much of the code used for the Perl5 implementation could then be re-used .
Anyway , I expect to take pictures and chat with a bunch of folks about .NET and perl6 at this shindig .
I hope to see you there :)

Pregnant students in a Denver high school are asking for at least four weeks of maternity leave so they can heal , bond with their newborns and not be penalized with unexcused absences .
The request is unusual in Colorado ’s public schools , where districts tend to deal with pregnant students or new moms with specialized programs or individualized education plans .
Denver Public
Schools has no districtwide policy , leaving it up to schools to work out plans for students to continue their education .
Two counselors from East High School approached the school board last month , saying the policy at their school is unfair and inconsiderate because it forces new moms to return to school the day after being discharged from the hospital or face being charged with unexcused absences .
“ My initial reaction is if we are punishing girls like that , that is unacceptable , ” said Nicole Head , one of the counselors who brought the matter to the school board last month .
“ We ’ve got to do something . ”
East High School administrators could not be reached for comment over the winter break , but district officials say they are reviewing the policy on absences to make it “ friendlier ” to new moms , said DPS spokesman Alex Sanchez .
Kayla Lewis , who is five months pregnant and a senior at East , requested that the board establish maternity leave for students at a Dec. 20 public hearing .
“ After you have the baby , your body needs time to heal , ” the 18 - year - old said .
That is true , said Dr. Sarah Grope , pediatrician at HealthOne ’s Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver .
“ To just assume that two days after having a baby they can go back to school is ridiculous at best , ” Grope said .
“ During that time , they should be able to do their schoolwork and give time to bond with their children . ”
School - board member Michelle Moss was baffled that schools were giving girls unexcused absences after birth .
“ It ’s critical that these young women have a chance to bond with their babies , ” Moss said .
“ Maybe we do need a policy .
Clearly , as a district , we have to look at what is going on with our young women .
We ’ve got to look at the birth - control issues and teen pregnancy and how we best help them deal with it and still graduate . ”
Denver has one of the highest teen - pregnancy rates in the state .
Of every 1,000 girls ages 15 to 17 , 54.5 will become pregnant in the city , compared with 24.3 throughout Colorado , according to state health statistics .
The district has a school for pregnant teens and new moms , Florence Crittenton School , but it has a waiting list .
Plus , many students want to remain at the school where they started , said Head , the counselor at East .
Cherry Creek , Adams 12 , Jefferson County and Douglas County school districts have policies in which students work with counselors and principals to devise plans that will keep them in school .
Several districts have special schools with child - care services for new moms .
Others have programs that allow students to receive high - school credit .
“ When a girl tells us she is pregnant , we advise her to work one on one with her counselor and go from there to see what they can work out , ” said Michelle Ancell , spokeswoman for Cherry Creek Schools .
“ The counselor plays middleman between the principal and the student , ” said Melissa Reeves of Jefferson County Schools , who added that the district has started a computer - based credit - recovery program that students can use during evening hours .
Douglas County has had a program for 19 years called WINGS , or Winning in New Growth Situations , that offers support and instruction for the girls once a week , allowing them to earn elective credits in nutrition and parenting .
The program has 20 students , said coordinator Susan Anderson .
The district has a school that begins at 4:30 p.m. for new parents that is attached to Highlands Ranch High School .
Students also are able to stay in their schools , but that is not easy for many new moms , she said .
“ Day care is very difficult , hard to come by and expensive , ” Anderson said .
“ We just work really hard to make sure kids graduate high school .
We know it ’s so important . ”
Teen mothers face a challenging future , with many dropping out .
A third of teen moms receive their high - school diplomas and 1.5 percent get college degrees before they turn 30 , according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy .
“ If there are young mothers asking for maternity leave , the board should listen to them , ” said Lori Casillas , executive director of the Colorado Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy , Parenting , and Prevention .
“ If they think it is a barrier to graduation , the board should look at that . ”
Her organization advocates that schools provide child - care services for new moms .
Too many girls drop out after giving birth , and schools must do something to keep them , Casillas said .
Students at one high school in southern Colorado wanted to set up a child - care center , but the principal forbade it , saying it would encourage teen pregnancy , she said .
“ There is no evidence that has ever happened , ” Casillas said .
“ I do n’t think schools have been proactive at creating policies that encourage young mothers to remain in school .
Schools need to say , ‘ What if you do come back , then what ? ’
“ Schools need to say , ‘ This is what we do to support your learning . ’
That ’s not happening . ”

Everyone ’s current favorite state to ignore is having its caucuses tomorrow .
By moving the date to January 5th , Wyoming Republicans dared to challenge the divine rights of Iowa and New Hampshire , and in doing so lost half their delegates to the Republican National Convention .
Most candidates have n’t spent much time in the nation ’s least populated state , and some have n’t even bothered to show up – an understandable strategy given the state ’s limited ( and now halved ) voting power .
Mitt Romney and Ron Paul seem to be the only candidates who have much of a presence in the “ Equality State ” ( so dubbed as it was the first to grant women the right to vote ) , and an online Jackson Hole paper ’s extremely unscientific poll evinces the impact of those two candidates .
Can John McCain pull out a surprise win ?
Could Romney possibly lose a one - on - one showdown against Paul ?
Conceivably , but what is more likely is that most everyone will continue to ignore the lonely goings - on in Wyoming .

Approaching the coverage of the Iowa caucuses like I suspect a lot of Americans were — unspeakably sick of Bush , uncommitted to a Democrat , curious about how things would shake down — there were a couple fascinating moments .
MSNBC ’s coverage brought out their new power duo of Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews , and after the margin of Obama ’s victory became clear , Matthews seemed to want to grab the mantle of “ fiery liberal commentator ” from his cohost .
Asking questions of their panel of experts , he launched into a spitting tirade about how Clinton could possibly be considered an agent of change when she voted for the Iraq war , emphasizing over and over that “ two thirds of the party has voted against her . ”
A quick channel change to Fox News saw their reporter , a wide - eyed strong - jawed frat boy in what looks like military - issue headphones , stationed at the Huckabee headquarters , barely able to contain his glee over Huckabee ’s win .
Over at CNN , their situation room seemed invaded by information - filled data screens , with entrance poll pie charts rolling around the studio like mad Pac - Men .
Finally , it came time for the speeches .
Edwards snuck in before Clinton and basically delivered his stump speech , a blistering tirade against corporations , and he did his best to fire up what seemed to be a pretty sedate room .
Clinton was up next , and the setup could not have been worse : a chintzy hotel ballroom , decked up with a “ Ready to LEAD ! ” banner in Times New Roman Italic .
And hey , look : Madeline Albright .
Ugh .
Clinton ’s phrasing seemed to lose momentum every few words , and Bill looked like he ’d rather be in an impeachment hearing .
Then it was over to Huckabee , whose victory speech was pretty affable ; a little too affable , really , with a yuckity - yuck “ aw - shucks , me ? ” demeanor that you ca n’t pull off if Chuck Norris is standing right behind you ready to punch America in the face with his chin-fist .
Cut to the Obama arena , where the gigantic banner behind the bleachers says “ CHANGE ” in a funky sans serif font like an exit sign on the interstate .
A crowd nearing heart - attack level of excitement is every politician ’s dream audience , but there was no more inspirational , presidential speech given tonight , and probably has n’t been in a long time , although there was a beardy , beret - wearing hippie positioned right next to Obama ’s head who was kind of distracting ( see above ) .
At the end of the speech , MSNBC cuts back to the studio : dead silence .
Olbermann stumbles over a few words and abdicates to Matthews , and the whole room seems to be reeling from the force of what they ’ve just seen .
Over on CNN , even good old regulars like Bob Woodward and David Gergen are awestruck by Obama ’s speech .
Hundreds of pie charts are attacking Wolf Blitzer ’s head , and no matter what demographic they pull up , it ’s all Obama , winning women , men , aliens , furniture .
On Fox , they ’re having trouble with Greta Van Susteren ’s microphone , and while she ’s talking ( bitterly ? ) about an “ Iowa curse , ” her mouth is completely out of sync with her words , although at moments her voice doubles up in a kind of psychedelic echo : infinite Susteren .
One of the other Fox commentators keeps identifying herself as a conservative but seems about to convert to the Obama campaign .
It ’s pretty awesome , but I have to turn her off so I can go watch Obama ’s speech again .

To demonstrate my previous point that :
“ [ T ]he Republican position is this : the terrorists have won .
The terrorists ’ ideas and actions make America ’s liberal democracy irrelevant .
We must take what steps are necessary to protect the public safety ; civil liberties are only for those who deserve them .
Although the President took an oath to defend the Constitution , he now must defend American lives at the expense of this old document . ”
Vince Flynn has written a novel he has ironically titled Protect and Defend .
( See footnote if you miss the irony . )
Apparently , it is now the top fiction bestseller on The New York Times , and the author is going on a promotional tour .
Glenn Beck has said that Mitt Rapp , the hero of Flynn ’s thriller , makes “ Jack Bauer look like a puss ” .
Here a taste of what the novel is like from an exchange towards the end of chapter 45 during which the President of the United States , the Attorney General , and the hero Mitch Rapp are on a conference call in a crisis situation that perfectly illustrates my point :
“ Mitch , [ Attorney General ] Pete Weber here .
We all know you and [ CIA Director ]
Irene are close but you really need to take a few steps back and remember that you took an oath , an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
We all took that oath and that means that none of us is above the law , including you . ”
There was a long pause and then in a voice filled with frustration Rapp said , “ You have got to be kidding me ! ” Rapp ’s stark response caused everyone in the room to take a quick look at each other .
“ Excuse me ? ” the attorney general asked defensively .
“ The Director of the CIA was just kidnapped and her entire security detail was wiped out and you want to lecture me about an oath and a two hundred year old piece of paper ? ”
“ Our entire country is based on that piece of paper , ” Weber responded defensively .
“ You may have been thinking about defending a piece of paper when you took your oath but I was thinking about protecting and defending American citizens from the type of shit that just happened .
I apologize for my language , Mr. President , but this is ridiculous . ” [ my italics ]
There are so many things to find wrong with this : the fact that Rapp misrepresents entirely the oath of office and mocks the rule of law ; the fact that he deems the legal document that is supposed to be a check on his actions irrelevant ; or the fact that Dick Cheney and President Bush have been reputed to have made similar statements about the Constitution and about the rule of law .
A contempt for the rule of law
The overwhelming feeling you get from the book is one of complete disregard for law and morality .
Throughout the novel – which I have read – no American character ever objects to torture or law - breaking or murder on moral grounds .
The only character who in some way thinks about morality is the Iranian intelligence chief who eventually works with the Americans because he knows that what his country is doing is wrong .
But as the novel ’s hero cuts off a prisoner ’s testicles , mutilates dead bodies , and kills a Democratic Party strategist , there is explicitly no remorse .
Flynn actually makes a point of saying that Rapp has no remorse or twinges of conscience over these actions .
( It is also suggested the hero , acting with the CIA , killed the Vice President in a previous book : the rationale for the murder of the Democratic strategist and Vice President is that they orchestrated a terrorist attack in order to win an election .
As Flynn says in the book and interview : too often politicians put their own party ’s interest ahead of national security . )
The odd thing about this rejection of laws and constitutions and any traditional sense of morality is that while Flynn portrays his character ’s actions as rational , they are clearly driven by visceral feelings more than pragmatism .
Again and again , the “ liberal ” characters suggest that the hero is too emotionally caught up to think straight and do his job rationally – and Rapp admits it .
Yet , knowing this , the President of the United States gives Rapp “ carte blanche “ .
Flynn makes it clear that Rapp would do all of these things while not emotionally involved , but , perhaps to keep the audience sympathetic , keeps mentioning how emotional Rapp is .
Any time any limit on Rapp ’s actions and power is suggested , he reacts viscerally , with one example shown above .
The strongest feeling in the novel is a contempt for law and ethics and the rule of law and conscience are considered “ niceties ” that are only practical in times of peace .
If you doubt the current administration shares these feelings , I suggest reading Charlie Savage ’s new book Takeover .
The fact is that these visceral feelings are informing Republican policy – both in Vince Flynn ’s imaginary world and in our own .
This contempt for the rule of law and for conscience , and the policies and actions stemming from this feeling , represent nothing less than the preemptive surrender of American values in order to try to preserve American lives .
What ever happened to “ Live free or die ” or “ Give me liberty or give me death ! ” ?
Benjamin Franklin warned , “ Those who would surrender precious liberty in exchange for a bit of temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . ”
Now we have a president , a number of presidential candidates , and a few literary characters who believe liberty is only worth the paper it is protected by , who believe the rule of law does not apply in times of war , and who believe that we are in a war that will be fought for “ generations ” .
If these men and women are right , we have reached the end of the American experiment .
If the president is not constrained by the rule of law ; if the balance of power between the branches of government is not respected ; if the Constitution is merely an “ old parchment ” ( to use Dick Cheney ’s dismissive phrase ) ; if the government has the right to torture and imprison and spy on American citizens in violation of Congressionally sanctioned law ; if the president assumes tyrannical powers , even if he exercises them judiciously and is allowed to do so , what is left of our nation “ conceived in liberty ” ?
I believe an Obama presidency would take the first steps to restore American values to our government .
But no matter who you support , you must realize this election is of historic importance .
Yet despite this , many Americans , especially , those of my generation , the post 9/11 generation are disengaged from power .
We cannot afford this disengagement , ironic or otherwise , any longer .
A prescription for change
Vote and vote in large numbers and vote even if it does n’t seem like it makes a difference .
Sign up to vote today if you have n’t already .
Vote for change .
Vote to tackle the issues that matter .
Campaign , volunteer , and throw your support behind the candidate you think is the best .
Even more , and in addition , we must work in our local communities , on the web , and through our entrepreneurial efforts to start changing our society .
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world .
Indeed , it is the only thing that ever has .
We must engage with power .
We must try to revive this corrupt system .
We cannot wait until 2012 for real change .
Our moment is now .
We can not let this election slip by .
Sometimes , in the midst of trying times , all we have is the audacity of hope and our seemingly insignificant powers as individuals .
We cannot decide what obstacles we will face .
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us .
Bonus QuotesA quote from Chapter 48 of Vince Flynn ’s Protect and Defend :
“ How are we [ the CIA ] going to suffer any more under these idiots [ those who make laws ] than we already have ? ”
“ By you mutilating prisoners .
Do you have any idea how that will play with the average citizen ?
They ’re going to think we ’re a bunch of monsters ! ”
“ Right now , I am a monster .
Just like the guys who took Irene .
That ’s how you fight this damn war – not with politicians , reporters , and lawyers . ”
From Vince Flynn ’s forthcoming interview in The Washington Times :
Congress really upset me with how they treated Attorney General Michael Mukasey and how the media pushed this question .
Why are n’t reporters forcing senators and Congress to answer the same questions about torture ?
What do you think we should have done ?
Given them a lawyer , three square meals a day and let planes get hijacked ?
From Vince Flynn ’s interview with Glenn Beck :
Torture works , and all the proof you need to understand – and I ’m not talking Saddam and Uday and Qusay torture .
You do n’t sit a guy down and say , here ’s your 13 - year - old daughter , we ’re going to gang rape you if you do n’t talk .
That guy will say anything .
I ’m talking about a situation that ’s almost clinical in nature where you keep somebody , they are being reviewed by a physician and a psychiatrist , you keep them up days on end , you question , question , question .
footnotes
The most common cultural association with the phrase “ protect and defend ” is with the Presidential Oath of Office .
The oath reads :
I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
Mitch Rapp as illustrated above makes fun of this oath and mis-states it .

BA has ordered 24 Dreamliners
Boeing has been ordered to ensure passengers on its new 787 Dreamliner jet cannot hack into the flight system and take control of the plane .
The ruling has come from America 's Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , which is concerned that the plane 's computer system may be vulnerable .
Boeing said it was in constant dialogue with the FAA to resolve the issue .
The US giant will start to deliver the mid-sized planes from November .
British Airways has ordered 24 Dreamliners .
Rival UK carrier Virgin Atlantic has orders for 15 .
' Appropriate safeguards '
Responding to the security revelation , which was first reported by trade magazine Flight International , Boeing said that " appropriate safeguards were already designed into the 787 " .
Like most modern planes , the 787 has extensive computer systems
" We have already reached agreement with the FAA on the documentation , analysis and demonstrations necessary to show compliance with this special condition , " it said .
" Completion of these activities will occur during the flight test programme . "
It added that information from the test flights would be fully shared with the FAA to ensure a thorough review of the system .
Carbon fibre
The Dreamliner is Boeing 's fastest - selling plane , with 802 orders in total by the start of this year .
Last year it was hit by a six - month delay due to manufacturing problems .
The Dreamliner is Boeing 's first all - new jet since 1995 .
It is the only big commercial aircraft made mostly of carbon fibre rather than aluminium and is billed as the most environmentally - friendly commercial jet ever built .
Boeing says the 787 is much more fuel efficient than its competitors and produces 20 % less carbon dioxide .
The world ’s most powerful medical magnetic resonance imaging machine , the 9.4 Tesla at the University of Illinois at Chicago , has successfully completed safety trials and may soon offer physicians a real - time view of biological processes in the human brain .
The safety study was published in the November Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in an issue focused on MRI safety .
Researchers and physicians hope that the 9.4T will usher in a new era of brain imaging in which they will be able to observe metabolic processes and customize health care .
Oncologists , for example , may one day be able to tailor radiation therapy based on a brain tumor ’s real - time response to treatment .
Currently , physicians often must wait weeks to see if a tumor is shrinking in response to therapy .
With the 9.4T , it will be possible to see if individual cells within the tumor are dying long before the tumor has begun to shrink .
The 9.4T magnet has a field strength more than three times that of state - of - the - art clinical units .
UIC ’s 9.4T is the first such device large enough to scan the head and visualize the human brain .
“ Because the more powerful magnet allows us to visualize different types of molecules , we are seeing activity in the brain along a completely different dimension , ” said Dr. Keith Thulborn , director of UIC ’s Center for Magnetic Resonance Research .
Current MRI visualizes water molecules to track biochemical processes .
By visualizing the sodium ions involved in those processes instead , the 9.4T permits researchers to directly follow one of the most important energy - consuming processes in the cellular machinery in the brain .
The strength of magnetic resonance scanners has increased from less than 0.5T up to the first 8T in 1998 .
As human safety data became available , the FDA limits were revised upwards accordingly — to the current level of 8T in 2003 .
In this safety trial , 25 healthy volunteers — 12 men and 13 women — were exposed , in random order , to the 9.4T scanner , in which they were exposed to a static magnetic field and to sodium imaging , and to a mock scanner with no magnetic field .
An audio recording simulated the sound of a real scanner .
Vital signs and cognitive ability were measured in all volunteers before and after the sodium imaging at 9.4T and the mock scanning .
There were no significant changes in heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate or other vital signs when volunteers were exposed to either the magnetic field or the imaging .
There were no significant differences in the cognitive testing of volunteers following mock vs. real scanning .
The most frequently reported discomfort was lightheadedness or vertigo when being moved into the magnetic field .
A few subjects reported a metallic taste , nausea , or a visual effect of seeing sparks .
The sensations went away once they were stationary in the magnetic field .
The researchers concluded that exposure to a 9.4T static magnetic field does not present a safety concern .
With the FDA - required safety trials completed , UIC researchers will begin to put the 9.4T to use .
“ This initial evaluation of safety is only the first step towards realizing metabolic imaging of the human brain , ” Thulborn said .
“ We are now moving towards patient studies of sodium imaging and towards safety testing for oxygen and phosphorus imaging in humans .
“ These early metabolic signatures of cellular health have great potential to advance detection and monitoring of diseases in the earliest stages , when treatment can produce the greatest benefit . ”

Susan Hallowell , the director of the Transportation Security Administration 's security laboratory , allows her body to be X - rayed by the " backscatter " machine at the Transportation Security Administration in Egg Harbor Township , N.J. , Wednesday , June 25 , 2003 .
PHOENIX ( AP ) -- Sky Harbor International Airport here will test a new federal screening system that takes X - rays of passenger 's bodies to detect concealed explosives and other weapons .
The technology , called backscatter , has been around for several years but has not been widely used in the U.S. as an anti-terrorism tool because of privacy concerns .
The Transportation Security Administration said it has found a way to refine the machine 's images so that the normally graphic pictures can be blurred in certain areas while still being effective in detecting bombs and other threats .
The agency is expected to provide more information about the technology later this month but said one machine will be up and running at Sky Harbor 's Terminal 4 by Christmas .
The security agency 's Web site indicates that the technology will be used initially as a secondary screening measure , meaning that only those passengers who first fail the standard screening process will be directed to the X - ray area .
Even then , passengers will have the option of choosing the backscatter or a traditional pat - down search .
A handful of other U.S. airports will have the X - rays machines in place by early 2007 as part of a nationwide pilot program , TSA officials said .
The technology already is being used in prisons and by drug enforcement agents , and has been tested at London 's Heathrow Airport .
The security agency says the machines will be effective in helping detect plastic or liquid explosives and other non-metallic weapons that can be missed by standard metal detectors .
Some say the high - resolution images -- which clearly depict the outline of the passenger 's body , plus anything attached to it , such as jewelry -- are too invasive .
But the TSA said the X - rays will be set up so that the image can be viewed only by a security officer in a remote location .
Other passengers , and even the agent at the checkpoint , will not have access to the picture .
In addition , the system will be configured so that the X - ray will be deleted as soon as the individual steps away from the machine .
It will not be stored or available for printing or transmitting , agency spokesman Nico Melendez said .
The History Of Zork
By Matt Barton
[ Gamasutra is proud to be partnering with the IGDA 's Preservation SIG to present detailed official histories of each of the first ten games voted into the Digital Game Canon .
The Canon " provides a starting - point for the difficult task of preserving this history inspired by the role of that the U.S. National Film Registry has played for film culture and history " , and Matteo Bittanti , Christopher Grant , Henry Lowood , Steve Meretzky , and Warren Spector revealed the inaugural honorees at GDC 2007 .
This second piece takes a look back at one of the grandfathers of interactive fiction and story - based games , in Infocom 's text - based classic Zork . ]
Zork .
For some , the name conjures up little more than a dim notion of the “ primitive ” era of home computing , back when graphics technology was so lacking that desperate gamers were willing to buy games even if they consisted entirely of text .
For this group , the entire genre of “ adventure games , ” or “ interactive fiction , ” or whatever you wish to call it , was simply making a virtue of necessity .
Gamers did n’t have access to good graphics technology , so they had to make do without it .
Once the technology allowed for more “ compelling ” graphical experiences , of course this quaint text - only genre would go extinct .
As for playing Zork today — you ’re kidding , right ?
The text adventure is dead , kaput , deceased , expired , gone to meet the great developer in the sky .
This genre is an ex-genre .
For others , though , the name Zork still makes their Elven swords glow blue .
To them , saying that Zork is obsolete makes no more sense than saying J.R.R.
Tolkien ’s Ring trilogy is obsolete .
Why do people still read Tolkien or any other novelists when there are so many movies and channels available on TV ?
If graphics and animation are so essential , then why have n’t comics and pop -up books long overtaken “ plain text ” novels on the New York Times best seller list ?
It is n’t difficult to see that humans are n’t exactly uniform or predictable in their preference for a given mode of entertainment .
One size does not fit all , nor should it .
Unfortunately , although movies and television never caused the novel to go out of production , graphical video games do seem to have caused the extinction of the text adventure .
Or have they ?
“ The majority of people that play computer games today do not even entertain the notion that text adventure games are games at all .
In their minds ‘ games=graphics ’ ;
If they see a jumble of text on their screen they 're much more likely to think their computer crashed than consider the possibility they 're playing a game . ” – Howard Sherman , President of Malinche Entertainment
“ Modern gamers have seen and played a whole range of games since 1989 , and of course to them Zork is a pretty strange experience ; it 's retro , it 's hard to get into , it 's not graphical .
I 'm pleased that people still play the games , given all the time that has passed and all the advances in software and hardware . ”
– Dave Lebling , Infocom Implementer
However , perhaps this is not a simple matter of cause and effect .
Perhaps it ’s wrong to assume that the availability of good graphics technology caused the decline of games like Zork .
If “ interactive fiction ” has migrated to the margins of the computer gaming industry , it could be due simply to a lack of good marketing , not evidence of some inherent limitation of the genre .
It ’s quite possible that one day , when enough gamers are at last disillusioned with the latest 128 - bit smoke and mirror show , interactive fiction titles will again enjoy the lucrative rewards won by Infocom during the heyday of the Zork trilogy .
After all , the treasures of Zork are still there beneath the old white house , awaiting their discovery by new generations of gamers .
Zork is not obsolete ; merely under appreciated .
Perhaps Zork is not the past of gaming , but its future .
“ Poetry is a vibrant , essential part of American culture and many other cultures , although there is really no market at all for it .
( Some companies publish poetry books , but practically no one makes a living as a poet , even if they have won the Nobel Prize . )
I think IF will be a vibrant , essential part of digital media and literature even if no one manages to sell it . ” – Nick Montfort , author of Twisty Little Passages
It ’s quite likely that no computer game in history has ever inspired as much prose as Zork , even if we omit the billions of commands inputted by legions of over - caffeinated hunt - and - peckers .
Zork and other text - based adventure games have long been the darling of academics writing about games , such as Brenda Laurel and Janet Murray .
No doubt , many of those early visitors to The Great Underground Empire felt they were experiencing the Future of the Novel .
Developers and critics dreamed of a day when interactive fiction games would sit alongside their older brothers on the shelves of Borders and Barnes & Noble , and standing proudly alongside Thomas Pynchon and Norman Mailer in the reading queues of the literati .
Sadly , it does n’t seem to have happened -- at least , not yet .
The question is , why ?
What , if anything , is really beyond Zork ?
“ Zork is all text — that means no graphics .
None are needed .
The authors have not skimped on the vividly detailed descriptions of each location ; descriptions to which not even Atari graphics could do complete justice . ”
– David P. Stone in Computer Gaming World , Mar - Apr 1983
“ I think of them more as thematic crossword puzzles . ” – Marc Blank , former Infocom Implementer
Anyone truly interested in Zork and interactive fiction will want to read Nick Montfort ’s excellent Twisty Little Passages , Graham Nelson ’s A Short History of Interactive Fiction , and Tim Anderson ’s own History of Zork .
What I intend to do here is focus less on the developmental history of the game and more on its impact , particularly on the ways it has influenced modern adventure and role - playing games .
My goal is to persuade you that the text adventure is still a viable genre for modern gamers , even in an age when software and hardware developers are making breakthrough after breakthrough in graphics and animation .
I want to talk about the game developer that put its “ graphics where the sun do n’t shine . ”
Examine Zork
An Only Slightly Fatigable History of Zork
Zork began life in much the same way as many of the early computer games ; that is , as a fruitful , informal collaboration by starry - eyed , college students .
Indeed , it ’s easy ( if , perhaps , a bit misleading ) to compare the development of Zork with that of another classic computer game , Spacewar !.
Zork was developed by four members of the MIT ’s Dynamic Modeling Group , whereas Spacewar ! was developed by members of MIT ’s Tech Model Railroad Club .
Both teams were excited about the possibility of computer games , and both were fueled by the adrenaline - rush of successful hacks and making a habit out of doing what others felt could n’t ( or should n’t ) be done .
However , the authors of Zork had a much different vision of the future of computer games than the hackers responsible for Spacewar !.
For , although Spacewar !
paved the way for graphical “ twitch ” games , Zork was a game for folks who preferred prose to pyrotechnics .
The authors of the mainframe Zork , Tim Anderson , Marc Blank , Bruce Daniels , and Dave Lebling , begun writing the program in 1977 for use on a DEC PDP - 10 computer , the same computer used by Will Crowther and Don Woods to create Colossal Cave Adventure ( Spacewar ! was programmed on the earlier PDP - 1 ) .
The PDP - 10 was a mainframe computer that was much more powerful than any home computer of the time , though much too large and expensive for most consumers .
The few home computers that existed were so woefully underpowered compared to mainframes like the PDP - 10 that most of the early game developers had little interest in trying to restrict or sell their software ; if you had access to one of these behemoths , chances are you could get easily acquire games like Colossal Cave Adventure using the ARPANET , the progenitor to the internet .
The “ imps , ” as they would later style themselves , were enchanted with the aforementioned Colossal Cave Adventure , also known as Adventure or simply Advent ( I prefer the more descriptive title ) .
Colossal Cave is certainly a groundbreaking game , both in the figurative and literal sense — the author and his wife were dedicated cavers , and Crowther based much of the game on an actual cave system in Kentucky .
Although many critics tend to overlook this caving connection , I think it ’s important if we want to fully understand the appeal of games like Colossal Cave and Zork .
Surely it is not a coincidence that both games are focused on the type of thrilling exploration one finds as a caver or urban explorer .
To my mind , these games are less “ interactive novels ” than “ interactive maps ” ( or “ interactive worlds ” to use language popularized by Cyan ) .
Another interesting “ coincidence ” here is that the first jigsaw puzzle ever sold was of a map ( see Daniel McAdam ’s History of Jigsaw Puzzles ) .
It seems that maps and puzzles have been associated from very early times !
Although exploration games can be rendered with graphics instead of text , this eliminates much of the freedom ( or at least the illusion of such ) allowed by text — a point I ’ll return to later .
As for Crowther , his purported intention for creating the game was chiefly as a way to share some of his enjoyment of caving and the role - playing game Dungeons & Dragons with his two estranged daughters .
It ’s easy for critics , perhaps avid D&D players themselves , to get so fixated on this fantasy role - playing connection that they overlook the influence of caving .
“ I ’ve always loved maps , and my favorite games were the ones that required me to do meticulous mapping .
But I do n’t think map - making and adventure games are joined at the hip ; while mapping was a big part of game like Zork and Starcross , it was much less an issue in games like Deadline and The Witness , and not at all in Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy ( which was Infocom ’s second most successful game , after Zork ) . ” – Steve Meretzky , former Infocom Implementer
“ Exploration is critical , of course , but map - making was mainly required because the adventure games had no visuals .
But frankly , it ’s a nuisance … ” – Marc Blank
“ I 've never drawn a map of any text adventure game I 've played . ” – Howard Sherman
Colossal Cave established many of the conventions and principles upon which almost all subsequent text adventures are based , such as the familiar structure of rooms and objects , inventory , point system , and input structure ( “ OPEN DOOR ” , “ GO NORTH ” etc . )
The game also introduced several elements inspired by J.R.R .
Tolkien ’s famous works , including dwarves and magic ( I might note that Tolkien was always drawing maps himself ) .
To get through the game , players frequently sketched out their own graphical maps of the areas they explored .
Colossal Cave also famously introduced the “ non-Euclidean maze , ” or a series of identically described rooms .
The only way players can navigate these mazes ( besides cheating ) is to drop breadcrumbs , or objects whose placement in a room will alter its description ( thus allowing the player to retrace steps ) .
The game also requires players not merely to collect treasures , but to deposit them in the proper location to earn points ( the same feature shows up in Zork ) .
Although Colossal Cave was certainly a breakthrough , it did n’t take long for hackers to master it .
Some hackers went a step beyond ; they had sighted a new vista and wanted to explore its possibilities to the fullest .
Much like Crowther and Woods , the imps were initially inspired more by a desire to test their hacker skills than a singular desire for wealth .
Indeed , in a famous 1979 article published in the scientific journal IEEE Computer , the authors promised to send anyone a copy of the game who sent them a magnetic tape and return postage .
This article , written by Dave Lebling , Marc Blank , and Tim Anderson , describes the game as a “ computerized fantasy simulation , ” and uses terminology familiar to anyone who remembers Dungeons & Dragons :
“ In this type of game , the player interacts conversationally with an omniscient ‘ Master of the Dungeon , ’ who rules on each proposed action and relates the consequences . ”
However , like Colossal Cave , Zork is primarily a game about exploration , involving such activities as breaking into a supposedly abandoned house , rappelling down a steep cavern , and even floating across a river in an inflatable raft .
Along the way , the player is continuously confronted with puzzles and even a few fights ( such as a troll to be dispatched with the sword ) .
Most famously , though , the player must at all times be wary of the grue — a mysterious beast which lurks in total darkness , always hungry for adventurers .
On the surface , Zork appears to have much in common with its progenitor , Colossal Cave , and IF scholar Dennis Jerz has gone so far as to say that “ whereas Adventure began as a simulation of a real cave , Zork began as a simulation of Adventure . ”
However , Zork offered several key innovations to that game , including a much more sophisticated parser capable of handling commands like “ KILL TROLL WITH SWORD ” and “ PUT COFFIN , SCEPTRE , AND GOLD INTO CASE , ” whereas Colossal Cave was limited to commands of one or two words ( “ GET BOTTLE ” , “ PLUGH ” ) .
Zork also offered a more sophisticated antagonist , the famous thief , who roams about the world independently of the character and eventually plays an important role in solving the game .
Zork II also introduces a coherent plot to add some narrative coherence to the player ’s treasure hunting .
Overall , though , the game was praised for its humor and excellent writing .
“ The parser was far ahead of other adventure games and the environment was far better simulated ( due to the fact that it was written in an object - oriented way ) .
In many ways , Infocom 's games were far ahead of their time . ” – Marc Blank
Where [ journalists and historians ] tend to go wrong is to overemphasize the importance of our parser .
You can't blame them for that , because we pushed it hard as a ‘ unique feature ’ as well .
What was at least as important was coming up with good writing , good stories , and rich environments .
– Dave Lebling
“ Zork introduced an actual villain , the thief , who opposed the player character during the initial exploration of the dungeon , who could be exploited to solve a puzzle , and who had to be confronted and defeated .
This was a real character with the functions of a character as seen in literature , not the mere anthropomorphic obstacle that was seen in Adventure .
”-- Nick Montfort
I should mention that the mainframe Zork was not broken into a trilogy , but rather existed as a single massive game .
After the imps founded Infocom and decided to commercially release the game for personal computers , they were faced with stiff memory limitations ( and a wide variety of incompatible platforms ) .
To get around the problem , they broke the game up into three parts , though not without some modifications and additions .
It ’s also worthwhile to mention the brilliant design strategy they followed .
Rather than port the code to so many different platforms , Joel Berez and Marc Blank created a virtual platform called the “ Z - Machine , ” which was programmed using a LISP - like language called ZIL .
Afterwards , all that was required to port the entire library to a new platform was to write ( or have written ) a “ Z - Machine Interpreter , ” or ZIP .
Scott Cutler took on the task of creating the first ZIP , which was written for Tandy ’s TRS - 80 ( aka the “ Trash 80 . ” )
Indeed , one of Infocom ’s key assets as a text adventure publisher was the ease with which they could offer their games on a tremendous number of platforms ; graphical games were much harder to port .
“ It was so ( relatively ) easy to write an interpreter for a new computer , and then – voila !
– the entire Infocom library was available on that machine .
So it was cost effective even for machines like the NEC APC ( with its huge 8 ” floppy disks ) where a game might only sell two or three dozen copies . ”
– Steve Meretzky
“ The fact that we supported multiple platforms actually had some negative impacts , especially as the newer machines began to have more memory and better graphics .
We had to write to the lowest common denominator , or spend time on each game fitting it to the different platforms . ” – Dave Lebling
Indeed , for many of the more obscure platforms , Infocom ’s lineup was the best ( if not the only ) games available .
No matter what type of computer you had , you could always buy a copy of Zork .
This fact no doubt offered them considerable leverage in the terrifically diversified home computer market of the early 1980s , when consumers could pick from dozens of different machines , each with its own advantages and disadvantages ( cost , speed , memory , ease - of - use , expandability , software library , etc . )
Infocom also lured gamers with innovative packaging and “ feelies , ” or small items included with the disks and manuals .
Usually these items were added to complement the game ’s theme , such as the “ Peril Sensitive Sunglasses ” included with The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy .
Other feelies served to curtail illegal distribution .
For instance , without the QX - 17 - T Assignment Completion Form , players would not be able to input the coordinates needed to access the space station in Stationfall .
Sadly , the ambiance achieved by the clever packaging and feelies are incapable of being “ emulated , ” and players really wanting to get the full experience would do well to own an original boxed copy .
“ You have to mention the revolution to packaging and marketing .
[ Even ] while the Zork games were just a manual and a disk in a blister pack , [ they ] were well ahead of all other software of its time , which came in Ziplock bags , often with a Xeroxed manual . ”
– Steve Meretzky
“ Our other key innovation was to market our games to adults , but that 's another , much longer story . ” – Dave Lebling
The three classic Zork games are The Underground Empire ( 1980 ) , The Wizard of Frobozz ( 1981 ) , and The Dungeon Master ( 1982 ) .
Although these games are based on parts of the massive mainframe version , the imps worked hard to make each game more coherent , such as the aforementioned plot structure of Wizard of Frobozz .
Now , players had to do more than just find all the treasures — they had to find a way to bring the story to its natural resolution .
No doubt to the angst of many parents worried about the “ Satanism ” of so much fantasy role - playing , this story culminates in giving ten treasures to a demon , who takes them as payment for performing one critical task .
The game is also noted for two infamously difficult puzzles called the “ Bank of Zork Vault ” and the “ Oddly - Angled Room . ”
The final game in the trilogy , The Dungeon Master , takes leave of much of the humor and opts for a more solemn and gloomy tone ; one reviewer calls it “ brooding . ”
Instead of merely hunting for loot , the player must find items that allow him ( or her ) to take on the role of Dungeon Master .
In 1983 , Infocom released Enchanter , the first of another trilogy of games set in the Zork universe .
These games were much more focused on magic and spell - casting than Zork , but retained much of the humor and excellent writing .
Sorcerer ( 1984 ) and Spellbreaker ( 1985 ) round out the series .
Each entry in the series is increasingly difficult , to the point that some critics complained that Spellbreaker was a contrived effort to boost sales of Infocom ’s InvisiClues books .
Infocom ’s Zork and Enchanter trilogies were fabulous successes , and the company followed up with several other classics ( see Wikipedia for a full list ) .
To make a long story short , Infocom ’s business was booming , and its superior interactive fiction titles earned them enough zorkmids to build their own empire , not to mention throw incredible promotional parties , including the legendary “ murder mystery party ” thrown at the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) for Suspect .
Infocom even hired a troupe of actors and let participants indulge in some “ live action role - playing ” to solve the murder .
Infocom was at their zenith .
Unfortunately , the bottom was about to fall out of the boat .
From the beginning , Infocom was not intended solely to develop and publish games ( one thinks of countless rock and pop bands dreaming of producing “ serious ” music with the London Philharmonic ) .
Although their text adventure games had sold amazingly well , Infocom was n’t satisfied — they were convinced they were destined for bigger and better things .
The albatross flopping around Infocom ’s corridors was a relational - database called Cornerstone .
Cornerstone sounded like a brilliant idea — everyone knew that database software had revolutionary potential for business , but the current offerings were far too complex for the average user .
Infocom saw an opportunity , and felt that the same virtual machine strategy they used for Zork would work well for Cornerstone .
Unfortunately , by the time Cornerstone hit the shelves , the “ IBM Compatible , ” now known simply ( and tellingly ) as the “ PC , ” was the overwhelmingly dominant platform for business ; portability was no longer an issue .
Furthermore , the virtual machine setup reduced its speed , and it lacked several of the advanced features that made its rival database programs worth learning in the first place .
The program was not a success , and several critics remarked that its name was apt — it sat on store shelves like a stone .
Infocom had foolishly invested so heavily in the product , however , that they were unable to recover , and in 1986 the company was acquired by Activision .
What happens next is a rather dismal story indeed .
Activision seemed uninterested in publishing text games , preferring instead to exploit the popularity of games like Zork in graphical adventure games , starting with Beyond Zork in 1987 , a graphical game by Brian Moriarty ( Wishbringer , Trinity , and later Loom ) .
Beyond Zork offered players a crude automap and several random and RPG elements to theoretically enhance the game ’s re-playability .
Re-playability is always an issue with most adventure games , since once the player figures out the puzzles and solves the game , there is little reason to play it through again — though in my experience , a few years is sufficient time to forget enough of the details to make it fun again ( I compare it to re-reading a favorite novel ) .
Steve Meretzky ( Planetfall , A Mind Forever Voyaging ) got in on the act with Zork Zero , another graphically enhanced game published in 1988 .
Zork Zero is a prequel to the trilogy , and offers several nice features like in - game hints , menus , and an interactive map .
“ Zork Zero is a very well documented and user friendly game .
Overall , it is a worthy addition to the Zork series and is , by far , the best one to date .
It is a lot better than many animated ones . ” – Dave Arneson in Computer Gaming World , Jan. 1989 .
“ Beyond Zork contains so many innovative features that if it were n’t for the richness of the text , you might not recognize the product as having come from Infocom . ” – James V. Trunzo in Compute ! , Apr. 1988 .
The graphically enhanced Zork Zero
The last game to published under the Infocom label was Return to Zork , a 1993 game released for PC and Macintosh ( and later ported to several other platforms , including the Sega Saturn and the 3DO ) .
Developed by Activision , Return to Zork is quite a different animal than the previous Zork games , even the graphically enhanced games described above .
Return to Zork will no doubt remind most gamers of the far more popular Myst , which was released a few months afterwards .
The parser is gone , replaced by a purely graphical interface that is surprisingly complex and multi-faceted .
The game also offers live action sequences , including performances by Robyn Lively .
Contemporary reviewers seemed to mostly enjoy the game , though Zork aficionados were ( and are ) divided over whether to include the game as part of the Zork canon .
Very few of the original characters show up in the game , and there will always be the issue of whether any graphical adventure game could truly compare to the great text - based classics .
“ People accustomed to the speed and flexibility of a text - only parser are going to feel handcuffed . ” – Jay Kee on Return to Zork , in Compute ! , Sep. 1994 .
Activision released two more Zork - themed graphical adventures : Zork Nemesis ( 1996 ) and Zork : Grand Inquisitor ( 1997 ) , quietly dropping the name “ Infocom . ”
Nemesis offers a much simplified graphical interface and a much darker atmosphere than previous games .
Like Return to Zork , Nemesis was loaded with live action sequences — to the point that the game shipped on 3 CD - ROMs .
Most reviewers remark about the intense gore found in the game , including a puzzle requiring the player to chop the head off a corpse with a guillotine .
Grand Inquisitor brought back much of the humor missing in Nemesis , and seemed to pay more homage to the series than the previous two games .
Perhaps more significantly , Activision released Zork : The Undiscovered Underground , a text adventure by Marc Blank and Michael Berlyn .
The Undiscovered Underground no doubt eased some of the bitterness that dyed - in - the - wool Zork fans felt towards Activision , who some viewed as merely exploiting the franchise to turn a quick buck .
Unfortunately , even a new text adventure was not enough to save Zork ; Grand Inquisitor did not sell as many copies as Activision hoped .
To date , there have been no more official Zork titles , though there have been several anthologies .
GameTap also offers most of the games through its subscription service , but there are plenty of free ( if not so legal ) ways to play the earlier games online .
“ Whether these games qualified as “ exploiting ” the brand , I guess I ’d say so , but I do n’t feel like Activision was sullying something pure and noble ; we were exploiting the brand ourselves with games like Brian ’s Beyond Zork and my Zork Zero . ” – Steve Meretzky
“ The major thing I would have done differently at that time would have been to try to involve the Infocom authors in the writing of the new Zorks , and to try to keep up the Infocom level of quality and polish ; some of their efforts were pretty feeble . ”
– Dave Lebling
“ When Activision was run by Bruce Davis ( in the late 80's ) , I 'm sure you could n't find anyone at Infocom with anything good to say about them .
But that 's well in the past . ” – Marc Blank
The Future of Zork
To say that Zork is an influential adventure game is like saying the Iliad is an influential poem .
At some point , the question is not so much one of “ influences ” but rather of laying foundations .
Although the game ’s mechanics have no doubt been surpassed by later parsers , no one can deny the incalculable influence Zork has extended across a broad spectrum of games and genres .
Could we have Myst without Zork ?
What about Doom or Ultima ?
All of these games borrow and pay homage , whether directly or indirectly , acknowledged or not , from the type of gameplay found in Zork .
The player is still exploring spaces , finding affordances , and overcoming obstacles .
The only crucial differences are the ways these activities are represented on the screen , and the way they are selected by the player .
In the first case , rooms and actions are described with text rather than graphics .
In the second , players use their keyboards to input commands in the form of words and sentences rather than mouse clicks or arrow keys .
For example , if the player “ goes north ” in Doom by pressing the up arrow key , players in Zork simply type “ go north ” or simply “ n . ”
To say that the former method is objectively superior or more “ immersive ” than the latter seems foolhardy at best .
“ Sometimes I see the same sort of humor and irreverence of Zork popping up in games , for example in some of the NPC dialogue or quest names in World of Warcraft , and I like to think that that ’s the influence of Zork in particular and the Infocom games in general . ”
– Steve Meretzky
“ The MMOs are the most Zork - like , but the lineage is more through the side door : MMOs like Everquest and World of Warcraft are descended from MUDs , which were inspired by Adventure and Zork .
MMOs have genetic material from a lot of sources , though . ” – Dave Lebling
“ I do n't discern any influence , frankly . ” – Marc Blank
What Zork seemed to contribute more than anything was the idea that the computer could simulate a rich virtual environment much , much larger and nuanced than the playing fields seen in games like Spacewar ! or Pac - Man .
Furthermore , the game demonstrated the literary potential of the computer .
Thousands upon thousands of gamers have been charmed by the wit and elegance of Zork ’s many descriptions .
Perhaps more than anything , though , these games offered players the illusion of total freedom .
Instead of merely selecting a few set commands from a menu , Zork encouraged players to imagine infinite possibilities .
For most players , a great deal of the fun was simply experimenting with strange commands to see if the developers had anticipated them .
For example , typing HELLO results in , “ Nice weather we ’re having lately ” or “ Good day . ”
Type JUMP , and you ’re told , “ Very good .
Now you can do to the second grade . ”
On the other hand , typing “ HELP ” results in “ I do n’t know the word ‘ help , ’ ” a response which seems to have unintended significance .
You can try out the results of curse words yourself .
There have been many claims made over the years ( particularly by disgruntled fans of interactive fiction ) that their games are simply more intellectually challenging , and that the reason so many modern gamers do n’t like them is that they simply are n’t intelligent or refined enough to appreciate them .
The very idea of a graphical adventure game is repugnant , fit only for dolts and small children .
While I do n’t share this view , as someone who teaches writing , I can certainly understand its appeal .
For what could possibly teach people the power of the written word better than a text adventure game , where typing words is literally the only way to make things happen ?
On the other hand , I ’ve never bought the argument that a textual description requires more imagination than a graphic .
It seems to me that the same sort of thing is going on in my head whether I see the word “ mailbox ” or see one represented on the screen .
To make sense of either , I have to have some sort of familiarity with the concept of mailboxes , and imagine the possible reasons why the mailbox is there and what role it could play in the game .
It ’s an argument at least as old as Plato , and not one that I find very helpful .
“ Graphic adventures were awful looking back in the day , but that 's certainly no longer an issue .
I think text adventures were simply an excellent fit for those early days of PC's , but that they simply are n't competitive now as entertainment . ” – Marc Blank
“ I could name a few good graphical adventures , but none that I know of suggest ways that we could reorganize our society , as A Mind Forever Voyaging does , and none are as powerful on the surface and beneath the surface as is , for instance , Bad Machine .
That said , I do n't object to graphical games at all , and I do n't think there 's a sharp divide between them and text - based IF .
Text - based games can shade off into graphical ones . ”
– Nick Montfort
What , then , is the true advantage of a text adventure over a graphical one ?
For me , the answer to this question lies entirely in the perceived freedom and intelligence of the parser .
It ’s nice to be able to interact with a game in such a thoroughly compelling manner .
And it ’s here that I see the future of Zork , or the future of any text - based interactive narrative .
The key is an increasingly sophisticated parser , with enough artificial intelligence to make convincing responses to anything the player might type ; it would be as though there was an actual person or “ dungeon master ” on the other side of the screen .
It is true that such technology is far beyond what we currently have available , but consider how far graphics technology has come since 1980 .
What if the same level of exponential growth had occurred in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing ?
“ The things that interest me , ” writes Montfort , “ are advancing the state of the art , tackling simulation and language in new ways , and doing important work within our culture . ”
Perhaps what we ’ll find beyond Zork is not better graphics , but the wily Dungeon Master himself .

Beer , Brats and Bad Behavior German Elite Troops in Afghanistan Marred by Reports of Misconduct
As members of the German Bundestag prepare to decide whether to extend the German military 's mission in Afghanistan , reports of alcoholism and irresponsible behavior by commanders of Germany 's " Kommando Spezialkräfte " elite unit are coming to light .
It has been quite a while since I have put finger tip to key board and joined the Tesla blogosphere .
This might have something to do with my being a little bit busy as we have been maturing the Roadster from an amazing prototype to a full - blown production car .
From Darryl : I am experimenting with a new thing for our blogs – video .
I am planning on using this to do intro videos like the one with Mac here , and perhaps to answer questions raised on the blog for follow up video interviews .
In some cases , we may have the entire blog be a video blog .
One of the things that inspired me to try this is the fact that we have a lot we want to talk about but the reality is many of the folks hard at work on the car have very little time to spare to write blogs ( it ’s harder and more time consuming than it seems ) .
Since we are just trying it out , I am using a cheap “ Flip Video ” camera and YouTube to shoot and host the videos .
If it catches on maybe we ’ll invest in some better stuff .
You ’ve heard us say this many times but , “ This is n’t easy ” .
Being the guy who ’s done this sort of thing before , I ’ve often warned my colleagues that this was going to be hard .
If you think you know about cars because you ’ve tinkered with them during the weekend , I can assure you that it is a whole new world when you design a new one and try to put it into production .
Unfortunately , no one told me how hard this particular one was going to be .
Having said that , I ca n’t imagine a more rewarding job than getting the Tesla Roadster from concept through to production - and we are so nearly there .
Last time I wrote , we had just started crashing the early prototypes .
As I stated at the time , this exercise is both expensive and scary .
I have since found that although crashing the final validation cars is less expensive due to pre-production parts costing less than early prototypes , it is even more scary .
Although we needed the early tests to be successful , I also knew that they represented a learning opportunity and that there would be subsequent repeat tests .
For the final certification tests , the consequences of failure would have had a serious impact ( pun intended ) on our program .
Some of you may have seen some recent blogging about the safety of EVs during crash testing .
There is nothing intrinsically less safe about an EV than a gasoline car .
It ’s all about the energy absorption of the periphery of the vehicle and the integrity of the structure that protects the passengers and anything else that it is a good idea not to damage - in our case this is the ESS ( battery box ) ; in the case of regular cars it ’s the fuel tank .
I always find it interesting when people say , “ Is n’t it dangerous carrying all those batteries around ? ”
Well I do n’t know about you , but I ’d rather carry a load of relatively inert battery cells than 10 gallons of highly volatile , flammable liquid .
I will not comment on how other companies design their vehicles but at Tesla , we have paid great attention to the integrity of the design for crash management .
Front Crash Test Front Crash Test
Side Crash Test Side Crash Test
This relates not only to the aforementioned structural integrity , but also to the safety systems within the ESS itself .
The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ( FMVSS ) are slightly different for EVs in that they cover spillage of electrolyte and avoidance of electric shock rather than the spillage of fuel as in a conventional gasoline powered vehicle .
We have therefore incorporated numerous safety systems into the ESS to prevent such dangers .
The most significant of these systems opens the primary contactors during a crash event and thus completely isolates the high voltage system from the rest of the vehicle .
This system when combined with the physical protection of the enclosure , results in an electrically safe vehicle following the prescribed impacts .
Rear Crash Test Rear Crash Test
Rear Crash Test Rear Crash Test
So , back to the plot , how did the final certification tests go ?
Well , I still have some hair and it ’s not all grey .
Thanks to great design , structural analysis , build quality and well run test management , we have successfully completed the entire suite of dynamic impact testing to meet both FMVSS and , as importantly , our own very strenuous internal performance targets .
This is a great achievement for Tesla ; it takes us another ( major ) step closer to our final goal and is another demonstration that EVs are as real as any other vehicle on the road .
And while we ’re on the FMVSS theme , while crash testing gets the headline attention there are roughly 40 other specific federally mandated requirements that apply to the Roadster .
Tesla needed to meet all of these requirements in order to be in a position to affix the much coveted Manufacturer ’s Certification Label on the car .
Here ’s a few that you may or may not be aware of .
Defrost Test Defrost Test
“ Windshield Defrosting and Defogging ”
The roadster has been in a climate chamber getting itself truly chilled and frosted .
During these tests , we start the vehicle and ensure that defined zones of the windshield are cleared within a specified timeframe .
Come on , who was thinking , “ That must be hard for an electric car with cold batteries ” ?
Not so .
The Roadster has the advantage of not needing to wait for an engine to warm up ( and warming by means of all that otherwise wasted energy - how inefficient ! ) but can immediately get to work on the windshield using our electrically powered PTC heating system .
We passed the defrost test with flying colors .
" Rear View Mirrors ”
This one amuses me - not because the regulations require that important rearward areas must be visible via the mirrors , a very sensible precaution , but rather that federal rules do not specifically regulate the forward field of vision as is the case in Europe .
Crazy huh ?
Anyway , we passed this too .
There is some standard stuff covers things like , “ Flammability of Interior Materials , ” - very sensible .
In a similar vein there is a , “ Controls and Displays ” .
These standards may answer the question of why so many cars look similar - perhaps , but we do tend to recognize what all the symbols mean , whatever car we jump into .
Lights !
Did you know that you ca n’t just make any old lighting thingy that shines down the road ?
Check out your current car , there should be “ DOT ” markings on the lens to confirm that they meet the FMVSS prescribed intensity and lighting pattern to provide sufficient illumination and avoid dazzling oncoming traffic .
Yup , I agree .
It would help if people adjusted them occasionally .
Or is that just because I drive a low slung car and suffer jacked up trucks coming the other way !
The lights must also be within prescribed positions on the vehicle .
One problem with such a low sleek design like the roadster is positioning the headlamp high enough to meet these requirements - not a problem for designers of the Suburban !
Last on the list was seat testing .
We have to heave on the seat belt system to ensure that it is strong enough , and we have to impact the head restraint to ensure that it absorbs energy within prescribed limits - too stiff and it can cause unnecessary head injury in case of an impact .
This testing has now been successfully completed resulting in the Tesla Roadster meeting the necessary FMVSS test requirements to allow sale in the Federal Market .
Ok , I ’m a Brit so that was a bit understated .
TESLA MOTORS HAS NOW MET ALL THE FMVSS TEST REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALLOW US TO MAKE PRODUCTION CARS AND SELL THEM IN THE FEDERAL MARKET .
Is that more appropriate ?
Is that the whole story ?

As well as ensuring that the vehicle meets all of the safety standards , we have also had to provide the EPA ( Environmental Protection Agency ) with a full description of the vehicle and our range test data that was recorded during rolling road testing at an independent third party certified test house .
The result of this was that on January 16 , 2008 , the EPA issued a “ Certificate of Conformity with the Clean Air Act of 1990 ” to Tesla Motors Inc .
This was the final step necessary for DOE / Customs to accept the importation of Production Roadsters .
These are immensely significant milestones in the history of Tesla Motors and the future of electrically powered , zero emission vehicles .

LOS ANGELES 
A federal grand jury here issued subpoenas to MySpace and others last week in connection with the suicide of a 13 - year - old Missouri girl after she received cruel messages from people posing as a teenage boy on the site , The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday .
Thomas Mrozek , a spokesman for the United States attorney here , declined Wednesday to confirm that the office had issued subpoenas .
The Los Angeles Times , citing unnamed sources , reported that the investigation would determine if the creation of a fake identity to harass the 13 - year - old , Megan Meier , could be considered Internet fraud under federal statutes .
MySpace , the social - networking Web site , has its headquarters in Beverly Hills , Calif .
After almost a year of investigation , federal prosecutors in Missouri did not press charges against Lori Drew , the woman who , along with her teenage daughter and a former employee , was accused of setting up an online account using the fake identity “ Josh Evans , ” an attractive 16 - year - old boy , and communicating with Megan in the month before her suicide .
The Drew and Meier families live within blocks of each other in Dardenne Prairie , an affluent community northwest of St. Louis .
Megan was a friend of Ms. Drew ’s daughter , but the friendship cooled when the girls began junior high school two years ago .
Soon afterward , “ Josh Evans ” appeared on MySpace and began sending messages to Megan .
“ When he made the phone call , that ’s what I  I interpreted it as , that was unethical , ” Mr. McLaughlin responded , according to a transcript of his deposition .
“ Not just unethical but illegal ? ” Mr. Lane pressed .
“ Yes , sir . ”
In some ways , the hundreds of pages of transcripts of interviews of Secret Service agents  sealed under a court order that expired last week and obtained by The New York Times from Mr. Lane  have compounded the original questions about what actually happened that afternoon , when Mr. Cheney and Mr. Howards , a 55 - year - old environmental consultant , came together at the Beaver Creek Resort , about two hours west of Denver .
Police procedural questions about whether Mr. Cheney was lightly patted on the shoulder , as Mr. Howards contends , or hit harder in a kind of straight - arm shove , as one Secret Service agent witness contends , or something in between as other agents have described , have been buried under a recrimination - laced free - for - all over what came next .
About 10 minutes or so after the encounter , well after Mr. Howards had walked away , he was arrested , and the Secret Service agents involved went about preparing their individual statements about what happened .
A spokesman for the Secret Service , Eric Zahren , said that because the case was open , he could make no comment and allow no interviews with the agents involved .
A spokesman for Mr. Cheney referred questions about the case to the Justice Department ; a spokesman there declined to comment because the suit is continuing .
Mr. Howards spent about three hours in the Eagle County jail .
He said that Mr. Reichle had told him he would be charged with assaulting the vice president , but that local law enforcement officials filed only a misdemeanor harassment charge .
That charge was later dismissed at the request of the Eagle County district attorney , Mark Hurlbert , who said in an interview in October 2006 that he had been told that the government did not want to pursue the matter .
Mr. Hurlbert said that he could not recall whether Mr. Cheney or the Secret Service had made that determination , though it was his understanding that the vice president did not want to prosecute .
The Bush administration again extended its full support to Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf as it stated that he is the right person for killing his own people .
The people of tribal areas described this latest action of the United States as the Bush form of democracy .
In this form of democracy the people do not matter .
If George W. Bush desires something it will certainly happen .
As far as the war on terror is concerned , President Musharraf has US support to continue deceiving the world .
According to Reuters , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday pressed President Pervez Musharraf to hold free and fair elections next month and urged him to boost counter - terrorism cooperation with the US and Afghanistan .
Rice met Musharraf on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum , their first meeting since the assassination of former premier Benazir Bhutto and the imposition of emergency rule in the country .
“ They talked about the current situation and the importance of the coming elections , and that they need to be free and fair , ” State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said .
Earlier , President Musharraf , addressing the Pakistani community in Paris , said he was looking forward to a progressive , stable and honest government in Pakistan that could put the country on the road to economic prosperity and bring an end to the political unrest .
The president said the new government would be required to strengthen the reconciliation process and move forward with unity to meet major challenges , such as the fight against terrorism , and providing security to people , according to APP .
He said Pakistan was the only Muslim country having nuclear technology and the country ’s nuclear potential was being gradually increased .
He assured the audience that Pakistan would continue to develop and strengthen its nuclear capability and would not succumb to pressure to stop the nuclear development process .
Musharraf said he hoped the new government would be able to sustain the growth rate achieved during the last seven years and concentrate on the reduction of poverty and unemployment .
He agreed that inflation was a major cause of concern for the people and said the price - hike was affecting the whole world .
He said he was visiting European countries to project Pakistan ’s position on various issues in its true perspective .
He deplored that Western media distorted facts relating to Pakistan ’s human rights and democratic situation and its fight against terrorism .
Expressing shock over the assassination of former premier Benazir Bhutto , Musharraf said the foreign media had painted a wrong picture of the tragedy , going as far as accusing Pakistan ’s intelligence agencies for the incident .
( CNN ) -- Raids at an Oakland , California , bakery and three homes produced evidence that links the business to the killings of a prominent African - American journalist and two other people , police said .
Chauncey Bailey -- editor of the Oakland Post , an African - American newspaper -- was gunned down Thursday morning on an Oakland street .
He had written about Your Black Muslim Bakery and was reportedly looking into a bankruptcy filing by the business .
Police searched the four locations early Friday , authorities said , adding that the search warrants were ready to go and planned for execution before Bailey 's death .
Police said they found weapons and arrested several people on outstanding warrants .
Two remained at large .

Yusuf Bey IV , who controls the chain of bakeries founded by his father , Yusuf Bey , was among those detained , and was being interviewed , said Lt. Ersie Joyner , head of the Oakland police homicide unit .
" We believe that he 's involved to a certain degree in these homicides , " he said , but Bey had not been booked as of Friday afternoon .
Do n't Miss
Alameda County health officials closed the bakery after an inspection for unsanitary living and eating conditions , said Howard Jordan , assistant police chief .
The warrants stemmed from an investigation that began in May after a case involving kidnapping , robbery and torture in East Oakland , Joyner said .
" It became apparent Your Black Muslim Bakery had some involvement in the case , " he said .
In addition , police were able to connect two slayings in July -- both men shot and killed near the bakery -- using gun evidence .
Police would not reveal the suspected motive in Bailey 's death or in the other killings .
The investigation does not involve the Nation of Islam , another African - American Muslim group , police said , and " should not be seen as an investigation of any faith tradition . "
Your Black Muslim Bakery has a history of legal troubles , according to CNN affiliate KTVU .
When Yusuf Bey died in 2003 , he was awaiting trial on charges of sexually abusing a 13 - year - old girl who worked at the bakery .
In the wake of Bey 's death , his son and designated heir , Antar Bey , was shot to death as he talked on his cell phone at an Oakland gas station in October 2005 .
That slaying remains under investigation , KTVU said .
In November 2005 , several group members , including Yusuf Bey IV , were accused of vandalism and other charges in connection with the trashing of liquor cases at convenience stores .
Police said at the time that the group 's religious opposition to alcohol fueled the incidents , according to media reports .

It 's been speculated upon and speculated upon , but today it happened : Warner Bros. declared undying allegiance to one format alone : Blu-ray .
" The window of opportunity for high - definition DVD could be missed if format confusion continues to linger , " said Warner chairman Barry Meyer , suggesting that this move will end the format war .
We are a bit sad about this , given our current love of Warner 's HD DVDs over their identical Blu-ray titles .
And there 's still a lot of momentum on the HD DVD side , with Paramount , DreamWorks and Universal exclusivity .
But this is a massive blow for sure .
WARNER BROS .
ENTERTAINMENT TO RELEASE ITS HIGH -DEFINITION DVD TITLES EXCLUSIVELY IN THE BLU - RAY DISC FORMAT BEGINNING LATER THIS YEAR
Decision Made in Response to Strong Consumer Preference for Format
( January 4 , 2008 - Burbank , CA ) -
In response to consumer demand , Warner Bros .
Entertainment will release its high - definition DVD titles exclusively in the Blu-ray disc format beginning later this year , it was announced today by Barry Meyer , Chairman & CEO , Warner Bros . and Kevin Tsujihara , President , Warner Bros .
Home Entertainment Group .
" Warner Bros . ' move to exclusively release in the Blu-ray disc format is a strategic decision focused on the long term and the most direct way to give consumers what they want , " said Meyer .
" The window of opportunity for high - definition DVD could be missed if format confusion continues to linger .
We believe that exclusively distributing in Blu-ray will further the potential for mass market success and ultimately benefit retailers , producers , and most importantly , consumers . "
Warner Home Video will continue to release its titles in standard DVD format and Blu-ray .
After a short window following their standard DVD and Blu-ray releases , all new titles will continue to be released in HD DVD until the end of May 2008 .
" Warner Bros . has produced in both high - definition formats in an effort to provide consumer choice , foster mainstream adoption and drive down hardware prices , " said Jeff Bewkes , President and Chief Executive Officer , Time Warner Inc. , the parent company of Warner Bros.
Entertainment .
" Today 's decision by Warner Bros. to distribute in a single format comes at the right time and is the best decision both for consumers and Time Warner . "
" A two - format landscape has led to consumer confusion and indifference toward high definition , which has kept the technology from reaching mass adoption and becoming the important revenue stream that it can be for the industry , " said Tsujihara .
" Consumers have clearly chosen Blu-ray , and we believe that recognizing this preference is the right step in making this great home entertainment experience accessible to the widest possible audience .
Warner Bros. has worked very closely with the Toshiba Corporation in promoting high definition media and we have enormous respect for their efforts .
We look forward to working with them on other projects in the future . "
Newswise —
The human mind is a prolific generator of beliefs about the world .
The capacity of our minds to believe or disbelieve linguistic propositions is a powerful force for controlling both behavior and emotion , but the basis of this process in the brain is not yet understood .
In the January volume of Annals of Neurology , currently online , Sam Harris , a graduate student in the lab of his co-author , Mark Cohen , a professor of psychiatry in the UCLA Center for Cognitive Neuroscience , and Sameer Sheth of the Massachusetts General Hospital , report that functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) reveals clear differences in the areas of the brain involved in belief , disbelief , and uncertainty .
Their results suggest that the differences among these cognitive states may one day be distinguished reliably , in real time , by techniques of neuroimaging .
This finding has implications for the detection of deception , for the control of the placebo effect during drug design , and for the study of any higher cognitive phenomenon in which the differences among belief , disbelief and uncertainty might be relevant .
Fourteen adult volunteers were scanned in a MRI device at UCLA 's Brain Imaging Center .
While inside the scanner , subjects were presented with written statements covering a broad range of topics , including mathematics , geography , factual knowledge , word definitions , religion , ethics and biographical facts about themselves .
Subjects were asked to rate these statements as true , false , or undecidable .
The authors then compared the brain images acquired when their subjects believed , disbelieved or could not judge the truth - value of these written propositions .
The scientists predicted that the difference between belief and disbelief would be largely mediated by activity in the frontal lobes the part of the brain most enlarged and differentiated in humans .
Indeed , when belief and disbelief were contrasted , the investigators saw differences principally in a region known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) , near the front of the brain along its midline .
" The involvement of the VMPFC in belief processing suggests an anatomical link between the purely cognitive aspects of belief and human emotion and reward , " the authors state .
" The fact that ethical belief showed a similar pattern of activation to mathematical belief suggests that the physiological difference between belief and disbelief may be independent of content or emotional associations . "
The areas especially engaged in disbelief included the cingulate areas of the limbic system , and the anterior insula , a brain region known to report visceral sensations , such as pain and disgust , and to be involved largely in negative appraisals of sensations like taste and smell .
" Our results appear to make sense of the emotional tone of disbelief , placing it on a continuum with other modes of stimulus appraisal and rejection , " the authors state .
" False propositions might actually disgust us . "
When the subjects experienced uncertainty , yet another pattern emerged .
A different portion of the cingulate cortex , located closer to the front of the brain , showed a much stronger signal .
This so - called " anterior cingulate " cortex frequently shows up in studies of conflict monitoring , error detection , and cognitive interference .
When compared to both belief and disbelief , the state of uncertainty also showed decreased signal in the caudate , a region of the basal ganglia , which plays a role in motor action .
Noting that uncertainty differs from both belief and disbelief by not allowing us to settle upon " a specific , actionable interpretation of the world , " the authors suggest that the basal ganglia may play a role in mediating the cognitive and behavioral differences between decision and indecision .
Taken together , these data offer insight into the way in which our brains work to form beliefs about the world .
" What I find most interesting about our results , " said Harris , " is the suggestion that our view of the world must pass through a bottle - neck in regions of the brain generally understood to govern emotion , reward , and primal feelings like pain and disgust .
While evaluating mathematical , ethical , or factual statements requires very different kinds of processing , accepting or rejecting these statements seems to rely upon a more primitive process that may be content - neutral .
I think that it has long been assumed that believing that " two plus two equals four " and believing that " George Bush is President of the United States " have almost nothing in common as cognitive operations .
But what they clearly have in common is that both representations of the world satisfy some process of truth - testing that we continually perform .
I think this is yet another result , in a long line of results , that calls the popular opposition between reason and emotion into question . "
Harris is the author of two New York Times best sellers , The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation , which have been published in over ten languages .
Cohen is a pioneer in the technologies and applications of magnetic resonance imaging .
He , along with colleagues at Harvard , performed the first experiments using fMRI to localize brain activity in humans .
Work in Dr. Cohen 's lab is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health .
The Center for Cognitive Neuroscience is part of the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior , an interdisciplinary research and education institute devoted to the understanding of complex human behavior , including the genetic , biological , behavioral and sociocultural underpinnings of normal behavior , and the causes and consequences of neuropsychiatric disorders .
In addition to conducting fundamental research , the institute faculty seeks to develop effective treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders , improve access to mental health services , and shape national health policy regarding neuropsychiatric disorders .
Phosgene is most famous for being part of the chemical arsenal used in the trenches during World War I - generals preferred it over chlorine because soldiers coughed less and therefore inhaled more .
It was still stockpiled in military arsenals after the Second World War but its presence in the atmosphere today is due to man-made chlorinated hydrocarbons used in the chemical industry .
Phosgene still plays a major role in the preparation of pharmaceuticals , herbicides , insecticides , synthetic foams , resins and polymers .
Professor Peter Bernath of the Department of Chemistry at the University of York and a research team have carried out the first study of the global distribution of the gas .
Between February 2004 and May 2006 , they used the Canadian Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE ) satellite to measure the incidence of the gas .
People wishing for the air quality of the old days do n't mean 1917 France .
The scientists discovered that it was present in some quantity in all latitudes , though there is a main atmospheric concentration of the gas was above the Equator .
They found that levels of phosgene in the atmosphere had reduced since previous studies in the 1980s and 1990s , though its continued presence is a contributor to ozone depletion .
Professor Bernath said : ” There is a small , but not negligible , concentration of phosgene in the troposphere .
Chlorinated hydrocarbons do n't occur in nature but as chlorinated solvents they are used by industry .
They are short - lived and they decay rapidly , but they decay into phosgene .
“ It 's very toxic and pretty nasty stuff - its reputation is well deserved .
Considering the health hazards associated with phosgene , the chemical industry is trying to find substitutes to eliminate its use .
But the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons is being reduced because of the legal restrictions of the Montreal Protocol , so phosgene is also decreasing . ”
Higher up in the atmosphere phosgene can be slowly oxidized by ultraviolet rays , and so it continues to play a role in the depletion of the ozone layer .
The research was financed by the Canada Space Agency ( CSA ) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .

Even after more than a year of maintaining a normalized body weight , young women who recovered from anorexia nervosa show vastly different patterns of brain activity compared to similar women without the eating disorder , Walter H. Kaye , M.D. , professor of psychiatry , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , and colleagues report in the December issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .
Studying these differences in brain function could lead to a better understanding of why some young women , who are typically worriers and perfectionists in childhood , are at greater risk of developing the disorder .
Evidence also shows that such patterns of temperament persist even after recovery .
“ Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) of the brain is providing new clues to why people with anorexia nervosa are able to deny themselves food and other immediately rewarding pleasures , ” said Dr. Kaye , who is director of the eating disorders research program at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) and has a joint appointment as professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Diego .
“ In addition , we have a new understanding of why people with anorexia seem to worry so much . ”
Dr. Kaye and his colleagues studied 13 women who had recovered from anorexia , maintaining a normal weight and regular menstrual cycles for at least one year , and 13 healthy women in a control group .
Each was asked to guess whether a flashing question mark on a computer screen represented a number higher or lower than five .
Correct guessers were rewarded with $ 2 , while incorrect guessers forfeited $ 1 . Brain activity in the anterior ventral striatum and caudate regions were monitored during game play with fMRI brain imaging .
The anterior ventral striatum is associated with instant emotional responses , while the caudate is involved in linking actions to outcome and planning .
“ During the game , brain regions lit up in different ways for women who formerly had anorexia compared to healthy controls .
While the brain region for emotional responses showed strong differences for winning and losing in healthy women , women with a past history of anorexia showed little difference between winning and losing , ” said Angela Wagner , M.D. , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the study ’s first author .
“ For anorexics , then , perhaps is it difficult to appreciate immediate pleasure if it does not feel much different from a negative experience . ”
The caudate regions of the brains of formerly anorexic women , however , were more active than those of healthy controls , especially in the most anxious people , suggesting that women with a history of anorexia were more focused on the consequences of their choices , Dr. Kaye noted , adding that anorexics “ tend to worry about the future ” and doing things right .
“ There are some positive aspects to this kind of temperament , ” he said .
“ Paying attention to detail and making sure things are done as correctly as possible are constructive traits in careers such as medicine or engineering . ”
Carried to extremes , however , such obsessive thinking can also be harmful , Dr. Kaye added .
Results of the guessing game are instructive because they show that healthy women responded to wins and losses by “ living in the moment ” and moving on to the next task , while people with a past history of anorexia had trouble letting go .
“ They tended to try and find strategies within the game , and were concerned about making mistakes , ” said Dr. Kaye .
There is no proven treatment that reverses symptoms in anorexia nervosa , which has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder .
Increasing researchers ’ understanding of these basic brain differences could influence future development of drugs and other treatments for anorexia , Dr. Kaye added .
“ We ’re starting to understand these processes because we have better tools , such as brain imaging , and a better understanding of how the brain works due to advances in cognitive neuroscience . ”

In their frantic drive to pave the way for a military strike against Iran , leading figures in the neoconservative pro-Israel lobby have embarked on a vicious campaign of demonizing that country by comparing it with the early years of Nazi Germany and its President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with Hitler .
These champions of war and militarism are the same trigger happy characters who helped orchestrate the criminal war against Iraq on the basis of ghastly lies and criminal fabrications of evidence .
Instead of being held responsible for all of the grisly lies and evidence manufacturing , they are let loose to once again beat the drums of war — this time against Iran .
Top among these civilian militarists are Norm Podhoretz , a senior foreign policy adviser to the Republican frontrunner Rudy Giuliani , Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman , and the leader of Israel ’s Likud Party Benjamin Netanyahu .
These are part of the leading members of the “ war party ” that include , among others , Vice President Dick Cheney in the White House and Elliot Abrams in the State Department .
Podhoretz ’s wild charges of fascism against Ahmadinejad , Iran , and Islam — at times bordering on delirium and self - parody — are unabashedly spelled out in his recently published book , “ World War IV : the Long Struggle against Islamofascism . ”
Although Elliot Cohen was the original author of the concept of World War IV , Norman Podhoretz has been the major popularizer of the concept .
Describing the Cold War as World War III , he sets out to explain both the rationale for the projected World War IV and the strategies to win it .
To explain the “ looming world conflagration ” that is allegedly predicated on the conduct of militant Islam , he begins by asserting that " the malignant force of radical Islamism " has as its objective " to conquer our land " and to destroy " everything good for which America stands . "
After a long and discursive detailing of how and why Islam is incompatible with progress and modernization , and how it therefore poses a serious threat to Western values , he then argues that , “ to fend off the menace of militant Islam , ” the United States needs to resolutely engage in a long , drawn out war in the Muslim world that can be called World War IV . [ 1 ]
Benjamin Netanyahu has also frequently called upon the Bush administration to launch a military strike against Iran on the grounds that , “ like Nazi Germany , ” it is a menace to world peace : " It 's 1938 and Iran is Germany .
And Iran is racing to arm itself with atomic bombs .
. . .
Believe him [ Ahmadinejad ] and stop him .
. . .
This is what we must do .
Everything else pales before this . "
While the Iranian president “ denies the Holocaust , ” Netanyahu said , " he is preparing another Holocaust for the Jewish state . " [ 2 ]
Senator Lieberman ’s characterization of Ahmadinejad as being another Hitler is somewhat subtle and indirect : “ I 'm proud that I co-sponsored that bipartisan resolution calling for regime change in Iran because there are some leaders you can't negotiate with .
Look at what Ahmadinejad has said .
History reminds us in the case of Hitler and Osama bin Laden that they said exactly what they ultimately did .
. . .
We need to be working with people in Iran , who hate this government , to help them overthrow it . ” [ 3 ]
Anyone even faintly familiar with the socio-economic and historical characteristics of fascism would dismiss these wild accusations and characterizations of Iran as bogus .
Ahmadinejad differs from Hitler on a number of major grounds .
To begin with , Ahmadinejad is known as a grassroots leader or fighter , not an agent or collaborator of big business , as would be the case with fascist or fascistic figures and characters .
Indeed , he came to power by challenging and running against the presidential candidate of big business , whereas fascist leaders like Hitler or Mussolini were promoted by big business .
Second , Hitler represented an expansionist imperial power .
By contrast , Ahmadinejad ( and the Iranian government in general ) represent an anti-imperialist challenge or force in the Middle East that harbors no expansionist ambitions or territorial claims .
Third , Hitler was an unrivaled and unchallenged dictator .
He had complete monopoly of power ; not only commanding the German armed forces , but also controlling all the branches of government and , indeed , the entire German society .
By contrast , Ahmadinejad is not a dictator ; he is an elected president without much power .
The real power rests with the “ Supreme Leader , ” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who is commander in chief of all of Iran 's armed forces .
Khamenei has the final say on all major foreign policy issues .
Ahmadinejad is also constantly and relentlessly challenged by both the parliament and the Judiciary .
For example , the legislature rejected more than two - thirds of his recommendations for ministers , which meant that it took nearly a year before his cabinet was fully staffed .
As intelligent and educated individuals , Lieberman , Podhoretz , Netanyahu and their neoconservative cohorts must certainly be aware of these glaring differences between Hitler and Ahmadinejad , or between today ’s Iran and the late 1930s Nazi Germany .
So , why are they disregarding such obvious differences and deliberately obfuscating the historic characteristics of fascism ?
The answer is clear : they want to justify another war of aggression , a military strike against Iran .
The more fundamental question , however , is why do they want to attack Iran ?
The answer , in a nutshell , is that the pro-Israel lobby is determined to eliminate any and all obstacles to the continued occupation of the Palestinian land .
And since the lobby views Iran as one of those obstacle , it is therefore driven to demonize that country as the next target of a military strike .
All other publicly stated or implied reasons such as national interests , democratic ideals , Iran ’s nuclear technology , and the like are simply harebrained pretexts for achieving this overriding goal .

Broken C code
A few weeks back , someone asked on debian - 68 k about an unexpected result of some piece of software when it was compiled on ARAnyM , an m68 k emulator that can run Linux .
His initial idea was that this could perhaps be a bug in ARAnyM , since it only occurred to him inside ARAnyM , and not on any of the other architectures he tried .
In fact , it was a bug in his code .
Let 's have a look at what 's going on here .
The example program which Sergei provided and which exhibits the problematic behaviour is spread over two files .
The first file contains this :
#include < stdio.h > void * f ( ) ; main ( ) { void * a ; a = f( ) ; printf ( "
%d
" , ( long ) a ) ; }
#include < stdio.h > long f( ) ; long f( ) { long a = 84 ; printf ( "
%d
" , a ) ; return a ; }
while the second contains this :
Many people familiar with the C programming language will intuitively expect that this program , when run , will output the following :
84 84
When in fact , when compiled and ran on an m68 k machine , the output is as follows :
84 -1072577264
What 's going on here ?
In order to understand that , we have to take a look at the assembly code .
This is done by use of " objdump -d " , and gives ( amongst others ) the following output :
800004c4 < main > : 800004c4 : 4e56 0000 linkw % fp,#0 800004c8 : 61ff 0000 001a bsrl 800004e4 < f > 800004ce : 2f08 movel % a0 , %sp@ - 800004d0 : 4879 8000 05 aa pea 800005 aa < _ IO_stdin_used+0x4 > 800004d6 : 61ff ffff feec bsrl 800003c4 < printf@plt > 800004dc : 508f addql # 8 , %sp 800004de : 4e5e unlk %fp 800004e0 : 4e75 rts 800004e2 : 4e75 rts 800004e4 < f > : 800004e4 : 4e56 0000 linkw % fp,#0 800004e8 : 4878 0054 pea 54 < _init-0x800002f0 > 800004ec : 4879 8000 05 aa pea 800005 aa < _ IO_stdin_used+0x4 > 800004f2 : 61ff ffff fed0 bsrl 800003c4 < printf@plt > 800004f8 : 7054 moveq # 84, %d0 800004fa : 4e5e unlk %fp 800004fc : 4e75 rts 800004fe : 4e75 rts
So what 's happening here ?
main acquires some stack space , and then ( 0x800004c8 ) immediately jumps to a subroutine 26 bytes ahead ; our function f .

f also acquires stack space ( 0x800004e4 ) , then pushes two addresses on the stack ( ...4e8 and 4ec ) , and jumps to the printf function .
The first of these two addresses is the constant 84 that is hardcoded in the binary ; the second address is our format string .

f then moves the constant value 84 to the D0 register ( ...4f8 ) , frees its stack space ( 4fa ) , and returns ( 4 f c ; the second rts can be ignored , that 's a harmless quirk in the compiler ) .

main now copies whatever is in the A0 register to the stack ( 4ce ) , pushes the exact same format string to the stack ( 4d0 ) , and again jumps to the printf function ( 4d6 ; the difference in hexadecimal values is due to the fact that the bsr opcode uses processor - indirect addressing ) .

Finally , main clears up what it 's been doing , and exits
The difference should be clear : the f function stores its result value in the D0 register , but main goes looking for it in A0 .
The reason for this discrepancy very simple .
The m68 k processors has three sets of registers : one set is for integer values ( D0 through D7 ) , one set is for address values ( A0 through A7 ) , and one is for floating - point values ( FP0 through FP7 ) .
The m68k ABI specifies that integer return values should be stored in integer registers , that address return values should be stored in address registers , and that floating - point return values should be stored in floating - point registers .
This makes sense , since register - indirect addressing modes require the address to be stored in an address register ; and calculating values requires the value to be stored in either a floating - point or integer register .
When main , then , tried to look for a return value in A0 , it found something , but obviously not what it should have found ...
This issue would have been a non-issue had this function been written the way it should have , like so :
#include < stdio.h > void* f( ) ; int main ( ) { long * a ; a=( long * ) f( ) ; printf ( " %Ld
" , * a ) ; return 0 ; } void* f( ) { static long a =84 ; printf ( "
%Ld
" , a ) ; return &a ; }
To close up : there 's a reason why compilers emit warnings if you do something strange or " clever " .
In this particular case , the warning was suppressed , since both files contained a declaration of an f ( ) function , even if the declaration was different .
This is a horrible hack that tries to work around those warnings , rendering them utterly useless .
Please , pretty please , with sugar on top : do n't do something like that .
If you write C code , please compile it with - Wall - Werror , and make sure it compiles that way .
If you want to access a function in a different file , create a common header file that both will #include , so that the compiler can notice differences between declaration and definition of a function ; and do n't expect that something will work because you fixed it for a common and well - known case , because there will often still be other places where your bug will still trigger .
In this case , by declaring the function as one returning a long value , they made sure it could not break on 64 - bit architectures .
However , as shown above , that does n't make the bug go away ... )
Writing clean and portable code is way more fun .
Trust me .
Franco Frattini addressing the conference in Herzliya .
( European Commission )
At a conference in the Israeli town of Herzliya on 22 January , Franco Frattini , the vice president of the European Commission , stated that “ the steps leading up to the Gaza blackout cannot be construed as a war crime , ” according to a report on Ynetnews.com , a website published by the Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot .
( Dana Zimmerman , “ Top EU official : Gaza siege not a war crime , ” Ynetnews.com , 22 January 2007 . )
A published text of Frattini ’s comments did not address the issue of war crimes , but blamed Hamas for the crisis .
Frattini claimed that Hamas “ has been provoking Israel ’s armed response . ”
( The EU ’s Take of the Israeli - Palestinian Issue , comments of Franco Frattini , published by The MediaLine , 22 January 2007 . )
Since it was elected in January 2006 , Hamas has made numerous offers of ceasefires which Israel has publicly rejected .
Frattini charged that “ Hamas has never abandoned its plan of destroying Israel and still rejects the principle of [ the ] two - state solution . ”
Athough Hamas was democratically elected , Frattini , who is also European Commissioner for Justice , Freedom and Security , stated that “ Hamas can not be a viable interlocutor , neither for the international community , nor for the poor Palestinian people who should sooner rather than later realize that Hamas has brought them only disaster . ”
Frattini , a former Italian foreign minister , who is also the top EU official responsible for combating terrorism , told his Israeli hosts that “ your predicament in the face of terrorism is the same as ours . ”
As desperate Gazans pleaded for rescue and the UN and International Committee of the Red Cross warned that food and medicines were within days of running out , Frattini told assembled Israeli officials : “ For too long , we ignored Israel ’s fears and legitimate concerns about terror , fanaticism and the refusal of key groups in the Arab camp to come to terms with Israel ’s existence , let alone its legitimacy . ”
Frattini ’s comments apparently denying the illegality of Israeli actions directly contradict those of other senior EU officials .
The 27 - nation union ’s External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner went on record that she is “ against this collective punishment of the people of Gaza . ” ( Yossi Lempkowicz , “ EU Commissioner : ‘ I am against collective punishment of Gaza , ’ ” European Jewish Press , 21 January 2008 . )
The top EU foreign policy official , Javier Solana , agreed with Ferrero - Waldner .
In a written statement responding to questions posed by The Electronic Intifada , Solana ’s spokesperson affirmed that “ as expressed by Mrs Ferrero - Waldner , Mr. Solana agrees with the use of the term ‘ collective punishment ’ to describe Israel ’s actions . ”
However , Solana ’s office refused to comment on the substance of Frattini ’s remarks or whether they represented an official EU position .
Other international officials , incuding John Dugard , the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories , have in recent days affirmed that Israel ’s actions , including the killing and wounding of dozens of civilians , and the blockade , constitute serious violations of international law .
The Fourth Geneva Convention , which governs Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip , states that “ To the fullest extent of the means available to it the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population ; it should , in particular , bring in the necessary foodstuffs , medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate . ”
The Convention also states that no person under occupation “ may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed ” and that “ Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism ” by the Occupying Power “ are prohibited . ”
Numerous Israeli officials , including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Ehud Barak have publicly announced their satisfaction that their orders have harmed the civilian population ( See Ali Abunimah , “ Where does it end ? ” The Electronic Intifada , 21 January 2008 . )
The decision of the EU to allow an official with as high a rank as Frattini to speak in Israel in this manner in the midst of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza may be intended to send a signal of tacit EU support for Israel ’s actions against Gaza despite words of criticism from other officials .
Co-founder of The Electronic Intifada , Ali Abunimah is author of One Country : A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli - Palestinian Impasse ( Metropolitan Books , 2006 ) .

Search used to be horrible in Outlook .
It was so bad that for all intents and purposes , you could n’t search your old email .
Instead , you were encouraged to carefully sort it out into a hierarchy of folders ( shudder ) .
A bunch of third party fixes appeared .
My favorite was called Lookout .
It provided blazingly fast full text search .
Searches took less than a second and really found things .
It was built on DotLucene ( now called Lucene .
Net ) an excellent open source search engine .
Microsoft did the only thing that made sense : they bought Lookout ( the company ) and took the product off the market .
People complained .
Microsoft finally put Lookout back up for download , but they sure were n’t happy about it .
When Outlook 2007 runs , it checks to see if Lookout was running and disabled it if it was .
Theoretically , Outlook 2007 has search built in , although it ’s not really built - in : it ’s built on top of Windows Desktop Search , which comes with Vista and is available as a free download for XP .
The trouble is , Windows Desktop Search is just not that fast .
When I “ upgraded ” from Outlook XP to Outlook 2007 , the only new “ feature ” I noticed was that full text searches started taking about 30 seconds .
About 100 times longer than they did with Lookout .
And I could n’t install Lookout : of all the Outlook add -ins in existence , Outlook specifically refused to run Lookout .
The only possible explanation is that someone on the Outlook team is getting paid a bonus for convincing people to switch to Gmail .
The story has a happy ending .
Last week Microsoft released a patch for Outlook 2007 which fixed the problem for me ( I have a lot of big PST files , which , I ’m told , is why search was so slow for me ) .
Now I can search old email quickly enough that I do n’t forget what I was searching for by the time the results come up .
It ’s not quite as fast as Lookout used to be , but it ’s a big improvement and makes Outlook less of a downgrade .
Today was the first day of hearings into baseball ’s steroid scandal and the Mitchell Report :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
At a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in the same , wood - paneled room where Palmeiro , Mark McGwire and others testified three years ago , congressmen mixed criticism of baseball and its players with praise for commissioner Bud Selig and union leader Donald Fehr for progress on the sport ’s drug - testing program .
“ The illegal use of steroids and performance - enhancing drugs was pervasive for more than a decade , Major League Baseball was slow and ineffective in responding to the scandal , and the use of human growth hormone has been rising , ” said committee chairman Henry Waxman , a California Democrat .
“ The Mitchell Report also makes it clear that everyone in baseball is responsible : the owners , the commissioner , the union and the players . ”
So , here ’s a radical idea ; let Bud Selig , the owners , and the players handle this on their own .
If they do n’t do it right , the fans will voice their disapproval , as they did in the years after the 1994 player ’s strike , when it took years for the game to regain it ’s credibility .
The last time I checked , Major League Baseball was not part of the Legislative , Executive , or Judicial branches of government .
Therefore , there really is n’t any reason for Henry Waxman to get up on his soap box and pontificate .
Of course , pontificate he will .
Hearings will be held , depositions will be taken , and time will be wasted .
And the Members of Congress involved will convince themselves that this is a subject demanding their attention :
“ This is the American pasttime , great pasttime .
It ’s a game that really exemplifies who we are as a country and as a people .
As you know , our youth look up to our celebrities and the top of that list are baseball players , I feel .
And so , it ’s important to us that we do n’t sit by and allow an issue that has impacted baseball for an era to continue , because it breaks down the faith and the trust .
“ Baseball players are role models .
And so , Congress feels that it has a duty to take a look and investigate . ”
That was what Congresswoman Diane Watson said this morning on C - Span .
Role models ?
Well if that ’s going to be the criteria for determining when a subject demands Congresses attention , I guess it ’s time to summon Britney , Paris , and Lindsey to Washington .
On both Wednesday and Thursday , the price of oil briefly hit $ 100 a barrel .
The new record made headlines , as well it should have .
But what does it mean , aside from the obvious point that the economy is under extra pressure ?
Well , one thing it means is that we ’re having the wrong discussion about foreign policy .
Almost all the foreign policy talk in this presidential campaign has been motivated , one way or another , by 9/11 and the war in Iraq .
Yet it ’s a very good bet that the biggest foreign policy issues for the next president will involve the Far East rather than the Middle East .
In particular , the crucial questions are likely to involve the consequences of China ’s economic growth .
Turn to any of several major concerns now facing America , and in each case it ’s startling how large a role China plays .
Start with the soaring price of oil .
Unlike the oil crises that followed the Yom Kippur War and the overthrow of the shah of Iran , this crisis was n’t caused by events in the Middle East that disrupted world oil supply .
Instead , it had its roots in Asia .

Zombie Rat Heart Muscle Powers Robot
Korean scientists have successfully established a fabrication method for an " actuated hybrid cell robot . '
The microrobot backbone was built with a biocompatible and elastic material polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) by using a specially designed 3D molding aligner , and consisted of three strips of PDMS legs connected across a body .
Cardiomyocytes were then plated on the grooved top surface of the backbone , resulting in a high concentration of pulsating cells .
These key techniques enabled the microrobot to walk continuously for over ten days .
The performance of our crab - like microrobot was measured at an average velocity of 100 µm s1 , and the estimated total distance it travelled was 50 m over a one - week period .
Thus , we have demonstrated for the first time a walking robot that exhibited reliable and long - term actuation performances .
When the neonatal rat heart tissue contracted , the robots six horizontally aligned legs ( see image below ) pulled together .
When the tissue relaxed , the legs drew apart .
The pulses propelled the robot forward .
No speed demon , the rat heart muscle robot streaked through a solution at 100 micrometers per second ( about 0.0002 mile per hour ) .
This is by no means the first muscle - powered robot .
Take a look at the micromachine shown below .
SF fans will enjoy comparing this tiniest of robots with the muscle - powered power wagons from Jack Vance 's phenomenal 1967 novel The Last Castle .
Power - wagons , like the Meks , originally swamp - creatures from Etamin 9 , were great rectangular slabs of muscle , slung into a rectangular frame and protected from sunlight , insects and rodents by a synthetic pelt .

MAKING PEACE MAKING PEACE HOPKINS , Mich . —
There 's not much left to remember Robert Sellon by .
A single , wallet - sized photo tucked into a framed collage .
Old newspaper clippings .
Many , many memories .
But Tammi Smith does n't let go easily .
Nearly 26 years after her half brother was murdered , she can still mimic the way he smiled , the way he talked .
And she recounts what must have happened the night he was beaten to death in a Grand Rapids pool hall .
The men convicted of killing him have entrusted her with the details .
" I 've got letter after letter that says if they could do things differently , if they could trade places with my brother , they would , " Smith says , " and I know that 's not just pencil on paper . "
The story of how Smith made her peace with the twin brothers convicted of her half brother 's slaying captures the difficult choices inherent in the debate over sentencing youth offenders to life without parole .
It began in October 1981 .
Sellon was closing the Golden Eight Ball long past midnight .
David and Michael Samel , 17 - year - old twins , were the last customers inside .
They followed Sellon downstairs , intent on robbing him .
When he fought back , investigators said , the Samels beat and strangled him with a hammer and nunchucks .
Over the years , each brother has put principal blame on the other .
Michael Samel pleaded guilty to second - degree murder and was sentenced to 35 to 55 years in prison .
David Samel was tried , found guilty , and sentenced to life without parole .
Tammi Smith was 15 at the time of the murder .
Soon after , she went to the county jail where David Samel was being held , and cursed him for destroying her family .
Then she tried to forget .
But six years ago , Smith and her sister realized it would n't be long before Michael Samel came up for parole .
They wondered if he had changed .
By then Smith was a born - again Christian , newly reflective on the importance of forgiveness .
She sat down and wrote Michael Samel a letter .
He wrote back ; later , his brother wrote , too .
Over time , Smith and the men convicted of her brother 's murder began talking regularly , sending each other birthday and Christmas cards .
Those conversations convinced Smith her brother 's killers were not monsters but two men who , as teenagers , had made a terrible mistake , their judgment clouded by drugs and immaturity .
" Sending these guys to prison for the rest of their lives is not going to bring my brother back , " she says .
" It 's been 25 years , 26 almost .
I just think how much more punishment does it need to be ?
What good is going to come out of this ? "
That argument largely echoes one by David Samel , serving life at Ionia Maximum Correctional Facility .
Still , he can't quite make sense of Smith 's forgiveness .
" I 've got to tell you that sometimes I can't get my head around that whole thing , " he says .
" She 's got a beautiful heart . "
Smith is n't kidding herself .
Many people can't fathom her point of view .
That 's evident when she and her church group go to visit prisons and find even inmates are skeptical .
But she has n't given up trying to persuade them .
To make her case , Smith lays three photos side by side Robert Sellon 's , along with David and Michael Samel 's and asks people to pick out the one of her brother .
" Well , all three of them are , " she explains .
" I may have lost one , but I gained two more . " — The Associated Press DETROIT 
It began as a feud only a child could invent — teenage chest - thumping over who had the right to sneak across the golf course at Germania Town & Country Club after dark and scoop lost balls out of a pond .
But by the time it ended in the pre-dawn blackness of a long - ago June morning , that juvenile bravado had exploded into a crime whose horror defied adult comprehension .
Buried inside the charred skeleton of a Saginaw home , three children — 7 - year - old Isaac Rollie and his 9 - and 11 - year - old sisters — lay dead .
They perished at the hands of two local teens , who hurled pop-bottle firebombs through the windows of the house on Jordan Street so one could settle a petty score .
For taking three innocent lives , a judge decided , Michael Lee Perry had to pay .
Perry was 16 at the time of the fire , but for an adult crime he'd have to do adult time — and spend the rest of his life in prison , without any chance for parole .
That was 17 years ago .
And today , when Perry rises and offers his hand to a visitor allowed inside the razor wire - topped brick of Detroit 's Mound Correctional Facility , it is clear that prisoner No. 217645 's claim on childhood has long since lapsed .
He stands 6 - foot - 2 , graying at the temples , his hairline receding .
No question , Perry is a man now .
He appeals , though , for the understanding he says the boy he once was still deserves .
" I was wrong .
I took people 's lives who did n't even have a chance to grow up and experience life .
But , I mean , I did n't even experience life myself , " says Perry , now 34 .
" I 'm not saying a child should go unpunished .
... ( But ) it 's like I 'm just abandoned , discarded , left for nothing . "
Perry is far from alone .
At least 2,381 people are serving life without parole in U.S. prisons for crimes when they were 17 or younger .
The vast majority are locked up because they took another life .
Ever since the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that sentencing juveniles to death is unconstitutional , advocates have been nudging lawmakers , courts and the public to go one step further and re-examine the life sentences meted out to young people convicted of the most serious crimes .
If we believe that juveniles are intrinsically different from adults — that their judgment is lacking , that they are capable of learning from mistakes — then how can we justify locking them away forever ?
It is a difficult question and a painful one to contemplate .
Some of the crimes are horrific .
Others seem downright senseless .
The age of the perpetrators — and often of their victims — is enough to make any mother or father say a quiet prayer .
Then there is the fact that laws stringently tightened in recent years often give judges and juries little or no choice in weighing punishment .
In many states , the severity of the crime , not the age of the accused , mandates trial and punishment as an adult .
Even when some measure of discretion is allowed , it can distort the choices .
When the time came to sentence Michael Perry , state law forced a judge to decide between widely disparate options .
He could treat Perry as a juvenile , despite the seriousness of the crime , and see him released by 21 .
Or he could send him away forever .
" The only conclusion that I can reach , " Judge Leopold Borrello told two grieving families gathered in the courtroom that day , " is that the law deprives me of doing justice . "
Shoving match Quantel Lotts was 14 .
He and his brothers were spending the weekend at a friend 's house in St. Francois County , Missouri , and Quantel and his stepbrother started fighting .
Quantel chased Michael — who was three years older — with a bow and arrow before an adult stepped in .
Not long after , while they snacked , one of the younger children noticed Quantel holding a knife and reported him to Michael .
" Let 's take this outside , " Michael told Quantel .
In the yard , their shoving match ended in Michael 's death .
Quantel says he turned down an offer to plead to second - degree murder just before his trial began .
Found guilty , he was sentenced to life without parole .
Today , speaking by telephone from prison , Quantel Lotts will not talk about what happened that day .
But he remembers clearly where it left him .
" They say my stepbrother 's dead and they say I killed him , " he says .
" When I first got locked up , I spent the first six months crying to myself every night . "
Laws toughened up Americans are firm believers in stiff punishment .
But U.S. courts long applied a more forgiving standard when the accused was a juvenile .
Then in the late 1980s and early 1990s , alarm over violent youth crime set off widespread fears .
Tales of brutal carjackings and brazen gang warfare , of remorseless kids who killed just to know what it felt like , filled headlines .
Soon , experts warned , we would be at the mercy of legions of juvenile " superpredators . "
In state after state , lawmakers and prosecutors decided to get tough .
Many states began requiring that juveniles accused of first - degree murder be tried as adults .
To show they meant business , lawmakers mandated stiffer punishments .
If you were convicted of murder , no matter how old , you were going to do life .
The new mind - set resulted in swift change .
In 1980 , just two juveniles were sentenced to life without parole , the harshest punishment possible short of the death penalty .
By 1996 , 152 youth offenders were sent to prison for life , according to figures compiled by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International .
Today , inmates in 39 states and the federal prisons are serving life without parole for crimes they committed as youngsters .
Five states — Pennsylvania , Louisiana , Michigan , Florida and California — account for two - thirds of the cases documented by the two human rights groups , which are pushing for reform .
The tougher laws were applauded by prosecutors and victims ' advocates as necessary tools to fight crime and protect the public .
" If they can do these kinds of crimes , then they 've got to face the punishment , " says Maggie Elvey , a California activist whose husband , Ross , was beaten to death in 1993 by two boys , ages 15 and 16 .
" My theory is when Ross can walk the face of the Earth again , that 's when you can get out , " Elvey says .
But the sharp rise in juvenile violence that the new laws were meant to fight never came .
Gradually , that has lead some to question whether the tougher approach went too far .
" There were all kinds of predictions ( of a sharp rise in juvenile violence ) .
I think I even made a few .
But that has n't panned out , " says Linda J. Collier , a dean at Delaware County Community College in Media , Pa. , among those who called for stiffer juvenile sentences .
" There are probably many cases where I 'd say , ' Yes , lock them up and throw away the key . '
But there are probably other cases where that kid , if you look into his eyes , if you look into his soul , you can say yes , they can be rehabilitated . "
But how to do that ?
Should life without parole be eliminated for all juvenile offenders or only for some of them ?
What should the alternative be ?
The questions get harder when they are applied to real lives rather than abstracts .
Addolfo Davis was only 14 , but he 'd already known plenty of trouble — the child of a crack addict , he'd been arrested for shoplifting , robbery and other offenses starting when he was 10 .
His grandmother rejected a child welfare agency 's recommendation that he be removed from her home , then watched as he beat his own head until it bled and burned himself with cigarettes .
Then , in October 1990 , Davis joined two other teens — one 16 , the other 18 — in something far worse .
Angered because of a dispute over drug - sales territory , they set out to even a score .
The trio , all carrying guns , headed to the third - floor apartment of a rival , and when it opened , pushed inside .
Davis did n't get far .
One of the men inside knocked his gun away immediately and ran .
But Davis ' companions began shooting , killing two of those inside and wounding two others .
After he was arrested , Davis was transferred to adult court , in part because of his prior record .
When he was convicted of murder — found accountable although he had n't fired a shot — the law made it clear he would be sentenced to life .
Today , he is 31 .
" Gun towers , bars , walls , lock downs , hand cuffs , visits , letters , collect calls , " he wrote for an assignment in a prison ministry class two years ago .
" This is all I know . "
' You did it '
On a Sunday night in 1994 , the kitchen staff at Bistro Pete 's was too busy to notice the restaurant 's back door had been left unlocked .
Suddenly , two masked figures barged into the suburban Sacramento eatery .
They waved guns , and barked orders .
Moments later , kitchen manager David Lamburth lay dying .
Police arrested three 17 - year - olds .
The shot that killed Lamburth , they said , was fired by Dwayne " Tommy " DeLuna .
At trial , DeLuna acknowledged his role but claimed the shooting was an accident .
" Show some mercy .
Consider his age .
I know what 's in his heart , " DeLuna 's mother pleaded with the judge , after he was found guilty .
" He is a good kid . "
But the victim 's mother begged to differ .
" He 's dead .
You did it .
When you shot my kid , Tommy , you shot me , too . "
In weighing punishment , a judge told DeLuna the legal system had already shown mercy .
If he'd been a few months older at the time of the shooting , he could 've faced execution .
Instead , with five months left in his childhood in the eyes of the law , he was sentenced to life without parole .
Dozens of stories Sending juveniles to prison for life raises a host of tough questions .
Colorado tangled with them last year when lawmakers made juvenile lifers eligible for parole after 40 years and the governor established a special clemency board to look at those already in prison .
Legislators in Illinois and California have introduced bills calling for change .
Now , Michigan — where 306 inmates are serving life for crimes they committed when they were 17 or younger — could be the next to face those questions .
At least that is the hope of Deborah LaBelle , an Ann Arbor attorney pushing for reform .
She lambastes the inconsistencies of a legal system that deems people too immature to vote or drink alcohol or serve on juries , but says they are old enough to be held accountable as adults for their crimes .
Worse , she says , is that mandating life sentences forces courts to treat all youth convicted of murder the same .
" Are n't there kids who have done horrible things ?
Yes .
But then you have to grant that are n't there kids who did n't , who just made a horrible decision , " she says .
" Should n't we individualize them ?
Are n't they at least entitled to that ? "
LaBelle 's files are filled with dozens of such stories .
Some echo the " poster child " cases highlighted by advocates — tales of teens who , at least in the retelling , are guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Often , they acted as accomplices but did n't pull the trigger , or committed crimes at the behest of someone older .
But the debate is crystallized in the cases that force hard choices — harsh sentences vs. harsh crimes .
They are stories like Trevor Brownlee 's , who admonishes himself — 18 years too late — for his days as a teenage drug dealer on the streets of Ypsilanti .
In 1989 , when Brownlee was 15 , he and two friends set out for a party .
Local gangs were feuding .
Underneath his trenchcoat , Brownlee carried a sawed - off shotgun .
It was n't long before Brownlee 's group ran into teens they 'd never seen before , in from Detroit .
Soon , they started trading words over turf .
The confrontation seemed to fizzle .
Then , Brownlee 's friend shouted an alarm :
Was one of the out - of - towners reaching for a gun ?
Brownlee did n't wait to find out .
He fired into the Detroit teens ' car , then shot one in the torso , another in the leg .
The first was killed .
The second was paralyzed from the waist down .
Today , Brownlee wears No. 211016 on the state blues issued to prisoners at Riverside Correctional Facility in Ionia , where he is serving life .
The sentence has given him plenty of time to think about that night .
What troubles him goes beyond knowledge that he killed someone .
It 's that , in his words , the crime was " about nothing . "
" It was n't until I was 25 that I actually sat down and realized the full extent of what I did , " says Brownlee , now 33 .
" Man , I was an idiot .
That 's the best way to describe it . "
Brownlee and others like him hope Michigan lawmakers see that they can learn and change , that they are worthy of a second chance .
But backers of life without parole sharply disagree .
They 're people like Michael Thomas , the prosecutor in Saginaw , whose strong support for juvenile life sentences is based on personal experience .
Years of violent juvenile crime have defiled his hometown , making clear the need to protect the public and see that justice is done , he says .
" I think most people sitting on a jury , most people with houses in your neighborhood , pretty much understand that they ( juveniles accused of heinous crimes ) are the worst of the worst and that the penalty does fit the crime , " he says .
No middle ground
On the day Michael Lee Perry was sentenced for the Saginaw firebombing , the judge sought a middle ground that did not exist .
Instead , he sentenced Perry to life , while recommending that after 20 years a Michigan governor consider him for a reprieve , commutation or pardon .
Perry is already preparing his petition for freedom .
" When I go see Michael he gives me hope that everything will be better when he comes home , " his mother , Maria Chavira , says .
But Perry recognizes that political calculus makes exoneration rare .
Even as he reassures his mother , he tries to makes peace with the possibility that will never happen .
" If I do ( spend ) my life within these walls and fences , I 'll accept my punishment , " he wrote the judge two years ago , in a letter intended for the family of his victims , " and do it in the memory of the pain , suffering , heartaches and deaths I helped cause .
" I will never forget . " Copyright 2007 The Associated Press .

On Tuesday 's Countdown , Keith looks at the market meltdown and how the failed policies of President Bush and the Republicans made it possible by deregulating the institutions that led us to where the economy is today , and by borrowing money from other countries to pay for massive tax cuts here at home .
Rachel Maddow joined Keith and talked about John Edwards , who was the first presidential candidate who talked about the impending crisis and suggested an economic stimulus package to head it off -- and as long as the topic is the economy , he has the upper hand .
Shattering all its previous records , the U.S. wind energy industry installed 5,244 megawatts ( MW ) in 2007 , expanding the nationâ€™s total wind power generating capacity by 45 % in a single calendar year and injecting an investment of over $ 9 billion into the economy , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) announced today .
The new wind projects account for about 30 % of the entire new power - producing capacity added nationally in 2007 and will power the equivalent of 1.5 million American households annually while strengthening U.S. energy supply with clean , homegrown electric power .
â€ œThis is the third consecutive year of record - setting growth , establishing wind power as one of the largest sources of new electricity supply for the country , â€ said AWEA Executive Director Randall Swisher .
â€œThis remarkable and accelerating growth is driven by strong demand , favorable economics , and a period of welcome relief from the on- again , off - again , boom - and - bust , cycle of the federal production tax credit ( PTC ) for wind power.â€ 
â€ œBut the PTC and tax incentives for other renewable energy sources are now in danger of lapsing at the end of this yearâ € ” and at the worst moment for the U.S economy , â€ added Swisher .
â€ œThe U.S. wind industry calls on Congress and the President to quickly extend the PTCâ € ” the only existing U.S. incentive for wind powerâ€ ” in order to sustain this remarkable growth along with the manufacturing jobs , fresh economic opportunities , and reduction of global warming pollution that it provides.â€ 
The U.S. wind power fleet now numbers 16,818 MW and spans 34 states .
American wind farms will generate an estimated 48 billion kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) of wind energy in 2008 , just over 1 % of U.S. electricity supply , powering the equivalent of over 4.5 million homes .
This wind power also :
Helps protect consumers from increases in electricity costs due to volatile fuel prices and supply disruptions : by reducing the use of natural gas and other fuels used for electricity generation , and lowering the pressure on their price , wind can save consumers money , even in regions with low or no wind resources .
Reduces global warming emissions :
To generate the same amount of electricity using the average U.S. power plant fuel mix would cause over 28 million tons of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to be emitted annually .
Conserves precious water resources :
Wind farms donâ€™t need water for steam or for cooling , a benefit that is increasingly valuable in arid areas and in times of drought .
Wind powerâ€™s strong performance is expected to continue this year , with AWEAâ€™s initial estimates indicating that 2008 could equal 2007 in new wind capacity installed .
Developers report that with strong demand for wind power across the country , wind turbines are already sold out for the year .
Talk about an opporotunity , if more companies in America started making wind turbines they could be sold out before they were done .
AWEA projects that with more companies entering the market , more turbines will become available .
The pace of growth in 2008 and beyond is expected to largely depend , not on turbine availability , but on the timing and duration of an extension of the federal production tax credit .
The following chart illustrates the impacts of the expiration - and - extension cycles of the production tax credit on annual wind power installations and shows how stability in the availability of the credit spurs growth .
Report highlights include :
Installations in the last quarter of 2007 alone ( 2,930 MW ) surpassed the amount installed in all of 2006 ( 2,454 MW ) .
Texas consolidates its lead ; wind power also expands at a strong pace in Midwest and Northwest .
The states with the most cumulative wind power capacity installed are :
Texas – 4356 MW
California – 2439 MW
Minnesota – 1299 MW
Iowa – 1273 MW
Washington – 1163 MW
Investment is flowing into the wind power supply chain .
At least fourteen new manufacturing facilities opened or were announced in 2007 , according to initial AWEA estimates .
Companies are opening new manufacturing plants and expanding existing ones , creating new jobs and business opportunities across the country , even in states that do not have a large wind resource .
GE Energy continued to lead in wind turbine sales , with 45 % of the market in terms of new capacity installed .
FPL Energy remained atop the list of wind project developers , with 956 MW of new development in 2007 alone .
The full annual report is available here and a state - by - state listing of existing and proposed wind energy projects is available at http://www.awea.org/projects.
Washington Post : Private military contractors a US ' crutch ' in Iraq
Want to get news as it breaks ?
Get Raw headlines in your browser .
The United States has set a new precedent in its reliance on private contractors to perform dangerous military duties in Iraq , reports the Washington Post in its Monday edition .
Writes the Congressional Research Service in a recent report : " Iraq appears to be the first case where the U.S. government has used private contractors extensively for protecting persons and property in potentially hostile or hostile situations where host country security forces are absent or deficient . "
Of these contractors said to perform " functions once carried by the U.S. military , " recently gauged at 127,000 , less than 20 percent were Americans .
The CRS report goes on to say that the increasing reliance on private contractors , of whom 1,001 have died as of June 30 , 2007 in the Iraq offensive , saves resources that would otherwise be used to court volunteers for military service ; it also appears to lessen the chance of a draft .
A 1995 Defense Department study discouraged the use of private contractors in place of active servicemembers , saying that the practice would keep the Pentagon from " building and maintaining capacity needed for strategic or other important missions . "

[ Editor ’s note :
This is based upon a single blogger having heard a single D.J. on a Berkeley , CA radio station .
We hope it is true , but can not get confirmation until the morning ]
AT LAST we seem to be getting some movement here .
AS of an hour or so 3 to 4 pm this afternoon , the announcer at KPFA in Berkeley declares that Barbara Boxer has publicly announced her support of Impeachment .
NOW is the time to give Barbara a call and thank , congradulate , encourage , and ( maybe chastise her tardiness , ) but cettainly EMPHASISE the urgency of the Impeachment BEFORE the dub pulls off his NEXT heinous scheme and declares Martial Law , which would freeze him as Dick Tater indefinitely .
There is STILL NO TIME to lose here .

FORT COLLINS , Colorado ( CNN ) --
The editor - in - chief of Colorado State University 's newspaper will keep his job after he published a four - word column that said , " Taser this : F**k Bush . "
David McSwane speaks to the media after an earlier hearing on his decision to publish the column .

The CSU Board of Student Communications met Thursday for nearly four hours in a closed hearing before deciding to admonish instead of fire Rocky Mountain Collegian editor - in- chief David McSwane .
Speaking for the board that oversees student media , CSU faculty member Jim Landers read a prepared statement and refused to comment further .
" We see the editorial as an opinion which is protected by the First Amendment , " Landers read .
However , Landers said the board found that the editor had violated the school 's ethical standards .
" We feel that it caused harm to The Collegian and to student media .
It is our judgment that his actions were unethical and unprofessional , " Landers said .
The September 21 column had prompted the College Republicans to circulate a petition calling for McSwane to resign and advertisers to pull their money out of the publication .
A public hearing by the board made up of six students and three faculty members followed .
That event attracted hundreds of students , many of whom had to be turned away from the packed room .
To some who heard Thursday 's ruling , it simply was n't enough .
" He got off easy , " said Cole Weinman , a student media employee who has worked for the campus newspaper , radio and television station .
" I do n't know that the decision correlates with what has happened here . "
One member of The Collegian 's editorial board said he was glad the issue is behind them .
" I 'm just relieved that it 's over and I 'm glad they made the decision that they did , " said Sean Star , an editor for The Collegian .
Star also expressed his admiration for McSwane .
" I think he handled it extremely well considering the amount of coverage that it got , " Star said .
" People need to realize that he 's a 20 - year - old student and not a professional yet . "
After the hearing was adjourned , McSwane and his lawyer immediately left and canceled a press conference scheduled for later Thursday evening .
He refused to comment for this story .
Board member Elise Stephens , a 22 - year - old student , said that McSwane showed little emotion through the entire process .
" He 's really hard to read and that about covers it , " Stephens said .
" He did n't say or do anything really when we read our decision .
He thanked us , but I think that 's about it . "
" I think our meeting went so long tonight because it is a First Amendment situation , " she said .
" We had to consider every side of it . "
McSwane 's column resulted in lost revenue for the self - funded newspaper , including 18 advertisers and up to $ 50,000 , director of student media Jeff Browne said at the public meeting on September 26 .
Despite heavy criticism , The Collegian editorial board was pleased with Thursday 's decision , Star said .
" I 've never been an editor before and , to me , he 's the best boss I 've ever had , " Star said .
" I think it helped him a lot that the editorial board was behind him during this whole thing . "

South Korea 's Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 90.03 points , or 5.4 percent , to 1,592.63 .
Australia 's benchmark S&P index was down 6 percent .
The Singapore stock exchange was down 4.5 percent , and Taiwan 's benchmark Taiex was down 6.6 % .
Trading was halted in Indian markets Tuesday as shares plunged on opening , with the benchmark index falling 9.5 percent .
Shares in India 's Sensex fell nearly 11 percent -- a four - month low -- on Monday .

Traders said steps announced last week by President Bush to kick - start the U.S. economy are too little too late .
They got no direction from New York , because U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday .
Traders now want to see how Wall Street reacts when it reopens Tuesday .
" I think the expectation is the U.S. will open further down tomorrow , " said analyst Howard Wheeldon of BGC Partners .
" That is a big kick in the teeth for President George W. Bush . "
Markets also dove across South America , where the United States is the largest trading partner for many economies .
Brazil 's Bovespa exchange , the continent 's largest , closed down 6.6 percent , Argentina 's Merval dropped 6.3 percent , Colombia 's IGBC was down 7.7 percent and Peru's General Index was off 8.4 percent .
In North America , the Toronto stock exchange fell 4.75 percent , while Mexico City closed down 5.35 percent .
If the United States slips into recession , Americans may buy fewer goods , especially those from overseas .
That 's why shares from Toyota in Tokyo to BMW in Frankfurt were down heavily .
Banks also fell hard as the lending policy during the boom time continues to concern analysts .
Banks and insurance companies also own a lot of equities .
Commodity - led shares , like oil firms and mining companies , were also hit hard , after flying high for most of 2007 .
If the world economy falters consumers are likely to less oil and buy fewer products like gold and copper .
By only the 14th trading day of 2008 , shares in Europe 's main markets are now down between 12 to 15 percent on the year .
During the market gyrations of 2007 , sharp falls were often followed by sharp rises .
There is no evidence of that yet in 2008 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
When it comes to living longer , fitness may trump fatness , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .
File photo shows a man running on a treadmill at Madrid 's Moncloa Palace , Jan. 26 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Susana Vera
Men and women who were fit , as judged by a treadmill test , but were overweight or obese had a lower mortality risk than those of normal weight but low fitness levels , the study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed .
Exercise expert Steven Blair of the University of South Carolina and colleagues tracked about 2,600 people age 60 and up , examining how physical fitness and body fat affected their death rates over 12 years .
Those in the lowest fifth in terms of fitness had a death rate four times higher than participants ranked in the top fifth for fitness .
“ Being fit provides protection against mortality in these men and women 60 and older , whether they ’re normal weight , overweight or obese , ” Blair said in a telephone interview .
The findings are particularly relevant as people in the United States and many other countries live increasingly sedentary lifestyles and obesity rates remain high .
At the same time , the populations are aging in many nations .
“ I believe we have an obesity epidemic .
It ’s a bad sign .
We should not ignore obesity , ” Blair said .
“ But what happens all too often is we focus nearly exclusively on obesity and forget the activity and fitness part . ”
MODEST EFFORT HELPS
The researchers assessed the fitness of the participants using a treadmill test , seeing how long they could walk while the treadmill ’s incline increased .
They measured body mass index -- calculated from a person ’s weight and height -- as well as waist circumference and body fat percentage .
The study showed that even a modest effort to improve physical activity can provide health benefits , the researchers said .
Those in the bottom fifth in terms of fitness were about twice as likely to die than those in the next fifth .
“ You should n’t be scared and think , ‘ Oh , I ’m overweight , I ’m obese , it ’s useless for me to be physically active , ’ ” Dr. Xuemei Sui , another University of South Carolina researcher who worked on the study , said in a telephone interview .
Drastic steps may not be needed , the researchers said .
“ If you ’re overweight or obese and you ’re sedentary and unfit and you start taking three 10 - minute walks a day and you do that at least five days a week , you ’re not going to lose an enormous amount of weight , ” Blair said .
“ You ’re going to still be heavy .
But you ’re going to be much healthier if you do that , ” Blair said .
Blair also stressed the importance of a healthful diet including lots of fruit , vegetables and whole grains .
More than a third of U.S. adults are obese , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease , certain types of cancer and the most common form of diabetes , the CDC said .
The CDC also has found that more than half of adults do not engage in regular physical exercise .
Exercise cuts the chances of dying of coronary heart disease , as well as lowering the risk for stroke , colon cancer , diabetes and high blood pressure , the CDC said .

Men always want sex .
Right ?
Wrong .
I have often heard the sexual partner of a man say , “ My mate does n’t want to have sex .
What ’s wrong with him ?
Do n’t all men want sex ? ”
That ’s a common misunderstanding and it ’s based on the mistaken belief that men are wired to want sex most times they can get it .
Here ’s a list of ten common reasons why men may not want sex :
Medications .
Antidepressants ( SSRI - type ) and antihypertensives ( blood pressure medication ) are often the culprit when a man has a lowered interest in sexual activity .
These can also cause sexual dysfunction .
Lack of sleep .
When a man is in his teens or twenties , the opportunity to have sex will often overwhelm the desire to sleep .
This is often true also when a relationship is brand new .
But , as people and relationships age , sex can lose its compelling nature and a good night ’s rest can be quite tempting .
Hormonal levels .
The most important physiological stimulant of sexual desire is testosterone .
Many men are mistakenly sent to have a blood test for total testosterone when low libido is the issue .
While that information might be interesting to know to have a full picture of a man ’s hormonal levels , knowing the free testosterone level is much more relevant to how much sex he desires .
Also , too much prolactin and SHBG ( sex hormone binding globulin ) can suppress sexual desire .
So when a hormonal reason is suspected , these are the blood tests to have ( in order of importance ) : free testosterone , prolactin , SHBG , and total testosterone .
Identity issues .
When men feel uncertain about their role in the world , their desire for sex can dwindle .
Depression may be linked to this , but is n’t always .
Identity issues can crop up when : he has issues at work or is out of work , faces the death of an important family member , becomes disheartened about a formerly held strong belief , and questions his understanding of his own sexual orientation — to name a few .
Turn - off to aspects of the sex .
Some men will turn away from sex rather than have sex that is not fulfilling to them .
Lack of fulfillment can be related to specific things that his partner does during sex or how he experiences his partner ’s body .
He may feel criticized or treated unfairly .
It may just seem like too much “ work . ”
He may have sexual interests that he knows or fears his partner may not share .
Disagreements with one ’s mate .
When there are interpersonal difficulties between the members of a couple , many men will avoid sex or just plain refuse their partner ’s advances .
Some men punish their partner by withholding sex , but for others it ’s not a matter of punishment , they just cannot muster sexual feelings when there are unresolved conflicts .
Stress .
Stress comes in many forms and may stem from : financial difficulties , personal or family member illness , challenges at work , parenting dilemmas , and issues involving extended family members .
Of course , there are many more sources of stress .
Masturbation that replaces partnered sex .
This is a hot topic since the advent of the Internet .
It seems to some researchers in this field that many men who might not have sought out other sources of visual sexual stimulation ( magazines , videos , movies ) have found their way to locate sexual imagery online .
For some couples , this can be a dilemma , particularly when the viewing of the images leads to masturbation , that then leads to less partnered sex .
Less partnered sex feels like a blessing to some , but to others it is a frustrating and disappointing outcome .
Fear of intimacy .
Some men have relationships with their romantic partner that resemble that of siblings .
The contact that they experience in their relationship takes the intimacy level up so high that adding sexual intimacy on top of that feels like an overload .
Though it may be difficult to imagine that a person could have too much intimacy , it is the hunch of many sex experts today that this is a very common cause of declining sexual frequency in couples .
Difficulties functioning sexually .
Many men who have an erection dysfunction or believe that they ejaculate too soon — or too late ( if at all ) , will avoid having sex with their partner .
Rather than face what feels like another experience of “ failure ” in our performance - obssessed culture , these men choose to avoid being sexual at all .
When partnered with a man who does not want sex , the optimal path does not include criticism , belittling , or slurs on his manhood .
Armed with accurate information and professional help , most of these causes of sexual avoidance can be greatly improved and in many cases removed altogether .
Civil liberties : are they melting away ?
January 7 , 2008 at 3:09 am thinkingshift
Do n’t know about you : but I ’m finding it hard to get revved up into 2008 .
I ’m still in holiday mode and enjoying my new toy : a Nikon D40 with a Sigma 18 - 200 mm lens .
So I ’m prowling around looking for insects and poor unsuspecting birds to freeze frame !
But I did find this article by Richard Ackland of the Sydney Morning Herald to be of some concern .
He takes a look at civil liberties violations in Australia and concludes that our “ relaxed and comfortable land ” is watching these liberties go down the toilet .
And frankly , whilst I was overjoyed to see Rudd win the PM election , I ’m getting the vibe that the Federal Labor Government will continue its predecessor ’s authoritarian track record .
But time will tell .
Ackland offers up a crop of 10 violations – if you ’re too lazy to go off and read the SMH article , here ’s a run down :
The Trent Smith “ witch - hunt ” – he ’s a trade economist ( from DFAT ) who was sacked by the Howard Government for allegedly leaking information by email to a Labor staffer and for having loose - lips .
Smith worked as an ALP adviser between 1997 - 1999 and there were accusations from Labor of a “ witch - hunt ” .
It was a four - year , $ 1 million witch - hunt , with police ferreting through 8,000 emails .
Although cleared of wrongdoing after an investigation , Smith was ultimately sacked ( and I believe the reason was that in an email he referred a Labor staffer to publicly available material ) .
Escalation in police powers .
APEC and the Cronulla riots have given police new powers to create restricted , cordoned off areas and the police ( without warrants or reasonable suspicion ) can search people and confiscate “ offensive property ” ( which apparently includes mobile phones and the Australian flag – did n’t think the flag was THAT bad ) .
Deportation .
ASIO is busy appealing to the Federal Court over its obligations to provide deportees with details of their adverse security arrangements .
So we have , for example , Scott Parkin , the US peace activist thrown into jail in Australia and then deported , without any explanation .
And 2 refugees who were kept in the dark and held on Nauru ( where Australia has a refugee detention centre ) for 5 years .
The Pine Gap Four .
Some Christian pacifists gained entry to Pine Gap .
They alleged that the base was being used by the US in their bombing of Iraq .
The four were prosecuted under an unused piece of legislation – Defence ( Special Undertakings )
Act of 1952 .
The Crown asked the court to send the four to jail .
Dr Izhar ul - Haque .
An Australian judge found that ASIO falsely imprisoned , kidnapped and intimidated a Sydney medical student , Izhar ul - Haque , for allegedly receiving terrorist training in Pakistan .
A strong campaign AGAINST human rights for Australia .
Hello ?
Philip Ruddock .
The former Attorney - General is singled out for saying that any accused person can have a “ fair trial ” based on hearsay evidence and evidence extracted by coercion .
Obviously , he went to a different law school from me .
The High Court of Australia .
The court has whittled away freedom of speech with the Channel Seven Adelaide v Manock decision .
Majority ruling in this case suggests that for any published comment to be defensible it must be “ reasonable ” .
So the right of any “ ratbag or crank ” to speak up about unpopular cases has been severely curtailed .
David Hicks .
As if 5 or so years of detention without charge was n’t enough , the control order issued by a Federal magistrate certainly ensures that Hicks continues to be hounded .
Dr Mohamed Haneef – need we say more .
So maybe , just maybe , before we Australians declare we live in a free , open country , we should take some time to familiarise ourselves with all of the above and look at the holistic pattern .
Might make us stop and think a bit .

Oil production is highly pyramidal and almost half of the world production is coming from less than 3 % of the total number of oilfields .
Therefore , tracking large oil projects seems like a good approach and it is generally easy to gather good information about a few hundreds of important projects .
The most notorious studies are from Chris Skrebowski ( ODAC ) that has tracked megaprojects since 2004 ( see references at the bottom of this post ) .
Initially , only projects that could produce 100 kbpd and more were included .
In 2007 , the last update included also 40,000 bpd and more .
However , forecasted increases in new production capacity have been overly optimistic .
So what went wrong ?
They are many possible causes : demand destruction due to high prices , significant project delays , withheld capacity , larger decline of the resource base , etc. .
Having a good estimate of the decline rate of the resource base ( Most estimates are ranging between 2 and 6 % / year ) is fundamental for the precision of supply forecasts derived from megaproject database ( see Rembrandt 's recent post ) .
Stuart is also looking at this problem here .
In the following , I assume that I have information about the amount of supply coming from megaprojects for years beyond the year t 0 .
For t >t 0 , the total oil production will be decomposed in the following components :
P FIP + : is the contribution from fields that were online prior to t 0 and that are still experiencing production growth or at least a production plateau for the year t> t 0 .
: is the contribution from fields that were online prior to and that are still experiencing production growth or at least a production plateau for the year .
P FIP- : is the total contribution from fields that were online prior to 2004 and that are in decline for t> t 0 .
: is the total contribution from fields that were online prior to 2004 and that are in decline for .
P MegaProj : is the total contribution from new supply additions from megaprojects .
: is the total contribution from new supply additions from megaprojects .
P SmallProj : is the total contribution from new supply additions from small projects .
Where :
If we remove the contribution from MegaProjects , we define a production erosion as following
Eventually , after a few years depletion will dominate and most fields will be in decline :

We defined production erosion as the production decline of the resource base ( + small new projects ) resulting from the removal of the contribution from megaprojects .
We modelised production erosion as a simple sum of three components ( FIP + , FIP - , Small projects ) which are presenting different decline rates .
Looking at the UK data as a benchmark :
we observed that the annual decline rates for the production erosion are not stationary in the first years following the removal of future new supply additions .
The decline rate goes from positive values to negative values in just one year and is converging toward a low negative value in 6 - 8 years .
the decline rates for FI P + are not stationary for the first 6 - 8 years but then are reaching an asymptote .
the estimated decline rates for FIP - are relatively constant over the years .
The World production ( crude oil + condensate ) is almost flat since 2005 , however almost 6 mbpd of new supply from megaprojects have been added .
We tried to evaluate what is the implication for the underlying decline coming from the post -2005 resource base :
World production erosion is exponential with a linearly increasing decline rate between 2004 ( +4 % ) and 2007 ( - 4 % ) showing no sign of slowing down .
This accelerating decline is probably the effect of the FIP + group as we observed for the UK production .
The fact that the decline rates seem to be so high is probably a sign that the current world production levels are exceedingly reliyng on new megaprojects in order to maintain production .
If we assume that crude oil production will continue its slow decline started in 2005 ( Figure 11 ) , this implies that decline rates may reach a low around - 10 % / year around 2010 .
We have absolutely no information on the contribution coming from small projects ( probably thousands of them ? ) .
However , the fact that we have not removed this contribution should have produced more conservator decline rates .
no information on the contribution coming from small projects ( probably thousands of them ? ) .
However , the fact that we have not removed this contribution should have produced more decline rates .
The effect of high prices on demand and withheld production in particular from some OPEC producers may bias this analysis .
.
Megaproject forecasts are probably excessively pessimistic beyond 5 years simply because the information is not available yet ( what we call the horizon effect ) .

Fields in decline will follow an exponential decline with a constant rateHowever , fields that have not reached their peak production before will have a non stationary decline rate
The initial decline for thegroup the will be slower but will eventually converge toward the average decline rate of In the following , I 'll try to validate the above assumptions on the UK production database .
The UK is one of the only country in the world ( along with Norway ) that has a detailed public production dataset per field .
Therefore , the UK will be our benchmark that can help us partially validate the above model ( original idea from Euan ) .
Figure 1 shows an example of production erosion for .
However , this analysis is assuming that there is no contributions from small projects ( i.e.for ) .
Production erosion rates are initially positives and then drop rapidly within a few years toward a minimum decline rate .
In order to validate relations ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) , fields are split in two groups , and , according toor not they have reached their production peak before .
Observed average decline rates forappear to decline quickly from α=40 % toward negative values and remain nearly constant to a value close to - 15 % ( Figure 4 ) .
Decline rates forare remaining relatively constant around α= - 15 % .
Another interesting observation is that the production decline postcan be closely modeled by a logistic curve which parameters are estimated using the Hubbert Linearization on production prior to t .
On Figure 5 , we can see that there is a good correlation between the logistic model and the actual production erosion especially when < 1994 ( aconclusion could be also that the Hubbert Linearization is underestimating future supply additions as suggested by Euan ) .
The methodology is pretty much the same as the one Stuart employed at the difference that we performed a Monte - Carlo procedure which enable us to inject some degree of uncertainty on the megaproject numbers .
The estimated production erosion is shown on Figure 7 .
The estimated decline rates are linearly increasing over the observation period with an annual increase of 2.9 % per year .
Having observed on the UK that the logistic model seems to be a good model for forecasting future production erosion , I estimated the logistic model for the world production .
What 's intriguing is that the estimated production erosion ( in orange on Figure 9 ) the logistic curve in 2007 .
On Figure 9 , we are showing different decline scenarios :
If we look at the production plateau for crude oil from 2005 to 2007 , one can notice that the production profile is almost parallel to the logistic curve .
Based on this observation , I assumed that the current plateau will continue with a slight downward slope following the logistic decline ( see Figure 11 ) .
In that case , the production erosion rates are slowing down after 2007 and are reaching a bottom value around - 10 % in 2012 .
Since August 2005 , production from Saudi Arabia has declined by 1 mbpd and is now around 8.7 mbpd ( see Figure 12 ) .
The question of whether or not this decline is voluntary has been the center of intense debates on TOD .
Let 's assume that Saudi Arabia would have maintained production constant at 9.6 mbpd since August 2005 , the decline rates ( Figure 13 ) would have been slightly less important around - 3 % for 2007 as well as the acceleration ( - 2.5 % / year ) .
Rift Valley Purges

I have n’t been able to post for the last few days as I have been in the Rift Valley and internet towers were down in Nakuru , and there was no connection to be had in Naivasha either .
Violence erupted Thursday in Nakuru and has spread east to Naivasha and seems to be heading further on to Nairobi .
There are accounts of groups of people moving east across the country toward the capital , instigateing organized ethnic cleansing .
In Nakuru , countless died and were injured in clashes between the Kikuyus and Luos and Kalengins .
A new displaced persons camp was opened in the stadium for a group of Luos fleeing violence by the Mungiki sect .
Saturday afternoon nearly a thousand men , women and children were taken by the red cross to hide in the stadium after the Mungiki sect murdered 6 people the night before .
Police presence was heavy after the first day of fighting and things cooled down dramatically on Monday when people could be seen returning to work and shops opening up for business again .
The hospital on Friday evening , however , was a horror scene , with over 60 wounded mostly by machete , stoning and arrows .
Naivasha , a Kikuyu stronhold , was extremely difficult to manage and virtually impossible to photograph after Sunday ’s epic violent clashes wherein Kikuyus killed and wounded an unkown number of Luos , and sent those remaining running for their lives with their belongings in their hands the next day .
The security situation has prevented the press and aid agencies from ascertaining the magnitude of the death and injury count , and gangs continued to gather in the city center , setting up road blocks , and looting .
This morning when I left , there were many houses set aflame .
For the last three days , the Lake Naivasha Country Club hotel ’s front lawn has been a refugee camp for a group of Luo families who have not eaten anything since they arrived .
In the meantime , out front , a large gang of Kikuyus gathers around the clock with makeshift weapons , aiming to kill those Luos hiding inside .
It was terrifying to see such a thing and recalls harrowingly the scenes in the movie Hotel Rwanda .
Late last night I started to receive messages that leaflets had been dropped in the estates along the road from Naivasha to Nairobi , ordering all non-Kikuyus to leave immediately .
Sometime around 4 in the morning and ODM MP was assassinated in his home in Nairobi .
The situation is not looking good .
Below is a collection of pictures from the last few days in the rift valley .

When a star like our Sun dies , it ’ll end up as a white dwarf .
And if a star contains 1.4 times the mass of the Sun , it ’ll have enough gravity to turn into a neutron star .
Much bigger stars turn into black holes .
But now it turns out , neutron stars can be much more massive than astronomers previously believed – and making black holes might be much more difficult .
Astronomers working with the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico have increased the mass limit you need for a neutron star to turn into a black hole .
Paulo Freire , an astronomer from Arecibo presented his latest research at the Winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society , “ the matter at the center of a neutron star is highly incompressible .
Our new measurements of the mass of neutron stars will help nuclear physicists understand the properties of super - dense matter .
It also means that to form a black hole , more mass is needed than previously thought .
Thus , in our universe , black holes might be more rare and neutron stars slightly more abundant .
When these massive stars run out of fuel , they collapse down and then explode as a supernova .
The core of the star is instantly compressed into a neutron star ; an extreme object with a radius of roughly 10 to 16 km across and a density of billions of tonnes per cubic centimetre .
A neutron star acts like a single , giant atomic nucleus .
Astronomers used to think that neutron stars needed between 1.6 and 2.5 times the mass of the Sun to collapse – any bigger and you ’d get a neutron star .
But the new evidence from Arecibo pushes this limit up to 2.7 times the mass of the Sun .
Although that sounds like a slight amount , it can actually have a significant impact on the ratio of neutron stars to black holes in the Universe .
In fact , scientists do n’t fully understand how dense neutron stars can really be , and when they might actually switch over to become black holes , “ the matter at the center of neutron stars is the densest in the Universe .
It is one to two orders of magnitude denser than matter in the atomic nucleus .
It is so dense we do n’t know what it is made out of , ” said Freire .
“ For that reason , we have at present no idea of how larger or how massive neutron stars can be . ”

Sometimes , just to test my point of view , I like to take the opposite side and defend it .
For example , I think attacking Iraq was a huge mistake .
So today I will make my best argument for the other side .
First , you have to separate the outcome , which is unknown , from the original decision to attack .
Hypothetically , it could be a good decision to attack , based on what you knew at the time , but things could go wrong for unforeseen reasons .
Likewise , it could have been a bad decision to attack , based on the evidence at the time , and somehow by luck , things might turn out well .
So you have to look at the decision and the outcome separately .
For the outcome , I would argue no one can predict the fate of Iraq more than a few years out .
For situations this complex , the unintended and unpredictable consequences generally dwarf the predictable parts .
Lots of people have died in Iraq , and will continue to die .
We created a breeding ground for terrorists .
We took our eye off of the ball in terms of catching Bin Laden when we had the chance .
And it will cost a trillion dollars .
The costs are immense .
On the plus side , Iraqi Kurdistan is doing well , and might become the sixth largest source of oil reserves .
If they avoid war with Turkey , they could become a prosperous democracy regardless of what happens to the rest of Iraq .
Al - Qaida overplayed its hand in Iraq and proved it ’s not a war between the Christian crusaders and Islam .
Al - Qaida targeted Muslims and caused the U.S. and the locals to join forces against them .
That could turn out to be a good thing in terms of the battle for the hearts and minds of Muslims .
Iraq is Al - Qaida ’s flypaper .
They entered Iraq in large numbers , discredited their own movement by killing Muslims , and are now getting killed themselves .
They did what the United States could n’t do on its own , in making the U.S. occupation seem beneficial to the security of the locals .
Violence in Iraq is trending down .
No one thinks there is a smooth ride ahead , but it ’s obvious to all parties that continued violence is n’t going to make life better for anyone .
There ’s no “ winning ” to be had .
Now that the U.S. presence is improving security , and our forces are moving up the learning curve in figuring out how to be less hated and more useful , there ’s a legitimate chance that things could keep trending well .
The cost of the war in Iraq is immense .
But it has several potential benefits :
1. Al - Qaida showed itself to be everyone ’s enemy .
2. Iraq has potential to be a U.S. ally , even if true democracy does n’t take hold .
3 . The U.S. sharpened its war - making tools and showed it is willing to use them .
4. Iraqi oil production will eventually increase , even if it takes 20 years .
5 . The U.S. has a permanent military base in the Middle East .
On balance , are these benefits worth the costs ?
Probably not .
But all of the unintended consequences have n’t played out .
For example , in the long run , I ’d expect events in Iraq to have a big impact on Iranian politics .
Some of those changes could be good for U.S. interests .
What about the original decision to invade ?
If you believe the president KNEW Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction , it was clearly a bad decision .
I believe the president and his advisors believed we would find WMD .
After all , Saddam had a history of seeking WMD , a motive for doing so , and he resisted inspections .
If there is a tiny chance your sworn enemy is building nuclear weapons , and you have a nearly 100 % chance of stopping him , even at a very high cost , it seems sensible to do it .
It would be rational self defense to risk losing thousands of U.S. troops to reduce the perceived risk of nuclear attack on the U.S. by 1 % .
If you say you KNEW there were no WMD in Iraq , you ’re either a liar or an idiot .
It was unknowable .
If you thought there was a 1 % chance Saddam was building WMD that could get into terrorist hands , then the decision to attack Iraq was rational for American self defense , even if the outcome turns out bad .
From a moral perspective , the huge Iraqi losses have to be included in the calculation .
Morally , you would n’t want to kill a thousand people in a different country to protect one person in your own .
But from a national defense perspective , which is the responsibility of the president of the United States , he has to count American lives as more valuable than other lives .
That might seem evil , but that ’s the job we hired him for .
All things considered , the DECISION to attack Iraq was correct , given the perceived risk of Saddam developing WMD .
Likewise , the decision NOT to attack North Korea is rational because doing so would increase the odds of a nuclear attack on the U.S. and its allies , not decrease it .
They already have functional nukes and a much tougher army .
When a venture capitalist invests in a particular company , and it goes out of business , he does n’t conclude that he made a bad decision to invest .
He concludes that his strategy is good because he only needs one in ten companies to succeed .
Likewise , you ca n’t view the decision to attack Iraq in isolation .
It is part of a larger hard - ass policy of attacking anyone who looks like they can be conquered at an acceptable cost and might pose catastrophic risks to our security .
To pick an obvious example , if we attacked Iran , and discovered they ARE building a nuclear weapon and planning to use it , that would validate the strategy of attacking Iraq .
One out of two ai n’t bad .
In fact , if we attacked three or four countries looking for WMD , and found none , it still does n’t invalidate the strategy .
You only need to find one country that actually has them , and might use them , to make the entire strategy sensible .
At the very least , all that attacking gives some teeth to the U.N. inspectors .
That ’s my best argument for why attacking Iraq was both sensible at the time and might work out well in the long run .
I just wish I believed it .
With all the people out there willing to offer help on Linux , getting started should be pretty easy .
But with many options in introductory books and easy - to - install distributions , choosing a place to start can be the hard part .
Where to Find Support
Picking a distribution gets a lot less challenging when you remember to choose based on where you plan to go for help .
Your local user group mailing list will be a lot more useful when other members know the locations and utilities you 're talking about .
Just subscribe to your local user group mailing list , and lurk for a while to find out what distribution the most helpful people there use .
Then pick up a copy of a good Linux book , burn an install CD , and jump in .
There is lots of useful online documentation for specific tasks .
But so far , books offer the best introductions to basic concepts such as file permissions or working with the shell .
And looking for the distribution 's name in the title of your first Linux book can be a time and frustration saver for new users .
Instead of telling you to do things this way on one distribution , that way on another , or worse , telling you to find things for yourself , a book that concentrates on one distribution can point you straight to the file , tool or feature you need .
Lately , though , there 's been a catch .
The most helpful introductory books for beginners , Mark G. Sobell 's " Practical Guide ... " series , cover Red Hat Linux and its descendants Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux , but many of the participants in user groups and mailing lists that offer the best help for new users are running Ubuntu .
Sobell 's new " A Practical Guide to Ubuntu Linux " closes the gap .
Ubuntu's Advantages
Part of Ubuntu 's popularity among user group members is because it nails down and documents many of the best system adminstration practices .
For example , many administrators recommend that you never log in as root .
Just log in as yourself , and use a properly configured sudo to run individual commands as root when needed .
Ubuntu actually disables the root account , and forces you to use sudo .
A new user who installs Ubuntu and does things the Ubuntu way will find himself or herself acting in many ways like a cautious , experienced sysadmin without realizing it .
Now , in A Practical Guide to Ubuntu Linux , you can get a thorough Linux intro book that works the Ubuntu way , while still drawing on the author 's long experience with old - school Unix and older Linux environments to cover the basics that have n't changed .
Warning :
This beautiful ballet of chemical reactions could make you trade your lava lamp for a magnetic stirrer .
When several clear liquids are combined , the mixture quickly changes colors — back and forth — over and over again .
Like Mitt Romney speaking on social issues , the undulating brew just ca n’t make up its mind .
In 1973 , the spectacular demonstration was perfected by Thomas Briggs and Warren Rauscher , two amazing high school science teachers .
Over thirty - five years later , chemists are still trying to fully understand how it works .
What they do know : Several reactions take place at once .
One of them produces iodine , which gives the amber color .
Hydrogen peroxide reduces other chemicals into iodide ions .
Along with normal iodine , the charged particles interact with starch to create it a blue - black color .
The speeds of those transformations are constantly changing .
As one overtakes the other , the color suddenly changes .

Bowing to pressure from consumer advocates , Pennsylvania officials have dropped plans to bar farmers from revealing whether or not milk hails from hormone - enhanced cows .
The state 's agriculture department on Thursday issued new guidelines that allow dairies to label milk so that customers know if it was produced from cows pumped with recombinant bovine growth hormone ( rBGH ) also known as recombinant bovine somatotropin ( rBST ) .
The move comes less than two weeks before a February 1 ban was set to take effect that would have barred dairies in the Keystone State from slapping certain labels on milk products , including " from cows not treated with growth hormone rBST '' and " free of artificial growth hormones . "
'' This is a victory for free speech , free markets , sustainable farming and the consumer 's right to know , " Michael Hansen , a senior scientist with the Consumers Union ( CU ) , said about the state 's about - face .
" Consumers increasingly want to know more about how their food is produced and , particularly , whether it is produced in a natural and sustainable manner .
There is no justification for prohibiting information about rBGH use on a milk label . ''
He added that the state should be applauded for " realizing that its initial regulation prohibiting such labeling was flawed and for reversing its position . ''
The fabricated hormone , marketed by agricultural giant Monsanto , is a synthetic version of a natural one found in cows and is designed to boost their milk output by a gallon or more daily .
Consumers in recent years have increasingly gone organic , seeking brands of milk from dairies that nix artificial hormones .
According to Consumers Union , use of the faux growth agent has been declining in recent years , dipping from 22.3 percent of all U.S. dairy cows in 2002 to 17.2 percent last year .
The Food and Drug Administration has ruled that the synthetic hormone is safe , but not all experts agree .
The CU and other health advocates in this country and abroad are wary of its potential effects on humans , and its use is prohibited in Canada and the European Union .
Many farmers in Pennsylvania and other states have vowed not to use rBGH in their milk products , a claim which in some cases fetches higher prices .
The new rules will allow them to continue advertising their fare as free of artificial hormones , but requires them to document their claims -- a safeguard applauded by consumer advocates .
( Dairies are barred from labeling milk as containing no growth hormones , because cows produce some naturally . )
Consumers Union , the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports , was among a coalition of some 65 organizations that sent a letter to Pennsylvania Gov. Edward Rendell protesting the proposed label ban .
In a statement released Thursday , he said " The public has a right to complete information about how the milk they buy is produced . "
The coalition is currently fighting similar bans that are being mulled by other states , including Washington State , Missouri and Ohio .
This was widely expected to be an excellent year , after an already good year in 2006 , when more than 2,500MW were installed in the US .
hopes were that 3,000 , or even 3,500MW would be installed in 2007 .
With more than 5,000 MW built and connected to the grid , the record for any country is shattered ( the previous one was Germany with 3244 MW in 2002 ) .
And 2008 is looking good too .
As the AWEA notes , wind power has several advantages :
Helps protect consumers from increases in electricity costs due to volatile fuel prices and supply disruptions : by reducing the use of natural gas and other fuels used for electricity generation , and lowering the pressure on their price , wind can save consumers money , even in regions with low or no wind resources .
Wind power prices are quite simple : there is no fuel cost , just a little bit of maintenance , so each additional kWh of power provided when wind blows is almost free once the turbines are installed .
Which means that the only cost is the amortization ( or financing ) of the initial construction .
And the good news is that this cost is set in stone from the start , and will not change for the next 20 years : you know how much interest and principal you need to pay , and that 's it .
Compared to gas - fired plants or even coal - fired plants , whose main cost is that of the fuel , it 's becoming a huge advantage , and an incredibly safe bet .
Even better , as the AWEA notes , each time wind blows , power with zero marginal cost is sent into the network ; with electricity market prices set at the highest marginal cost needed to satisfy demand at any given moment , the more ultra cheap power you have , the lower that market price will be , as there is less need to tap the more expensive producers ( like diesel plants or gas peaking plants ) .
That reduces the price of electricity for everybody .
The Economist noted that studies in Denmark have shown that the savings to electricity consumers thanks to that effect are now larger in that country than the cost of subsidizing wind power production - which means that this is exactly the kind of things that governments should do , ie bear an expense that creates a larger gain for the overall population .
Today , wind power , while still more expensive than existing coal and nuclear plants , is cheaper than gas - fired power and , thus , most of the time , cheaper than market prices which are driven by gas prices .
The trouble is that investors are not yet convinced that this will be true for the full next 15 years , and are still reluctant to some extent to support wind construction without some form of support .
In the US , that support takes the form of the PTC , or production tax credit , which allows investors to deduct , for ten years , an amount equal to 2cents / kWh from their tax bills , which can thus be added to their income coming from the wind project .
The PTC is pretty low compared to European support mechanisms , but given that the US has a generally better wind resource , it 's been more than enough to support the industry .
The problem is that it is a temporary mechanism which is only extended for a year of two by Congress each time it lapses , causing huge uncertainty .
In fact , several times in the past few years , it was not renewed in time and killed the industry for that year , creating havoc for the industry worldwide ( some manufacturers almost went bankrupt ) .
Oddly enough , the problem with PTC is not that it 's unpopular in Congress , but the opposite : that it 's hugely popular .
That means that any law that includes it is likely to be supported by a strong majority , and then gets larded with more disputable - and disputed - items , which are then opposed .
The PTC gets taken hostage , effectively ...
Crazy , but true .
Reduces global warming emissions :
To generate the same amount of electricity using the average U.S. power plant fuel mix would cause over 28 million tons of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to be emitted annually .
This is pretty obvious too .
Each kWh of wind is carbon - free , and reduces the need for the same kWh to be generated by a hydrocarbon - burning plant .
Some contest that effect by saying that wind power is intermittent , and thus unreliable , and requires fuel - burning plants as back - up for times when there is demand for power but no wind .
What is true is that wind power cannot eliminate the need for coal - fired and gas - fired plants , but it does eliminate the need for these plants to actually burn fuel : having these plants around , but functioning at a lower capacity is a net plus for carbon emissions .
A lot of gas - fired plants are designed not to be used for permanent use ( gas peaking plants can be profitable even though they function less than 5 % of the time ) , so this is technically feasible and imposes minor costs - and it DOES reduce emissions ( for a discussion of a more detailed study , see this diary : No technical limitation to wind power penetration ) .
The problem today is certainly not that of too much wind in the system , it is that , despite recent growth , wind investment is still dwarfed by investment in the traditional power sector , as this table from the US Energy Information Agency shows :
Just under double the capacity in gas - fired plants was built than in wind .
And , with wind power 's lower capacity factor ( 30 % for wind , which means that a wind power will produce , on average over the year , only 30 % of its maximum potential capacity , as opposed to 70 - 90 % for gas ) that means that capacity additions in 2007 still translate in 5 times more kWh coming from gas than from wind just for the new capacity .
The problem is that gas is no longer plentiful : production in North America ( ie US and Canada ) is declining , which means increasing LNG imports - a sector where there is heavy competition from other markets :
Even if there is enough gas , the massive requirement to invest in the LNG infrastructure , and likely bidding wars with European buyers , are going to keep gas prices high - and thus power prices .
Conserves precious water resources :
Wind farms do n't need water for steam or for cooling , a benefit that is increasingly valuable in arid areas and in times of drought .
This is a less obvious argument , but a vital one in many areas , as steam - based power plants ( which also includes nuclear ones , in that instance ) require access to plenty of water to function .
So , some may ask , why subsidize wind power if it's so great and so damn economic already ?
As I noted above , its competitivity in the short term has not yet convinced investors that this will be the case over the next 15 years , the usual duration to finance the investments .
The good part of having fixed production costs is that they cannot go up ; but the downside , of course , is that they cannot go down which means that , should there be any period of lower gas prices , wind power plants would not be able to repay their debt during that period - and banks absolutely hate payment defaults , even temporary .
The risk is low , but enough to give cold feet to lenders without some additional revenue source , and the lack of financing makes projects much less attractive for investors .
Also , wind is almost competitive despite the massive subsidies received by its competitors ( all the tax breaks received by the oil&gas industry , no accounting for pollution and carbon emissions , etc ... ) , and the PTC only levels the playing field to some extent .
But there are other reasons why more support for the industry would be worthwhile , even given prevailing price conditions :
wind power creates a lot more jobs per kWh produced than all other technologies .
Good manufacturing jobs , good construction jobs , and long term maintenance jobs .
Even better , apart from the manufacturing ones , these jobs are not offshoreable , and are usually located in the communities near thewind farms , often providing a much needed boost to areas with otherwise few prospects ;
wind power does not require the control of the Persian Gulf by US Navy aircraft carriers nor grunts in Iraq ;
wind power is local , is plentiful , and will not be depleted ;
Some will say that wind farms are ugly .
I do n't have an argument against that , but would suggest that there is enough space for wind power projects without needing to put them in the most spectacular spots .
And as a final note about my partiality here : as a financier for the industry , I have to make sure that we do not take inappropriate risks .
In particular , that means making sure that performance claims are not inflated , that costs are as announced and , a very important thing , that each project is well accepted by the local community and that there is no hostility ( as this can lead to judicial procedures , delays , and bad publicity , all things which cost money and can compromise debt repayment ) .
So bankers - when they do their job - have to remain clear - eyed about the industries they work with ...
Iran yesterday confirmed that Russia had agreed to deliver the S - 300 air defence system , a move that is likely to irk the Bush administration and gives further proof of Russia and Iran 's deepening strategic partnership .
Iran 's defence minister , Mostafa Mohammad Najjar , told Iranian TV that the deal had been agreed under a previous " contract " .
He did not say when the system would be shipped to Iran .
Russian defence experts yesterday acknowledged that the missile system , originally designed in the 1970s , would significantly enhance Iran 's ability to shoot down enemy aircraft .
The S -300 had a range far superior to that of the US Patriot system , experts said .
It could also shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles , they added .
" It 's a formidable system .
It really gives a new dimension to Iran 's anti-aircraft defences , " said one Russian defence expert , who declined to be named .
" It 's purely a defensive system .
But it 's very effective .
It 's much better than the US system .
It has good radar .
It can shoot down low - flying cruise missiles , though with some difficulty . "
The sale follows Russian president Vladimir Putin 's visit to Iran in October to attend a meeting of Caspian Sea nations , the first trip by a Russian head of state to Tehran since Stalin attended a 1943 summit with Churchill and Roosevelt .
Putin has made clear his opposition to the US hardline stance on Iran , and has defended Iran 's right to pursue a peaceful nuclear programme .
He has also repeatedly derided the Bush administration 's plans to build a missile defence system in Europe to counter a potential nuclear missile fired by Iran or North Korea .
Yesterday Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , repeated the Kremlin 's contention that the Pentagon 's defence shield was aimed at " deterring " Russia , and not at a " hypothetical threat " from Iran .
Lavrov also alleged that the US administration was working to overthrow the Iranian regime .
" I think this is a concurrent goal , " he said .
" If our American partners pursue the aim of regime change ... this would be an alteration of policies and we would oppose it . "
Earlier this month , Russia delivered the first 80 - tonne shipment of fuel to Iran 's Bushehr power station , which Russian engineers are controversially building under a $ 1bn ( £ 504 m ) contract .
Russia has been Iran 's main weapons supplier for several decades .
Earlier this year Russia delivered 29 Tor -M1 defence missile systems to Iran under a $ 700 m contract signed in December 2005 .
Russian officials would not comment on the Iranian statement , but defence sources told the Interfax news agency that a contract for the missiles ' delivery had been signed several years ago .
They envisaged the delivery of several dozen S -300 missile systems , they added .
The S -300 is much more powerful and versatile than the Tor - M1 .
The S -300 is capable of shooting down aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic missile warheads at ranges of nearly 100 miles , and at altitudes of up to 90,000 feet .
Rumours about the sale of S - 300 missile systems to Iran have circulated for a long time , but Russian officials had consistently denied it .
On Tuesday , Russia 's military successfully test - fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads - a weapon intended to replace ageing Soviet - era missiles , Associated Press reported .
The RS - 24 missile was launched from the Plesetsk facility in northern Russia , and its test warheads hit targets on the Kura testing range on the Kamchatka peninsula , some 4,340 miles east , strategic missile forces spokesman Alexander Vovk told AP .
Tyler Cowen reports :
Marginal Revolution : Four new economics journals : The [ American Economic ]
Association will publish four new quarterly refereed journals starting in 2009 that , together , cover the fields of economics ...
AEJ : Macroeconomics : macroeconomics ; monetary economics ; international finance ; aggregate aspects of development ; economic growth ; finance ; and comparative economic systems .
Editor : Olivier Blanchard .
AEJ : Microeconomics : microeconomic theory ; corporate finance ; industrial organization ; micro theory aspects of economic development ; and micro aspects of international economics .
Editor : Andrew Postlewaite .
AEJ : Economic Policy : public economics ; urban and regional economics ; public policy aspects of health , education , and welfare ; law and economics ; economic regulation ; and environmental and natural resource economics .
Editor : Esther Duflo .
AEJ : Applied Economics : labor ; demography ; empirical micro development ; and health , education , and welfare economics .
Editor : Alan Auerbach .
Then I think Tyler becomes confused :
Overall I consider this bad news .
It expands the career - making power of one professional association and the editors it nominates .
It further encourages overspecialization , and discourages general interest research .
It discourages research in the area of whichever journal becomes the weak sister of the four .
It makes it harder for an individual piece to stand out as important .
By the time these journals hit the street , it is unlikely that their paper versions will play much of a role at all in deciding what people read -- big screens will be too big with too many pixels and printers too fast .
What these journals will do is guarantee that Olivier , Andrew , Esther , or Alan is sitting on top of a refereeing process that finds that these papers are interesting .
How valuable this signal is depends on how good the editors are at managing referees and how good the editors ' tastes are .
Certainly AEJ : Macroeconomics and AEJ : Applied Economics will significantly add to my utility .
( I do n't know Andrew Poslewaite at all , and so do n't know how good his taste is , and I have no idea how good a manager Esther will turn out to be . )
Tyler muses further :
The real issue is why articles should be bundled into journals at all ...
It used to be a combination of limited economies of scale in distribution and a filtering - signalling mechanism .
Now it 's overwhelmingly the filtering - signalling mechanism .
[ Ed : Our First Amendment rights of expression are heading toward being completely suppressed .

Police break up anti-war meeting in Washington
Mounted police charged in to break up an outdoor press conference and demonstration against the Iraq war in Washington on Thursday , arresting three people , organizers and an AFP reporter said .
“ The police suppressed the press conference .
In the middle of the speeches , they grabbed the podium ” erected in a park in front of the White House for the small gathering , Brian Becker , national organizer of the ANSWER anti-war coalition , told AFP .
“ Then , mounted police charged the media present to disperse them , ” Becker said .
The charge caused a peaceful crowd of some 20 journalists and four or five protestors to scatter in terror , an AFP correspondent at the event in Lafayette Square said .
No one appeared to have been hurt .
Three people — Tina Richards , the mother of a marine who did two tours of duty in Iraq ; Adam Kokesh , a leader of the Iraq Veterans Against the War group ; and lawyer Ian Thompson , who is an organizer for ANSWER in Los Angeles — were arrested , Becker said .
The ANSWER coalition is trying to rally support for an anti-war demonstration in Washington that is due to take place on September 15 .
Last month , the movement was threatened with a fine of at least 10,000 dollars unless it removed posters in the city announcing the September 15 march .
Washington city authorities have said the posters had to come down because they were stuck on with adhesive that did not meet city regulations .
“ At our demonstration today we were showing the media that the paste we use conforms to the rules , ” Becker said .
“ One of our activists was making a speech when the police barged in and grabbed the podium .
At that point , Tina Richards started to put up a poster , so they arrested her and two others . ”
“ This strategy of suppression has not worked .
We expect many tens of thousands of people ” in Washington for the September 15 anti-war demonstration , he said .
The march has been timed to coincide with the release of a report by the US military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and will be part of a week of protests led by veterans of the Iraq war .
A petition calling for the impeachment of President George W. Bush , allegedly carrying one million signatures and endorsed by former US attorney general Ramsey Clark , will also be submitted to officials during the week ’s activities , ANSWER has told AFP .
( Original Article )
Choosing the best car from among the scores of new models introduced each year is invariably dicey because there are always people who say you got it wrong .
But that does n't stop the motopress from doing it at about this time each year , and for the first time , we 'll join them .
We did n't see any big trends that took the auto industry in a new direction this year , but a renewed focus on diesel engines and smaller cars , particularly in Europe and Japan , suggests the industry finally realizes it must produce cleaner , more fuel - efficient vehicles .
If this was the year the auto industry woke up to that fact , 2008 will be the year it gets out of bed and does something about it .
The industry is on the cusp of great change .
Sales are falling in America and Europe .
Rising fuel prices have consumers favoring thriftier cars .
American and European policymakers are poised to significantly tighten fuel economy and emissions standards .
It 's not at all clear how this will shake out , and the major automakers are scrambling to find their way .
And so it is that a survey of the cars various magazines and juries named the best of the year reflects the transition we 're seeing in the industry , and explains how cars as different as the Audi R8 super car and Fiat 500 micro car both can be considered the best of the year .
Before we name our pick for the best car of the year , we 'll take a quick look at what others are saying .
Motor Trend gave the nod to the Cadillac CTS , calling it the " star of a new GM revival . "
The editors of Playboy - not exactly known as a bellwether of auto trends , but we 'll mention it anyway - also liked the Caddy but gave top honors to the Audi R8 .
Britain 's Evo , a magazine that stresses performance above all else , said the Porsche 911 GT3 RS is number one .
( We agree the ' 3 is a sweet car , but we think the 911 GT2 , a 600 - horsepower bare - knuckle brawler that is not for the weak or the stupid , remains the best 911 ever . )
Car and Driver offered up a laundry list of cars as its " 10 Best " .
With cars ranging from the Honda Fit to the Porsche Cayman and Boxster , it 's got something for everyone .
These are all fine cars , particularly the R8 - which is n't as good as you 've heard , it 's better .
They 're exhilarating .
They 're technologically advanced .
And they represent some of the best work their respective manufacturers have done in years .
But they do n't lead the auto industry into the future .
We 're not suggesting automakers stop building insanely fast cars like the 911 GT3 RS or luxurious performance sedans like the CTS .
But they need to begin expending at least as much effort producing cars at the other end of the spectrum - cars an increasing number of consumers want .
Subcompacts are the fastest growing market segment in the United States , and , with hybrids , clean diesels and electrics , the only ones sure to meet the tougher fuel economy and emissions regulations the automakers know are coming .
That 's why its refreshing to see the " car of the year " choices by juries of auto industry journalists , insiders and engineers .
They were unanimous in selecting small , clean and efficient cars .
A panel of 58 jurors from 22 countries named the Fiat 500 the European car of the year .
Sixty jurors in Japan selected the Honda Fit .
The Automotive Researchers and Journalists Conference of Japan chose the Mazda Demio , also called the Mazda2 .
It 's too bad only the Fit is available in North America .
And so in keeping with that theme , we offer our choices for the car of the year .
The runner up : the Fiat 500 .
Perhaps no car better sums up the smaller , cheaper , more efficient ethos than this update of the iconic Cinquecento .
It 's fun , it 's reasonably quick ( it 's a safe bet it wo n't be long before Abarth makes it quicker ) and no car , including the Mini , so perfectly pays homage to the past while looking to the future .
Car Magazine named it car of the year - over the Rolls Royce Phantom DHC , Audi R8 and BMW M3 , among others - and said it is a car " every right - thinking enthusiast ought to be encouraging at this time . "
We could n't agree more .
The 500 is n't available in America ; if it were , it almost certainly would be our car of the year .
We 're big supporters of alternative fuels and hybrid drivetrains , but we also realize the gasoline - fueled internal combustion engine will be around for a long time to come .
We 'd like to see more of them in cars like the 500 .
And Autopia 's 2007 Car of the Year is ...
The Tesla Roadster .
Yes , it 's got a price tag approaching six figures .
Yes , the first run is sold out .
And yes , the it's been in the pipeline for more than two years , so strictly speaking it is n't really " new . "
But this was the year the Tesla finally hit the road - the company is letting journalists test drive it this month - so we 're including it .
The Tesla is our pick for two reasons .
First , it 's easily the coolest alternative fuel vehicle ever made , one that proves electric cars can be every bit as breathtaking as the finest fossil - fuel guzzling super cars .
Granted , the TZero and Venturi Fetish are in the same vein , but they have n't had the impact - or the hype - of the Tesla .
But more importantly , the Tesla best represents the direction the auto industry must go .
Too many automakers have churned out the same old cars year after year , growing fat and lazy on the profit margins offered by SUVs and pickup trucks .
That wo n't work anymore , and they know it .
It 's time for new thinking and new ideas .
It 's time for innovation .
The Tesla has those things in spades , and there 's a reason Silicon Valley is emerging as a leader in electric vehicle technology .
And so because of what it is and because of what it represents , the Tesla Roadster is the Autopia car of the year .
Tell us what you think ...
A simple consideration of the energy content of a barrel of crude oil can show us what a tremendous bargain it is even at current near - record prices .
We take this bargain for granted , and at least in the U.S. , most consider the benefits of oil a birthright .
We should at least pause and consider the following :
A barrel of crude oil contains 5,930,226,101 joules of energy .
A joule is one watt for one second .
Therefore , this would be enough energy to light a hundred watt light bulb 24 hours a day for nearly two years ( 686 days ) .
The maximum sustained output of a human being doing heavy manual labor is also about a hundred watts .
But we do n’t work 24/7 , and we do n’t work on weekends .
At 8 hours a day , it would take a human 2059 work days to expend as much energy as is contained in one barrel of oil !
This does n’t count the work it would take to produce the prodigious quantities of food such a person would eat–but let ’s ignore that for now .
The treadle pump above , for example , used in countries where oil - fired pumps are not affordable , probably requires the expenditure of even less than 100 watts of human energy .
To get some perspective , consider that a person works 48 weeks per year .
This allows for 2 weeks vacation , and 10 sick / personal days .
This is a total of 240 work days per year .
At this rate , it would take a human being 8.6 years of backbreaking labor to equal ONE BARREL OF OIL !
This is absolutely shocking .
It seems counterintuitive .
Do the math yourself and you will never think about energy the same way again .
Now the hard manual labor we are talking about could only be accomplished by the young and able - bodied .
And it would be hard to argue that a person could keep up this kind of output for very long .
Under the best of circumstances , a person might last 25 years .
This is the energy equivalent of 3 barrels of oil .
So in human energy terms , a very fit person ’s life is worth 3 barrels of oil .
OK , I admit that this is a bit of a stretch , since we are worth a lot more than our manual labor ( Karl Marx might disagree ) .
But let ’s look at this in terms of wages , to see what the energy in a barrel of oil would cost if provided by human labor .
This might give some perspective on history , when much of the work was done by slaves .
Let ’s start by assuming a slave wage of –say – 11 cents an hour .
Last time I checked , this is what prisoners in the U.S. are paid for prison work .
At this rate , the cost of a barrel of oil is $ 1,812 .
If that seems way out of line , consider that in today ’s dollars , the cost of a barrel of whale oil ( the world ’s last widely - used pre-petroleum liquid energy source ) at its peak price was $ 924 .
This is taken as $ 22 * 42 gallons .
But wait .
This is prison labor .
If you priced oil at its labor equivalent at the U.S. minimum wage of $ 5.15 an hour , you get a whopping $ 84,830 per barrel !
Let ’s assume for a minute that the conversion of crude to gasoline is an equal ratio ( it ’s not , there is energy loss in the process ) .
At prison wages , a gallon of gas would cost $ 43 .
At the minimum wage , a gallon of gas would cost $ 2,019 .
Something to think about the next time you fill your tank with dirt cheap $ 3 a gallon gasoline .
Tim Rutten , writing for the LA Times made several interesting observations regarding talk radio , MoveOn.org , and the way congress has responded to commentary coming from each .
[ T ]he House and Senate censured the liberal activist group MoveOn.org for taking out a newspaper advertisement that characterized Gen. David H. Petraeus , the U.S. military commander in Iraq , as “ General Betray Us . ”
Now congressional Democrats are seeking a similar expression of disapproval for radio talk - show host Rush Limbaugh , who they allege insulted servicemen and women opposed to the Iraq war by calling them “ phony soldiers . ”
( Limbaugh has a baroque explanation of what he actually meant by those words , but you probably have to be a regular listener to his show to follow it . )
There ’s a temptation to dismiss all this as hollow foolishness — like most of the things Congress does with ease .
Beyond all this preposterous posturing , though , there are a couple of things worth considering because both really do involve free speech and your right to hear it .
Now , the MoveOn.org ad was patently offensive , a particularly unconscionable slur on any honorable American in uniform , let alone a guy who commanded the 101st Airborne .
It was , however , rejected out of hand as an expression of loony narrow - mindedness by most Americans who oppose the war .
Nobody , in other words , needed a congressional coalition — not even a bipartisan one — to instruct them on how to think .
Similarly , it ’s possible that the Democratic leadership is sufficiently clueless not to have noticed until now that Limbaugh regularly goes on the air and says cruel and offensive things about people of all sorts .
Most Americans with a pulse , however , are abundantly clear on the fact that Rush talks a pretty mean game .
To this point , I agree with Mr. Rutten .
It should be beneath congress to spend time passing useless resolutions condemning private citizens or groups for expressing opinions that some congressmen disagree with .
Outrageous and crazy things are printed , spoken , and blogged on a daily basis .
Should congress pass resolutions for each and every one of these statements ?
Of course not .
They work for us and they have a job to do .
But unfortunately for those of us who value our First Amendment rights , there are certain politicians who wish to do more than pass resolutions condemning speech they disagree with by bringing back the so - called “ fairness doctrine . ”
ASK most Americans what the Fairness Doctrine is and they ’ll correctly tell you it ’s a regulation that requires broadcasters to air both sides of an issue .
Tell them that it has n’t been enforced since 1987 , when the Federal Communications Commission essentially deregulated broadcasting and abolished the doctrine , and they ’ll look at you like you ’re nuts .
That is , however , the situation , and much that is of current consequence flows from it — including the existence of contemporary talk radio of which Limbaugh is the avatar .
In America today , talk radio is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican Party ’s conservative wing .
GOP partisans will argue that ’s because deregulation subjected radio to the discipline of the marketplace , and , when that market expressed itself through ratings , it stated an overwhelming preference for conservative talk - show hosts .
That ’s a good , Reagan Era argument , but Democrats and their allies see different forces at work .
They point to the fact that deregulation freed big corporations to acquire hundreds of radio stations at about the same time that satellite transmission made syndicated radio programming decisively cheaper than locally produced shows .
It was an easy call for the corporate station managers , who quickly filled their airtime with cheap , syndicated programming .
Most of the first wave of syndicated programming was talk by conservative commentators , who ’d long been shut out — or felt they were shut out — of mainstream media .
Talk radio is “ owned ” by the G.O.P.?
Ridiculous !
Yes , it ’s true that the vast majority of talk show hosts are conservative but so what ?
The reason why conservative talk has been successful is because there is a market for conservative views .
The prevailing theory seems to be that conservative talk is successful because it is one of the few places where the alternative views ( alternative to the left wing MSM ) are expressed .
This could explain why conservative talk has succeeded where progressive talk has failed .
The fact that a few large media corporations own most of the radio stations is irrelevant ( clearly , Rutten also believes that antitrust laws are legitimate ) .
If there was a stronger market for progressive views , these large media corporations would not hesitate to drop the conservatives in favor of progressives .
The radio industry ’s master is the bottom line , not the G.O.P. or anyone else for that matter .
If the FCC were to reimpose the Fairness Doctrine , talk radio would no longer be a part of the GOP base .
That ’s why Democratic senators like California ’s Dianne Feinstein and Illinois ’ Richard J. Durbin have been talking about prodding the agency into doing that since last spring .
It ’s also why , late Monday , 200 Republican representatives notified the House Rules Committee that they intended to seek a “ petition of discharge ” for the “ Broadcaster Freedom Act . ”
That bill , written by Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) , a former radio talk - show host , would prohibit the FCC from ever reimposing the Fairness Doctrine .
Under the House rules , if Pence can get 218 signatories to the petition , the Democratic leadership must let it come to the floor for a vote .
That ’s what ’s really at stake in all the posturing over MoveOn .org and Rush Limbaugh .
In the minds of both parties , it ’s not so much a fight over speech as it is over the right kind of speech .
The sad irony is that the only voice that is n’t being heard in all this talk over talk is that of the public , which , after all , owns the airwaves over which this struggle is being waged .
For the sake of argument , let ’s say that Rutten is right : talk radio is “ owned ” by the G.O.P. base .
Again , I have to say : so what ?
Rutten major common error in this piece is this notion that the public “ owns the airwaves ” ( except for the illegitimate use of taxpayer money to fund both NPR and PBS ) .
The entire argument for government imposed regulations on broadcasting rests on this notion that the airwaves are owned by everyone .
If the airwaves are owned by everyone , then that also means that the airwaves are owned by no one .
If the airwaves are owned by no one , then the government assumes that the government rightly fills that vacuum to own the airwaves .
But the public does not own the airwaves ; the people who pay the money to transmit their programming do .
The way I see ownership of the airwaves should be similar to ownership of any other kind of property : a radio station owner determines the frequency s/he wants to use and s/he registers the frequency with the county so no other station can use his or her frequency .
In the real world , it ’s a little more complicated than that but the fact remains that radio station owners pay for their programming from advertisers and donations ( donations are more common for religious programming ) NOT public funds .
If the G.O.P. base truly has spent the money to keep these shows on the air , I say more power to them .
What would stop the DNC from doing the same ?
If we buy into this myth of the public airwaves , we do so at our own peril .
If the FCC can demand that talk shows give equal time for all issues ( assuming that is even possible ) , what is to stop congress from setting up similar unelected bodies to impose similar regulations on newspapers , magazines , and blogs ?
Newspapers are delivered on public roads , magazines are delivered through the U.S. mail , and the internet is transmitted over utility lines which are often also regulated by the government !
I agree with Mr. Rutten that the voice of the public is not well represented on the radio but what are we willing to sacrifice in the name of fairness ?
Despite my frustration with the MSM and talk radio , we live in a time where we have so many other options to express our views and listen to unconventional views of others .
We now have the internet which gives us access to videos , podcasts , and blogs .
The government should be the last place for us to deem the ultimate arbiter of fairness .

Speaking of Reg Braithwaite , in this post he touches on team size and productivity .
There are so many gems there , I could comment on just about every sentence , but I think this is my favorite :
If we know that bug per line of code remains amazingly constant , why do we try to scale code out in verbosity rather than up in abstraction ?
I ’ve very often wondered the same thing .
When I ’ve given talks about dynamic languages and productivity , I ’ve sometimes brought up the “ bugs per line of code ” constant .
With dynamic languages , I generally write far fewer lines to solve the problem than I would in Java or C ++.
While that alone does n’t guarantee correctness , of course , in my experience it sure seems to lead to solutions that are completed faster and with fewer bugs .
Yet in those presentations , I ’ve always gotten pushback on that idea from someone in the audience , typically based on the “ static typing will save you ” argument , which I ’ve never fully understood despite having written , read , and fixed tons and tons of statically - typed code over the course of my career .
First , the notion that you ’re generally likely to have more bugs if you have more lines of code just seems like common sense , since there are just more chances to be wrong .
Second , static typing does nothing to help ensure that you ’re applying suitable algorithms and are correctly solving the problem , yet that ’s where the bugs tend to be .
But it goes beyond bug counts — sometimes it even comes down to getting a solution vs. not getting one at all .
The fact that you can quickly visualize and produce a solution in Python or Ruby , for example , means you ’re a lot more willing to actually sit down and crank out that solution in just a few days , rather than agree to take on a multi - month multi-person task to try to drive that nail with a Java or C++ hammer .
Not to abuse another cliché , but I truly have been there and done that , believe me .
Postings like these often seem to attract comments of the form , “ Well , dynamic languages are just too dangerous ; we have several hundred programmers and we can’t watch everything that every one of them does . ”
I think that ’s precisely Reg ’s point !
But this also gets to another related issue , which is that if you build teams that you ca n’t or wo n’t trust , you ’re simply creating a self - fulfilling prophecy .
You ’re essentially expecting your teams to fail , so they will .
In that type of environment , you ’re just not going to be able to attract or keep anyone that you actually can trust .
Furthermore , if you ’re that type of manager or leader , not only is the likelihood that you ’ll be able to scale your organization quite low , but you have nobody but yourself to blame for the eventual failures you ’re sure to encounter .
Issues related to dynamic languages and static typing are the least of your worries .
Rather than tying your developers ’ hands , it ’s far better to devote continual effort to instilling common values and culture across the organization so that your teams can work toward common goals without requiring constant centralized oversight .
Read Peter Senge ’s The Fifth Discipline for great insight into this area .
For me , dynamic languages mean increased productivity .
It ’s as simple as that .
It ’s because the programming languages I use actually can do this , and because succinctness is power .
And if you ’ve never actually tried developing real software in such languages , that ’s too bad , because that power — that productivity — really is quite amazing .
CAN Gordon Brown , Moses - like , have summoned the storm that struck stockmarkets this week ?
Nothing less than a thunder - and - lightning extravaganza was needed to distract attention from the manifold shortcomings of his government 's latest plan for Northern Rock .
For four months ministers have dithered over what to do with the bust mortgage lender , victim of the worldwide credit crunch and its own recklessness , stumbling along on a £ 26 billion ( $ 51 billion ) loan from the Bank of England and a £ 30 billion guarantee to depositors .
Unable to find a private buyer with access to enough cash to take the bank off its hands , the government refuses to do the politically unpalatable thing and nationalise it .
The plan announced on January 21st is the worst of both worlds , and mis-sold in the bargain .
If a suitable deal with a private - sector buyer can be negotiated in the next few weeks , Northern Rock will raise the money to repay its debt by issuing some £ 30 billion in asset - backed bonds , which the government will underwrite .
So , in this not - very - opaque shell - game , the taxpayer will guarantee repayment of the money Northern Rock borrows to repay the taxpayer .
In exchange for its continued support , the government will make the bank pay a fee and will take a small stake in it ; the bank 's new owners will have to come up with some equity and agree not to pay themselves whopping dividends straight off .
But the position will be gallingly asymmetrical : the bank 's owners will pocket most of the profits , if any ensue ; and taxpayers will foot most of the losses , if a lot of those materialise instead .
Investors were not slow to see the opportunity : Northern Rock 's shares rose by 46 % when the plan was announced , on the same day as the shares of Britain 's blue - chip companies fell by 5.5 % .
No solution to this messy affair — a subsidised sale , nationalisation or outright bankruptcy — is appealing .
The arguments for each have often been rehearsed .
Nationalisation , the least bad , has the virtue of admitting where financial responsibility lies , and aligning power and potential profits accordingly .
That it offends shareholders , who are rightly rewarded for taking risks when things go well , is neither here nor there .
It is taxpayers who matter : taxpayers , and honesty .
To pretend that this hybrid is both a private - sector solution and the best way to see taxpayers made whole , when in fact they will be standing surety for the bank for years , is bold .
Alistair Darling , Mr Brown 's successor as chancellor of the exchequer , can have no such certainty , as house prices and the economy all turn down ( see article ) .
He is wise to provide few details .
Time to get tougher
Although the government is too afraid of awakening sleeping dogs to embrace nationalisation outright , it acknowledges that state ownership remains an option if negotiations with would - be buyers fall through .
And if it sets the tough rules of engagement necessary to get a decent deal for taxpayers , that result becomes more likely .
Northern Rock is to pay a fee for the bond guarantee .
That should be hefty : current guesses of £ 400 m to £ 500 m a year almost certainly understate the value in today 's tumultuous markets of such a gold - bottomed undertaking .
And the government wants a stake in the business , in order to profit from any upside : again , talk of 5 - 10 % is far too modest given that the bank would not exist , still less make profits , without official backing .
It would make sense , too , to insist that the bank 's true owners be represented on its board .
If that makes it more likely that Northern Rock 's liabilities end up on the government 's books , so be it .

Obama makes threepeat out of DC , Maryland , Virginia John Byrne

This A variety of TV news networks have called the Potomac primaries in Maryland , Virginia , and Washington DC for Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , just after polls closed at 7 pm ET and 8 pm ET respectively .
At an address at the University of Wisconsin in Madison , Obama 's victory speech aimed a barb at Washington insiders and played up what he implied was the universal appeal of his campaign around the United States .
" And although we won tonight in the District of Columbia , this movement wo n't stop until there 's change in Washington , DC , and tonight we 're on our way , " he said at the start of his speech .
" We know how much further we have to go .
We know it takes more than one night to overcome the decades of money and influence and partisanship .... let let you down and told you to settle . "
Obama also took aim at Sen. John McCain , the likely GOP nominee for president .
" John McCain has said he would keep our troops in Iraq for 100 years , and that 's reason enough not to give him four years in the White House , " he argued .
Vote counts at the Virginia State Board of Elections showed a commanding lead for Obama in the state .
WIth about 75 % of the total votes counted , Obama had around 65 % of the vote .
And just as polls closed at 9:30 pm ET , after inclement weather prompted a judge to extend time for voting , Obama was also projected as the winner in Maryland .
Meanwhile , news emerged from the Clinton campaign of another staff shakeup .
Mike Henry , the deputy to recently sidelined Patti Solis Doyle left the New York senator 's campaign .
An excerpt of an e-mail he wrote that was published by Chris Cilizza at the Washington Post hinted that more changes might be coming at the campaign .
" Our campaign needs to move quickly to build a new leadership team , support them and their decisions and make the necessary adjustments to achieve the winning outcome for which we have all worked so hard for over a year now , " Henry wrote .
But in El Paso , Texas where Clinton was speaking Tuesday night , she seemed to be skipping he outcome in the Potomac primaries .
" We 're going to sweep ahead in Texas over the next three weeks , " she declared , before accusing President Bush of being " all hat and no cattle . "
The results confirmed earlier leaks to RAW STORY at 6:30 pm ET from a network source who saw exit poll data and said Obama won the three states " handily . "
In Virginia , exit poll data showed that 89 % of African - American Democrats voted for Obama while 51 % of white Democrats turned out for Clinton .
Obama also took 58 % of the female vote in the state .
And 67 % of voters who described themselves as " Conservative " voted for Obama , broadening the candidate 's claim that he is able to reach out to both sides .
According to exit polls for Maryland , 62 % of the state 's voters Tuesday were women , and 59 % of those women voted for Obama .
Among White Democrats , 54 % voted for Sen. Clinton , and 88 % of black Democrats voted for Obama .

Researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , had the exercisers sprint for 30 seconds , then either stop or pedal gently for four minutes .
Such a stark improvement in endurance after 15 minutes of intense cycling spread over two weeks was all the more surprising because the volunteers were already reasonably fit .
They jogged , biked or did aerobic exercise two to three times a week .
Doing bursts of hard exercise not only improves cardiovascular fitness but also the body ’s ability to burn fat , even during low - or moderate - intensity workouts , according to a study published this month , also in the Journal of Applied Physiology .
Eight women in their early 20s cycled for 10 sets of four minutes of hard riding , followed by two minutes of rest .
Over two weeks , they completed seven interval workouts .
After interval training , the amount of fat burned in an hour of continuous moderate cycling increased by 36 percent , said Jason L. Talanian , the lead author of the study and an exercise scientist at the University of Guelph in Ontario .
Cardiovascular fitness — the ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen to working muscles — improved by 13 percent .
It did n’t matter how fit the subjects were before .
Borderline sedentary subjects and the college athletes had similar increases in fitness and fat burning .
“ Even when interval training was added on top of other exercise they were doing , they still saw a significant improvement , ” Mr. Talanian said .
That said , this was a small study that lacked a control group , so more research would be needed to confirm that interval training was responsible .

The euro was supported by the ECB president 's comments
The pound bought just one euro 37.6 cents in quiet Christmas Eve trading .
" There are increasing signs that the British economy has hit a brick wall triggered by the decline in the housing market , " said analysts at BNP Paribas .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) president Jean - Claude Trichet 's recent comments have also boosted the euro .
Inflation and growth
In an interview with the Financial Times , Mr Trichet hinted that the ECB was more worried about inflation than economic growth .
He said that interest rate cuts in the US and Britain should not distract the ECB from tightening its monetary policy .
" Other colleagues are in a different situation , " Mr Trichet said .
Britain 's record trade deficit has also helped push down the value of sterling .
With motorized transportation using 40 % of US oil consumption , it 's important to examine what we are doing on a local and regional level with transportation plans , funding , and construction .
Are we digging ourselves deeper into the hole of oil dependency for mobility ?
As we consider the collision course of peak oil and global warming , we should start look around our own communities and see if our transportation plans , policies , and construction projects are anticipating higher gas prices and a future with reduced vehicle miles traveled by automobile or stuck in the " building our way out of congestion " mindset .
Holding local elected officials accountable for their words and deeds can be a frustrating experience .
One day they are standing up denouncing the Federal government for making the wrong investments in our future and not tackling global warming or our addiction to oil by signing the Mayor 's Climate Change Agreement .
The next day they announce the latest in highway funding touting new roads , less traffic , more jobs .
Adding one new mile of one lane of highway capacity creates an estimated 116,500 to 186,500 tons of carbon dioxide emissions over 50 years .
Further , expanding transportation systems primarily for the benefit of single occupancy drivers only deepens our addiction to sprawl land use patterns - when we make it easier for people to drive further and further from where they live to where they work , highway expansions subsidize suburban sprawl .
Highway funding is largely financed by gas taxes , which are collected by the 50 states and sent to the Federal government and then distributed back to the states .
Some states are " donor " states that receive back less than 100 % of what they contribute to the Feds .
Other states are " recipient " states that receive more than 100 % of what they contribute
The vast majority of federal transportation funds go to highways ( maintenance and expansion ) , eating up $ 228 billion out of the $ 286 billion in federal funding for 2004 - 2009 .
When the Feds kick the highway funds back to the states ( with some small amounts " ear - marked " for specific projects ) , large metro regions and state Departments of Transportation get to decide the vast majority of which highway and transportation projects get funding .
So while there is almost no local control of amount of gas taxes collected , there is a lot of local control over what types of transportation projects actually get built in metro regions .
Regional " metropolitan planning organizations " are comprised of locally elected officials who must approve transportation plans that receive federal funding .
There are 385 metropolitan planning organizations across the U.S .
Where I reside , Austin , Texas , our local transportation planning agency , the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization , recently authorized almost $ 1.5 BILLION in highway expansions for five highways in Austin .
About one - third of this - $ 540 million - is from debt ( in the form of bonds ) to be floated on the presumption that toll collections on the new toll lanes will repay the bond debt .
Despite Austin's image as " green , " we are investing enormous sums of money into deepening our addiction to cars , oil consumption , and sprawling land uses .
Our mayor unveiled an " Austin Climate Protection Plan " this year and a few months later voted for the $ 1.5 BILLION in highway expansions , with no one in the media picking up on the hypocrisy .
What transportation plans are being considered , funded , and built in your area ?
New toll roads ?
Mass transit ?
Rapid bus ?
Free or low - cost bike rentals ?
Extensions of commuter rail lines ?
What percentage of your metropolitan planning organization 's funding is going to highway expansions ?
TOD : LOCAL is interested in hearing your stories !

Most fake bombs missed by screeners
75 % not detected at LAX ; 60 % at O'Hare
WASHINGTON — Security screeners at two of the nation 's busiest airports failed to find fake bombs hidden on undercover agents posing as passengers in more than 60 % of tests last year , according to a classified report obtained by USA TODAY .
Screeners at Los Angeles International Airport missed about 75 % of simulated explosives and bomb parts that Transportation Security Administration testers hid under their clothes or in carry - on bags at checkpoints , the TSA report shows .
At Chicago O'Hare International Airport , screeners missed about 60 % of hidden bomb materials that were packed in everyday carry - ons — including toiletry kits , briefcases and CD players .
San Francisco International Airport screeners , who work for a private company instead of the TSA , missed about 20 % of the bombs , the report shows .
The TSA ran about 70 tests at Los Angeles , 75 at Chicago and 145 at San Francisco .
The report looks only at those three airports , using them as case studies to understand how well the rest of the U.S. screening system is working to stop terrorists from carrying bombs through checkpoints .
The failure rates at Los Angeles and Chicago stunned security experts .
" That 's a huge cause for concern , " said Clark Kent Ervin , the Homeland Security Department 's former inspector general .
Screeners ' inability to find bombs could encourage terrorists to try to bring them on airplanes , Ervin said , and points to the need for more screener training and more powerful checkpoint scanning machines .
In the past year , the TSA has adopted a more aggressive approach in its attempt to keep screeners attentive — the agency runs covert tests every day at every U.S. airport , TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe said .
Screeners who miss detonators , timers , batteries and blocks that resemble plastic explosives get remedial training .
The failure rates at Los Angeles and Chicago are " somewhat misleading " because they do n't reflect screeners ' improved ability to find bombs , Howe said .
TSA chief Kip Hawley , responding to previous reports about screeners missing hidden weapons , told a House hearing Tuesday that high failure rates stem from increasingly difficult covert tests that require screeners to find bomb parts the size of a pen cap .
" We moved from testing of completely assembled bombs … to the small component parts , " he said .
Terrorists bringing a homemade bomb on an airplane , or bringing on bomb parts and assembling them in the cabin , is the top threat against aviation .
" Their focus is on using items easily available off grocery and hardware store shelves , " Hawley said .
A report on covert tests in 2002 found screeners failed to find fake bombs , dynamite and guns 24 % of the time .
The TSA ran those tests shortly after it took over checkpoint screening from security companies .
Tests earlier in 2002 showed screeners missing 60 % of fake bombs .
In the late 1990s , tests showed that screeners missed about 40 % of fake bombs , according to a separate report by the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress .
The recent TSA report says San Francisco screeners face constant covert tests and are " more suspicious . "
The world ’s biggest building will be coming to Moscow in 2013 , and it will be energy efficient .
Covering an area of 2.5 million square meters and towering above the Kremlin at 450 meters , it will be one giant hotel .
There will be 3000 hotel rooms and 900 serviced apartments .
Energy Efficiency
Now the good stuff .
The building is one giant spiral , creating terraces on every level .
These terraces create a thermal buffer for the main building , protecting the building from Moscow ’s extreme weather , saving electricity .
The building will be covered with solar panels and wind turbines .
Natural ventilation will be provided thanks to numerous strategically placed large atriums .
Also , dynamic enclosure panels will be slotted into the structural framing allow daylight to penetrate deep into the heart of the scheme and can be controlled to modify the internal environment .
“ Energy management is at the heart of this structure , several on - site renewable and low - carbon energy generation projects are planned , ” the company said in an official press statement .

Google Docs Offline Access
By Tony Ruscoe
In a post Philipp made last week about writing a book in Google Docs , he said :
Working with Google Docs requires an internet connection .
In my case , I need this internet connection anyway [...] your mileage may vary ( and who knows , Google may also release Gears - support for Google Docs in the future ) .
After playing around with one of Google ’s not - so - private experimental sites , I can confirm that offline access is currently being tested .
When I visited the site recently , I saw this message :
Of course , I clicked the link and this popped up :
Google Gears is a browser extension for Firefox 1.5 + and Internet Explorer 6.0 + that enables web applications to provide offline functionality through JavaScript APIs .
( It also has its own blog . )
Other companies – like Remember The Milk and Zoho – are already making use of Google Gears , but the only official Google integration is for Google Reader ( although evidence that offline functionality is coming to Google Calendar has also been spotted ) .
After enabling offline access and confirming the security warning for Google Gears , my documents started to synchronize , just the same as feed items synchronize in Google Reader .
( In case you encounter any error messages , Google allows you to reset and disable offline access through the offline access settings dialog box . )
Disappointingly , I was n’t able to actually view or edit any of my documents after going offline ; I could only view them in the document list and received a Firefox “ Offline mode ” message when I tried .
However , I was able to perform simple operations like renaming and starring them while being offline , which were successfully synchronized once I reconnected .
As you can see from the screenshot above , it looks like offline access might be initially introduced just for documents , rather than spreadsheets and presentations which are grayed out like other options in the menu , such as creating a new document , uploading and sharing .
From what I ’ve seen , I think it ’s clear that offline access is obviously still in its early stages , but it ’s reassuring to see that Google is actively improving its online office applications to make them also work offline like the desktop applications we ’re all used to .

Predicting technology trends can be a difficult business
But what will be making the headlines over the next 12 months ?
Here the BBC News website gives its predictions for five technologies that could become big in 2008 .
THE WEB TO GO
Could the online and offline worlds meet in 2008 ?
One of the biggest drawbacks of web applications is that they can only be used when there is an internet connection .
Although mobile working is becoming increasingly common , ubiquitous connectivity is still a long way off .
But there are tools that are beginning to blur the online and offline worlds .
Over the last 12 months a number of technologies that could have a significant impact on the way people use the web .
Search giant Google announced its Gears application whilst Adobe launched Air and Microsoft released Silverlight .
All the technologies have the ability to take rich web content and make some of it available offline .
For example Adobe has shown off an Ebay desktop application built using Air that would allow users to do much of the legwork required in setting up auctions offline .
The next time the user connects to the internet the listing would be posted to the website .
Silverlight offers the reverse - the ability to build desktop applications and allow them to run in a web browser .
Google Gears does not allow the creation of new applications but does allow web applications to be taken offline .
For example , the developers of the free online office package Zoho use Gears to allow users to use their applications in a similar way to a normal desktop office program .
2008 should see more examples of applications built with or using one of the three tools to make a truly seamless computing experience .
ULTRA MOBILE PCs
The Asus eee is setting the trend for UMPCs
Various devices have tried to fill the role between a PDA and a full - blown laptop over the years , but none has taken off .
But 2008 could be the year when the Ultra Mobile PCs ( UMPCs ) finally have their day .
The first devices were launched in 2006 , but they have never gone mass market - partly because of a combination of high prices and poor battery life .
But towards the end of 2007 a series of new products started to hit shelves .
The most talked about was the Asus EEE , a sub -£ 200 laptop about the size of a hardback book .
The Taiwanese manufacturer has predicted it will sell five million of the tiny machines in 2008 .
The low - cost laptop runs open source Linux software and weighs less than one kilogram .
To cut down on weight it does away with a hard drive in favour of just 4GB of flash memory .
Whilst the storage is small , its use of flash highlights another trend of 2008 .
Flash memory has been gradually increasing in power .
For example , electronics giant Samsung recently showed off chips that could be used to make 128 GB memory cards .
As a result the technology is now starting to challenge hard drives as the storage of choice on laptops .
Apple is even rumoured to be launching ultra- thin Macbooks using flash in 2008 .
IPTV
Internet TV has been hampered in the past because broadband speeds were not fast enough to deliver a reliable service .
But today more than half of all UK homes have a broadband connection , at an average speed of four megabits a second ( Mbps ) , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) .
And speeds are increasing .
Next year , ADSL2 + comes online , promising broadband speeds of up to 24 Mbps .
As a result , more and more internet protocol television services are being launched .
Alongside established services from BT vision and Virgin Media , other operators are getting in on the business .
Following the launch of a successful service in the Czech Republic , mobile phone operator O2 plans to launch a UK service in 2008 .
Others such as Orange are expected to follow suit .
The BBC will also be pushing its iPlayer in 2008 , a service that allows people to catch up on the corporation 's output over the web .
Whilst in November , the BBC partnered with rivals ITV and Channel 4 to launch a joint on - demand service .
Existing firms are also predicting rapid growth through 2008 .
Mary Turner , the chief executive of Tiscali UK said in December that its service is currently signing up 250 people each day and expects to have 50,000 users by the end of the year
It is aiming for 200,000 by the end of 2008 .
WIMAX
Wimax is a wireless technology that can deliver high speed broadband over long distances .
It is already big in the US with companies such as Sprint and Intel backing the technology .
Some areas of the developed world , such as Abuja in Nigeria , are also trialling the technology .
But , according to analyst Mike Roberts of research firm Informa Media and Telecoms , it has never taken off in Europe .
But , he said , that could all change in 2008 .
" Next year could be the first year that we see some of the major deployments of Wimax in Europe , " he said .
Milton Keynes has just launched what it claims if the first commercial Wimax service in the UK .
The aim , according to a spokesperson was to " make Milton Keynes the first WiMax - powered wireless internet city . "
According to Mr Roberts others could follow suit particularly if a big player such as BT was " able to get its hands on the right spectrum " .
MOBILE VOIP
Skype is the best - known provider of traditional VoIP services
VoIP is a technology that allows users to make cheap phone calls over the internet .
Although some firms such as Jajah and Truphone have offered VoIP on mobiles the technology is still relatively nascent .
However , 2008 could be the year the technology takes off .
Towards the end of 2007 , network operator 3 launched a Skype phone that allows users to make calls using the service , already popular for making calls from PCs .
Handset - maker Nokia also offers four phones with the ability to use the technology .
" We plan to add VoIP enabled devices to the existing range , " said Mark Squires of the firm .
But even with the backing of a heavyweight such as Nokia , not everyone is convinced that 2008 will be the year of mobile VoIP .
" Mobile VoIP is still at a very early stage , " said Mike Roberts of analysts Informa Media and Telecoms .
" It 's very disruptive but it will be a slow burn , to my mind , "
Teenager , Erik Crespo , used his MP3 player to secretly recorded an abusive interrogation by a New York Detective , Christopher Perino , that may not land the detective in jail for perjury .
In an extraordinary Petty Mason moment , Perino was on the stand testifying in April that he never interrogated the teenage suspect about a Bronx shooting until a defense attorney confronted him with the transcript taken from the MP3 .
Perino never knew that he was recorded in an hour long interrogation using abusive language .
After the prosecutor asked for a delay , Perino was taken from the stand and advised to get a lawyer .
He now stands accused of perjury .
Defense attorneys have long complained that officers will often show more loyalty to their colleagues than to the truth on the stand .
While the vast majority of officers testify truthfully , there remains a disturbing incidence of false testimony told to protect the “ thin blue line .
Without this recording , there would be no way that Perino would have been held accountable .
Prosecutors , as here , routinely take the word of the officers without independent inquiry .
He faces 12 counts of first - degree perjury and faces as many as seven years on each count , prosecutors said .

OTTAWA–North America 's traditional automotive industry will effectively disappear within a decade if Ottawa does n't put trade restrictions on imported vehicles , CAW president Buzz Hargrove says .
Hargrove delivered that stark message at a meeting yesterday with Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
Hargrove urged the federal government to bring in a reciprocal trade arrangement .
" I said to the Prime Minister that it would n't surprise me ( that ) , within a decade , General Motors and Ford both would declare bankruptcy in North America , " he told reporters after the meeting .
A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Harper " appreciates the challenges " facing the auto industry .
Meanwhile , Martinrea International Inc. announced plans this week to close its major automotive - parts plant in Kitchener , formerly known as Budd Automotive , by the spring of 2010 , with 1,200 jobs lost .
" We raised our concern about the lack of response by our government as we 've gone from one of the most successful auto - producing nations in the world , and now we 've moved down the ladder to No. 9 , and almost daily we get another announcement of a closure , " Hargrove said .
The long - time president of the Canadian Auto Workers said he explained to Harper that a combination of trade restrictions similar to the old North American Auto Pact and an automotive investment fund would go a long way toward breathing life into the moribund industry .
" We told him that , if he does n't deal with the trade issue , then there is absolutely no way our industry can survive and ... that we should look at an auto pact type arrangement with Asia , " Hargrove said .
" The auto pact , which was signed with the U.S. in 1965 , recognized that we were not getting our fair share of production and jobs in Canada from the American producers , and now we have a similar problem with Japan and South Korea .
Any agreement would have to ensure that trade is reciprocal : whatever they sell to us in dollar terms , they would have buy from us . "
Hargrove said these foreign auto manufacturers flood North America with their vehicles – from offshore and from plants in Canada and the United States – and then buy virtually nothing in return .
Hargrove made a pitch to Harper to commit $ 30 million to reopen the Ford Essex Engine Plant in Windsor , a city that has been devastated by plant closings .
" We told him you can't delay those things ... and that on every opportunity that arises to say , ` The federal government will partner with you under certain conditions . ' "
California is said to be having a budget " crisis . "
Last week the Governor signed an emergency proclamation forcing the legislature to meet and act on the budget within forty - five days .
" Crisis " and " emergency " are serious words , and the public is upset about hearing them .
This is , of course , the intent of those using the words -- to get the public upset and demanding action .
When people are shocked and worried they will accept solutions that might not be what they would accept if they had time to think , consider all reasonable alternatives and weigh all the consequences .
In an " emergency " the public just wants the problem solved .
( This is a " Shock Doctrine " approach . )
So having created a crisis atmosphere the Governor is asking for " across the board " cuts in state government spending .
This is a tactic that let 's him avoid specifying any particular cuts .
The reason the Governor does not want to specify any particular spending cuts is because people will realize that such cuts are not a good idea .
Asking for cuts " across the board " sounds so fair .
But not specifying also means not prioritizing .
By setting no priorities for spending cuts the Governor is saying that one area of spending matters to him no more than another .
Let 's be clear about what the Governor is doing .
He is cutting police and other law enforcement and public safety .
He is cutting schools -- when California already is 43rd in spending per pupil .
He is letting prisoners out onto the streets .
He is cutting disaster assistance .
He is letting roads and bridges deteriorate .
That is what government spending is -- and we are who it is for .
Each and every thing the Governor is asking to cut is important to all of us , the people of California .
We , the people need and want what the state spends its money on .
We need our police and public safety departments .
We want our children educated in good schools .
It is rare to find a person who claims that the state " spends too much " who can tell you just what we , the people of the state actually spend our money on .
( Try it yourself - see if you can get specifics from anyone who claims that the state spends " too much . " )
That is why the Governor is calling for " across - the - board " spending cuts and not specifying where he thinks cuts should be made .
Meanwhile the Governor is not presenting the public with alternatives to spending cuts .
There ARE alternatives , but they are only going to be part of the process if people pay attention to what is going on .
Here are just a few examples of alternatives that should be considered :
Alternative : Restore the vehicle license fee .
This would bring back $ 5 billion that we , the people should be collecting and using .
Alternative :
Tax oil as it is taken out of the ground .
The oil belongs to the people of California but we do n't ask companies to pay us when they pump it .
A California oil - severance tax would go a long way toward helping solve our budget problems .
Alaska , for example , has no income tax , and in fact the state instead sends a check to citizens each year because they understand that the oil is a common resource and tax the companies that pump it out of the ground .
Alternative : Impose a surtax on upper incomes to balance the budget and pay off the bonds .
Consider that the reason some people receive so much more income is because the infrastructure we Californians have built and the benefits that we the taxpayers have granted to corporations helps build prosperity .
And one effect of having very high incomes is that they have large amounts of disposable income with which to pay taxes and still have plenty left over .
This money can also be used to pay off the bonds that the Governor has issued to avoid making touch choices in the past .
Currently we pay approx .
$ 4 billion each year toward interest on these bonds .
Paying down these bonds and reduces these interest payments and THAT is a spending cut we all want to happen .

Gonzales named lawyer of the year Associated Press
Published : Wednesday December 12 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Negative news coverage may have cost former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales his job , but it won him a dubious honor Wednesday from a magazine published by the American Bar Association : Lawyer of the Year .
Additionally , the ABA Journal named Gonzales ' successor , Attorney General Michael Mukasey , as its top lawyer for 2008 -- mostly in anticipation of how often he 'll be in the media spotlight for trying to repair the beleaguered Justice Department .
The monthly magazine gave the awards to lawyers who made the most news , said editor and publisher Edward A. Adams .
" Think about Time magazine 's Person of the Year , " Adams said in an interview .
" In years past they 've named people like Adolf Hitler , Joseph Stalin .
So we 're not suggesting by these awards that these are the best lawyers in any sense of the word .
We are saying they are the most newsworthy -- and perhaps also the best . "
Gonzales resigned in September after 2 1/ 2 years at the department amid investigations into whether he broke the law and lied to Congress .
He has denied any wrongdoing .
A public furor that surfaced last January over the firings of nine U.S. attorneys , and whether they were politically motivated , marked the beginning of the end of Gonzales ' tenure as attorney general .
His conflicting public statements about the ousters led Democrats and Republicans alike to question his honesty .
Also ,
House testimony by a former top aide to Gonzales , Monica M. Goodling , raised questions about whether he was trying to coach her answers about the firings -- potentially illegally tampering with a witness in ongoing congressional and Justice Department inquires .
Gonzales has said he was merely trying to comfort Goodling at an awkward time .
It 's unusual for the ABA Journal to pick its Lawyer of the Year even before the year has begun .
But the magazine did just that with Mukasey for 2008 , predicting in a news release that the new attorney general will be a top newsmaker " as he deals with the problems he inherited from Gonzales in the politically charged climate of a presidential election year . "
Adams said the magazine 's picks " do not necessarily reflect the official policy of the ABA . "
The American Bar Association is made up of about 400,000 lawyers in the United States .
Other high - profile lawyers that were nominated for the distinction included Goodling , the Justice Department 's liaison to the White House who quit in April amid the political firestorm ; I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in the investigation into the leaked identity of former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson ; and U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald , the top prosecutor in Chicago who won the case against Libby .
Brazil 's role as a global energy producer is likely to increase dramatically over the next ten years .
The country is already a relatively important oil producer , and following recent announcements of major offshore deep - water discoveries , the largest Latin American country will move from being self - sufficient to becoming a net exporter .
If the government 's early estimates are confirmed — that the broader area where the recent discoveries were made might hold as much as 70 bn - 100bn barrels — Brazil will be able to boast of holding among the world 's ten - largest oil reserves in the medium to the long term .
Given the early stage of exploration , these initial calculations sounded too optimistic and were seen as politically driven , coming amid concerns about potential energy shortages .
However , most industry analysts seem to agree that Brazil 's place in the geography of oil is set to change .
The Tupi oil field , whose discovery was announced in November 2007 , has potential recoverable reserves of 5 bn - 7bn barrels , according to Petróleo Brasileiro ( Petrobras , Brazil 's state - controlled oil company ) .
This is equivalent to between 35 % and 55 % of Brazil 's current existing reserves , estimated at around 14bn barrels .
The euphoria sparked by Tupi 's discovery is explained by indications that this field may be just a large piece of the major pre-salt layer ( oil reservoir found under an extensive layer of salt deep below the sea level ) in the Santos basin , which extends from Rio de Janeiro ( in the south - east of Brazil ) to Santa Catarina ( in the south ) .
Although drilling in deep water is expensive and risky , Petrobras — which is the operator of the field and holds a 65 % working interest in partnership with the UK's BG Group ( 25 % ) and Portugal 's Galp Energia ( 10 % ) — has developed the know - how and technology to carry out this kind of exploration .
Development of Tupi will be costly : oil analysts estimate investments of between US $ 70bn and US $ 120bn .
This will require Petrobras ( which will have to spend 65 % of the total amount ) to substantially increase its planned investments of US $ 112bn for 2008 - 12 .
But the payoff would be particularly big , since Brazil 's oil mix , which is currently dominated by the production of heavy oil , is likely to change substantially as pre-salt accumulations are believed to have light , good - quality oil .
While Petrobras is set to hugely benefit , there are also risks involved , not least that oil prices currently at historically high levels could decline substantially by the time commercial production starts , probably around 2012 - 13 .
However , currently this risk seems to be only moderate .
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that tight global oil supply and strong demand from emerging markets will keep Brent oil prices at very high levels of US $ 73 per barrel in 2012 .
( We reckon that the price will come down a bit in 2009 - 10 , with a lot more Saudi oil capacity coming on stream , but we expect prices to edge up again from 2011 onwards because of doubts about further increases in supply . )
Another major risk is that the field 's potential falls much short of current expectations .
But , although Petrobras 's early estimates of new recoverable reserves of 70 bn - 100bn barrels may prove exaggerated , there seems to be scope for optimism .
There have been several signs that the government 's calculation of huge estimates were not exclusively politically motivated .
First , the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the removal of 41 oil - exploration blocks in the same area of the Santos Basin from an upcoming auction immediately after Tupi 's discovery .
Furthermore , on February 7th both BG and Galp suggested in their annual reports that their calculations of Tupi 's possible reserves are larger than even Petrobras 's estimates .
Also , the announcement in early January 2008 of the discovery of the Jupiter gas field in the Santos basin , which , according to Petrobras , may have the same size as Tupi , has contributed to further cautious optimism among oil analysts .
Gas dependence
Currently Brazil is almost self - sufficient in oil .
After reaching self - sufficiency in 2006 , the country 's oil - trade balance slipped into a deficit estimated at US $ 400 m in 2007 owing to a surge in domestic demand amid strong economic growth .
As for gas , which has become a more widely used source of energy in Brazil , most of the country 's needs are met by importing from Bolivia and , on a smaller scale , from Argentina .
This has made Brazil vulnerable to regional developments , such as the nationalisation of the natural - gas sector by the Morales government in Bolivia in 2006 and recent production bottlenecks faced by that country , which are likely to affect its supply to Brazil .
Domestically , there is growing concern about the possibility of energy shortages in 2008 - 09 if a scenario of below - average rainfall materialises , although the Lula government has played down this risk .
In this context , Petrobras will be under increased pressure to advance as quickly as possible with ongoing exploration works in the Santos basin .
There are high expectations that new announcements concerning the reserves ' potential in the pre-salt layer will be made in the first half of 2008 .
At the very least , Tupi will almost certainly bolster Brazil 's self - sufficiency in oil production and may also transform the country into a net exporter .
Jupiter , according to the government , is likely to lead to self - sufficiency in gas in the medium term as well .
Further , if the huge potential of Tupi and its sister fields is eventually confirmed , Brazil 's importance as an oil producer will increase even more .
This could change the regional , and even the global , balance of energy power .
The Lula government would certainly try to capitalise on this in the run-up to the 2010 presidential election , whoever from his party runs for the presidency .
Preparations for those elections will begin after the October 2008 municipal elections are concluded .

There 's a badder - ass rover rolling into Marsville , and it's big — like Mini Cooper big .
Weighing 2,000 pounds ( nearly three times the heft of its predecessors ) , the Mars Science Laboratory is nuclear powered and packed with gadgets never before seen on the Red Planet .
Its mission : Assess Mars ' past and present capacity to support life — from alien microbes to human explorers .
MSL ( prototype above , sans science gear ) wo n't launch until fall 2009 , but researchers are already arguing about where to land it .
They have to pick the right spot because , well , life ( on Mars ) is at stake .
Landing Gear
The air bags that cushioned older rovers as they touched down would n't protect this oversize probe .
NASA 's solution : rocket - powered hovercrane , of course .
Laser Vaporizer
MSL can examine a sample from 30 feet away by vaporizing it .
A spectrograph will then measure the light emitted from the free atoms to identify its elements .
Percussive Drill
If NASA wants a closer look , MSL will pulverize a rock with its rotary - percussive drill .
A strawlike casing on the bit will capture dust and send it on to test chambers .
Onboard Lab
Handy spectrometers will search rock powder and gas samples for carbon .
A radiation detector will help NASA decide if it 's safe to send earthlings up there .
Neutron Gun
As it roves , MSL will shoot neutrons into the ground to find permafrost , which may have once been liquid water — the common denominator for life ( as we know it ) .
Nuclear Power
A tiny piece of plutonium will produce enough heat to recharge the batteries each night .
Total power required to operate MSL : 300 watts — same as a hand blender .

Best - selling author Terry Pratchett has spoken to BBC Radio Stoke 's Pete Morgan about how he has dealt with his Alzheimer 's diagnosis .
A Tuna Tempest
The fish hit the fan the other day with the publication the New York Times article regarding the risk of mercury in tuna , which I covered in my entry Some More Mercury With Your Tuna ?
But was it junk science ?
Or was it something that needed to be said ?
Rebuttals came swiftly , and among them , two stand out particularly in the melee .
The Center for Consumer Freedom and the National Fisheries Institute both released the hounds and took the author to task over the research methodology as well as the conclusions , countering that the story may not have been as accurate as the author would like us to believe .
I am not so sure that I agree , but I reprint their comments for your perusal , and I encourage all my readers to scroll down to the conclusion of this entry for my perspective on the whole matter , which frankly , has become a beast that needs to be addressed .
The Center for Consumer Freedom took issue with the article and made the following points in asking for a full retraction of the story which they felt was factually erroneous :
The Times neglected to inform readers that the Food and Drug Administration ’s methylmercury “ Action Level ” ( 1.0 part per million ) includes a generous ten - fold safety cushion .
FDA has written that the Action Level “ was established to limit consumers ’ methyl mercury exposure to levels 10 times lower than the lowest levels associated with adverse effects . ”
In
reality , the highest - mercury sample reported by the Times ( 1.4 ppm ) contains less than one - seventh the amount of mercury that might be a cause for health concern .
The Times mistakenly claimed that consumers eating a fixed number of pieces of sushi tuna will “ reach what the Environmental Protection Agency calls its weekly reference dose . ”
In fact , EPA writes that “ reference doses ” are meant to identify levels that are “ likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime . ”
By definition , it ’s not possible for anyone to exceed a reference dose with a single week ’s worth of exposure .
The Times also omitted information about safety margins built into the EPA ’s mercury reference dose .
Like the FDA ’s Action Level , that reference dose incorporates a ten - fold safety factor .
In the example of the highest - mercury sample identified by the Times , a consumer would actually have to eat 26 pieces per week — over an entire lifetime — before accumulating the lowest level of mercury in his or her body associated with adverse health effects in scientific studies .
The Times wrote that “ mercury enters the environment as an industrial pollutant . ”
In fact , virtually all the mercury in tuna ( an ocean fish ) enters the environment naturally through undersea volcanic activity .
The Times wrote that “ methylmercury [ is ] the form of mercury found in fish tied to health problems . ”
In reality , the medical literature contains no documented cases of mercury toxicity from eating fish in the United States ; the only cases recorded anywhere occurred more than 40 years ago in Japan as the result of an industrial spill .
The National Fisheries Institute has also taken notice of the work and has requested a formal retraction as well , their concerns being :
There is little if any acknowledgment or explanation of the widely accepted benefits associated with eating seafood .
Well researched science - based articles that deal with the mercury issue deserve to include a discussion of the benefits of Omega 3 fatty acids .
An article that presents a risk - only analysis ignores widely tested and reported health benefits that
offset many of the concerns raised .
offset many of the concerns raised .
The sourcing found throughout the report is almost completely one - sided .
Aside from the Environmental Protection Agency and restaurants whose sushi was tested by the Times , the only sources consulted are experts with clear self - interests and or activist groups engaged in both lobbying and fundraising against coal fired power plants , a source of mercury .
Examples
include : Despite the availability of well regarded , independent , objective laboratories Burros chose to have her Sushi samples tested by Dr. Michael Gochfeld .
As part of his own work Gochfeld treats patients for issues related to mercury .
Because Gochfeld ’s research and practice stands to benefit from alarmist stories about mercury he should not be considered an objective clinician in this case .
Kate Mahaffey from the EPA tells readers that a rise in blood mercury levels in this country “ appears ” to be related to Americans eating fish that are higher in mercury .
This is pure speculation and is in fact refuted by the latest consumption data that shows lower mercury seafood like shrimp , salmon and tilapia are some of the most popular .
Environmental Defense is a political activist group with scant expertise in the medical science of food consumption .
Burros omits mention of their fundraising agenda , instead describing them disingenuously as “ work[ing ] … to improve human health . ”
Yet , the “ advice ” they offer is at odds with what every major medical , health and government agency has publicly recommended .
include : Throughout the article there is a sensational mischaracterization of the RfD ( reference dose ) .
Burros suggests that people who eat a certain number of pieces of sushi are at risk of exceeding EPA ’s reference dose level .
It does not mention that those guidelines are based on consumption over one ’s entire lifetime and not merely a certain number of days or weeks .
Nor does it mention the built in ten - fold safety factor .
In mentioning the levels of mercury found in the samples tested Burros fails to explain that the FDA ’s “ Action Level ” is a calculated estimate that also includes a ten - fold safety factor .
I am a skeptical person by nature .
I normally dig deeply into things that interest me ( sushi obsession anyone ? ) and have a fairly analytical mind .
I like to think that I wo n’t be swayed either way by articles and press releases of this nature , however it is sometimes easy to get caught up in things .
A day before the NYT article came out I had made plans to dine with six of my co-workers next week , taking them to one of my favorite sushi restaurants ( which was one of those on the list ) .
When the Times article was published , I was still game , but morale was low so we made reservations at a different type of restaurant .
Oh well .
But I have two goals with this missive , to encourage people to understand the context of these articles as well as raise awareness regarding what might be a safety issue in our favorite food .
The New York Times has a vested interest in publishing articles that get everyone all fired up .
Sensationalism sells papers ( and subsequently advertising space ) , while keeping the reader engaged and discussing the fear du jour .
On the other hand , the National Fisheries Institute and the Center for Consumer Freedom are both organizations with deep ties to the restaurant and seafood industry , and themselves have a vested interest in keeping people eating fish .
It would seem , on the surface , that not much has really changed .
We always knew that there was mercury in fish , and more in the larger predatory fish than the smaller fish down the food chain .
Pregnant women and children have always been asked to avoid these fish , and others to consume them in moderation .
So what is the real story ?
A recently published blog / article in Newsweek refuted a number of these counter arguments , which I will paraphrase for you .
I admit to a degree of bias myself , as I love sushi and would like to believe that my favorite food is entirely safe , however an objective perspective drives me to raise awareness over protecting my own interests .
The points made countering the CCF were :
The claim is that the “ action level ” set by the FDA for methylmercury “ was established to limit consumers ’ methyl mercury exposure to levels 10 times lower than the lowest levels associated with adverse effects . ”
The “ action level ” was set in the 1970 ’s and does not define any safe level of methylmercury consumption .
The “ action level ” is merely a legal term which defines the contamination ( greater than 1 part per million in this case ) at which a food item can be said to be contaminated enough to be removed from the market .
Apparently , the action level was originally intended to be 0.5 parts per million , however a lawsuit was filed by the U.S. fishing industry claiming that the economic impact of setting the level at 0.5 would be devastating for the fishing industry , and as it happened , it seems that profits have trumped safety as a Judge ruled in favor of the fishing industry and the level was raised .
The FDA has not declared and safe dosage of methylmercury as , in fact , the consumption of any methylmercury is actually unsafe , however due to it ’s prevalence in our environment , it can not be entirely avoided .
The Environmental Protection Agency does list a reference dose which measures an amount consumed ( rather than contained in a food ) , which is 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day .
If one were to use this measure , a person who weighs 130 pounds ( 60 kilos ) could consume 42 micrograms of mercury per week ( 0.1 ug / kg / day x 60 kg x 7 days ) and stay within the EPA ’s “ presumed safe ” limit .
By consuming 4 oz of the tuna the NY Times had analyzed , one would exceed that ‘ safe ’ level and consume 48 ug of mercury in that week .
And it ’s not just tuna , 16 ounces of swordfish would contain 480 ug of mercury , which is greater than 11 times the EPA ’s presumed safe level .
The CCF claims that “ By definition , it ’s not possible for anyone to exceed a reference dose with a single week ’s worth of exposure . ”
Not true , as indicated above , and even a single can or tuna fish has approximately 65 ug of mercury , which is more than the weekly reference dose suggested by the EPA .
The DDF states “ Like the FDA ’s Action Level , that reference dose incorporates a ten - fold safety factor .
In the example of the highest - mercury sample identified by the Times , a consumer would actually have to eat 26 pieces per week — over an entire lifetime . ”
Again , there really is no safe dose of methylmercury , and the levels also have to be put in perspective .
While a few micrograms of mercury may not be as harmful to a fully grown adult , the risk to the fetus of a pregnant woman , for example , is much greater .
Methylercury causes brain damage , and a developing fetus is particularly at risk from any environmental contamination .
From my perspective , I feel the same way about sushi ( and tuna ) that I did three days ago , and I am not going to be the veritable headless chicken and run for the hills based on an article .
But what this article has done is bring more attention to the danger of mercury in our food supply , and that is very real .
Seafood has been touted for its health benefits , and this is still the case .
The Omega - 3 fatty acids contained in seafood are considered the good fats , and are heart - friendly .
One does not need to eat tuna , however to achieve these benefits , there are plenty of fish in the sea ( sorry about that ) and a paper by the ocean conservation group Oceana , “ Hold The Mercury : How Consumers Can Avoid Mercury When Buying Fish “ , outlines the diverse ways to reap the benefits of seafood varieties while avoiding fish with higher mercury content .
Interestingly , Japan has entirely refused to take any action because of the NYT article as “ The newspaper is exaggerating the risk , ” according to Teruo Tagaki , the chief of the Fisheries Agency ’s products safety office .
Japan has always had closer cultural ties to the sea , and seafood is a significant influence in the traditional Japanese diet .
Personally , I do n’t think I ’d like to eat any amount of mercury , but then again , every time I go swimming in the ocean I drink it down , so what ’s a piece of fish ?
I also avoid tuna as the species is in danger from serious over fishing .
But , what I ’m trying to say it to use your own judgment , if you feel you should avoid the risk entirely , by all means , do so .
Sensationalism sells papers , even if it ’s true .
But for me , a great sushi meal is sensational , and I ’ll still be going out for sushi as much as I can manage .

スラッシュドット の「 HTML5 策定におけ るOgg Vorbis/ TheoraとDRMの扱いを巡る攻防」他について。
http://srad.jp/mac/article.pl?sid=07/12/11/1950248
これは、議論が変な方向に行っていて、
W3Cがコーデックを決める必要がないから削った
などと納得している人がいますが、削ったのはOgg系が候補から外れた事実を内外に示すためで、上のような曖昧な責任回避の結論で収まる気配はありません。現実的には、TheoraとH.264のいずれかしかあり得ないので、現在は、仕様内にH.264云々を盛り込む直前である、とも言えるでしょう。Nokiaの論文にしても、前後を知らなければ如何様にも解釈できるでしょうが、この文脈で言っているのは、「H.264以外は認めない」ということだけで、他意はないと見るべきです。どうにも混沌とした状況ではありますが、おおまかに次のような3つの勢力に図式を単純化すると、わかりやすいと思います。
Ogg Vorbis/ Theora以外は認めない人々 H.264以外は認めない人々 二つ以上のコーデックを認めない人々
まず、 [ 1]はいわゆるOSS支持派です。もっとも、VorbisとTheoraは単にソースというよりも、むしろ特許の話なので、それよりも若干範囲は広いかもしれません。とりわけ、GIFやMP3でイヤな思いをした人々は、大体ココにカテゴライズされます。今はテーブルに就いていませんが、Wikimedia Commons はVorbis/ Theoraをふんだんに使っているので、Wikipediaに関心がある人々は潜在的な支持勢力と言えるかもしれません。
そして 、 [ 2 ] は、 AppleやNokiaなどの大企業です。既にH.264でのノウハウをある程度確立しており、特にNokiaはパテントも持っています。AACなどmpeg4系列技術に興味を示している企業もここに分類されます。
最後 の [ 3 ]は、ちょっと説明が難しいですが、あえて言うと「ウェブデザイナ陣営」という事になるでしょうか。ブラウザを一つにする野望は諦めたものの、せめてWeb上のビデオのコーデックくらいは一つに絞ってくれ、と悲痛な叫びを上げる人々です。今回、W3Cで仕様を纏めている人達(=主にOperaの二人)はここに分類されています。
では、順を追って説明していきます。上で挙げた意見「W3Cがコーデックを決める必要がない」も一応は正論で、それを認めていれば、こんな騒動にはなっていなかったと思います。ブラウザがTheoraとH.264の両方に対応すべき仕様でも表面的には問題ありませんし、将来的に新しいフォーマットも出ると予想されるので、現段階で決めるのは無意味かもしれません。しかし、それだけは嫌だと思っている人々[ 3]の提案なので、「とりあえず両方実装する」という選択肢は捨ててかかる、という前提なのです。そこで、Theoraが候補に挙がり、ほぼTheora一本槍で、決まりかけていました。しかし、[ 2 ]
が「 Theoraは絶対に嫌だ 」と猛烈に反対したので、取りあえず仕様から削り、今に至ります。
… 、と書くと、なんだか 、AppleとNokiaがひどくワガママな印象というか、まあ、実際にかなりの我が侭を言っているのですが、両者ともH.264には巨額の投資を行っているので、いまさらTheoraを標準規格する案など呑めるはずもないのです。敢えて言うなら、Theoraのようなフォーマットに技術的に退行するのが耐えられない、というのが本音でしょう。そして、[ 2]は自前でブラウザを作る能力があるので、[ 3 ] は[ 2 ] のブラウザ にTheoraを使わせるのを諦めた、というのが真相です。つまり、[ 2]はたとえ「非標準」の謗りを受けたとしても、Theoraを搭載しない覚悟も、ビジネス的展望もできているので、[ 3 ]
がTheora採用を強行すると 、 [ 3 ] の大目標であるWeb上コーデックの統一が果たせなくなるから断念したわけです。そして、[ 1 ]
はしわ寄せを感じて一斉に反発しました。
といって も 、 [ 3 ] は[ 1]
を説得することを諦めたわけではありません。H.264あるいはその代替技術に十分緩いライセンスを付与させる為の交渉を行っているようです。もちろん、そうなら[1]の大部分は満足でしょう。
これが本当に実現可能なら、もはやHTMLがどうとかは無関係に、夢が広がる話なんですけど、実際のところはどうなるんでしょうね。これは憶測ですが、既にNokiaはフリーライセンス化に前向きと思わせる節があります。まずあり得ないとわかってはいますが、ひょっとすると、という思いもあり、いずれにしろ、どう妥協点を探るかは興味深いです。
Eventually I ’ve got round to finishing the girls version of the Christmas cheat sheet , I ’ve also tweaked the boys version a little .

Update :
By popular request , the girls version now includes ring size !
For nearly a year , the families who live along Waterford Crystal Drive in this bedroom community northwest of St. Louis have kept the secret about the boy Megan Meier met last September on the social networking site MySpace .
He called himself Josh Evans , and he and 13 - year - old Megan struck up an online friendship that lasted several weeks .
Then the boy abruptly turned on Megan and ended it .
That night , Megan , who had previously battled depression , committed suicide .
The secret was revealed six weeks later : Neighbor Lori Drew had pretended to be 16 - year - old Josh to gain the trust of Megan , who had been fighting with Drew ’s daughter , according to sheriff ’s department records and Megan ’s parents .
After their daughter ’s death , Tina and Ron Meier begged their other neighbors to keep the story private .
Let the local authorities and the FBI conduct their investigations in privacy , they pleaded .
Advertisement
But after waiting for criminal charges to be filed against Drew , neighbors learned that local and federal prosecutors could not find a statute applicable to the case .
This community ’s patience has dried up .
The furious neighbors -- and in the wake of recent media reports , an outraged public -- are taking matters into their own hands .
In an outburst of virtual vigilantism , readers of blogs such as RottenNeighbor.com and hitsusa.com have posted the Drews ’ home address , phone numbers , e-mail addresses and photographs .
Dozens of people allegedly have called local businesses that work with the family ’s advertising booklet firm , and flooded the phone lines this week at the local Burlington Coat Factory , where Curt Drew reportedly works .
Advertisement
“ I posted that , where Curt works .
I ’m not ashamed to admit that , ” said Trever Buckles , 40 , a neighbor whose two teenage boys grew up with Megan .
“ Why ?
Because there ’s never been any sense of remorse or public apology from the Drews , no ‘ maybe we made a mistake . ’ ”
Local teenagers and residents protest just steps from the Drews ’ tiny porch .
A fake 911 call , claiming a man had been shot inside the Drew home , sent law enforcement officers to surround the one - story , white - sided house .
People drive through the neighborhood in the middle of the night , screaming , “ Murderer ! ”
The Drews , who have mounted cameras and recording devices onto the roof of their house to track the movements of their neighbors , declined to comment for this article .
Cyber - bullying has become an increasingly creepy reality , where the anonymity of video games , message boards and other online forums offers an outlet for cruel taunts .
But it can be difficult to draw the line between constitutionally protected free speech and conduct that is illegal .
Advertisement
Still , Parry Aftab , an Internet privacy lawyer and executive director of WiredSafety.org , points to one federal statute that may apply in the Meier case : the telecommunications harassment law .
Amended in 2005 , the law prohibits people from anonymously using the Internet with the intent to annoy , abuse , threaten or harass another person .
Terri Dougherty , a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney ’s office in St. Louis , declined to comment on whether prosecutors could apply the federal statute in the Meier case .
The mounting tension and heated emotions have local community leaders worried .
The St. Charles County Sheriff ’s Department , which had rarely visited the suburb , now regularly patrols there .
County prosecutors are reexamining the case .
On Wednesday evening , Dardenne Prairie ’s Board of Aldermen unanimously passed a law that makes cyber - harassment a misdemeanor -- with a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail , $ 500 fine or both for each violation .
It ’s the most stringent punishment available to the city .
Advertisement
“ We ’re all in shock , ” said Mayor Pam Fogarty .
“ If I have anything to say about it , we ’ll never have our hands tied legally like this again . ”
Dardenne Prairie is an upper - middle - class enclave of about 7,400 people , about 35 miles northwest of St. Louis .
Over the years , the flat expanse of farmland has been taken over by sprawling subdivisions , high - end bistros and strip - mall cafes .
The Meiers moved to the east side of town 13 years ago , where clusters of maple trees and prairie grasses still remain relatively undeveloped .
Eager for more space at a budget price , the couple were drawn by numerous families and safe streets with names like Swan Lake Drive and Tri Sports Drive .
“ There were kids everywhere , and they ’ve all grown up together , ” said Tina Meier , 37 , who works in real estate .
“ They ride their bikes together , have barbecues together , go on family vacations together , go to school together . ”

Megan befriended Lori and Curt Drew ’s daughter in elementary school , and the two became close , Meier said .
When Megan transferred to a different middle school last fall , in an effort to help her deal with depression and get away from some bullies , the girls grew apart , her parents said .
The Meiers declined to discuss the details behind the girls ’ estrangement .
Around the same time , Megan started to use the Internet , under the supervision of her parents .
Sitting on the family ’s brown floral couch with her father , or nestled next to her mother in the family ’s office in the basement , the eighth - grader browsed through her friends ’ websites and chatted about school .
When a boy messaged Megan on MySpace and asked to be her friend , she excitedly agreed .
The two talked online for about six weeks , her parents said .
On Oct. 16 , Josh told Megan he ’d heard that she was a terrible friend .
The two fought .
Tina , who had to leave to take Megan ’s younger sister , Allison , to a doctor ’s appointment , ordered Megan to get off the computer .
Advertisement
She did n’t .
The messages grew nasty , according to an FBI transcript .
The final message is n’t included in the transcript : “ I remember it said something like , ‘ The world would be a better - off place without you , ’ ” said Ron Meier , 37 , who works as a machinist .
That evening , as her parents were downstairs preparing for dinner , Megan hanged herself in her closet .
She died the next day .
In the weeks that followed , the Drews comforted the Meiers .
They said nothing to them about the fake MySpace account .
Advertisement
They prayed at the wake and consoled sobbing community members at Megan ’s funeral .
They invited the Meiers to birthday parties and had Allison over to bake holiday cookies .
They asked the Meiers to hide Christmas gifts in their garage , away from their own children ’s prying eyes .
It was last Thanksgiving weekend when the Meiers said they learned the truth from a neighbor who had figured out that Lori Drew had devised the online relationship with Megan .
In a fit of rage , they hacked up one of the gifts they were storing -- a Foosball table -- with an ax and sledgehammer .
Tina and Ronald dumped the pieces onto the Drews ’ driveway .
“ I heard this god-awful screaming , ” said neighbor Kristie Kriss , 48 .
“ It was Tina .
When I heard what happened , I could n’t believe it . ”
When the Drews complained to the authorities about the loss of their Foosball table , the story became public .
According to a sheriff ’s department report , Lori Drew said “ she wanted to ‘ just tell them ’ what she did to contribute to the Meiers ’ daughter ’s suicide . ”
Drew told the officer that she , with the help of a temporary employee , “ instigated and monitored ” a fake profile prior to Megan ’s suicide , “ for the sole purpose of communicating ” with the girl .
Advertisement
“ Drew stated that she , her daughter and [ the employee ] all typed , read and monitored the communication between the fake male profile and Megan , ” the report said .
Drew then told the officer that the account had been accessed by other people , “ and Megan found out she had been duped . ”
The Meiers hired an attorney .
“ We told our friends to trust the system , and we would have our justice , ” said Ron Meier .
Advertisement
The neighborhood may have agreed to stay mum , but they could n’t keep their feelings hidden :
Many people here say they shunned the Drews , meeting their gaze with sneers and obscene gestures .
On the anniversary of Megan ’s death , Ron ’s relatives lined the street with black - and - white polka - dot balloons and put up signs around the neighborhood that asked for “ justice for Megan . ”
Meanwhile , the Meiers ’ marriage fell apart .
Tina moved out of the house in the spring and now lives with her mother .
The couple is getting divorced .
Allison , now 11 , splits her time between the two .
Ron has remained in the house on Waterford Crystal Drive , and has tried to preserve Megan ’s room .
Her clothes fill the closet .
But he ’s stopped sleeping at the house .
Advertisement
His attorney has suggested that he spend the nights with friends or family , because “ if something does happen to the Drews , I ’m going to be the No. 1 suspect and I ’ll need a witness to prove my innocence , ” Ron said .
“ All we feel is frustration , anger , ” neighbor Kriss said .
“ For months , we ’ve been asking ourselves , ‘ What mother in her right mind would do this ?
And why wo n’t the cops do anything to punish them ? ’
“ We just want them gone . ”

The Meteoric Rise of Rep. Mark Kirk ( R - IL ) , The New Darling of Pro-Israel PACS
By Janet McMahon
To paraphrase author Ayn Rand : Who is Mark Kirk ?
Pro-Israel PACs know the answer , that ’s for sure : since he first ran for office in 2000 , their contributions to Kirk have increased from a measly $ 7,006 to $ 66,064 in 2005 — with 10 months yet to go until the Nov. 7 election .
( Shelley Berkley , look out ! )
We ’re not sure if the dramatically increasing sums mean his successive re-election campaigns have been correspondingly difficult , or if they represent a reward for Kirk ’s being a self - described “ acknowledged leader of bipartisan efforts to enhance the security of Israel . ”
No doubt AIPAC and its minions are most appreciative of the fact that Kirk , a Naval Reserve intelligence officer , “ secured U.S. agreement to shared satellite surveillance information with Israel . ”
That must make his constituents at home — wherever that is — feel a lot safer .

Spend a little time around West Coast Customs and you 'll learn the price of fame .
Insane deadlines .
Routine 60 - hour workweeks .
A demanding , want - it - now celebrity clientele .
And a self - described micromanager CEO who does n't mince words — including expletives .
" It 's a lot of pressure , " says Ishmael Jimenez , 36 , an upholstery expert and one of the handful of managers who work for CEO Ryan Friedlinghaus .
" I can make no excuses , because West Coast Customs has a worldwide reputation . "

That reputation is borne of an automotive customization business that gained national fame thanks to its outrageous hip - hop designs and appearance on the MTV show Pimp My Ride .
For four seasons of that show , West Coast Customs transformed broken - down jalopies into outrageous , urban - oriented rides with wild paint jobs , humongous chrome wheels and ground - pounding stereos .
Friedlinghaus , probably the most heavily tattooed CEO in America , says he yanked the shop 's participation because he thought Pimp was too gimmicky with its ugly duckling - to - swan format .
Nowadays , he 's more stoked about his latest ventures and another TV series that the staff did for cable channel TLC .
He says that show Street Customs , now out of production , was a more realistic portrayal of how a custom car shop really operates .
The crew does things that would make most car owners wince .
Like sawing the roof off a Land Rover to install smoked glass or turning the off - road luxury vehicle into a two - door , instead of four - door model .
Those tasks , along with fancy paint , wheels and all the glitz , were accomplished in about a month .
At any given moment , the shop is working on about 20 vehicles .
Recent jobs have included cutting the roof off NBA star Shaquille O'Neal 's $ 145,000 Mercedes - Benz S600 to make it a convertible .
The artists and technicians also are adding speakers , paint and goodies to skier Bodie Miller 's 1992 GMC Typhoon SUV .
These vehicles share garage space with a Dodge Nitro SUV , Ford F - 250 pickup and a vintage 1950 Mercury , among others .
Each is getting its own unique makeover .
Creativity on the clock
It 's not all about the flash .
Digital clocks hanging above the garage floor tick off the seconds until each project is due to be turned back to its owner as a sparkling show car .
The business makes deadlines .
" I just get it done .
My word is everything , " Friedlinghaus says .
The busy garage is only the most visible element of Friedlinghaus ' burgeoning automotive business that now includes : • International .
The first franchised West Coast Customs shop opened six months ago in Dubai .
The deal came after West Coast received a commission to convert a Hummer as a birthday gift for a sheik 's 14 - year - old daughter , he says .
Now similar arrangements are in the works in Russia , Japan , Germany and Malaysia .
The shop has gained worldwide exposure from syndicated episodes of the original Pimp shows .
• Merchandise .
West Coast has its own co-branded stereo systems , wheels , paint and leather kits .
It already has an extensive line of T - shirts and other apparel with its distinctive graffiti - like designs .
Next will be its own shop - inspired clothing line called Wrench , due to go on sale later this year .
The company also is developing a line of automotive graphics that can be wrapped onto any car .
• Live shows .
Friedlinghaus is trying to develop a newfangled community car show near his factory in Corona , east of Los Angeles , later this year .
It would include car - themed family entertainment , not just rows of tricked - out cars on display , he says .
Among other things , his crew would rebuild a car on stage — then give it away .
West Coast Custom 's crew already gives demonstrations of their customizing techniques at industry trade shows .
" We have grown up , " Friedlinghaus says .
" We 're doing real stuff . "
West Coast employs 35 at a $ 4 million plant decorated with graffiti art and at a design shop nearby across the train tracks in Corona .
Most of West Coast Customs ' jobs are $ 25,000 to $ 50,000 conversions , though some are far more complicated , and costly .
Lately , the company has specialized in building entirely new chassis for vintage muscle cars .
For instance , West Coast attached the body of a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle sedan to the guts of a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette , creating the " Corvelle . "
The goal is a vintage look with modern - day reliability and performance .
Friedlinghaus says revenue at the privately held company now exceeds $ 10 million a year .
Not bad considering that the company started only 11 years ago with a $ 5,000 loan from Friedlinghaus ' grandfather .
A false start in ' the OC ' Friedlinghaus , 32 , grew up in Las Vegas , as the family renegade who developed an early appreciation for baggy low - riding pants , hip - hop music and tinkering with cars .
He says his straight - laced father used to tell him , " You 're never going to get anywhere wearing your pants like that , listening to that kind of music and driving those stupid cars . "
When the family moved to the affluent south Orange County , Calif. , enclave of Laguna Niguel , Friedlinghaus opened West Coast Customs as his first car business in 1997 .
But it did n't click .
His clientele was " a bunch of spoiled rotten kids who did n't know what they wanted , " he says .
Then , he says , they would send their raving parents to the shop to protest how much they had spent on their cars .
Instead , Friedlinghaus followed the advice of a friend .
He moved the business to Compton , a hardscrabble , inner-city community .
Though Compton is n't many miles from Laguna Niguel , culturally and economically it is a world apart .
Big break from a big client
It 's there , Friedlinghaus says , that he got his first big break .
O'Neal , then the star center of the Los Angeles Lakers , heard about his ability to soup up cars .
Shaq handed over his Lincoln Navigator to Friedlinghaus to install a new suspension .
Now , " I 've built him 38 cars , " says Friedlinghaus , including the latest Mercedes and an International truck that he 's converting into the " Dunktruck , " a promotion vehicle for O'Neal 's sneaker line .
O'Neal , in comments relayed by spokesman Todd Brooks , says he's not sure how many vehicles that West Coast Customs has done for him , but it 's " probably enough that we should be partners . "
Friedlinghaus is someone who " understands what I like , and he always delivers on what he says .
He has earned my trust , " O'Neal says .
" Ryan always outdoes himself .
That 's why I had him do my Dunktruck . …
There 's more pressure for Ryan on this one . "
West Coast has done promotional vehicles for other businesses .
One was for Rockstar Energy Drink , which commissioned a truck and recreational vehicle .
" It was a natural fit , " says Mike Kelso , Rockstar 's marketing director .
" They get where Rockstar is coming from . "
After a succession of moves around urban L.A. , Friedlinghaus brought West Coast back out to the suburbs , moving the company nearly two years ago to its factory a few minutes ' drive from his house .
His Pimp My Ride days , which ended in 2004 , brought him enough fame that he says he is still recognized in public .
Thanks to worldwide syndication , he says he was once chased by fans through an airport in Germany .
The Pimp show continued after West Coast Customs ended its involvement , utilizing a new shop in L.A. 's San Fernando Valley .
West Coast soldiered on , business as tough as ever .
" It 's stressful , " says Sean Mahaney , the metal fabrication chief , because of the compressed schedule for finishing vehicles .
The hip clientele " want what 's cool right now . "
Then there is Friedlinghaus , who lords over every project .
" He 's his own worst critic , and he 's your critic , too , " says Scott Voinovich , 35 , the general manager .
The stressful milieu made for " good TV , " says Street Customs executive producer , Craig Piligian .
" Ryan has his own special brand of building cars .
He 's the best at it . "

But Neuros Technology
International , creator of a new video recorder , has decided to go in a different direction .
The company , based in Chicago , is providing full documentation of the hardware platform for its recorder , the Neuros OSD ( for open source device ) , so that skilled users can customize or “ hack ” the device  and then pass along the improvements to others .
The OSD is a versatile recorder .
Using a memory card or a U.S.B. storage device , it saves copies of DVDs , VHS tapes and television programs from satellite receivers , cable boxes , TVs and any other device with standard video output .
Because the OSD saves the recordings in the popular compressed video format MPEG - 4 ( pronounced EM - peg ) , the programs can be watched on a host of devices , including iPods and smartphones .
The OSD is for sale at Fry ’s , Micro Center , J&R Electronics and other locations for about $ 230 .
Mr Kasparov is among the Kremlin 's fiercest critics
Mr Kasparov said his Other Russia bloc had faced difficulty arranging for its supporters to meet in Moscow - an official requirement for his candidacy .
The former chess player has frequently accused President Vladimir Putin 's government of throttling opposition .
A Putin aide , Dmitry Medvedev , is expected to succeed him as president .
Earlier this week , Mr Putin named Mr Medvedev , currently the first deputy PM and chairman of gas giant Gazprom , as his choice for president .
Mr Putin's own popularity is likely to ensure his nominee gets the job , analysts say .
Though constitutionally obliged to step down in March , Mr Putin is expected to retain political influence - possibly by becoming prime minister .
Parliamentary elections in Russia earlier this month delivered a landslide victory to United Russia , the largest party in the Duma loyal to the Kremlin .
Other Russia - a coalition of mainstream politicians , as well leftists and nationalists opposed to the Kremlin - did not meet legal requirements to field candidates .
' Technical reasons '
Mr Kasparov announced on Wednesday that he was abandoning his campaign for the presidency .
Other Russia activists clashed with riot police at a recent rally
" My electoral campaign finishes tomorrow , " Mr Kasparov said , citing problems in finding a place to hold a meeting of his supporters in Moscow .
Under Russian election law , presidential contenders who are not affiliated to one of four major parties that won seats in parliament must provide the details of two million supporters across the country .
Such contenders must also organise an " initiative group " meeting of at least 500 supporters before a December deadline .
" In all Moscow we have not been able to find a hall where our supporters could meet , " Mr Kasparov said .
" We pay and the people agree .
There are no problems .
And then they call us to say they are refusing , can't give us the hall any more , " he said .
" They refuse to give us the hall for technical reasons . "
Mr Kasparov has accused Mr Putin of stifling the opposition through its dominance of the media and through new electoral laws that allegedly favour pro-Kremlin parties .
The former chess star , who represented the Soviet Union at tournaments in the 1980s , was arrested and jailed for five days before the recent election for taking part in an illegal rally .

“ Send us gossip , ” urges the Hebrew - language Merahlim site , at www.merahlim.co.il, founded by a paparazzi photographer who goes by the name of Buchacho .
“ After 20 years in entertainment journalism , I came to the conclusion the best stories came out of workplaces , ” Buchacho said .
The site -- its title means “ gossip ” in English -- launched earlier this month .
It offers links to sections with gossip about Israeli companies including banks , cable television networks , newspapers and airlines , and the military .
Companies are named on the site but employees mentioned in the entries are not , although job descriptions are used .
Users do not have to disclose their own identities , and there is no way to verify the information they provide .
Buchacho said Merahlim generates about 5,000 hits a day .
Entries range from the mundane to the raunchy .
One user , identifying herself as a secretary at a major telephone company , asked : “ Who is the hot new guy in sales ?
The quality of the sales department seems to be improving lately . ”
Others disclose far more personal details .
“ Who is the captain and the flight attendant who entered the same restroom at a New York bar ? ” “ Flight Attendant Ilan ” posted .
“ He looks good for his age .
She is young but looks ... hot .
Pay attention on next Thursday ’s flight . ”
Most of the companies cited in postings declined to comment about the site .
Buchacho said he and his Web team check every entry and delete anything they believe is particularly hurtful .
He said he was not particularly worried about law suits .
Eran Liss , an attorney specializing in media law , said he did not believe the Web site had crossed any legal boundaries .
“ The site is about gossip .
But if someone writes about , let ’s say , a new product being developed , the company could definitely have a case .
It is a very sensitive issue , ” Liss said .
Merahlim also enables users to comment on the gossip or classify an entry as “ recommended ” .
Unsurprisingly , the most racy stories often generate the most responses -- such as the tale of an executive ’s wife who pulled into a parking lot only to spot her husband smooching with another woman in his car .
“ Who is he ?
Which department does he work in ?
Customer service ? ” one user asked in the comments section .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A college student withdrew from school after winning the 5 million yuan ( $ 683,000 ) jackpot in a lottery in China ’ eastern city of Nanjing , local media reported on Thursday .
The second - year student at the Jiangsu Maritime Institute , identified by the nickname
Yong to protect his identity , was the sole first - prize winner in the “ Double Colour Ball ” issued by the China Welfare Lottery on Tuesday , the Beijing News said .
“ After winning the lottery , Yong told his roommates that he would share 2,000 yuan with each of them , ” it added .
Yong informed school authorities of his winnings , and had returned home .
“ We are not sure if he will return to school , but we hope he will eventually finish his education , ” the paper quoted Yong ’s teacher as saying .
The Communist Party abolished lotteries in China after taking power in 1949 , denouncing them as a practice of decadent capitalists .
But the country launched state - run lotteries in 1987 amid market - oriented reforms .
Lotteries have become increasingly popular both among the poor and the newly rich in China , where many forms of gambling are banned .
Per capita income in China ’s urban areas is roughly $ 1,900 a year and about $ 600 a year in rural areas .
Lottery - related crimes have been on the rise as well , and underground lottery schemes have become rampant across the country in recent years , bankrupting many families .
Last month , China set up its first help centre for lottery addicts , offering counseling and legal assistance .

Massive security contractor faces growing protest in rural California town over 824 - acre base Miriam Raftery and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday April 3 , 2007 Print This Email This SAN DIEGO -- Potrero , California boasts a broad swath of meadowland that currently houses derelict chicken coops .
Surrounded by the Cleveland National Forest , the property boasts a former chicken ranch and includes an environmentally sensitive , protected agricultural preserve southeast of San Diego .
But if private security contractor Blackwater USA gets its way , this 850 - strong community will soon host an 824 - acre military training base , replacing the erstwhile chicken ranch with fifteen firing ranges and an emergency vehicle operators course the length of ten football fields .
A RAW STORY investigation has already led to the removal of one lawyer connected to the project .
The inquiry has also discovered that California congressman and current presidential candidate Duncan Hunter -- who is the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee -- is a client of the firm , Blackwater USA , a massive US security contractor in Iraq .
Minutes of a planning meeting raise questions about whether Hunter was involved in lobbying for the project .
At the Feb. 8 , 2007 planning meeting , Vice President for Blackwater West Brian Bonfiglio said Hunter was one of the firm 's clients .
" We talk with Duncan about many things , " Bonfiglio said ( emphasis in original ) .
Blackwater is nt a stranger to controversy .
In February 2004 , families of four security contractors killed in Fallujah , who are suing the firm for information regarding their deaths , testified before the House Government Reform Committee .
The private security contractor has seen its federal contract revenues swell since Sept. 11 .
Six years ago , the firm raked in $ 250,000 ; today a single Iraq contract is valued at $ 300 million .
Much of its work takes place in Iraq ; the company was at one time responsible for the security of interim Iraq consul Paul Bremer .
Blackwater now aims to expand operations by establishing several new training camps in addition to its headquarters in North Carolina .
Townspeople and environmentalists are squaring off against the company and public officials .
The Potrero Planning Group approved the facility by a 7 - 0 vote in December  but since then more than half of the town 's registered voters have signed a petition opposing the facility .
Residents also say they are organizing a recall against members of the Planning Group who voted in favor .
Chairman of the Planning Group Gordon Hammers says he wont reconsider the boards decision .
" I think its good for the community , " he said in a recent interview with the East County Californian .
" It provides jobs . 
 It will improve the general economy of the community and as a result , improve property values , " he added .
Hammers contended that arguments against the project " have absolutely no rhyme or reason " and that some opposition is based on misunderstanding of the projects scope .
In a later email to RAW STORY regarding questions about whether noise would disturb nearby residents , Hammers wrote , " If the good science shows that Blackwater 's claims are true then I will be a proud supporter of a vital partner with law enforcement and the war on terror , " he said in an e-mail .
" If good science shows that their claims are not true then they will lose my support . "
Internal documents Internal documents acquired by RAW STORY show that the company had discussions about potential " fatal flaws " in the Potrero project in 2006 .
Of most concern to the company seems to be the camp 's effect on the local eagle population .
On page two of an " Internal Working Draft , " the authors identify that the eagle population in the area is a " potential fatal flaw . "
This runs in direct opposition to public statements by the company .
In the minutes in which Blackwater 's Vice President admits the company has a contract with Hunter , he remarks , " Has anybody seen eagles ? "
The firm also identifies a public versus private road " reduced potential to be a fatal flaw " and that plans for traffic had also " reduced potential fatal flaw . "
The opponents Jan Hedlun is the lone Potrero planner opposing the project .
Elected in November , Hedlun didnt vote at the December meeting because she says she wasnt told she was eligible .
" Im in the middle of a battle ,  Hedlun said .
" I am a lamb in a lions den .
They re pushing this through quicker than anything Ive ever heard in my entire life . "
Although the Potrero Planning Group has met monthly for several years , Hammers has refused to convene an April meeting , saying that only quarterly meetings are required and a quorum cant be met .
When Hedlun pressed Hammers to schedule a meeting in order to allow public input , Hammers responded in an email acquired by RAW STORY , " Jan , get over it .
There is not going to be a meeting . "
The proposed Blackwater West training facility at Potrero would include 15 firing ranges for automatic and semi-automatic weapons and small caliber guns , as well as an emergency vehicle operators course the length of ten football fields -- 3,280 feet in length and 1,320 feet in width , according to a project description .
The facility would also include bunkhouses and commando - type training facilities , ship simulators , and law enforcement and rescue safety training towers with rock - climbing walls and platforms .
Multiple San Diego County records indicate that " hazards " -- including  explosives    should  be stored in an " armory " at the site .
Blackwater West's Bonfiglio denied that the project would use explosives .
" No bombs ,  he said .
 No tanks , no heavy artillery . "
Residents contend Blackwaters proposal is being fast - tracked through the planning process under streamlined procedures recently adopted by San Diego County to expedite processing of major projects such as housing developments .
A public " Notification of Preparation " hearing is scheduled for Apr. 5 at the San Diego Department of Planning and Land Use ; citizens have until Apr. 27 to respond .
Some residents have voiced concern that the noise from the firing range will disrupt their lives .
In response , Blackwater has proposed anti-skid pads and other measures to lessen noise from the driving course , which would operate for up to an hour and a half after sundown .
According to Bonfiglio , a helicopter pad would only be used for emergency landings and could benefit the community in the event of a medical emergency .
Conflict of interest Residents also raise concerns over the role of San Diego County officials in expediting the project .
An article in the San Diego Reader concluded that Potrero residents are being " ambushed " by " county bureaucrats marching alongside Blackwater USA . "
Documents filed with the county indicate Blackwater officials have been meeting privately with Department of Planning and Land Use personnel since at least May of 2006 .
Members of the public in Potrero did not learn of the proposed project until Oct. 12 at the earliest .
One whistleblower contends that failure to notify the public until late in the planning process may violate the California Environmental Quality Act ; others allege that County planners may have violated the Brown Act , which mandates open meetings .
Environmentalist Duncan McFetridge questions why residents werent included in early planning .
" It is as close to collusion as you can get without actually being illegal ,  McFetridge says .
 I am convinced that one of the main reasons that Blackwater came to San Diego is that we are the capital of privatization where lines between private and public sectors is a total blur . "
 In San Diego we do n't have revolving doors ,  he added , we have tunnels between politicians and profiteers . "
A spokesperson for San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob denied that Blackwater has received special treatment .
" That would be illegal , " the employee said , declining to be named .
The streamlined procedures , she said , were created after " ample public input , " in response to complaints that development projects were taking four years for approval .
Jacobs representative suggested that it would be inappropriate for the supervisor to speak with media regarding the Blackwater project , as she may have to vote on it eventually .
Several community members noted , however , that Jacob had no such qualms about speaking out against a proposed high - rise Indian casino near her own ranch in Jamul .
One citizen opposed to the project revealed that Lori Sparlisted with the California Bar Association as an attorney with a law firm representing Blackwater on July 31 , 2006 has since unexpectedly surfaced as a land use / environmental planner for the Department of Planning and Land Use .
" She walked into our Mar. 1 , 2007 Save Potrero meeting , representing the County , " said former Potrero planner Carl Meyer .
After RAW STORY inquired about her ties to Blackwater , the Department of Planning removed her from the project .
Quality of life concerns Area residents express alarm about disruption of their quiet , rural lifestyle and are skeptical of reassurances offered by Blackwater and local officials .
Dania Raum purchased property in Potrero three years ago " because it was so beautiful and peaceful . "
Asked about the proposed project site , she replied , " It s a secret , hidden valley .
There are wetlands up there and all kinds of raptor birds . "
Golden eagles nest 3,500 feet north of the meadow , she observed .
Blackwater has offered to supply foraging materials for the eagles .
But Raum scoffed at the idea of raptors foraging near a firing range .
" Right , " she said .
" Those eagles are going to be so gone ...
I believe we are being railroaded into this disaster . "
" Can you imagine tire squealing and crash em ups ?  she added .
 They are pushing this as a night time course ... so they will have machine guns going all day and cars going all night . "
Raum doesnt believe Blackwater 's claims that noise can be muffled .
" My son was way across the valley on a horse , and I could hear him coughing , " she said .
" It echoes for miles up there . "
Hammers insists that the planning group is relying on scientific evidence that residents will not hear noise from the proposed facility .
A recent noise test was canceled , reportedly due to liability concerns on the part of property owners .
San Diego County is now relying entirely on computer models to assess noise levels .
Safety and environmental concerns Residents also cite safety issues involving excessive traffic on a winding access road measuring at some points just 20 feet wide .
Critics cite high fatality rates on nearby Highway 94 and raise alarm over Blackwaters plan to bus in local trainees and bring additional people from the airport on shuttles .
Blackwater says its vehicles would be no larger than trucks that previously serviced the ranch .
Fire safety also concerns locals .
Blackwater 's Brian Bonfiglio asserted that the company proposed to local fire authorities a plan to not only shelter - in - place its own employees and facilities in the event of wildfire but also make Blackwaters site a " safe haven for the community . "
However , a February 2007 report on guidelines for wildland fire and fire protection prepared for the County describes shelter - in - place as a " last resort design concept . 
Critics warn that the policy could prove a death sentence in the event of a firestorm similar to the nearby 2003 Cedar wildfire , where twelve people died as 300 - foot high flames reached temperatures of thousands of degrees .
" This strategy has , to my knowledge , never been put to the test on a large scale during a major wildland fire , " Joseph W. Mitchell , Ph.D. of M- bar Technologies and Consulting in Ramona , California wrote in response to the Countys proposal .
" There are reasons to believe that it could lead to civilian and firefighter deaths and injuries as currently envisioned . "
Duncan McFetridge , of Save Our Forests and Ranchlands , has raised additional concerns about the loss of potentially crucial wilderness areas , noting that national forest lands have shrunk from two million to 650,000 acres .
" Meadowlands are the biological heart of our forest , " he said at a recent meeting .
" We can not lose our meadows without losing our forest . "
Bonfiglio responded to criticisms on environmental grounds with the observation that no studies have been approved by San Diego County .
" There are people concerned about habitat and open space , but they are doing it based on no science , no information , " he said .
McFetridge successfully blocked a proposed RV park in neighboring Descanso after citing a study by the University of California , Davis , tracking mountain lion movement .
The Potrero valley proposed for Blackwaters project is also frequented by deer and mountain lion , he said .
 This is a contest ,  McFetridge remarked .
 Blackwater USA is very good at what they do -- and Save Our Forests and Ranchlands is very good at what we do .
This battle will be won or lost on land use issues . "
Citizen activism
To win approval of the project , Blackwater must obtain a change in zoning on the property , which is currently zoned agricultural .
McFetridge believes the project can be defeated on land use issues and cites data from radio - tracking of cougars that highlights the sensitive nature of meadowlands on the property .
Other groups have also joined the battle to block Blackwaters camp .
" I will work hard to block this deal , " said Raymond Lutz , head of Citizens Oversight Panels , a grassroots organization .
" Blackwater is well known as one of the most egregious violators of human rights in the Iraq War ...
We dont need a `black - ops training camp in San Diego . "
Bob Davis , a member of the San Diego Peace & Justice Coalition , fears that civil disobedience may be needed to halt the project , stating " We may have to put our bodies on the line . "
Citizens are organizing opposition and public protests for the Apr. 5 meeting at the Department of Planning and Land Use .
" You can bet that Blackwater is lobbying the DPLU and its staff , " Sierra Club land use committee chair Jeanette Hartman said .
" Your only hope is to lobby back .
Fight everything .
If you dont , theyll just roll right over you here . "
Correction : Due to an editing error , Lori Spar 's status change was incorrectly identified .
She was removed from the Blackwater project , not the planning board .
A new study of worldwide technological competitiveness suggests China may soon rival the United States as the principal driver of the world 's economy -- a position the U.S. has held since the end of World War II .
If that happens , it will mark the first time in nearly a century that two nations have competed for leadership as equals .
The study 's indicators predict that China will soon pass the United States in the critical ability to develop basic science and technology , turn those developments into products and services -- and then market them to the world .
Though China is often seen as just a low - cost producer of manufactured goods , the new " High Tech Indicators " study done by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology clearly shows that the Asian powerhouse has much bigger aspirations .
" For the first time in nearly a century , we see leadership in basic research and the economic ability to pursue the benefits of that research -- to create and market products based on research -- in more than one place on the planet , " said Nils Newman , co-author of the National Science Foundation - supported study .
" Since World War II , the United States has been the main driver of the global economy .
Now we have a situation in which technology products are going to be appearing in the marketplace that were not developed or commercialized here .
We wo n't have had any involvement with them and may not even know they are coming . "
Georgia
Tech has been gathering the high tech indicators since the mid-1980s , when the concern was which country would be the " next Japan " as a competitive producer and exporter of technology products .
The current " HTI - 2007 " information was gathered for use in the NSF 's biennial report , " Science and Engineering Indicators , " the most recent of which was released January 15 .
Georgia Tech 's " High Tech Indicators " study ranks 33 nations relative to one another on " technological standing , " an output factor that indicates each nation 's recent success in exporting high technology products .
Four major input factors help build future technological standing : national orientation toward technological competitiveness , socioeconomic infrastructure , technological infrastructure and productive capacity .
Each of the indicators is based on a combination of statistical data and expert opinions .
A chart showing change in the technological standing of the 33 nations is dominated by one feature -- a long and continuous upward line that shows China moving from " in the weeds " to world technological leadership over the past 15 years .

The 2007 statistics show China with a technological standing of 82.8 , compared to 76.1 for the United States , 66.8 for Germany and 66.0 for Japan .
Just 11 years ago , China 's score was only 22.5 .
The United States peaked in 1999 with a score of 95.4 .
" China has really changed the world economic landscape in technology , " said Alan Porter , another study co-author and co-director of the Georgia Tech Technology Policy and Assessment Center , which conducted the research .
" When you take China 's low - cost manufacturing and focus on technology , then combine them with the increasing emphasis on research and development , the result ultimately wo n't leave much room for other countries . "
The United States and Japan have both fallen in relative technological standing -- though not absolute measures -- because of the dramatic rise of China and other nations such as the " Asian Tigers : " South Korea , Singapore and Taiwan .
Japan has faltered a bit over time , and if the increasingly - integrated European Union were considered one entity instead of 27 separate countries , it would surpass the United States .
" We are seeing consistent gains for China across all the criteria we measure , " Newman said .
" As a percentage mover relative to everyone else , we have not seen a stumble for China .
The gains have been dramatic , and there is no real sense that any kind of leveling off is occurring . "
Most industrialized countries reach a kind of equilibrium in the study , moving up slightly in one data set , or down slightly in another .
But the study shows no interruptions in China 's advance .

Recent statistics for the value of technology products exported -- a key component of technological standing -- put China behind the United States by the amount of " a rounding error : " about $ 100 million .
If that trend continues , Newman noted , China will shortly pass the United States in that measure of technological leadership .
China 's emphasis on training scientists and engineers -- who conduct the research needed to maintain technological competitiveness -- suggests it will continue to grow its ability to innovate .
In the United States , the training of scientists and engineers has lagged , and post - 9/11 immigration barriers have kept out international scholars who could help fill the gap .
" For scientists and engineers , China now has less than half as many as we do , but they have a lot of growing room , " noted Newman .
" It would be difficult for the United States to get much better in this area , and it would be very easy for us to get worse .
It would be very easy for the Chinese to get better because they have more room to maneuver . "
China is becoming a leader in research and development , Porter noted .
For instance , China now leads the world in publications on nanotechnology , though U.S. papers still receive more citations .
On the input indicators calculated for 2007 , China lags behind the United States .
In " national orientation , " China won a score of 62.6 , compared to 78.0 for the United States .
In " socioeconomic infrastructure , " China rated 61.2 , compared to 87.9 for the United States .
In the other two factors , China also was behind the U.S. , 60.0 versus 95.5 for " technological infrastructure " and 85.2 versus 93.4 for " productive capacity . "
China has been dramatically improving its input scores , which portends even stronger technological competitiveness in the future .
" It 's like being 40 years old and playing basketball against a competitor who 's only 12 years old -- but is already at your height , " Newman said .
" You are a little better right now and have more experience , but you 're not going to squeeze much more performance out .
The future clearly does n't look good for the United States . "
How many times must we tell the tale ?
How many times must we fall ?

Human nature is to spend everything you make .
It takes discipline to save money and accumulate wealth , and most people do not have it .
When house prices were rising , every homeowner suddenly faced with a dramatic increase in their yearly “ income , ” if they drank the kool aid and learned to view appreciation as income .
Many , many people did what human nature would compel them to do — they took this free money and spent it .
Given the pressures in Orange County to look and act rich , the temptation of all this “ unliberated equity ” was too much for many to resist .
Pretending to be making a great deal of money and being rich became a way of life to many in Irvine .
It went on for so long , it became part of their identity .
These people actually believed they were rich .
The influx of free money through appreciation was considered an entitlement for homeowners ; something that would go on forever .
Some have argued rampant equity extraction was not widespread , and it will not be the cause of many foreclosures .
As an observer of human nature , I would argue this was very widespread ; it had to be .
The chart above illustrates the dramatic increase in mortgage equity extraction .
It serves as a testament to the foolishness of many homeowners .
Your average person cannot stay out of credit card debt , what would lead someone to believe they would treat mortgage debt any differently , particularly when they believed their house would go up in value and pay for it ?
Often times the lessons we learn in youth stay with us for a lifetime .
When these are good lessons , they serve us well for our lives ; when they are bad lessons …
I did not pay much attention to mortgage matters in my household growing up , but I know my parents never overextended themselves to buy a house , and they never took out equity to spend on things .
In fact , it would have never even occurred to them to do so .
Perhaps it is my Midwestern upbringing , or perhaps it is just not growing up in a bubble market where such things are possible , but when I see the financial behavior of people during the bubble , I am simply astonished .
Perhaps the big picture is easier to grasp when you see specific examples of this phenomenon in action .
Today ’s post is a profile of two pretenders : people who faked being rich for several years by living off their appreciation through mortgage equity extraction .
Sometimes I cannot decide which is more amazing , that people would do this at all , or that they could sustain this lifestyle for so long .

So how did these people manage their mortgage debt ?
They bought the property in December 2001 for $ 328,000 , and they had a $ 307,263 first mortgage .
They put just over $ 20,000 of their own money into the deal .
One year later , they opened a $ 80,000 HELOC .
In 2004 , they refinanced for $ 490,000 taking out about $ 180,000 .
Hopefully , they paid off the HELOC , at least temporarily .
Later that year , they took out a new $ 30,000 HELOC .
Then in July of 2005 , they refinanced again for $ 650,000 with a 1 % Option ARM .
They have owned the house for less than 4 years at this point , and they have withdrawn $ 342,737 .
I guess this was n’t enough , because later in 2005 , they took out three more HELOCs for $ 24,000 , $ 82,000 and $ 24,000 respectively .
This property has at least $ 650,000 in mortgage debt , and assuming they took out and spent the HELOC money ( it would be a continuation of their pattern , ) they have over $ 750,000 in debt to pay off .
So when you look at the $ 799,000 asking price , and think they are doubling their money , think again : if they do n’t get their asking price , this is going to be a short sale .

.
The price is double what they paid , but it is a short sale .
There is only one way to do that : borrow and spend your equity .
This seller is an example of someone who tried to be good , but they were seduced by the dark side .
They bought the place in 1999 , and they put $ 58,200 down .
For three and a half years , they were fiscally responsible and did not expand their mortgage .
In late 2002 , they gave in an refinanced for $ 300,000 taking out their downpayment and a few dollars more .
Apparently , this “ equity liberation ” was rewarding because they opened a $ 90,000 HELOC in the spring of 2003 .
At this point , kool aid intoxication had set in and their journey to the dark side was complete .
The refinanced in late 2003 for $ 390,000 apparently paying off their first HELOC , but they opened another one for $ 100,000 .
That one only lasted until summer of 2004 when they refinanced again for $ 497,000 to pay off their other mortgages .
Having not learned their lesson , they took out another $ 88,000 HELOC a few months later .
By spring of 2006 , they were broke again , so they refinanced for $ 547,000 and took out another $ 100,000 HELOC .
From 2002 to 2006 , they took out and spent $ 414,200 assuming they spent the final HELOC .
So now they have $ 647,000 in debt on a property they paid $ 291,000 for .
A sale at $ 600,000 will not pay off the debt , and it will be a short sale .
It was a great run , was n’t it ?
They had 4 years of pretending they were rich .
So what do you think about this behavior ?
Think about the impact this money had on our local economy , and think about what it will mean when this money disappears .
Do you see why I contend we will have a severe local recession ?
Pretending …
.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Brittney for researching these properties and providing me with this information .
Without her hard work , I would not be able to bring these stories to you , and these stories need to be told .
Some people feel our work here is an invasion of privacy ( despite all the information being public record . )
These people and those who behaved in a similar fashion deserve to be exposed to the general public .
This behavior should be scrutinized for what it is : irresponsible .
If these owners find it humiliating , then perhaps they wo n’t do it again …
No , who am I kidding ?
They will do it again .

Sharing the faith - and a beer - in a smoky Tokyo bar
In societies where life is busier than ever , where cities are swelling and families dispersed , the religious rituals of yesterday do not seem so relevant .
But in Japan , a group of Buddhist monks are trying to change that .
They have secured a regular spot at a jazz bar where they seek to enlighten and entertain .
Chippie Sound Music
Bar is tiny and full of smoke - not incense , though , but cigarette smoke .
This is a bar after all .
There is cold beer on tap and a cool crooner on the stereo .
It 's amazing .
The Shomyo sounded great .
I feel really relaxed
Bar visitor
This is not normally where you would expect to find a trio of monks .
But Hogen Natori and his two friends believe this is as good a place as any to spread the word about Buddhism .
As they make their way to the stage they ring a small bell .
The small crowd falls silent .
Then the chanting begins and strangely haunting melodies fill the space .
It is Shomyo chanting , a style of Buddhist chant found only in Japan .
Warm response
This is what you might call " Buddhism - lite " though .
It is performance , not preaching .
After their first session on the stage , which lasts about 20 minutes , they sit down with the audience for a drink and a chat .
Come and join us .
We are telling people what Buddhism is , what monks are
Hogen Natori
One of the monks gets a bag of balloons out of his pocket and starts sculpting balloon flowers for some of the older ladies sitting around the room .
" Many Japanese do n't want to come to temple , " Hogen Natori says .
He is standing behind the bar where he has lit up a cigarette as he chats with the drinkers .
" They think Buddhism is very difficult , and deep and serious , but Buddhism is much more than that - exciting , funny even .
I want to spread this kind of teaching . "
He feels people are more receptive in a bar , when they are drinking and with friends .
Relaxing sounds
He gets a warm response from the crowd .
Some are a little older than you might normally expect to find in a bar like this , but they are clearly charmed by the younger monks .
" It was wonderful , " says one woman .
" It was my first time but I am really glad I came to listen to it .
The chanting itself was superb and so close by .
It was wonderful . "
The monks have faced criticism of their decision to perform in bars
Another first - timer was similarly impressed .
" It 's amazing , " he said .
" The Shomyo sounded great .
I feel really relaxed . "
The monks say that their decision to perform in bars like this has upset some Buddhists .
One woman told them they should not " lower themselves " in this way .
" What do you say to your critics ? " I ask Hogen Natori .
" Come and join us , " he replies .
" We are telling people what Buddhism is , what monks are .
" When people hear our chants they look relieved , " he adds .
" How nice ! "
Then it is time to get back on stage for the second half .
Again silence , and then again the haunting chants of a bygone age , the three shaven - headed monks in their grey robes kneeling in front of us , sharing their faith with the drinkers .
The Republican leadership in the House has voted to allow for Cheney 's impeachment to reach the House floor .
They think that the Democrats would be losers in the impeachment process .
It is my position that the Democrats would be BIG WINNERS if they understood the constitution and what the public wants .
Below are the positive points that would bolster their position with the media and the voters :
- The MSM and the Republicans are calling Democrats gutless .
- Courage of conviction is admirable and what the voters want .
- It would allow Democrats to argue that patriotism is more important than party loyalty .
- Bush would not be sidetracked because he would not be the target
- Cheney 's popular polls are very low .
- Cheney is the perfect villain for the Democrats as the ultimate neocon .
- Impeachment is purely a legislative process that cannot be challenged by the other branches .
- Legislative subpoenas could not be challenged by executive privilege .
- Failure to cooperate by Cheney could cause a charge of contempt of Congress .
- The Capitol Police would have full powers to arrest and seize documents .
- Technically the Capitol Police could seize Cheney 's walk in safe and arrest him .
- The impeachment trial would expose all of the criminal activity of this Administration .
- It would be leverage to negotiate an end of the war in Iraq in that Congress could drop the proceedings if Bush / Cheney agree to withdraw the troops .
- The House and Senate could finish their legislative agenda before the Senate trial
.
- Other Congressional business can be done while the trial is proceeding .

US judge forces Condi Rice and senior officials to testify about Israel 's influence over the government
Rice to be subpoenaed in espionage case
Judge OKs calls for intel officials to discuss talks with pro-Israel lobbyists
WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and more than a dozen other current and former intelligence officials must testify about their conversations with pro-Israel lobbyists , a federal judge ruled Friday in an espionage case .
Lawyers for two former American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobbyists facing charges have subpoenaed Rice , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley , Deputy National Security Adviser Elliott Abrams and several others to testify at their trial next year .
Prosecutors had challenged the subpoenas in federal court .
Lobbyists Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman maintain the Israeli interest group played an unofficial but sanctioned role in crafting foreign policy and that Rice and others can confirm it .
If they ultimately testify in court , the trial in federal court in suburban Alexandria , Va. could offer a behind - the - scenes look at the way U.S. foreign policy is crafted .
Criminal or diplomatic ?
The lobbyists are accused of receiving classified information from a now - convicted Pentagon official and relaying it to an Israeli official and the press .
The information included details about the al - Qaida terror network , U.S. policy in Iran and the bombing of the Khobar Towers dormitory in Saudi Arabia , federal prosecutors said .
But defense attorneys argued that top U.S. officials regularly used the lobbyists as a go - between as they crafted Middle East policy .
If so , attorneys say , how are Rosen and Weissman supposed to know the same behavior that 's expected of them on one day is criminal the next ?
U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III said the lobbyists have a right to argue that " they believed the meetings charged in the indictment were simply further examples of the government 's use of AIPAC as a diplomatic back channel . "
Defense attorney Abbe Lowell cheered the ruling .
" For over two years , we have been explaining that our clients ' conduct was lawful and completely consistent with how the U.S. government dealt with AIPAC and other foreign policy groups , " Lowell said on behalf of both defendants .
" We look forward to the trial . "
Ellis left open the possibility that the Bush administration may challenge the subpoenas on the grounds they would reveal privileged information .
But the judge said his ruling Friday " may trump a valid governmental privilege . "
If so , that could force the government to decide whether to allow the testimony or drop the case .
Neither the State Department nor the Justice Department had an immediate comment .
Among those subpoenaed in the case were : former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz ; former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage ; and Marc Grossman , former undersecretary of state for political affairs .

A Texas prosecutor who was accused of using the word " Canadian " as a racial slur in an e-mail could be part of the focus of an ongoing probe into the actions of another district attorney .
The e-mail , sent out in 2003 by Harris County assistant district attorney Mike Trent , has recently come to light as part of an investigation of Harris County Texas District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal , who is accused of sending racist and sexist e-mails .
In 2003 , Trent sent a staff - wide e-mail congratulating his colleague Robert Freyer for winning a conviction .
In the e-mail , Trent wrote : " He overcame a subversively good defense by Matt Hennessey that had some Canadians on the jury feeling sorry for the defendant and forced them to do the right thing . "
In fact , there were no Canadians on the jury , but there were some African - Americans .
The e-mail drew criticism from some who said the word " Canadian " is a racial slur against African - Americans , and questioned Trent whether he was using it in that context .
Trent denied the charge , saying he had been speaking with Freyer earlier and that Freyer had used the word Canadian in a conversation about the case .
' Do you guys think I 'm crazy ? '
From that conversation , Trent said he believed there were actual Canadians who had sat on the jury .
When Trent asked Freyer what he meant by Canadians , Trent said Freyer told him he had used " Canadians " to describe " liberals " on the jury , the Texas Lawyer reported .
" Do you guys think I 'm crazy ? "
Trent wrote recently in a blog post .
" Am I insanely stupid enough to send a racial slur to 250 lawyers ?
Litigious , complaint - ready lawyers , some of whom are African - American ?
That is just absurd . "
Trent has suggested it was reasonable to believe Canadians may have been on the jury because all that is needed to be a juror is to have a valid U.S. driver 's licence .
But the Harris County District Clerk 's Office told the Texas Lawyer that Canadians could only sit on a jury if they also have U.S. citizenship or they slipped through the system designed to eliminate non-U.S. citizens as prospective jurors .
" In retrospect , I realize I should have questioned this more , " Trent wrote .
Trent has apologized to those who were offended by what he wrote .
He has also noted that in 2006 he received an award from the Anti-Defamation League for prosecuting a hate crime .
Events Planned for March 10 - 19 , 2008 , to Resist the U.S. Occupation of Iraq , Oppose New Wars , Demand Impeachment

Details here .
MARCH 10 to 12 , 2008 ( Monday to Wednesday ) in Washington , D.C. : Stop - Loss Congress
This March , while tens of thousands of Americans in Washington , D.C. , and all over the United States will be participating in acts of nonviolent civil disobedience to protest the ongoing occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , and involuntarily deployed U.S. soldiers and innocent civilian victims will begin another year of occupation , torture , and murder , U.S. congress members will be on vacation ( from the 15th to 30th , technically a “ district work period ” ) , ignoring the killing and suffering they have enabled , supported , and financed .
To intensify the irony , Congress has condoned a widespread stop - loss policy in the military which requires soldiers to involuntarily extend their tours and prolong the killing .
It is time to Stop - Loss Congress !
On Monday March 10 , and Tuesday March 11 , we will deliver “ official ” stop - loss notices to all members of Congress in their Capitol Hill offices .
These will notify them that all of their LEAVES , VACATIONS and HOME VISITS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED until further notice .
Just as they require that active - duty personnel endure involuntary extensions of their tours of duty , we , the people for whom they work , are notifying them that they , too , will have their tours of duty INVOLUNTARILY EXTENDED until every foreign soldier and mercenary is out of Iraq , and home .
When all the troops and contractors get home , then Congress can go home , and no sooner .
Monday evening March 10 : Party at George Washington University with political HIP HOP performers SON of NUN and HEAD ROC along with a great DJ from B’more for dancing .
Admission is by donation .
Tuesday evening March 11 : Premiere of the documentary short “ DAD ON FIRE BLUES ” by filmmaker Scott Haman at BUSBOYS & POETS in Washington , D.C. Carlos Arredondo will speak .
Rick Burnley will recite poetry .
There will be flamenco music .
Afterward , there will be folk music at Saint Stephens Church .
On Wednesday March 12 , we will take nonviolent action on Capitol Hill , to ensure that , while thousands of Iraqis , Afghanis , and foreign invaders die and are injured for life , the members of Congress and their staffs do not go home but remain to DO THEIR DUTY , and immediately end the funding of the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan .
No members of Congress goes home until THE TROOPS COME HOME .
Also on Wednesday March 12 : Ghosts of War .
To participate in planning these events , to learn meeting times and places , to help distribute flyers and organize travel , training , and other preparation , join this listserve .

Cirrhosis is a major killer in the UK
US researchers say that the growth of scarring around the organ might be stopped by blocking a vital protein which helps it to form .
The research , in the journal PLoS Online , could also eventually help patients with lung problems and burns .
The British Liver Trust said that any treatment which lessened scarring would help patients .
Our latest finding proves that we can actually reverse the damage
Dr Martina Buck
UC San Diego Medical Center
Heavy alcohol use and hepatitis can lead to a process called fibrosis in the liver , which involves the formation of excessive scar tissue .
Cirrhosis happens when this scarring becomes too severe , interfering with the way the liver works .
Currently doctors can do little more than try to prevent more damage by changing the patient 's lifestyle or treating the virus which caused it .
Damage reversal ?
The researchers at the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine have halted the formation of the scar tissue by blocking a protein called RSK , which is released naturally by the body as part of the healing process .
The scientists used mice with severe liver fibrosis , some of which were given a chemical which countered RSK .
Those mice had no further liver fibrosis , while those who did n't receive the chemical showed signs of more damage .
Dr Martina Buck , who led the study , said she felt that the treatment might be able to go further , and actually repair damage already caused .
" Our latest finding proves that we can actually reverse the damage , " she said .
The researchers said that other conditions involving fibrosis , such as pulmonary fibrosis and scarring around burn injuries , could also potentially benefit .
A spokesman for the British Liver Trust said that the research was promising : " This is clearly in very early stages and the real test will be when a treatment is developed to safely block progression of damage in the livers of patients with liver disease and reverse their fibrosis .
" Irrespective of whether cirrhosis is fully reversible there is clearly a lot of benefit to be derived from reducing the amount of liver fibrosis as this allows the liver cells to resume normal function . "

CHARLES GIBSON : Let me start with , did you put too much faith in President Musharraf ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : President Musharraf is , right after September the 11th , was asked whether he was with the United States or with the radicals and extremists who had come to kill our citizens .
And he said , he 's with you , he 's been a loyal ally in fighting terrorists .
He 's also advanced democracy in Pakistan .
He has , he has said he 's going to take off his uniform , he 's said there will be elections .
Today he released prisoners , and so far I 've found him to be a man of his word .
And the fundamental question I have for President Musharraf is , will these elections be under emergency rule or law , because if they are , it 's going to be hard for --
CHARLES GIBSON : It 'd be a sham .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : -- well , it 'll be hard for those of us who , have belief that he 's advanced Pakistan 's democracy to , to say that 's , that 's still the case .
So , we 'll see .
Things are unfolding in Pakistan .
But he 's been a strong ally of the United States , and I certainly hope he succeeds .
CHARLES GIBSON :
Is there a line he cannot cross , that he cannot cross , something that would go too far , where you might say to yourself , ' OK , that 's enough ? '
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
Well , he has n't crossed the line .
As a matter of fact , I do n't think that , uh , he will cross any lines .
I think he truly is somebody who believes in democracy .
And he made a decision , we did n't necessarily agree with his decision , to impose emergency rule , and I , my , hopefully he 'll get , get rid of the rule .
Today I thought was a pretty good signal that he released thousands of people from jail .
CHARLES GIBSON : But he says he believes in democracy but this state of emergency , which he says he needs to do to fight terrorism , all he 's done is arrest political opponents , he 's arrested lawyers , he 's arrested human rights people .
It looks more about saving his own political skin ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Well , as I say , he has done more for Democracy in Pakistan than , than any modern leader has , and one of the reasons you 're seeing the blowback that you 're getting in Pakistan is because of the reforms that , that President Musharraf has put in place .
Are we happy with the emergency rule ?
No , we 're not .
Do we , do I understand how important he is in fighting extremists and radicals ?
I do .
And do I believe that he 's going to end up getting Pakistan back on the road to democracy ?
I certainly hope so .
CHARLES GIBSON : Mrs. Bush , you were very outspoken when the Myanmar situation occurred , and the monks were protesting , and very outspoken about the call for sanctions when they would not tolerate protest .
Why is Myanmar and different than Pakistan ?
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
Well , that is n't my … I can't answer that .
I can talk to you about Burma , because that 's what I know the most about , and what I 've studied the most , and know most about what 's going on in those countries .
But there is a difference , and that is , this has been military rule since 1962 or something , and when there were democratic elections in the early nineties , they were never recognized by the military regime , and in fact the leader of the party , the National League for Democracy , that won those elections , has been under house arrest for most of the time since then , Aung San Suu Kyi .
And the , what everyone in the world looked at in the , protest by the Buddhist monks was the violent , crack down on the , on the monks themselves .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yeah , there is a difference in that , Pakistan has been on the road to democracy , Burma had n't been .
And um , I 'm real proud of Laura 's , she 's learned that her voice can be pretty loud in international politics , and has really called the world 's attention to the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese people .
One of the interesting stories , if I might , not to be Mister Interrupter here , but uh , was after my speech at the United Nations where it was pretty clear about Burma , and she got an email from a human rights activist on the Thai border that had gotten to know Laura , heard the comments that I had made at the UN , and emailed Laura as a , as kind of a conduit into the White House .
So it 's a , she 's , her role has been very impressive and very important .
CHARLES GIBSON : Just one more question on Pakistan , are the , are the nuclear weapons , in your mind , safe from Islamic radicals , and can you be sure ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I certainly hope so .
We feel pretty comfortable at this moment in time .
And of course we 'll pay very close attention to , to any , country that has got nuclear weapons .
And , but yeah , I feel good about it right now .
CHARLES GIBSON : Let me turn to Iran , Admiral Fallon , the head of CentCom , said in a recent newspaper interview , he said the military strike against Iran is not in the offing .
It would be a strategic mistake .
Do you agree ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I think it 's very important for us to pursue our objectives diplomatically .
I also know it 's important for all options to remain on the table , and they are on the table .
CHARLES GIBSON : Including military ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yes , sir .
CHARLES GIBSON : So he 's wrong ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
As the Commander in Chief , all options are on the table --
CHARLES GIBSON :
When he says it 's a strategic mistake ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : My , my objective is to solve this issue diplomatically , and I fully intend to , and I believe we can .
But diplomacy is effective when all options are available to a president , and all options are available .
No one wants to use military force to achieve any objective .
But , but it 's important for all parties to understand that , you know , while I 'm optimistic we can solve it diplomatically , options are available to the president .
CHARLES GIBSON : There 's been a lot of bellicose rhetoric that has been aimed at Iran , and you yourself , at a news conference recently , raised the specter of , of World War III if there was a nuclear armed Iran .
Just my curiosity , why not turn the rhetoric around and smother them with kindness , call their bluff and say , look , if you 're seriously interested in nuclear power , we 'll build the nuclear power plants for you ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I 've done that .
You must have not heard it , but we actually did it with Russia .
Russia and , has offered to , you know , construct Bushehr , which is fine .
I supported Russia and said that not only should you build it , but uh , the major suppliers group will provide the fuel and collect the fuel .
And , so Russia and the United States are in concert on that issue .
Matter of fact , I said this in a press conference , that it 's the sovereign right of Iran to have civilian nuclear power , and I agree , and I believe that .
But the problem is , is that it's , what 's dangerous is there desire to learn how to enrich uranium , and , because the enrichment process could lead to a weapon .
Let me , if I might , I might want to comment on what I said about World War III .
I said , if you want to avoid World War III .
And the reason I said that is because I take the words of their leader very seriously when , for example , he says he wants to destroy Israel .
And you know , an attack on Israel , as far as I 'm concerned , would draw the United States into a very serious conflagration in the Middle East .
At least it would under my presidency .
And secondly I think it 's very important for our partners who are in the United Nations , for example , to understand that now is the time to work diplomatically to convince the Iranians to change their behavior .
And so , our strategy is clear , and I hope it's , I think it 's working .
You know the reason why I say that is because , one , there are people at the table that , you know , first were a little , little reluctant , and did n't take the Iranian threat seriously .
Secondly , Iran is beginning to feel a sense of isolation .
And thirdly , my rhetoric , by the way , is aimed to the Iranian people , which is , and I 'll be glad to repeat it here , which is that you 've had a grand history , and a great tradition .
Our beef is not with the Iranian people , it is with the government that is , you know , has hidden programs from international inspectors , has made very bellicose statements about how they intend to conduct foreign policy , that is promoting terror through organizations like Hezbollah , that is disrupting young democracies like Iraq and Lebanon , and therefore as a result of the actions of your government , you 're becoming isolated , and you can do better .
CHARLES GIBSON : Let me turn to Iraq .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yes , sir .
CHARLES GIBSON : You took a lot of doubting and rather skeptical questions about the surge .
I 'll give you a chance to crow .
Do you want to say , I told you so ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : [ LAUGHS ]
No , I do n't , because the decision , while it was a tough decision was really studied , and uh , and it was based upon the recommendations of wise military commanders .
CHARLES GIBSON : Do n't you take some satisfaction , though , in the fact that the , that the levels of violence have come down so far ?
CHARLES GIBSON : Absolutely , primarily because I , you know , I hurt when America loses a soldier anywhere , and it breaks my heart to think about loved ones who will miss a child , or a husband .
And having said that , I 'm thrilled for the Iraqis that they 're beginning to see enough security so that reconciliation is taking place as well as in , as the economy is beginning to move .
CHARLES GIBSON : Well , that 's the flip side , and that 's the reconciliation issue .
You said the design of this is to give the Iraqi government breathing space , to bring about reconciliation .
We 've got a reporter right now who 's embedded with the 1st Cav , and I talked to him yesterday , and he said that 's all they 're talking about .
He quoted a captain to me , we 've gone as far militarily as we can go .
The coalition cannot make reconciliation .
And then they go on with their impatience and their frustration , that reconciliation is n't coming --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I do n't know what province this person is in , but this province , if this person were in Anbar Province , which used to be the al Qaeda stronghold , they would see enormous amounts of reconciliation taking place as these , Sunni sheiks are stepping up and beginning to take the lead at the local level .
If he 's referring to , if this person 's referring to laws being passed by the parliament , he 's right in terms of a de-Baathification law , for example .
On the other hand , they 're just in the process of passing yet another budget which will distribute monies from the central government to provincial governments .
But there , as well there 's a lot of local reconciliation taking place .
I mean , after all , I , welcomed , you remember the Sheik that got killed ?
Well , his brother came , he 's now assumed the mantle of the --
CHARLES GIBSON : This is in Anbar ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yeah .
But they 're reaching out beyond Anbar , these Sunni sheiks are .
And he said to me , he came to the White House , and he said , you know , here 's what I 'd like , I 'd like the following things .
It 's like dealing with a county judge in Texas in a way .
Here is what the local folks want , I represent the local folks .
And he asked me , he said , would you mind meeting with some of the Shia Sheiks that I have gotten to know ?
And my only point to you is , is that , the captain 's remarks are true in this sense , the Iraqis are going to have to , you know , obviously take the leap politically , which they are beginning to do .
My , my advice to him is that you have to be somewhat patient .
One , because the grass roots reconciliation is beginning to translate into national , national changes .
But also , these are people who are learning what it means to be involved in democracy .
They , they 're adjusting , they have n't had the same experiences that we 've had .
CHARLES GIBSON : Let me turn to politics , and the real political pro in the family .
A year from now , a year from this day , we 're gonna now who has custody of this cottage for the next four years .
You got a gut sense as to who it 's gonna be ?
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
No , I have absolutely no idea .
No idea , I do n't know who our nominee 's gonna be from the Republican Party and …
So we 'll have a very interesting year watching from the sidelines , and I 'm glad we 'll be on the sidelines this time .
CHARLES GIBSON : He 's got a sister who 's endorsed one candidate , a nephew who 's endorsed another , a second nephew who 's endorsed a third , ca n't these Bushes … get together --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Stay together ?
[ LAUGHS ]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Either that or my mother wisely has said , okay , you pick this camp , you pick that camp , you pick this camp .
CHARLES GIBSON : Should n't the family be united on this , they 're -- they stick together pretty well --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : I can -- I 'll tell you this , they will be united behind the Republican whoever it is when the nomination is finished and we know who it is .
CHARLES GIBSON : And Mr. President , three months from now , we 'll know who the nominees are , essentially , this thing is so front - loaded --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Amazing , is n't it , yeah .
Uh , you know --
CHARLES GIBSON : What 's your sense of , of who it 'll be .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I 'm like Laura , I really do n't know , um …uh , and if I did n't I would n't wanna opine about it .
CHARLES GIBSON : You said --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I have a sense -- I have a sense that , um … I think , I think we 're gonna wanna reevaluate a primary system that gets so front - end - loaded .
It 's , I 'm not sure what to think about it , I do -- I , I , I , I know people are adjusting , all the campaigns are coming up with game -- new game plans , but …
CHARLES GIBSON :
This thing has been going for a year .
And , I wonder to what extent it inhibits your ability to get anything done in Washington and to govern .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yeah .
I do n't think so , I do n't -- certainly not on foreign policy .
Um …
CHARLES GIBSON : But you 're not gonna get immigration done in this year , you 're not --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : No --
CHARLES GIBSON : -- gonna get Social Security reform done --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : No , I know --
CHARLES GIBSON : -- you 're not gonna get health - care reform done because everything is so politicized --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
We may get some health - care reform done .
But you 're right , it 's , uh , you know , and we 're not gonna raise taxes .
Unless they can override my vetos .
CHARLES GIBSON :
And it 's almost impossible to get war funding worked out --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
We 'll get something done on the vets -- oh , we 'll get war funding .
CHARLES GIBSON : You will .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Absolutely .
CHARLES GIBSON : But -- but we 're gonna go through all kinds of political handstands --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
And should n't --
CHARLES GIBSON : -- first .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
And should n't , as a matter of fact on that issue , the Congress , uh , oughta put aside their … philosophical differences with , you know , with the decision I made , uh , on Iraq , and fund these troops .
We 'll get something -- we 'll get a lot , we 'll get some , good stuff done on veterans , we got the Dole - Shelala Commission , made some very strong recommendations that the administration strongly supports .
We -- we -- we can get some positive things done , but you 're right , you know , you get beyond June or July , heading into those conventions , it 's … pretty much Presidential politics --
CHARLES GIBSON : But it almost goes back to last June and July that everything has had a -- has been seen through a political prism in Washington .
If there 's one thing you could get done , one thing , that you could get done in your last year of office , what would it be ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
That 's , make sure those vets get , uh , uh , you know , a modern … system that is … where the bureaucracy functions as smoothly as possible , and that -- I believe we will , get some positive things done for the veterans .
CHARLES GIBSON :
You have said you do n't wanna comment politically but you did tell a book author that you thought Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I did .
[ LAUGHS ]
I got caught .
[ LAUGHTER ]
I do , I think she 's a very formidable candidate , and , one -- one of the interesting things , that she brings is that she has been under pressure .
She understands the klieg lights .
You know what I 'm talking about .
CHARLES GIBSON : Sure .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
You are the klieg lights .
And , [ LAUGHS ]
And it's , … you , it 's … Heading out to -- heading into this stretch in the primaries and heading into the general election , is , is really the difference between minor leagues and big leagues .
And --
CHARLES GIBSON : You wanna get caught on the Republican side too ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : No , I do n't , I really , I really , believe the race is wide open .
Uh , and … it 's , it 's hard for me to gau -- I do n't have a sense , I do n't have -- ' cause I 'm not out there talking to the --
In order to determine how well somebody 's doing you gotta get a sense of that grassroots … and how they 're feeling or who 's organized because these early states , Iowa and New Hampshire , voter turn - out is really important .
CHARLES GIBSON : Mrs. Bush , what 's the -- from your perspective , what do you think is the one thing … that these candidates , do n't know or probably underestimate , about being President .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Oh -- about being President --
CHARLES GIBSON : Yep .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : I -- you know , I do n't know , I have no idea , but , I think that maybe , what the American people do n't know , is how difficult it is to run for president .
To run for office , and how much , both emotional and physical stamina you need , to run for office , and I think that 's what , George is talking about and that 's …
You know , I think that -- people do n't see it really .
You just do n't have any idea until you 're really involved in it .
What it means to travel around the country and speak over and over …
CHARLES GIBSON : You -- you said --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : -- again .
CHARLES GIBSON : You said it 's grueling .
And candidates get tired and make mistakes .
You see any made so far ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Oh , I 'm sure there are , uh --
CHARLES GIBSON : How about Obama saying that he would meet without preconditions with --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : [ LAUGHS ]
CHARLES GIBSON : -- the leaders of Cuba , Venezuela , North Korea .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I thought that was a …odd foreign policy , but , uh , I 'm , I 'm really -- [ LAUGHS ]
I 'm gonna try to stay outta these races .
I would tell you what I think , uh , these candidates do n't really understand is how complex the environment is inside the Oval Office .
And how important it is , to have a set of principles from which you will not deviate , and , so that you can make good sound decisions .
It is impossible I … maybe not , but I think it 's impossible for anybody to fully comprehend , you know , how much incoming there is --
CHARLES GIBSON : Yeah .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : -- into the Oval Office , and therefore it 's important , to have a very orderly … disciplined process , that enables people to come in and give you their opinion , in a timely fashion , so that there 's enough data available for the President to deal with the problems in the world .
CHARLES GIBSON : Can they know … the psychological and maybe even , physical … burden , and pressure , of dealing with post - 9/11 homeland security issues --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : No , you can't .
Uh , it 's , it 's , you just have to -- I mean but this has been the case throughout the presidency .
Till you actually get in there , and understand the responsibilities that come with the office , you can't possibly , you can't possibly comprehend it , I 'll tell you one thing that 'll surprise 'em if they 've got an open heart , is that the prayers of the people will affect 'em in a positive way .
That has been one of the most surprising aspects of the presidency for me .
CHARLES GIBSON : Do you see it on wearing on him ?
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Sure . [ LAUGHTER ]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I thought I was doing pretty good .
[ LAUGHTER ]
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
He 's doing great but , I mean the seven years have flown by , they really have --
CHARLES GIBSON : Have they --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : -- and we know this last year will fly by too .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
You know , just last year I was thinking about , how to deal with Iraq , I -- you know , I was , I was part of the people who did n't approve of Iraq .
And when they asked the endless questions , do you approve of Iraq I was one , no , I did n't approve of what 's going on .
And wanted to do something about it and was confronted with a serious , decision .
It was just a year ago … that I was , you know … listening to people and getting ready to make the -- make the decision , and it just seemed like … it was just yesterday , I mean it 's unbelievable how much time 's passed --
CHARLES GIBSON :
If a person has an opportunity , in the role of the First Lady to observe the President and what he goes through for eight years … does that experience prepare the person to be president ?
I — I 'm speaking …
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Yes , in the --
CHARLES GIBSON : -- of course in the abstract --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : -- totally , yeah , exactly , totally in the abstract .
I think you , you certainly know what it 's like , I mean there 's no doubt about it , you know , you know the pressure , there is , you know the difficulties , you know the …
You 're very aware , and we certainly were this way too watching George 's dad , I mean we were very , always very aware of what it was like to serve both the burdens of it and the great parts about it as well , and the wonderful opportunities you had , when you live in the White House and when you have the chance to meet people everywhere --
CHARLES GIBSON : So if the First Lady were to run , previous First Lady were to run for President , that that experience is very helpful .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : I think it 's very helpful , I mean I think it was very helpful for us to have been … around the White House as much as we were when his parents served there --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
And that 's what I meant by she --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : -- she understands the klieg lights and the pressure --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
That 's right .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Having said that I do believe our candidate will beat her , if she happens to be the nominee .
But --
CHARLES GIBSON : Whoever that candidate may be --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Whoever -- whoever he may be in this case .
[ LAUGHTER ]
No question .
There is no question , that , Senator Clinton , understands pressure better than any of the candidates , you know , in the race because she … she under -- she lived in the White House and sees it first -- could see it first - hand .
CHARLES GIBSON : What 's the best part of being President ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Uh -- [ LAUGHS ] … representing the greatest country on the face of the earth is one of the greatest … parts of being President .
Seeing the heroic acts that Americans do on a daily basis , I was in a food bank in Richmond yesterday .
And , the woman running the food bank I would describe as dedicated , focused and spunky .
And , just so proud of her work .
Being -- be -- being the commander - in - chief of a military , of decent , honorable , intelligence , courageous people who volunteer in the face of combat , and , and face the danger .
I mean there 's a lot that is good about this , I can't -- I do n't think you can single out one thing --
CHARLES GIBSON : Do you think about legacy ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
You know , I -- I tell people I read three books on Washington last year and if they 're still writing on the first guy the 43rd guy is n't gonna be around to see it .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Mm-hmm .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
And I really bu -- I really mean that , I spent a lotta time reading about Abraham Lincoln , Abraham Lincoln had no earthly idea that the Gettysburg Address was a great speech .
All he knew is after having given it , he was condemned by a press corps that thought the person that preceded him was much better .
Because it , it , because of the length that his , of his predecessor 's speech .
You know , history , it 's just , it , I , I 've always felt that there needs to be a long leash to history .
That you can't judge a administration , immediately .
And , particularly one that has pushed hard for some big ideas , like , like , my administration has done .
CHARLES GIBSON :
You just , it did n't get much notice , but you just celebrated your 30th wedding anniversary --
BUSHES : [ LAUGHTER ]
CHARLES GIBSON : Congratulations .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
Thank you very much .
CHARLES GIBSON : And may there be 30 more .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
Thank you , sir --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Thank you so much .
CHARLES GIBSON : What do you know about marriage now , that you did n't know 30 years ago .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
Well , a lot I think but … I do n't know , I mean I think when we decided to get married 30 years ago even though we only dated such a brief time I think we knew we would have this kind of close relationship .
And we did n't know we'd have two girls , and , we 're very thankful for them , that 's always what I 'm thankful most at Thanksgiving for because their birthday is this weekend .
So that 's what I 'm reminded of every Thanksgiving .
CHARLES GIBSON : And , and does the pressures of the presidency , and being under the klieg lights … does it bring a couple together or does it put strains on the marriage .
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : I think it really brings us together .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yeah .
I think so too .
It depends on the strength of the marriage .
A weak marriage 'll be torn apart by the pressures .
I would suspect .
A strong marriage , gets stronger .
CHARLES GIBSON : And will there be a White House wedding ?
Not decided yet ?
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
We have n't decided --
CHARLES GIBSON : Gonna work it out this weekend ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Ah , well --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : [ LAUGHS ]
Maybe , hopefully , maybe we can discuss it .
CHARLES GIBSON : Was it in the --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
She just came off the book tour so we have n't …
CHARLES GIBSON : Gotten there ?
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH : Made any plans --
CHARLES GIBSON : Was it in this room that he --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : No , it was behind , Aspen , the presidential cottage .
Uh , Henry came , uh , earlier in the day and said I 'd like to see you .
And --
CHARLES GIBSON : And you knew .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I knew , because I 'd asked Jenna earlier that if Henry ever asks you to marry him , would you say yes .
She said absolutely , I love him .
And he came in and , and gave a very , uh …
CHARLES GIBSON : I heard you made him sweat --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : -- adept presentation .
[ LAUGHS ]
Well , yeah , a slight bit , not a lot .
CHARLES GIBSON : How long did you make him sweat .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Not too long --
CHARLES GIBSON : ' Cause I have personal experience in this .
[ LAUGHTER ]
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Uh , I , I , I , I --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
The way you made him sweat was say yes immediately before Henry had had the chance to -- he was all prepared .
[ LAUGHTER ]
What he wanted to say , and , George just said oh , okay .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : No , I actually said you got a deal .
CHARLES GIBSON : Oh .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yeah .
And , uh , and , he said well , he basically said --
He 's probably gonna be furious at me for talking about it but he said , I 've got some more -- if -- and it is my understanding -- I 've got some more talking points , and I -- [ LAUGHTER ]
He was a won -- he 's a wonderful kid and … we 're looking forward to --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
We 're happy .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : Yeah .
CHARLES GIBSON : Have a happy Thanksgiving to both of you --
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH :
Thank you --
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH :
Thank you very much .
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : -- very much , Charlie , and same to your family as well .
Pakistan Nuclear Weapons
A Brief History of Pakistan 's Nuclear Program
Pakistan 's nuclear weapons program was established in 1972 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , who founded the program while he was Minister for Fuel , Power and Natural Resources , and later became President and Prime Minister .
Shortly after the loss of East Pakistan in the 1971 war with India , Bhutto initiated the program with a meeting of physicists and engineers at Multan in January 1972 .
India 's 1974 testing of a nuclear " device " gave Pakistan 's nuclear program new momentum .
Through the late 1970s , Pakistan 's program acquired sensitive uranium enrichment technology and expertise .
The 1975 arrival of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan considerably advanced these efforts .
Dr. Khan is a German - trained metallurgist who brought with him knowledge of gas centrifuge technologies that he had acquired through his position at the classified URENCO uranium enrichment plant in the Netherlands .
Dr. Khan also reportedly brought with him stolen uranium enrichment technologies from Europe .
He was put in charge of building , equipping and operating Pakistan 's Kahuta facility , which was established in 1976 .
Under Khan 's direction , Pakistan employed an extensive clandestine network in order to obtain the necessary materials and technology for its developing uranium enrichment capabilities .
In 1985 , Pakistan crossed the threshold of weapons - grade uranium production , and by 1986 it is thought to have produced enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon .
Pakistan continued advancing its uranium enrichment program , and according to Pakistani sources , the nation acquired the ability to carry out a nuclear explosion in 1987 .
Nuclear Tests
On May 28 , 1998 Pakistan announced that it had successfully conducted five nuclear tests .
The Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission reported that the five nuclear tests conducted on May 28 generated a seismic signal of 5.0 on the Richter scale , with a total yield of up to 40 KT ( equivalent TNT ) .
Dr. A.Q. Khan claimed that one device was a boosted fission device and that the other four were sub-kiloton nuclear devices .
On May 30 , 1998 Pakistan tested one more nuclear warhead with a reported yield of 12 kilotons .
The tests were conducted at Balochistan , bringing the total number of claimed tests to six .
It has also been claimed by Pakistani sources that at least one additional device , initially planned for detonation on 30 May 1998 , remained emplaced underground ready for detonation .
Pakistani claims concerning the number and yields of their underground tests cannot be independently confirmed by seismic means , and several sources , such as the Southern Arizona Seismic Observatory have reported lower yields than those claimed by Pakistan .
Indian sources have also suggested that as few as two weapons were actually detonated , each with yields considerably lower than claimed by Pakistan .
However , seismic data showed at least two and possibly a third , much smaller , test in the initial round of tests at the Ras Koh range .
The single test on 30 May provided a clear seismic signal .

This table lists the nuclear tests that Pakistan claims to have carried out in May 1998 as well as the announced yields .
Other sources have reported lower yields than those claimed by Pakistan .
The Southern Arizona Seismic Observatory reports that the total seismic yield for the May 28th tests was 9 - 12 kilotons and that the yield for the May 30th tests was 4 - 6 kilotons .
According to a preliminary analysis conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory , material released into the atmosphere during an underground nuclear test by Pakistan in May 1998 contained low levels of weapons - grade plutonium .
The significance of the Los Alamos finding was that Pakistan had either imported or produced plutonium undetected by the US intelligence community .
But Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other agencies later contested the accuracy of this finding .
These tests came slightly more than two weeks after India carried out five nuclear tests of its own on May 11 and 13 and after many warnings by Pakistani officials that they would respond to India .
Pakistan 's nuclear tests were followed by the February 1999 Lahore Agreements between Prime Ministers Vajpayee and Sharif .
The agreements included confidence building measures such as advance notice of ballistic missile testing and a continuation of their unilateral moratoria on nuclear testing .
But diplomatic advances made that year were undermined by Pakistan 's incursion into Kargil .
Under US diplomatic pressure , Prime Minister Sharif withdrew his troops , but lost power in October 1999 due to a military coup in which Gen. Pervez Musharraf took over .
About two weeks ago , I made a brief comparison between a McDonald 's Value Menu double cheeseburger and a homemade cheeseburger , concluding that the homemade one was price competitive .
This brought out a ton of commentary from people standing up for the double cheeseburger ( as well as fast food critics ) questioning the conclusion .
After reading through all these comments , I decided there was only one thing to do : do the thing right .
So I headed to McDonalds .
While there , I bought a single double cheeseburger for $ 1.06 after tax .
I had to wait for a bit to get the double cheeseburger , as there were three people in line in front of me .
From the time I stepped out of my vehicle and I got back into my vehicle , I spent eleven minutes at McDonald's .
I got home , opened up my bag , and here 's what I found :
I will confess that this does n't appeal to me at all , although I know that these double cheeseburgers have a lot of fans .
I smelled it , shrugged my shoulders , and looked up the nutrition facts ( found here at McDonalds.com ) :
Serving Size : 5.8 oz
Calories : 440
Calories From Fat : 210
Total Fat : 23 grams
% Daily Value : 35 %
Saturated Fat : 11 grams
% Daily Value : 54 %
Trans Fat : 1.5 grams
% Daily Value : 80 %
Cholesterol : 80 grams
% Daily Value : 26 %
I do n't really need to go on from there - from a health perspective , it 's definitely worth being concerned about .
I did note the serving size - the single cheeseburger is 4 ounces , while the double cheeseburger is 5.8 ounces .
That means a beef patty at McDonald 's has a weight of 1.8 ounces and a double cheeseburger has 3.6 ounces of meat .
In other words , you can make just about five patties at home out of one pound of beef - each of these patties would have the same amount of beef as a McDonalds ' double cheeseburger .
I opened up the double cheeseburger to see what ingredients were on it :
I spy two slices of cheese , ketchup , diced onions , and some slices of pickles .
So , in order to construct a similar burger at home , I need hamburger meat , buns , cheese , ketchup , onions , and pickles .
A confession : I can't stand ketchup .
I like homemade ketchup alright ( basically tomatoes boiled down into a thick paste with some vinegar and a bit of spicing ) , but the store stuff , with high fructose corn syrup as the third ingredient , makes my stomach turn .
So , even though it will increase the cost for my own burgers in this price comparison , I 'm going to substitute a slice of fresh tomato for that ketchup .
Off to the store .
I bought these items as part of a regular shopping excursion , so the time for buying these items was maybe two minutes .
I went shopping at a Dahl 's grocery store .
First , I shopped for hamburger meat , and there were several options :
The cheapest option was 80/20 meat at $ 1.99 a pound .
80/20 means that the meat consists of 20 % fat .
Since that was the cheapest option , I went for that one , though I would normally tend to spend more and get a pound of the 97/3 meat , which is far healthier .
Here 's the nutrition facts on the 80/20 meat I bought , per one fifth of a pound ( I did the conversion from the one ounce numbers ) , if I were to broil it .
I 'm actually intending to grill it , which is far healthier as it allows much of the fat to drip away .
Serving Size : 3.2 oz
Calories : 243
Calories From Fat : 144
Total Fat : 16 grams
% Daily Value : 24 %
Saturated Fat : 6 grams
% Daily Value : 30 %
Trans Fat : 0 grams
% Daily Value : 0 %
Cholesterol : 80 milligrams
% Daily Value : 26 %
A patty of the 80/20 stuff , even if you just prepare it by broiling it instead of grilling it , is roughly as healthy as the meat on a McDonald 's double cheeseburger .
What about the cheese ?
Again , several options :
I ended up buying the American slices for $ 1.89 for 16 slices , which you can check the nutrition facts on here .
If you tack the cheese onto the meat , you start to approach the nutritional levels of the McDonald 's double cheeseburger , but this again assumes that you broil the meat instead of grilling it ( grilling it is far better for you ) .
I then picked up a jar of pickles for $ 2.49 , a package of hamburger buns for $ 1.99 ( this was overpriced ) , an onion for about $ 0.40 , and a tomato for about $ 0.40 .
These ingredients are all very healthy , so I wo n't reiterate the nutrition facts on these items - the " bad " ingredients are the cheese and the meat .
My total grocery bill for all ingredients was $ 9.16 .
Here 's what I bought :
I can assemble five double cheeseburgers from this material .
Let 's get started on the cooking .
I pattied and got the burgers on the grill in about two minutes , then I spent the ten minutes that they grilled slicing the tomatoes and dicing the onions and opening up cheese slices .
With twelve minutes of effort , here 's the food I had :
So what did this homemade cheeseburger end up looking like ?
Here 's the opened view , with a giant pickle slice on it :
Note the tomato slice instead of ketchup , a personal choice that makes the burger more healthy , more tasty ( for me ) , but more expensive .
Here 's what it looks like assembled :
And here 's that McDonald 's double cheeseburger for comparison :
I 'll allow you to draw your own conclusions .
After eating the meal , though , I had quite a bit of food left over :
That 's six slices of cheese , most of a diced onion , almost all of a jar of pickles ( which will last for a long time ) , and three buns .
I have almost all of the ingredients for more sandwiches with the cost already covered !
What about the time ?
Let 's assume that you 're going to make these burgers at home , and intend to eat them over two meals .
It took :
two minutes to shop for the supplies
two minutes to make the patties and get them on the grill
ten minutes for the patties to cook and to prepare the other stuff
one minute to reheat the leftover cheeseburgers later to build more sandwiches
one minute for cleanup ( with a dishwasher )
That 's a total of sixteen minutes for the homemade cheeseburger .
How about the McDonald 's version ?
It took me eleven minutes for the burger I bought , so if I went there twice for cheeseburgers for two meals , that 's a total of twenty two minutes for McDonald's .
That 's right , it was more time - effective to make the homemade cheeseburgers and enjoy them again later than it was to go to McDonald 's twice and pick up the double cheeseburgers .
What about the cost ?
The burger I assembled above cost $ 1.83 , while the McDonald 's double cheeseburger was $ 1.06 .
However , there are a few factors that are n't considered in those numbers .
First , the homemade burger was healthier .
It was grilled , and thus much of the fat dripped out of it .
The nutrition facts numbers above consider only a broiled burger , not a grilled one .
Second , the homemade burger had leftovers .
That cost per burger assumed no leftovers , but I had most of a diced onion , almost all of a jar of pickles , six slices of cheese , and three hamburger buns left over .
Without much more , I can make another meal out of these ingredients - just give me some cold cuts , for instance .
Third , the homemade burger had many more options .
I can do whatever I want with my homemade burger in terms of options - for example , I made the audible switching the ketchup for a tomato slice .
Lastly , the homemade burger was far , far tastier ( at least for me ) .
I tasted them side by side and it was n't even close .
Of course , this really is a matter of opinion .
For me , these factors make the homemade cheeseburger blow away the McDonald 's double cheeseburger .
I might spend pennies more on the homemade cheeseburger when all the costs are considered , but the healthiness , the flavor , the configurability , and the surprising time efficiency makes the homemade cheeseburger .
What do you think of McDonald's ?
Basically , I 'm indifferent .
I think fast food restaurants fill a role and have some big benefits ( convenience , mostly ) , but it is my belief that the other factors that are negatives towards fast food should usually swing things back towards preparing food at home .
The take home point ?
Do n't eat fast food because you believe it to be " cheap . "
The only real advantage of fast food is convenience - in the end , it has almost nothing to do with money .
In fact , if you choose anything but the absolute best value on the menu - which the McDonald 's double cheeseburger might be - it 's going to be far more expensive to eat fast food than eat at home .
The BA flight crash - landed at Heathrow Airport
Enlarge Image
All 136 passengers and 16 crew escaped from the British Airways flight BA038 from Beijing .
Eighteen people have been taken to hospital with minor injuries .
An airport worker told the BBC the Boeing 777 pilot , named later as Peter Burkill , 43 , said he had lost all power and had to glide the plane in to land .
All BA short - haul flights from Heathrow have been cancelled and others delayed .
BAA , the Heathrow operator , said it hoped to return to " near normal operations " on Friday , but advised all passengers to contact their airlines for up - to - the - minute information .
The worker also said the pilot had told him all the electronics had also failed .
I could hear the undercarriage come out and the next moment the plane just dropped

Travellers fear flight chaos Eyewitness accounts
What went wrong at Heathrow
" He said he had no warning - it just went , " the worker added .
" It 's a miracle .
The man deserves a medal as big as a frying pan . "
BA refused to comment on the report and said it would not speculate on the cause of the crash .
Police say the incident was not terror - related .
' Enormous bang '
Nearby Hillingdon Hospital said it had received 18 casualties , 12 women and six men .
Some of them had been suffering from whiplash .
Four of those admitted were BA crew members , but the pilot was not thought to be among them .
By Thursday evening , 17 had been discharged , but one woman with suspected concussion was admitted overnight .

Seven of those treated in hospital were British and three were Chinese .
The nationalities of the others are not yet known .
The incident happened on the south runway at 1242 GMT , as Prime Minister Gordon Brown was due to leave Heathrow for China and India .
His flight was delayed because of the incident .
Witnesses described the plane coming in very low and landing short of the runway , before skidding across grass and tarmac .
Part of the undercarriage , including two wheels were torn off , and there was some damage to the wings .
The runway was initially closed , but reopened later to take - offs only .
The north runway remained open throughout the incident .
A telephone helpline has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or relatives on 0800 3894193 .
The Department for Transport 's Air Accidents Investigation Branch has launched an investigation .
In a statement , it said initial findings would be released within 48 hours , followed by a more detailed , but still preliminary , report within 30 days .
Paul Venter , who was on board the plane , said he had been aware of a problem just as the plane was about to land .
" I could hear the undercarriage come out , and the next moment the plane just dropped , " Mr Venter said .
" When everything came to a standstill , I looked out of the window and the undercarriage was gone and the plane was on its belly . "
Eyewitness John Rowland said : " The plane 's wheels collapsed , doors were flown open .
" On its approach it took the runway too low , just missing the roof of my cab .
" It crashed into the runway , debris was flying everywhere , there was an enormous bang and it skidded sideways . "
Another eyewitness , also a taxi driver , said the plane flew over " so low you would think you could lean out the window and touch it " .
" It passed over my vehicle at something like 20ft and over the perimeter [ fence ] at 15ft before it plunged into the runway , " he told the BBC .
' Near miracle '
Fire crews doused the plane in foam to prevent its fuel tanks catching fire .
And BA said the cabin crew had done an " excellent job " evacuating passengers via the emergency chutes .

Chief executive of BA Willie Walsh said he was " very proud " of the crew and the Boeing 777 was an " excellent aircraft " .
" We train hard for incidents such as this , and all that training has paid off today , " Mr Walsh said .
BAA said it was doing everything possible to avoid further delays and cancellations on Friday .
It said in a statement : " Heathrow has received special dispensation from the Department for Transport to make some night flights and have notified local residents who may possibly be inconvenienced by this exceptional circumstance . "
Flights are expected to continue until about 0130 GMT on Friday .
Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly paid tribute to those involved in the incident and said she was " relieved " there had been no serious injuries .
" British Airways have assured me that they are doing everything possible for the passengers and crew involved , " Ms Kelly said .
" The next step is to find out what happened and why . "

Aviation expert Kieran Daly , from Flight International magazine , said not a single Boeing 777 had been lost in a crash since the aircraft was launched in 1995 .
A total of 221 flights out of a normal 1,300 were cancelled on Thursday , Heathrow 's operator BAA said .
Most of those were to short haul destinations - just eight were long haul .
A further 24 flights bound for Heathrow were diverted to Stansted , Gatwick and Luton Airports .
John McDonnell MP , whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes Heathrow , said the incident underlined concerns about extending the airport .
" This is a near miracle that neither passengers or anyone on the ground has been seriously injured , " Mr McDonnell said .
The plane involved is one of 43 Boeing 777s in BA 's fleet .
It is believed to be about six years old .

Yes , Paul has some LISP - inspired criticisms .

On the other hand , he concedes that dict as a first - class type is a very good idea , and that the Python OO system is right in style even if arguable in detail .
Paul 's website recommends
Python as the best alternative if you can't do LISP ; see < http://www.paulgraham.com/faq.html>.
Under the circumstances ( which include the fact that he's one of the two or three influence leaders of the LISP community ) that 's about the strongest endorsement one could expect .

>Eric S. Raymond</a >
Over the past six decades , the United States has used its nuclear arsenal in five often inter-related ways .
The first was , obviously , battlefield use , with the “ battlefield ” writ large to include the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The long - held consensus among scholars has been that these first atomic bombings were not necessary to end the war against Japan , and that they were designed to serve a second function of the U.S. nuclear arsenal : dictating the parameters of the global ( dis ) order by implicitly terrorizing U.S. enemies and allies ( “ vassal states ” in the words of former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski . )
The third function , first practiced by Harry Truman during the 1946 crisis over Azerbaijan in northern Iran and relied on repeatedly in U.S. wars in Asia and the Middle East , as well as during crises over Berlin and the Cuban Missile Crisis , has been to threaten opponents with first strike nuclear attacks in order to terrorize them into negotiating on terms acceptable to the United States or , as in the Bush wars against Iraq , to ensure that desperate governments do not defend themselves with chemical or biological weapons .
Once the Soviet Union joined the nuclear club , the U.S. arsenal began to play a fourth role , making U.S. conventional forces , in the words of former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown , “ meaningful instruments of military and political power . ”
As Noam Chomsky explains , Brown was saying that implicit and explicit U.S. nuclear threats were repeatedly used to intimidate those who might consider intervening militarily to assist those we are determined to attack .
The final role of the U.S. nuclear arsenal is deterrence , which came into play only when the Soviet Union began to achieve parity with the United States in the last years of the Vietnam War .
This is popularly understood to mean preventing a surprise first strike attack against the United States by guaranteeing “ mutual assured destruction . ”
In other words , any nation foolish enough to attack the United States with nuclear weapons will be annihilated .
However , Pentagon leaders have testified that deterrence has never been U.S. policy , and they have defined deterrence as preventing other nations from taking “ courses of action ” that are inimical to U.S. interests .
This could include decisions related to allocation of scarce resources like oil and water , defending access to markets , or preventing non-nuclear attacks against U.S. allies and clients , i.e. role # 2 , using genocidal nuclear weapons to define and enforce the parameters and rules of the U.S. dominated global ( dis ) order .
My argument is not that U.S. use and threatened use of nuclear weapons have always succeeded .
Instead , successive U.S. presidents , their most senior advisers , and many in the Pentagon have believed that U.S. use of nuclear weapons has achieved U.S. goals in the past .
Furthermore , these presidents have repeatedly replicated this ostensibly successful model .
In fact , even the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki achieved only one of their two purposes .
These first bombs of the Cold War did communicate a terrorizing message to Stalin and the Soviet elite about the capabilities of these new weapons and about the U.S. will to use them .
But , within weeks of the A - bombings , Washington was sharing influence in Korea with Moscow .
Four years later northern China and Manchuria , which U.S. leaders thought they had won with the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs , fell into what was seen as the Soviet sphere .
In 1954 France declined the offer of two U.S. A - bombs to break the Vietnamese siege at Dienbienphu , and in 1969 North Vietnam refused to be intimidated by Nixon ’s “ November ultimatum . ”
The U.S. commitment to nuclear dominance and its practice of threatening nuclear attacks have , in fact , been counterproductive , increasing the dangers of nuclear war in yet another way : spurring nuclear weapons proliferation .
No nation will long tolerate what it experiences as an unjust imbalance of power .
It was primarily for this reason that the Soviet Union ( now Russia ) and China , North Korea , and quite probably Iran opted for nuclear weapons .
The Romance of Ruthlessness
The Bush administration has again put nuclear weapons  and their various uses  at the center of U.S. military and foreign policy .
The message of the administration ’s Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) in December 2001 was unmistakable .
As The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists editorialized , “ Not since the resurgence of the Cold War in Ronald Reagan ’s first term has U.S. defense strategy placed such an emphasis on nuclear weapons . ”
The NPR reiterated the U.S. commitment to first - strike nuclear war fighting .
For the first time , seven nations were specifically named as primary nuclear targets : Russia , China , Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , and North Korea .
Consistent with calls by senior administration figures who spoke of their “ bias in favor of things that might be usable , ” the NPR urged funding for development of new and more usable nuclear weapons .
This included a new “ bunker buster . ”
Seventy times more powerful than the Hiroshima A - bomb , the bunker buster was designed to destroy enemy command bunkers and WMD ( weapons of mass destruction ) installations buried hundreds of feet beneath the surface .
To ensure that the “ bunker buster ” and other new nuclear weapons could inflict their holocausts , the NPR called for accelerating preparations for the resumption of nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site .
It also pressed for the nuclear weapons laboratories to continue modernizing the nuclear arsenal and to train a new generation of nuclear weapons scientists .
Among their first projects would be the design of a “ Reliable Replacement Warhead ” to serve as the military ’s primary strategic weapon for the first half of the 21st century .
With a massive infusion of new funds to consolidate and revitalize nuclear research , development and production facilities , National Nuclear Security Administration Deputy Administrator Tom D’Agostino testified it would “ restore us to a level of capability comparable to what we had during the Cold War . ”
Later , the Rumsfeld Pentagon published and then ostensibly “ rescinded ” a non-classified version of its Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations .
The Doctrine was revealing and profoundly disturbing .
In the tradition of the Clinton administration ’s Essentials of Post - Cold War Deterrence , the Doctrine communicated that the United States could all too easily “ become irrational and vindictive . ”
Most striking was the Doctrine ’s extended discussion of deterrence .
Rather than define deterrence as the prevention of nuclear attacks by other nuclear powers , the Doctrine stated that “ The focus of US deterrence efforts is … to influence potential adversaries to withhold actions intended to harm US national interests … based on the adversary ’s perception of the …likelihood and magnitude of the costs or consequences corresponding to these courses of actions . ”
Diplomatically , the Doctrine continued , “ the central focus of deterrence is for one nation to exert such influence over a potential adversary ’s decision process that the potential adversary makes a deliberate choice to refrain from a COA [ course of action . ] ”
In addition to putting Chinese diplomatic efforts to marginalize U.S. power in Asia on notice or deterring unlikely Russian or French nuclear attacks , the central role of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was global dominance .
China , Russia , France and Germany were reminded of their proper places , and Iran and Venezuela received ample warning not to adopt oil and energy policies that might constitute  courses of action that would “ harm U.S. national interests . ”
Placing the world on further notice , the Doctrine threatened that “ The US does not make positive statements defining the circumstances under which it would use nuclear weapons . ”
Maintaining ambiguity about when the United States would use nuclear weapons helped to “ create doubt in the minds of potential adversaries . ”
The Doctrine also refused to rule out nuclear attacks against non-nuclear weapons states .
The Doctrine also baldly instructed the U.S. military that “ no customary or conventional international law prohibits nations from employing nuclear weapons in armed conflict , ” thus subordinating international law to U.S. military strategy .
It also argued that nuclear wars could be won .
The Doctrine gave increased authority to field commanders to propose targets for nuclear attacks and described the circumstances when field commanders could request approval to launch first - strike nuclear attacks .
“ Training , ” it further stated , “ can help prepare friendly forces to survive the effects of nuclear weapons and improve the effectiveness of surviving forces . ”
The Doctrine went on to reconfirm the bankruptcy of the nuclear reduction negotiations between the United States and Russia .
The Doctrine was clear that U.S. nuclear forces would not actually be reduced because “ US strategic nuclear weapons remain in storage and serve as an augmentation capability should US strategic nuclear force requirements rise above the levels of the Moscow Treaty . ”
Toward Abolition
Since the end of the Cold War , the media and national political discourse in the United States have focused on the dangers of “ horizontal proliferation . ”
These dangers include “ rogue ” states with nuclear weapons , the possibility of nations with nuclear power plants becoming nuclear weapons states , and leakage from nuclear stockpiles finding its way to “ rogue ” states or to non-state terrorist groups like al - Qaeda .
One nightmare scenario has envisioned the overthrow of the Musharraf regime in Pakistan , with its nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of radical Islamists .
It does n’t take a genius to understand the importance of under - funded initiatives like the congressional Nunn - Lugar Nuclear Threat Initiative , which was designed to secure the world ’s nuclear weapons , fissile materials , and nuclear wastes .
However , these efforts can be no more than stop - gap measures as long as the United States threatens other nations with nuclear attacks and insists on maintaining the terrorizing imbalance of power .
Since the 1995 Nuclear Nonproliferation Review Conference , popular , elite , and governmental demands have been growing for the United States and other nuclear powers to fulfill their Article VI treaty commitment to negotiate the complete elimination of their nuclear arsenals .
In 1996 , in the International Court of Justice ’s advisory opinion on the use and threatened use of nuclear weapons ruled that both are violations of international law , and the Court directed the nuclear powers to implement their Article VI commitments .
While NGOs and popular movements from across the world came together to form Abolition 2000 , at the elite level former head of the U.S. Strategic Command Gen .
Lee Butler  supported by many of the world ’s generals and admirals  called for abolition .
And , in January 2007 , former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz joined former secretary of defense William Perry and former senator Sam Nunn in saying that U.S. double standards were driving nuclear weapons proliferation , and that the time had come for the United States to meet its NPT obligations .
Since then , pressed by voters and community based activists , John Edwards , Barack Obama , and Bill Richardson have each stated that if elected , they will be the president who negotiates the complete elimination of the world ’s nuclear weapons .
They need to be held to these commitments , and other presidential and congressional candidates need to be pressed to join their commitment .
( Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel have made similar commitments . )
The political and technical steps needed to eliminate nuclear weapons have long been known .
First , the United States must renounce its “ first strike ” nuclear war fighting doctrines .
Next it must refuse to fund the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons .
The other essential steps include verified and irreversible dismantling of nuclear weapons and their installations ; halting production of weapons - grade fissile material and securely containing existing stockpiles ; verification , including societal verification , and intrusive inspection systems ; and investing power in a supranational authority , probably the UN Security Council , to isolate , contain , or remove threats to the nuclear - free order .
Like cannibalism and slavery , nuclear weapons can be abolished .
The question is whether we humans have the will and courage to choose life .

The semester is over , and I did n't fail my C++ course , which is amazing , since I only did half the homework .
I realize that the language is n't intentionally painful , but I remain astounded that anyone would willing choose it for new development .
No wonder it sent me running back to Pascal all those years ago .
I 've been working through the 99 Prolog problems lately , and was quite surprised to discover myself using the S combinator to solve them .
S , defined as
S x y z = x z ( y z )
<*>
rotate xs n = uncurry ( flip ( ++ ) ) . ( split <*> ( mod n . length ) ) $ xs rnd_permu = rnd_select <*> length
rnd_permu_direct xs = rnd_select xs ( length xs )
rotate_direct xs n = back ++ front where ( front , back ) = split ( n `mod` length xs ) xs
is provided in Control .
Applicative as .
The two is has proved useful in so far were problems 19 and 25 : The latter is easier to understand .
It expands as Which immediately matches the definition given above .
The latter is unnecessarily difficult , and would be better written as : I would n't have noticed it at all , but I read Applicative Programming with Effects a while ago , which is what made me finally " get " S .
CEMENT CUDDLERS
An " Anti-shopping " Trip with the Los Angeles Cacophony Society
Text : Rev. Al , Art : Sneery
I had been thinking for a long time about making cement filled teddy bears .
I was n't exactly sure why .
At first it was just a perceptual curiosity I wanted to experience , and I wanted others to experience .
I liked the idea of someone being handed what appeared to be a fluffy stuffed animal , only to have it go tearing through your relaxed fingers like a lead meteor .
The Christmas shopping season seemed an ideal time to get them on the shelves of Los Angeles toy stores , so late in November , members of the Los Angeles Cacophony Society gathered in my backyard to gut several dozen plush toys and replace their innards with Portland 's finest .
We called them , " Cement Cuddlers " .
Each bear wore a full - color laminated label identifying it as such complete with bar code from another toy .
Inside the folded tag was the text :
" Unfortunate Child , do not mistake me for living thing , nor seek in me the warmth denied you by your parents .
For beneath my plush surface lies a hardness as impervious and unforgiving as this World 's own indifference to your mortal struggle .
Hold on to me when you are sad , and I will weigh you down , but bear this weight throughout your years , and it will strengthen your limbs and harden your will so that one day no man dare oppose you . "
The target was easy to select .
Not far away was a large not - to - be - named toystore , the biggest and newest of the chain in Southern California , a massive thing like the newly christened Titanic just begging for its iceberg .
By 10:30 , around a dozen Cacophonists had slipped in managing to place several bears on the shelves without arousing suspicion .
Not content to just leave them there we appointed Cacophonist Todd to help direct the management 's attention to our prank .
At 10:35 Todd entered , located a Cuddler , and brought it to the register , informing the cashier he could n't find the price .
Predictably , as he placed the innocent looking toy in those unwary hands , it went crashing to the floor like a particularly heavy bowling ball .
After this , it just got worse .
Todd began to demand a speedier price check , insisting that he had only minutes to complete this transaction before it would be too late to bring the bear to his nephew who was , as he repeated many times for our benefit , " in the hospital with a skin rash . "
This element of his story , however , did not appear to provoke the suspicion of the clerk , who apparently had no difficulty in imagining her customer entering the children 's ward not long before 11 PM to dump a lump of fur - covered construction material in the lap of an ailing youngster .
However , as Todd 's volume increased , backups arrived .
One of the more astute clerks commented that she had never seen this toy before and wished to know what shelf it had come from .
Indignantly Todd led them to the appropriate place .
A half dozen clerks , and several customers gathered round in bewilderment , passing the four bears amongst themselves and shaking their heads .
I eventually moved into earshot , and heard one woman reading the tag aloud .
" That 's really deep ! " she exclaimed .
I could no longer resist .
I moved in to express curiosity about this toy .
" Oh !
That 's a cute bear , " I remarked as I reached for a Cuddler .
Without warning , it was placed in my hands , which naturally were prepared to be unprepared for its weight .
Another thunderous crash !
Now I was outraged !
" Look here ! " I said .
" The labels say , for ages 2 - 10 !
How could " Nameless Toystore Chain " sell such a dangerous toy to 2 - year - olds ! "
Eventually I was calmed and began contemplating buying one for an older nephew .
Cacophonist Frank became interested in buying one too .
We all went to the register .
Thanks to the fully functional bar code , the farce continued .
However , the bar code used was from another toy , and so the computer identified the toy as : Alien Face Hugger ­ $ 1.99 .
More panic and confusion .
The manager was called .
In the chaos , the bears are handed back and forth a few times more giving Todd one more opportunity to let one fall , this time " on his foot " ( about 4 inches from his toes ) .
He begins to wail and pulls off his shoe and sock .
The clerks are incredulous .
" Would you say he dropped that on his foot ? " one says to me .
" I do n't want to get involved , " I say , secretly gesturing that Todd seems crazy .
The manager arrives , and he is young and sour - looking .
Easily a control freak .
We feel he is our divinely ordained victim .
They explain the difficulty with the scans , but he seems to pay little attention to the computer .
Instead his eyes keep darting to Todd as he leaps around on one foot howling about the lethal bears to other customers .
" Come with me , sir .
We 'll see what we can do for you , " he snaps , dragging Todd off to his little manager pen .
Frank and I continue as good cops to Todd 's bad cop routine , but continue to hover at the register insisting on the purchase .
We discuss with the clerks how troubled Todd seems and reread the label .
" This is weird , " one clerk finally realizes , " a Teddy Bear literally filled with cement . "
I suggest it might be a doorstop for children 's bedrooms .
Then a ray of light descends on Nameless Toystore .
" It 's like a joke someone 's playing or something , " says one of our blue - vested assistants .
" You mean , " asks Frank , with wonderfully stylized naiveté , " like someone made them themselves ?
Maybe just this weekend ?
Took out the stuffing and replaced it with cement ? "
" Or maybe that crazy guy did , " says the clerk .
" No , no .
Can't be , " I say .
" Why would insist on buying from you something he made himself .
That 's illogical ! "
Suddenly we hear Todd 's voice booming again from the front of the store .
They have emerged from the manager pen .
This will mean so much to Bobby .
God Bless you ! "
And he leaves with the bear in bag .
$ 1.99 !
Lucky bastard !
Manager - man hurries to the counter with his panicky stick - up - the - ass gait , one ear pressed to a cellular , doubtlessly consulting the Nameless Toystore overlords .
We mob him , insisting to know the price arrived at .
" They 're not for sale . "
We are incredulous , indignant .
" This item is discontinued . "
He bites off the word and rushes to the shelves to haul the Cuddlers away .
We continue to needle him as he gathers the bears .
Suddenly , he swings around holding the furry blocks of cement as if he might do some harm .
Perspiration has appeared on his forehead .
" Look ! " he sputters , " I do n't know how these things got on the shelves !
They DON'T track correctly on the computer .
I 've never seen them before .
I have NO explanation .
It 's like someone 's playing a joke on MY STORE ! "
It 's in that word " my " .
You can tell .
He 's gotten that look like he 's just seen the first crack in the brand new ceiling .
We understand that if that crack widens by even a hairline , he 's going to see through it .
He already suspects Todd .
He is probably 90 seconds from realizing that we 're all part of it .
And so we decide to take advantage of our time .
" Could you at least tell us the manufacturer so maybe we could order the toy ? "
He whips the label over , and reads , Brutal Truth Toys .
This is a good time to leave .
There 's still a half hour before midnight , so we take advantage of the energy we 've gathered to make a few prank phone calls .
I call a rival Nameless Toystore asking for Cement Cuddlers .
I 'm put on hold and another clerk picks up the phone and claims to have actually pulled up the info on my Cement Cuddlers on the computer .
He tells me I can get a raincheck .
Sadly , when I ask for the stock number , he suddenly loses the record that he " just had , just a minute ago " .
After going through three or four baffled and fairly easy to baffle clerks , I finally get to the manager .
I am slightly indignant at the delays and feigned ignorance of a product I JUST PURCHASED THAT VERY NIGHT at their rival , the new Burbank store , we 'd just invaded .
The manager explains that this new store carries certain promotional items not available to the other stores because it is the newest and largest .
I detect a note of envy in his voice , and soften my approach .
I become confidential and ask if the new store hired away a lot of good workers .
" You know , " I tell him , " I know it 's big and everything , but it 's so new ...
I mean , they did n't quite seem to have it all together yet . "
He agrees .
He 's heard rumors to this effect .
" All the employees seemed , I do n't know ... nervous somehow .
It 's like the store 's too big for them to handle .
I get a nervous feeling when I go in there . "
He knows what I mean .
" I think it 's that manager , maybe .
He seemed so tense and kinda angry somehow .
He does n't give me a good feeling .
He seems a little odd .
Have you heard anything like this ? "
He 's heard some funny things about this upstart .
" Yeah .
Odd manager .
Odd store .
Come to think of it this whole cement teddy bear thing is pretty odd .
Maybe this was just a special thing he wanted to order .
Maybe they were his idea . "
" David Delthony selected wood to charge his
ideas of form and space with unrelenting energy
and movement .
The stately presence his
sculpture occupies is much like a stage set for his
flowing and ever - moving shapes . "

December 24 , 2007 – 01:49
Recently I ’ve chatted with a potential customer .
He seeks developers to create a simple social network application .
He spent some time doing this .
Actually , a considerable time and a sizable budget : one year and a half and undisclosed amount of money .
Now he ’s got three different implementations of his idea .
All three partially working .
All three not ready for a production use .
Two out of three developers broke their ( extended ) deadlines and he stopped to work with them .
The leader of third group is not returning calls as deadline approaches .
It smelled like a typical deathmarch project for me from the very first words exchanges with current developer .
Being there , done that , know what to do to get out of the deathmarch hell .
Despite I ’m charging considerably more that his current developers , he seemed interested in me : I have project management experience , I speak like I know what to do , I can start right soon and can get more developers into the team .
Nevertheless we ’ve not contracted .
The show stopped when I was asked to provide an estimate for the project .
My opinion is that asking for an estimate at the engagement to the software contract is suboptimal , at least .
I ca n’t provide a project “ estimate ” if I ’ve not spent time reformatting the specs to my standard , read the code , tried it and documented the defects , outlined the plan , estimated it , experimentally verified the first step estimate and corrected it .
Just because “ the estimate ” in the software development is what other people call “ the bid ” .
What I can provide at start is a guesstimate – here we have N functions , M screens , so it should take kM + lM days .
But just when I append the usual disclaimer that this number should not be relied upon in any kind of financial and time planning , the understanding breaks .
Actually , what customer desires is just a fixed price bid , so he can get rid of financial risk .
Game of bidding
The bid selection on software project is too much influenced by the bid bottom line .
It would be a good thing , if it would include any kind of total cost analysis with some model attached .
But what bid on a small software project does this ?
At most , it includes a detailed analysis of cost drivers and a total development budget .
And in most cases it just states the amount of money paid to developer upon project completion .
Nevertheless , the development budget is the easiest thing to understand in the bid .
It ’s just a number .
No wonder the bid is mostly selected by the budget .
No wonder developers learn the game very fast – underbid and get the project .
Whatever happens next .
Parameter space of the software project
It is an established custom to treat a software project within 3d parameter space :
budget ,
delivery time ,
quality .
If the project has fixed complexity the volume , occupied by the project in that space , presumably , stays constant .
But …
Where ’s the project complexity is fixed ?
There ’s no such thing like a perfect information transfer between two persons .
There are always errors in understanding .
The project requirements , unless specified in a strict semantics ( like programming language ) are always subject to an interpretation .
Therefore the actual best estimate of the volume , project occupies in the parameter space , will always change with time .
That ’s the reason why any project plan should allow room for errors and resources to fix them .
Logically , next question from a customer would be : why I can’t pay an insurance against such errors ?
Finally , it ’s the developer who ’s the specialist ?
Why ca n’t he include that in the price ?
Simple probabilistic model of a feature development .
Of course , a developer can do that .
If he has the level of discipline , comparable to the traders of financial products ( e.g. options ) .
Most developers do n’t .
The pricing of options , err .. feature estimation is counterintuitive .
And even the best financial models tend to underestimate the effect of the “ long tail ” , the effect of events with little probability .
Let ’s build a simple probabilistic model of single feature development .
Let the complexity of feature would be 8 points .
That means , it would require 8 hours of constant attention of the qualified and prepared developer , without any interruptions or problems .
Of course , that wo n’t translate into 8 billable hours .
It could be anything from zero to infinity with a peak near 8 .
Good developers will have sharp peak , mediocre – wide one .
Also , say , it would take about a clock day to complete .
With the same probability distribution .
Next , someone had to review the feature .
Name it code review , acceptance testing , anything .
Let it require 1 point of complexity and require another a day of clock time to complete .
The review has 4 chances to accept the feature to production and 1 chance to return it to development .
( Gamma distribution on all values , alpha = 2 , beta = number of complexity points or number of days )
What would be 95 % - level certainty estimate for the implementation of this feature to take ?
41 billable hours and about 9 days to complete !
What would be 50 % - level certainty estimate ?
16 billable hours , 4 days to complete .
How that compares to blind estimation of 8 + 1 hours ?
Where is the intuition there ?
The fallacy of risk minimization
A rational developer , equipped with such model , would give estimated 41 billable hour and ask for a 9 business days timeframe to complete the task .
So what the “ rational ” customer desiring to minimize his budget risk would pay ?
He has quite good changes ( 45 % ) to pay 25 hours less ( 41h – 16h ) and get his result sooner by a work week .
Then why the hell I ’d advise my customer to overpay me ?
Why would I put myself in ridicule position of explaining how “ a day worth work ” translated into more than a work - week fixed price bid ?
Or why I would underbid and increase my own risks ?
I would welcome any analysis of the simple model above to show that I ’m wrong .
The recursive nature of estimation of software project .
See how the development of a simple “ day - worth ” feature translated to complex “ inflated ” estimation ?
But the actual software project is much more complex than a set of such features .
Features get dumped , added , misunderstood and , finally , even some bugs slip review and ( OMG ! ) go onto production .
This all adds another loop of confusion and complexity and inflates a reliable bid even more .
Yet customers require fixed price bid even before the detailed planning is done .
What a developer ought to do ?
Refuse to bid a fixed price , bear the risks or play “ this time will be different ” game ?
The way out .
The software development is a superposition of several complex probabilistic processes .
An attempt to put a fixed price tag onto it would be similar to put a fixed price on an financial instrument .
An attempt to establish a “ fair ” price on goods based on careful analysis .
History teaches that no one learns their lesson latest huge attempt to do this failed miserably .
Financial market has its own solution – the trading , which establishes what is believed a fair price .
And it ’s time to recall that the goal of a software development is not to establish a “ fair ” price for a project .
The goal is to develop a product .
An attempt to minimize risks by obvious means finally costs much more for a customer than the risk itself .
The obvious means are not rational .
An attempt to minimize risk in a software project is similar to an attempt to calculate an outcome of tennis match from the names of players and the brand of rackets .
Do really any rational tennis player try to set the game plan ahead ?
No , of course .
They do the work in tight iterations .
Watch - move - swing - hit - watch - move … etc
They minimize risk by close coupling of facts observed ( moving ball ) and their own movements .
In software development the analogy would be tight development iterations .
Promote enhanced versions to production weekly .
Release on staging daily .
Do a continuous integration builds to watch the code integrity after each build .
And if you are overbudget , make a business decision to stop or to allocate more funds .
That ’s not a development problem .
Cease overplanning .
Get a life .
PS
Ah , yes , my customer , I ’ve started with …
Yes , you know his story already .
He was blinded by estimations he was given and his desire to minimize the risk .
His product is in the development from early 2006 and is not yet complete .
What he tries now is to get “ more reliable estimates ” , preferably from “ more experienced developers ” .
Let the force be with him .
In an ever - changing fast - paced world , most of us are accustomed to doing things now , and long - term financial planning is often difficult for us to wrap our arms around .
We do n’t want to think about being a millionaire in twenty years ; we want to start down that road now with quick actions that we can use to quickly see rewards .
Here ’s a list of eighteen things you can do today that will improve your bottom line in the coming year .
I ’d advise you to sit down right now with a piece of paper , make a list of the ones that you are going to do today , and total up how much money this will save for you .
If the individual items seem frivolous , just bear with me : there ’s a conclusion to this that you may find interesting .
1. Drink less expensive coffee .
Do you stop at the coffee shop a bit too often ?
Cutting out one latte a week can save $ 5 a week , or even ordering a smaller size three times a week can save $ 3 a week .
Do you really need the grande latte ?
Savings : $ 5 a week
2. Prepare your own “ fast food . ”
Fast food is convenient and tasty , but with some advance work , you can prepare your own quick foods at home .
They take very little skill , are good for you , and are usually at least a dollar less expensive than the equivalent item at a fast food restaurant .
If you eat fast food even once a week ( and many of us eat more than that ) , then that ’s a dollar saved .
For me , I can save as much as $ 5 a week , so let ’s average the two .
Savings : $ 3 a week
3. Instead of watching television , read a book .
After
evaluating the per -hour cost of my hobbies , I discovered that television viewing was the most expensive and reading was the least expensive , so I basically just turned off the television and opened a book .
What happened ?
We trimmed our cable bill to just the basic channels ( a savings of about $ 15 a month ) , cut down our electricity usage ( television and surround sound were off for two hours when they used to be on ) which saved about $ 0.50 a month , and rediscovered a hobby that makes me consider the world instead of sitting there absorbing whatever the television feeds me .
We ’re even thinking about eliminating the cable entirely , since the few shows we now watch are almost all on network television .
An average individual could save about $ 8 a month doing this , so we ’ll use that .
Savings : $ 2 a week
4 . Find worthwhile weekend projects that do n’t burn money .
I used to spend my weekends involved with some pretty expensive hobbies , but then I started spending a couple weekends a month engaged with things that made money or were at least inexpensive .
Do you spend $ 50 on a golf excursion with your buddies twice a month ?
How about a once a month trip to the mall with a $ 100 bill ?
Replace these with
cost - effective weekend activities .
Even better if you ’re a parent : these can all involve the kids in a productive fashion .
Just replacing one expensive weekend activity a month can save $ 30 - $ 50 a month .
I ’ll even estimate this one on the low end .
Savings : $ 10 a week
5 . Air up your tires .
On your way home tonight , stop at a gas station and air up your tires .
It ’s incredibly simple to do ( if you ’re capable of taking the cap off of a toothpaste tube , you can do it ) , it ’s free , and it saves serious money – about $ 0.07 a gallon with current prices .
Do this once a month if you can , and you ’ll save about $ 3 a month .
Savings : $ 0.75 a week
6 . Use free software instead of expensive commercial products .
In the past , I ’ve bought copies of Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop and I also paid for yearly renewals for an antivirus package .
No more .
I save about $ 50 a year by using great open source software solutions .
Most are easy to install and work as well as the software they replace .
Instead of buying an expensive software package , look at what you can get for free .
Savings : $ 4 a month .
7 . Buy in bulk .
Instead of buying smaller packs of items you ’ll continually use ( such as toilet paper , dishwashing detergent , laundry detergent , fabric softener , shampoo , conditioner , dish soap , tissues , diapers , baby wipes , trash bags , etc. ) , buy them in packages that cost the cheapest per unit ( almost always the largest one ) .
Put the excess in storage and continue to refill smaller containers out of the bulk containers as you need them .
Even if you save only $ 5 per year on each item , if you buy ten items in bulk , you ’ve saved $ 50 .
If your grocery list has such continuous use items on it , pick up the bulk version instead .
Savings : $ 4 a month
8 . Plan your road trips more carefully .
We often make multi- hour treks to visit my son ’s grandparents and other relatives , as well as visiting friends and going on camping trips .
By planning ahead just a bit ( maybe fifteen minutes of work ) , we can save $ 20 on each trip .
If you travel quite a bit , planning ahead can easily save you up to $ 100 a year .
Savings : $ 5 a month
9 . Drink lots of water .
Keep a water bottle full at your side and take a big drink every time you feel hungry or thirsty .
This trick has saved me from many trips to the vending machines and unnecessary stops for food and beverages when out and about , and this converts straight into cash in my pocket .
By cutting out the unnecessary snacks , I can save a couple dollars a day on average – and some people are far worse than I am .
Savings : $ 10 a week
10 .
Check the library for books instead of the bookstore .
Before you go buy a book , check and see if it ’s available at your local library .
Many libraries now have an online catalogue that enables you to check for a book .
If this keeps you from buying one book a month ( average cost $ 12 ) , this adds up to $ 150 a year .
Savings : $ 12 a month
11 . Keep a list of what you spend .
I keep a small notebook inside my jacket along with a pen , and whenever I spend money on anything , I jot it down .
Every once in a while , I look it over and usually shake my head at the wasted money , but that ’s not the powerful part : the power is in the guilt I feel when I consider adding an item to my notebook .
This usually makes me stop and reconsider frivolous purchases , which can save me as much as $ 50 a pop .
On average , though , it ’s much smaller than that .
Savings : $ 10 a month
12 . Install compact fluorescent bulbs .
Replace the light bulbs in your home with compact fluorescent bulbs ; stop on your way home from work and use one of those Christmas gift cards to stock up .
If you replace fifteen bulbs with CFLs and use each bulb for four hours a day , you ’ll save $ 0.22 a day , or $ 7.50 a month , in your energy bill .
Per bulb , your savings each month is about $ 0.50 .
Savings : $ 7.50 a month
13 . Write a grocery list .
Preparing a grocery list seems kind of silly at first , but it works amazingly well .
We keep a pad of paper and a pen attached to the refrigerator so that both my wife and I can write down anything we can think of that we need or that we want for preparing a meal .
Then , when we go to the store , we just stick to that list ; if it ’s not on the list , we do n’t buy it .
Our weekly grocery bill immediately dropped by about $ 20 when we started sticking to this principle , and it ’s so easy to do ( and actually faster , because you do n’t wander through the store wondering if you forgot something ) .
Put a pad and a pen on the refrigerator and start making a list today .
Savings : $ 20 a week
14 . Eat breakfast .
Before you leave in the morning , eat something small , like a bagel or a cup of yogurt .
Why ?
When lunchtime rolls around , you wo n’t be as hungry and you ’ll make more sensible dining choices which do n’t involve going out to TGI Friday ’s and ordering a giant appetizer before your meal … not that I ’ve ever done that … not me … yeah , right .
When I do this , I save about $ 3 on ann average lunch , which is balanced against the $ 0.50 or so that the breakfast food cost me .
Savings : $ 10 a week
15 . Invite your friends over .
“ Wo n’t that cost money ? ” you ask .
Nope .
Invite your friends over about once a month for a potluck dinner .
Break it down into small pieces for everyone to bring ( assign each person something to bring ) and provide one of the main meal elements .
For example , you can have each couple bring their favorite pizza topping and some pizza sauce and you provide the dough .
Not only is this cheaper than going out to eat , you ’re also spreading some of the dinner cost out among the guests .
Even better : since you ’re at home already , it ’s pretty easy to find a very inexpensive activity to fill the evening , which is much cheaper than out - on - the - town activities .
We did this with a New Year ’s Eve party once and it was a huge hit – and it did n’t cost much either .
Everyone brought their favorite pizza toppings , favorite finger snack , and a six pack of their favorite beer .
Total cost for hosting a memorable New Year ’s party : about $ 20 ( dough , some mushrooms , and some Leinenkugel ) .
Savings : $ 20 a month
16 . Install programmable thermostats .
This is another great item to spend Christmas gift cards on .
A programmable thermostat can cut your energy bills by about $ 100 a year by following pre-set programs to lower and raise temperatures in rooms automatically .
This enables the house to be at a nice temperature when you ’re using it , but at an ambient ( or close to it ) temperature when you ’re not ( in the night , or when you ’re at work , for example ) .
This can save serious cash over the long term .
Savings : $ 7.50 a month
17 . Turn your computer off every night .
You can
do this automatically with little effort , and with a typical desktop computer , you can save about $ 2 a month on energy costs .
Savings : $ 2 a month
18 . Use the ten second rule .
The ten second rule basically states that you should pause for ten seconds before making a purchase and spend that time asking yourself if you really need what you ’re buying .
Quite often , the answer will be “ no , ” which is all the incentive you need to put the item back on the shelf .
I do this all the time and end up saving some decent money each month .
Savings : $ 20 a month
Now that I ’ve done all of these things …
If you ’ve done all of these things , you ’re now spending roughly $ 85 a week less than you used to .
Instead of letting that money just sit in your checking account , tempting you , sign up for a high - yield savings account at ING ( 4.5 % APY and a $ 25 signup bonus if you use a referral code – just ask me for one ) or HSBC ( 5.05 % APY ) .
Set up an automatic weekly deposit into that high - yield account from your checking account equal to the amount you ’re now saving .
And how much will I have ?
If you followed all of the steps in this plan and put it all into HSBC , at the end of the year you ’ll have $ 4,641.22 in the account .
You might think that some of the ideas on this list are a bit silly , but how silly is $ 4,600 a year ?
That can easily be enough to
make a few extra mortgage payments each year , pay off your car , or start an investment portfolio .
The best part ?
You can start immediately .
Bush - administration lawyers could be nailed for their role in destroying evidence in the CIA scandal , thanks to a quiet Connecticut child - porn case
January 16 , 2008 5:39:29 PM
Did the Bush - administration lawyers , and the CIA operatives they advised , commit obstruction of justice by destroying the now - infamous CIA - interrogation videotapes ?
A recent but little - known obstruction prosecution in a Connecticut federal court sheds light on how this pivotal question is likely to be resolved , and could serve as a template for how the Department of Justice will prosecute those involved in the tapes scandal .
In October 2006 , officials of Christ Church of Greenwich approached well - reputed local attorney Philip Russell for legal advice when they discovered child pornography on a church computer assigned to its organist , Robert Tate .
After considering the options , Russell advised the church to fire Tate , recommended to the dismissed employee that he obtain his own lawyer , and then destroyed the computer ’s hard drive .
Many lawyers — myself included — might have advised and acted much as Russell did .
Had he left the images intact , he would arguably have put the church , and himself , at further risk of being prosecuted for the possession of contraband .
Child pornography , like heroin and a few other such items , is in a legal category that makes it criminal to possess under virtually any and all circumstances .
Had Russell handed over the laptop to the FBI with the hard drive and files intact , he could have incriminated his client — the church , or its officers .
And unless the FBI believed that no church official knew about or condoned that particular use of the church ’s computer , the church could be liable for the hard drive ’s contents , because it technically owned the computer .
Advising a client about what to do with contraband found on its premises is one of the most challenging scenarios a lawyer faces , requiring difficult and controversial judgment calls .
Lawyers and legal ethicists differ as to how it should be dealt with under various circumstances .
Yet federal prosecutors in the United States Attorney ’s Connecticut office shocked nearly everyone , including members of the Connecticut bar and legal experts , when they indicted Russell in February 2007 on obstruction - of - justice charges for destroying the pornographic images .
The FBI had begun investigating the church ’s organist three days before Russell destroyed the hard drive , but the fact that Russell had no knowledge of the investigation was irrelevant to the feds .
This is because he was charged not under traditional federal obstruction - of - justice statutes — where one has to know of the existence of an investigation in order to be guilty of obstructing it — but rather under two relatively new provisions of the so - called Sarbanes - Oxley Act , named after its legislative sponsors .
Sarbanes - Oxley makes it a felony , punishable by up to 20 years in prison , for anyone to “ knowingly alter , destroy , [ or ] mutilate . . . any documents or tangible object with the intent to impede , obstruct , or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter . ”
Under that extraordinarily broad law , destroying materials can be considered obstruction even when no formal investigation has begun and no subpoena has been received .
Indeed , no investigation ever has to begin in order for there to be a violation of this law , as long as the person who destroys the materials understands that an investigation could follow , or that the materials might be useful in the “ proper administration of any matter , ” whatever that might mean .
Congress enacted Sarbanes - Oxley in 2002 to boost investor confidence following a string of high - profile corporate - accounting scandals — starting with the Enron fiasco — in which a large number of documents were destroyed .
The law ’s obstruction provisions were dubbed “ criminal penalties for altering documents ” and “ tampering with a record or otherwise impeding an official proceeding . ”
But the Department of Justice quickly applied these new provisions to situations like Russell ’s , which are not likely consonant with Congress ’s intent .
( The statute ’s official title , which may explain the scope of behaviors Congress sought to prohibit , is the “ Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 . ” )
Obstruction junction
Sarbanes - Oxley ’s obstruction provisions are the latest in a long line of increasingly vague congressional enactments that make it frighteningly easy for an ambitious federal prosecutor not only to indict the proverbial ham sandwich , but to convict the sandwich and deposit it in federal prison for decades .
Legal and business experts who learned of the Russell prosecution reacted with alarm .
Mark A. DuBois , the chief disciplinary counsel for the Connecticut Bar Association , told Greenwich Time , the local newspaper , that he was troubled by how attorneys like Russell are forced to act as soothsayers .
“ How prescient does a lawyer need to be ? ” he asked .
New York University Law School professor Stephen Gillers , one of the nation ’s most respected experts on legal ethics , told the Associated Press ( AP ) that the obstruction provisions of Sarbanes - Oxley “ upset a lot of assumptions about how lawyers can represent clients . ”
Connecticut US Attorney Kevin O’Connor swiftly dismissed the hand - wringing , telling the AP that those who “ impede investigations ” by “ destroying evidence . . . will be prosecuted , particularly when the obstructionists are attorneys and officers of the court . ”
The new Sarbanes - Oxley statute , said the prosecutor , was meant “ to remedy the loopholes ” in prior obstruction statutes .
The new statute eliminates the need to tie the obstruction “ to a pending or imminent proceeding or matter ” and “ does not require corrupt intent . ”
Firefox rises from ashes of abandoned Netscape Once mighty browser is pulled off life support by AOL , only to be resurrected by Mozilla and embraced by appreciative fans

As of Friday , AOL officially will end its support for Netscape , the fabled browser that helped transform cyberspace from a fraternity of software geeks into a community of consumers who could point and click their way through news and entertainment .
Netscape as a company had the trajectory of a ballistic missile .
Its public offering in 1995 set off the dot - com boom .
But Microsoft Corp. fought its efforts to make browser software the new operating system of the digital economy , and not even a Justice Department antitrust investigation could save it .
In 1998 , Netscape was acquired by AOL , another late '90s star whose fortunes have faded .
But this is not a story about the death of Netscape , because 10 years ago , just before the AOL acquisition , the company 's leaders made a gutsy play .
Led by former chief executive James Barksdale , technology guru Eric Hahn , marketing maven Mike Homer and co-founder Marc Andreessen , they decided to make their browser 's source code - the working core of the program - publicly available to be tweaked and improved .
And here 's the kicker - this born - again browser , which is today called Firefox , has captured about 16 percent of the U.S. browser market , stealing back its share from Microsoft 's once - impregnable Internet Explorer .
Microsoft declined to discuss how this reincarnation of Netscape has arisen to challenge its browser dominance .
But Mountain View software engineer Brendan Eich , an early Netscape employee and one of the technical architects of Firefox , explained how the decision to free the source code came about .
" By 1998 , the writing was on the wall .
Microsoft was driving their monster truck after us and they were about to pin us to the wall .
The idea was to give the code away so it would n't be lost , " said Eich , who continued to be paid by AOL to be one of the primary technical custodians of the free Netscape code
The most famous open - source software - that is , a program whose operational core can be used and changed by anyone with the technical skill - is the Linux operating system that was developed by volunteers from the start .
The Netscape situation was different because it had been developed by a commercial firm .
After Netscape was bought by AOL , there were fears the new owner would back away from the open - source pledge .
AOL 's then - Chairman Steve Case tried to assuage these concerns by pledging to " maintain the autonomy " of Mozilla.org , a nonprofit organization that Netscape had created to manage the open - source code .
For several years after 1999 , the Netscape source code existed in limbo .
AOL paid a core team of full - time engineers , including Eich , to coordinate and supplement the efforts of dozens of volunteer programmers who fixed or improved aspects of the Netscape browser .
" It was in a weird , half - alive , half - dead state , " said Mitchell Kapor , who helped develop the Lotus spreadsheet and became one of the tech pioneers muscled out by Microsoft .
In 2003 , Kapor , by then an investor in and proponent of open - source software , helped persuade AOL to spin off Mozilla.org with a $ 2 million cash cushion to become fully independent .
Eich , who survived these changes at Netscape , said AOL originally had wanted to give the Mozilla organization a smaller get - lost package , but Kapor , who was a friend of former AOL big - shot Ted Leonsis , helped marshal support for a more - generous send - off .
" I wanted to make sure Mozilla could take on a new life , " Kapor wrote in an e-mail last week from the World Economic Forum at Davos , Switzerland .
After that 2003 spin - off , Mozilla.org , though a nonprofit entity , began to move at startup speed under the leadership of former Netscape attorney Mitchell Baker , who had helped prod the open - source decision in 1998 .
With the clear authority to improve the free code , and the need to make the project self - supporting before the cash ran out , the Mozilla group re-branded the browser .
After two false starts - Eich says two early names , Phoenix and Firebird , ran into trademark conflicts - the group settled on Firefox .
This renamed and revised Netscape heir started to gain in popularity , partly because it premiered at a time when many Web developers and consumers were becoming disenchanted with Internet Explorer .
For instance , the Microsoft browser was plagued by pop-up ads that annoyed users , while Firefox made it easy for users to stop such distractions , Eich said .
Andrew Lipsman , an analyst with market research firm comScore , said Firefox has become so popular that in December , the Mozilla Web site drew 15.3 million unique visitors .
Eich said that traffic is now bringing Mozilla enough in advertising revenue to support about 150 paid staffers who keep improving Firefox .
It 's tough to say exactly how deeply Firefox has penetrated the browser market , where Microsoft once held a better than 90 percent share .
OneStat.com , a Dutch browser - tracking firm , gave Firefox 16 percent of the U.S. market in January compared with 78 percent for Microsoft .
Apple 's Safari browser had about 4 percent , with the barely measurable remainder distributed between another alternative browser called Opera and the remnants of the old Netscape .
Eric Raymond , a computer programmer whose 1997 essay , " The Cathedral and the Bazaar , " is one of the best early explanations of the open - source approach , said the success of Firefox in the aftermath of Netscape 's disappearance proved that the advantages of this community approach outweighed the downsides .
" It ca n't be traced back to who is responsible , " said Raymond , noting the frequent problems that arise with the open - source encyclopedia Wikipedia .
But the advantage , he said , is that any programmer in the world can improve open - source code - attracting a world of eyeballs helping to improve Firefox .
" Victory goes to the organization that can put together the largest consortium of brains , " he said .
A database manager at Fidelity National Information Services , a leading financial processing company , stole 2.3. million consumer records and sold them to a data broker , who then sold them to direct marketing companies , according to an announcement from Fidelity on Tuesday .
The Fidelity website has details on what was stolen :
" The misappropriated information included names , addresses and telephone numbers as well as , in many cases , dates of birth and bank account or credit card information .
Approximately 2.3
million records are believed to be at issue , with approximately 2.2
million containing bank account information and 99,000 containing credit card information .
The company is still investigating the time period over which the misappropriations occurred . "

What happens when you have 50,000 % inflation ?
The 200,000 note in Zimbabwe , pictured below , is worth only 3 cents , and you need new 10,000,000 notes .
Johannesburg / Harare
- President Robert Mugabe 's government , stricken by chronic hyperinflation , announced today it will introduce a 10 million Zimbabwe dollar note ( along with 1 million and 5 million notes ) .
Economists said it was the highest denomination of any currency in the world .
The issue of new notes follows nearly three months of banking chaos as cash dried up and queues , sometimes hundreds of meters long , became a permanent feature outside commercial banks .
Zimbabwe is in its 10 th year of economic crisis , marked by the world 's highest rate of inflation , the fastest shrinking gross domestic product in a country not in a state of war , the most rapidly collapsing currency and unemployment of over 80 % .
Economists said the disappearance of cash was a result of inflation estimated at 50,000 % - the government has banned publication of official figures - that forces shoppers to pay with brick - sized bundles of near - worthless notes for a few simple groceries .
A year ago , the highest denomination was 10,000 Zimbabwe dollars , then worth about $ 7 , now worth about 1/3 of 1 cent ( US ) .
The new 10 million Zimbabwe dollar note is worth $ 3 ( US ) .
During the year there were three separate new issues of notes as inflation continued to soar , including the 200,000 note pictured above , which is worth worth only 6 cents ( US ) .
Dear friends
Here is a New Year 's Resolution .
If this is * supposed to be * " a government of the people , by the people and for the people " .... then Congress should not have the power to make laws without public input .
For EVERY SINGLE BILL in CONGRESS !
Budgeting matters ?
Post for public viewing , gather public signatures , pass only on PUBLIC 's majority vote .
War funding ?
Ditto .
New Laws ?
Must require 85 % of PUBLIC vote .
NO Electoral College or anything of the kind involved to ( mis - ) " Represent " the people !
NO Internet votes and NO mechanized voting allowed !
ONLY hand - written letters from constituents allowable !
Letters should be marked with a color coded streak BY THE SENDER and letters marked with color code should be counted IN PUBLIC VIEW FOR VERIFICATION .
Storage area for letters must be under surveillance with full public access at all times required by law , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , no holidays , no exceptions .
That way they can't whisk away anything on the sly .
What say ye folks ?
Input ?
Should we get signatures going to get this passed into law ?
No more wars without end without public consent .
No more turning the Constitution upside - down .
We PAY the politicians to do our will : Since they obviously are n't doing it , here ' s the solution .
It 's absurd to PAY just to fund one 's own abuse and the ransacking of teh public will .
Only psyche ward basketcases PAY to fund their own abuse .
Oh and guess what .
That is NOT a statement to be misconstrued in gyst : I am NOT saying that we should stop paying our taxes !
I am only saying that if we PAY taxes , then we MUST INSIST that it is OUR will which is implemented and that it is the CONSTITUTION which is upheld , protected and defended BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , because that is truly what representative government is all about .
And because politicians are n't doing it .
Bye - bye corporate special interests and their ability to " buy " public policy and wars without end .
Bye - bye corruption .
We the People are taking over in a legitimate and peaceful way , and you ( government ) have ZERO argument for the fact that it is WE who pay the taxes and therefore it is WE who must vote prior to any law or budget matter being enacted !
Period .
End .
Does everybody agree ?
Does anybody have any concerns to voice ?
Any thoughts to offer ?
This is my New Year 's resolution .
Draft up a new law to empower the people and say bye - bye to the old evil way under which we all have suffered so much .
This must be a joint brainstorming work and I appreciate everybody 's input .
Thank you !
ps www.downsizedc.org is working on a bill to require Congress members themselves to read the text of bills , not their legislative aides .

M40's 10 Cent Survival Knife
VISIT M40's WILDERNESS SURVIVAL STORE
The best wilderness survival gear on the market !
Backyard campers and Rambo wannabe's ... go buy a Bear Grylls kit .
When you get serious about your wilderness activities ... come see my gear .
Hikers , mountain bikers , cross country skiers , ATV 'ers , off - roaders , and others whose activities carry them far and wide ... discriminating outdoorsmen opt for quality gear .
Is it a high end blade ?
Is it big ?
Is it a chopper ?
Ummm ... not really .
It 's none of the above , but what do you want for a total cost of less than ten cents ?
Here 's a better picture :
Okay , so it 's a piece of a hacksaw blade .
The other day I stopped into my local hardware store , and saw a 10 pack of hacksaw blades on sale for $ 1.99 .
That got me to thinking about a very small blade that could be packed in my survival kit .
When I reviewed Ranger Rick 's survival necklace , I had modified the included piece of hacksaw blade into a shave - sharp mini blade to make it more useful .
This time around , I figured I could play a little bit and see what I could come up with .
Hacksaw blades are VERY hard , high - carbon steel .
They take and hold an edge very nicely , but can be brittle , so you do n't want to make your blade too long , and it can't take a lot of abuse , but these have a lot of good uses in a survival kit .
Each blade has a hole at each end .
I figured I can get two blades out of each hacksaw blade ( I could get three out of the length , but I want the hole at the end for lanyards , etc ) .
That gives me 20 or more mini-survival blades for less than 10 cents each .
Making the 10 Cent Survival Knife
The pack of blades I got had 4 coarse , and 3 each of the medium and fine teeth .
I started with the coarse .
Using a pair of pliers , you should be able to easily snap the blade without bending it .
I used a belt sander , but this can be done with a file , grinder , or even a stone ( if you have lots of time ) .
The sander makes quick work of this .
It took me about 3 minutes to rough the shape , and another few minutes to give it a shaving edge .
I used a very coarse belt to rough out the shape I wanted .
Notice that I 'm keeping the blade wet as I work .
I keep a jar of water next to my sander , and dip it when it gets warm .
If you let it get hot , you can kill it 's ability to hold an edge !
I used a medium grit belt to do the taper and initial sharpening , and then went to my favorite belt which is a fine belt that is so packed with gunk that it 's pretty much a buffer to bring things to shave sharp .
Yes ... this blade will mow hair quite nicely .
Using the 10 Cent Survival Knife
This blade was designed to fit into the small tin I pack my survival kit in , though I 'm beginning to think there 's a lot of ways one could carry this blade comfortably in day - to - day life .
The additon of a small paracord lanyard makes this small blade a little easier to hold and use .
Putting two fingers through the lanyard helps to make this small blade more manageable .
The lanyard can be removed , and the small nylon string inside can be used to lash the blade to a stick for an effective fish spear .
The little indent I made at the front of the handle helps when holding the blade in your hand , but is also used to help secure the blade to your spear shaft along with the lanyard hole at the rear .
Without the lanyard , this blade can pack very flat , and could be carried in a wallet , in a slim pouch on the backside of one 's belt , as a neck knife , etc .
Just make sure you sheath it with something durable to protect both the blade and yourself !
Here 's a second blade I did with one of the fine - toothed hacksaw blades .
It 's a little longer , and the fine toothed blades are better for cutting metal and other hard materials .
Who knows ... this may just be the first survival knife with a really effective saw edge !
PARTING THOUGHTS
I 'm planning to pick up some of that rubber tool dip to see what kind of nice handle I can add to this .
These have a thousand uses , just use your imagination .
Even if you screw it up or break one , it 's only 10 cents and a few minutes of your time down the drain .
Good Luck !

Steffy : $ 2,500 cars = $ 200 oil ?
COMMENTARY
Last week we were talking about oil hitting $ 100 .
Is it too early to think about $ 200 ?
Not on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Options for December delivery of crude at $ 200 are the hottest bet in the market , with the number of contracts rising a record tenfold in the past two months , according to Bloomberg News .
Options are basically an insurance policy that traders use to protect themselves from the possibility that crude prices will double this year as they did last year .
While the chance of hitting $ 200 in a year is unlikely ,
the surge in the options speaks to the changing nature of the world 's oil economy .
Oil prices have been rising because worldwide supply is struggling to keep pace with demand .
Political unrest in Nigeria , for example , has crimped production from that country during the past two years .
Mexico has seen production from its most prolific oil field fall significantly .
Saudi Arabia missed a key deadline for starting production from a new
field .
No time to relax
All of this , of course , is what helped push oil to $ 100 last week .
Perhaps you even breathed a little easier as prices settled back this week .
Don't .
On Thursday , the Indian automaker Tata Motors is expected to unveil a car that sells for $ 2,500 .
That 's less than some Americans will spend on a big - screen high - definition television before the Super Bowl .
But it 's within reach for many in India 's emerging middle class , where the nominal per capita income is $ 1,089 , according to the International Monetary
Fund .
Car of sacrifices
The car , of course , is not something most Americans would want to drive .
Tata 's design codifies cheap , and the sacrifices are legion , according to a description in the New York Times .
Standard safety equipment for most U.S. vehicles , for example , costs more than $ 2,500 .
The new Tata will not , by our standards , be safe or environmentally friendly , and it probably wo n't be fun to drive .
It has a maximum horsepower of about 35 , the Times reported , so it 's more lawn mower than muscle car .
But that 's not the point .
Tata knows that most people who already own cars wo n't be interested in its new model , whose name has n't been revealed .
It 's targeting the hundreds of millions of people in the developing world who now ride scooters or bicycles or walk .
If it succeeds , crude prices may continue their climb of the past year .
The Tata probably will consume far less gasoline than the sport utility monstrosities common on American highways , but even the addition of several hundred million lawn mowers would rattle the markets .
" This is going to really shoot demand to levels we have not seen before , " said Michael Economides , an oil expert at the University of Houston and a former adviser to several state - owned oil companies .
" That 's going to open up segments of the population that were n't accessible . "
In China , for example , demand for oil surged in recent years as more people moved to urban areas , their incomes rose , and they bought cars .
Now , 1,000 new cars take to the streets of Beijing daily , Economides said .
Mobility options
Tata is , in essence , offering mobility to the emerging middle - class economies of India , Vietnam , Pakistan , China and much of Africa .
We know , better than anyone , what a middle class does when it adopts a device that fundamentally changes lifestyles :
It never letsgo .
In fact , it upgrades .
The people buying $ 2,500 Tatas today will someday be buying more expensive models with more car - ness — bigger and heavier bodies , more powerful engines and more options like air conditioning and electronics .
All of which translates into even greater demand for fuel .
" The price of oil is becoming less and less dependent on what happens in the U.S. , " Economides said .
Today 's glorified lawn mowers could be the emerging world 's Model T .
That 's why the Model T's maker also is angling on the Indian market .
Ford said Tuesday it 's doubling production in India , investing $ 500 million and plans to make an inexpensive car .
Renault - Nissan and an Indian - Japanese joint venture also are working on cheap cars , the Times reported .
So , last week we saw $ 100 oil , and this week we 're talking about $ 200 .
It may seem far - fetched given that all signs indicate the U.S. , the world 's biggest energy consuming economy , is headed into recession .
Oil forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg are predicting that prices will fall as low as $ 75 a barrel by the fourth quarter .
Doubts it 's going down
Economides does n't buy it .
" I see it only going up , not down , " he said .
On the floor of the Nymex , some traders are n't taking any chances .
More than 5,000 option contracts at $ 200 have been sold .
Sooner or later , all those glorified lawn mowers are going to need fill - ups .

So STFU you stupid libs , and get to reporting the GOOD news about George W. Bush .
If it were n't for you dirty f*cking hippies reporting the truth , President Bush 's approval ratings would be skyrocketing by now -- at least that 's what FOXNews ' John Gibson wants his fringe fans to believe .
Note the source - free " published report " on homelessness and the " be good little Germans " tone to his writing .
So are doubts about all this good news the reason that Bush 's disapproval numbers are so high ?
I do n't think so .
I think it is instead the tide of bad news turning to better or — dare I say it — good news is n't discussed in the media .
Instead it 's a constant drumbeat of things are bad , we 're losing the war , you 're going to lose your job and your house .
On yet another front , a published report today said that homelessness is virtually over .
People may have crushing mortgages , but they have homes .
So all in all , the war is going in our favor .
Proof of that is that Democrats have shut up about it .
Bush has made sure you have a job , and this economy has insured you have a home .
I do n't normally link to FOXNews ' website , but this article is so absurd , and I did come down on Gibby for his lack of sources so I figured I would go ahead and link it just to be on the safe side .
I would hate for anyone to think I could ever make up garbage like this .

It ’s mosquito season and I have buffalo sized ones zipping around the backyard as I type this .
Thanks to their first feast on my ankles tonight and an earlier comment from Kim , I was inspired to dig through every tip I had regarding mosquito bites and relief from the itching .
Scritch Scratch .
I have n’t tried most of the suggestions below , but I ’ll note which ones have worked for me .
Here are more than 40 tips organized in one neat file , each bullet point is a single method :
Quick Comfort From Household Items :
Rub a bar of soap over the itch .
I just tried this ( Ivory ) and the relief was near instant .
I used a dry bar directly on the skin , but I also have notes that you can spritz with water first and then run bar of soap over area–or use a wet bar of soap .
Place a piece of scotch tape over top ; or dab rubbing alcohol or ammonia on the area first then stick on a piece of tape .
Hot water :
Take a shower , or bath , or cover with a compress .
As hot as you can stand it without burning you .
Ice cube , ice pack or very cold water
Dabbers
The quicker you can apply one of the remedies below , the faster the relief .
These are topical suggestions , administer directly to the area .
Nail Polish Strong tea mixed with rubbing alcohol Toothpaste ( works for me ) Mouthwash Vinegar ( full strength or take a hot bath with 2 cups of vinegar added to the tub ) Honey Underarm deodorant ( solid or roll - on ) Rubbing Alcohol Ammonia Bleach
Use a tea bag or a cotton ball soaked in tea to dab on skin ( make sure to have either choice as hot as you can handle without burning )
Paste Remedies
Mix these fresh with water ( unless otherwise noted ) then apply as soon as possible .
The consistency should be nice and thick so it wo n’t run , yet will still stay in place on the affected area .
You could also spritz the wound with water then administer grains / powders directly ( generously ) and rub them in .
If in tablet form , crush first before adding liquid .
Baking Soda ( works for me ) Meat Tenderizer Salt Epsom
Salt ( could also do this as a foot soak if it ’s the ankle / foot affected ) Tums Tablets Aspirin Aspirin – crush then combine with a few drops of rubbing alcohol
Commercial Product Lotions , Creams & Topicals
* Direct application
Calamine Lotion Benadryl Cream Orajel Anbesol Caladryl Vicks VapoRub ( works for me ) Preparation H ( works for me ) Lucas Papaw Ointment Tiger Balm Bag Balm Gold Bond Medicated Cream ( or the Gold Bond Medicated Powder ) Mylanta ( heartburn product ) After Bite
Essential Oils
Use full strength or combine with olive oil .
Edit :
There are concerns about using essential oils on children and pre-teens , especially repeated use .
Tea Tree Lavender Witch Hazel ( astringent ) Cedar
Leafy Antidote
* Crush the fresh leaves roughly then apply
Basil Plantains ( Plantago )
Fruity Treatments
* Use fresh fruit & apply directly to skin
Lemon Juice Lemon Slice Lime Juice Lime Slice Banana Peel ( rub with the inside of the peel )
Whew !
Big List !
If I ’ve missed your favorite , most effective curative , please add them below .
Notes
If a remedy does n’t soothe or provide quick comfort , do n’t despair .
Give it another try , sometimes it will take 2 or 3 applications before it kicks in .
How long does the itchiness / irritation last ?
Usually about 3 or 4 days but can be up to a week !
If things are unbearable and none of the remedies above provide any lasting respite , taking an antihistamine can help ( both adults and children ) .
The itch is a reaction from the saliva of the skeeter that it injects into you as it feasts on your blood .
There are several dozen different species and you may react to some species bites more than others .
Too match scratching ( especially with dirty fingernails ) can actually cause an infection ( pus develops , redness surrounding blister , feverish ) .
If a child ca n’t stop fussing with it and irritating things more , covering with a bandaid will help provide some protection .
If large swelling occurs ( like welts ) , contact a doctor or pharmacist for suggestions ( especially if it ’s a child with a strong reaction ) .
It could be an allergy to the skeeter bite .
It ’s important to watch the throat for swelling , nausea and changes to breathing .
Seek professional medical treatment without delay .

We can all agree that the MacBook Air is a slick - looking little laptop .
It 's so thin !
You can't argue with that !
But if you 're in the market for a small , high - performance laptop , is it the best option ?
I pored over specs for four similarly positioned and more - or - less similarly priced laptops to see if you 'll get your $ 1,800 worth out of the Air .
Let 's go to the chart , shall we ?

It turns out that , surprise surprise , you pay a premium for a tiny form factor .
The MacBook Air is seriously expensive for the guts you get inside , but Apple is n't the only company guilty of charging insane amounts for smaller computers .
Just look at the Sony Vaio TZ150N , for example .
$ 2,100 for a 1.06 GHz processor ?
Are you kidding me ?
I do n't care how small , it 's still a rip - off .
The best deal — if you do n't mind an extra pound of weight and half - inch of thickness — is the Dell XPS M1330 .
It bests the MacBook Air in nearly every single category , delivering about 30 % more processing power , 50 % more memory , over 300 % more hard drive space , plus a dedicated graphics card .
All of this , for $ 300 less .
But also , two hours less of battery life , thanks to the new smaller and more efficient Core 2 Duo processor in the MacBook Air .
But it 's really no surprise that a form factor as striking as the MacBook Air 's warrants a premium price .
Super - slim and light laptops as a category have yet to come down from the stratosphere , dollar - wise .
It 's a form factor that SSD just makes loads of sense for , lightening them up and cutting down on battery life , but that drives the price up even further for the time being .
Chips are still getting smaller and screen technology keeps improving .
In a couple of years , these form factors will be reasonably priced with great specs , but until then , prepare to pay a huge chunk more for a bit less power , just so you can brag about having the thinnest computer on the block .

Linkvana - the new one way link building service to increase link popularity .
If you want to dominate the search engines , you probably already know that to get to the top the only way is to increase link popularity for your sites .
And to do that , you need to do a lot of high quality one way link building .
Not all incoming links are created equal – and some links can actually harm your site rather than help it .
You ’ve probably heard of the many one way link building systems and services out there where you get access to a whole bunch of blogs where you can post your links with a couple of paragraphs of content .
Unfortunately most of these services allow pretty much any old crap on their network , and consequently their blogs are being delisted by Google faster than they can add them .
Well , the good news is that that ’s all about to change .
A good friend of mine and professional SEO consultant has recently released his on backlink building system – but with a twist – this one works , and will always work .
The big difference that sets this service apart from the rest is that every post gets manually approved before it ’s allowed to be posted to the sites .
So only good clean and unique content is ever going to make it onto the sites .
Which means the search engines are never going to fall out with them , and they wo n’t be getting delisted for spammy or “ machine generated ” content .
I ’ve been beta testing Linkvana recently so have first hand experience of how it works , and in my opinion it beats the hell out of all the other blog networks out there that offer backlink building services .
To give you a very brief overview , you start by creating a project .
A project relates to a single domain .
So if you have 10 domains you want to promote , you create a project for each one – so 10 projects in total .
Then within each project you can create as many “ posts ” as you wish .
Each post is a snippet of content ( a couple of hundred works is fine ) with a link to a particular page on the domain – this could be to the home page or a deep link to any sub page .
When you ’re happy with the post you simply click the “ send ” button and the post is queued to be posted across the Linkvana blog network .
Very easy .
The major benefits that I see of this system over all the others are :
Very competitive price – and cheaper than it ’s nearest competitor ( which is no longer accepting new members )
– and cheaper than it ’s nearest competitor ( which is no longer accepting new members ) Natural Growth –
The posts you make for each project get distributed across the network gradually over time .
This looks much more natural from the search engines point of view , and means your links wo n’t get dumped for mass posting .

Automated posting – once you add a new post to your project , Linkvana takes over and automatically adds these posts to it ’s blogs .
The links are added gradually for maximum “ search engine friendliness ” and impact .

Secrecy and confidentiality – Linkvana are not publicising their blog domain names , which means the search engines and your competitors will be unaware of what you are doing in your business .
And the other major benefit is a 25 % discount on the membership fee if you join this year .
If you ’re involved in search engine marketing in any way , this program really is a “ no- brainer ” .
It ’s a great way to get new sites indexed fast , and for boosting your existing sites to the top of the search engines .
I used to be a member of SET , but lost confidence in their system when their blogs started getting delisted in a major way .
With Linkvana
I just cannot see that happening , as no one will know the URLs of the sites .
On top of that , the quality of content being posted to some of the SET blogs was very spammy and clearly machine generated ” , which is very easy for the search engines to find – and consequently ban .
So to me , Linkvana has everything I need in a program for building back links and increasing link popularity .
One of the more hidden features of the PlayStation 3's 2.10 firmware update is the spectacular Earth - based music visualizer , seen in motion on multiple user - posted YouTube videos and in stills in the pictures below .
The feature 's creator , Kyoto - based Q - Games ( ) , which was commissioned by Sony to create the visualizer , has been talking to Gamasutra about the feature 's genesis , its use of NASA data , and possible expansion concepts .
Q- Games ' chief of technology James McLaren spoke to Gamasutra about how that project got started , explaining : " Originally , we were working on the Gaia project ( our name for the earth viewer ) as a possible boot sequence for the PS3 .
The waving cloth background , also created by Q - Games , got the nod when the PS3 launched . "
McLaren continues : " We persevered with Gaia , and this visualizer came out of that ongoing work .
We 've had this under our hats for a while , so it 's nice to finally see it released into the wild . "
He added : " What you are seeing is a slimmed - down version , due to Flash ROM restrictions , so we are happy to witness a positive reaction on various internet forums . "
But how were the effects in the visualization created ?
McLaren explains : " This representation of the earth is a 3D model with some shaders and SPU trickery going on .
We tried to accurately model the earth 's atmosphere and have all the correct highlights on the oceans , etc .
The texture data is sourced from the NASA Blue Marble project . "
" They have some data that they 've patched together from hundreds of satellite passes over the earth , which is really top - notch quality , as you can see .
We really owe NASA a debt of gratitude for the data , as without it we would n't be able to produce something that looks this good . "
Is Q - Games helping out Sony with any other updates in the near future ?
McLaren explains : " Unfortunately , we can't really say much about that .
We 'd certainly like to expand the current Earth visualizer and allow people a little bit more user control , something we 've seen a few requests for on various online forums . "
However , he notes in closing : " Perhaps a future update might include the full Blue Marble dataset , but that would need to be a hard disc - resident version ... "
Genes have the ability to recognise similarities in each other from a distance , without any proteins or other biological molecules aiding the process , according to new research .
This discovery could explain how similar genes find each other and group together in order to perform key processes involved in the evolution of species .
This new study shows that genes — which are parts of double - stranded DNA with a double - helix structure containing a pattern of chemical bases – can recognise other genes with a similar pattern of chemical bases .
This ability to seek each other out could be the key to how genes identify one another and align with each other in order to begin the process of ‘ homologous recombination ’ — whereby two double - helix DNA molecules come together , break open , swap a section of genetic information , and then close themselves up again .
Recombination is an important process which plays a key role in evolution and natural selection , and is also central to the body ’s ability to repair damaged DNA .
Before now , scientists have not known exactly how suitable pairs of genes find each other in order for this process to begin .
The authors of the new study carried out a series of experiments in order to test the theory , first developed in 2001 by two members of this team , that long pieces of identical double - stranded DNA could identify each other merely as a result of complementary patterns of electrical charges which they both carry .
They wanted to verify that this could indeed occur without physical contact between the two molecules , or the facilitating presence of proteins .
Previous studies have suggested that proteins are involved in the recognition process when it occurs between short strands of DNA which only have about 10 pairs of chemical bases .
This new research shows that much longer strands of DNA with hundreds of pairs of chemical bases seem able to recognise each other as a whole without protein involvement .
According to the theory , this recognition mechanism is stronger the longer the genes are .
The researchers observed the behaviour of fluorescently tagged DNA molecules in a pure solution .
They found that DNA molecules with identical patterns of chemical bases were approximately twice as likely to gather together than DNA molecules with different sequences .
Professor Alexei Kornyshev from Imperial College London , one of the study ’s authors , explains the significance of the team ’s results : “ Seeing these identical DNA molecules seeking each other out in a crowd , without any external help , is very exciting indeed .
This could provide a driving force for similar genes to begin the complex process of recombination without the help of proteins or other biological factors .
Our team ’s experimental results seem to support these expectations . ”
Understanding the precise mechanism of the primary recognition stage of genetic recombination may shed light on how to avoid or minimise recombination errors in evolution , natural selection and DNA repair .
This is important because such errors are believed to cause a number of genetically determined diseases including cancers and some forms of Alzheimer ’s , as well as contributing to ageing .
Understanding this mechanism is also essential for refining precise artificial recombination techniques for biotechnologies and gene therapies of the future .
The team is now working on a set of further experiments to determine exactly how these interactions work , including the predicted length dependence .
In addition , further studies are needed to ascertain whether this interaction , discovered in a test tube , occurs in the highly complex environment of a living cell .

My blonde hair , blue eyes , and size 15 running shoes were n’t the only reasons for which I was a unique attraction at the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Hsinchu Xian , Taiwan .
My background in physics and mathematics meant that I was the only member of Dr. Wannhsin Chen ’s Stem Cell Engineering Group who had no experience culturing human embryonic stem cells .
I had come to the institute ’s Bioengineering Division as an East Asian Pacific Summer Institute summer fellow , having come from Rutgers University in New Jersey where I ’m a Ph.D. student and fellow of NSF ’s Integratively Engineered Biointerfaces program .
I had received cutting - edge instruction for the culturing of cells , but my experience was limited to very hardy cell lines from epithelial tissues ( surface cells ) , and my approach to cultures was more engineering than biomedical .
However , in Taiwan my mentors were all biologists , and would only mentor me as a student of biology .
They were very forgiving of my utter lack of Chinese language skills , but they were much more insistent that I speak biolog - ese .
But the work was everything that I had been trained to do at the university : to be able to interface with the researchers in the basic sciences , and to synthesize the experience within the universe of biomedical engineering .
Part of the magic of modern tissue research is just how deftly an experienced biologist can look at an image of cells in a dish and know immediately which cells are healthy or not , differentiated or not .
These qualitative — and in both labs , uncannily accurate — assessments not only confound the former physicist / entry - level culturist , but also place a concrete limit on the number of cells that can be evaluated in a day , and require valuable human resources –resources which periodically become susceptible to inaccuracies after long days , nearing lunch hours , or the hustle - and - bustle of a busy lab environment .
Merging statistical pattern recognition and computer vision to cell imaging , I am addressing the problem of cell sorting with novel quantitative methods .
By processing hundreds of cell images , and extracting salient parameters of cell size , morphology , and structure , I seek to rigorously and objectively determine a stem cell ’s status .
Experimental purity dictates that I devise my algorithm “ blinded ” , i.e. on cell images generated by my mentors without my involvement , which is probably for the better : their cells were markedly more photogenic than mine ( the only trustworthy qualitative statement this amateur can make ! ) .
When I am finished , a computer will be able to acquire , save , filter , and scan cell images , and process them for an online categorization cell - by - cell ( freeing the biologists to spend their workday innovating ) .
The idea is to either automate the cell sorting process , increasing the through - put of cell passage , or to complement the biologist ’s subjective assessments .
These principles underlie a number of fields of biomedical study , including automated diagnostics , pharmoaco - theraputics , and even forensics .
Biology and math were n’t the only things I learned during my tenure in Taiwan .
I learned a lot about myself , about academia outside of the United States , and about the Taiwanese people .
For many of us , it was our first time out of the country .
But the training staff in Taiwan made us feel at home from the minute we arrived .
I saw the experience as an opportunity to reinvent myself as a scientist .
In my round trip from Piscataway , New Jersey , to Hsinchu , Taiwan , I departed from my hometown of biomedical engineering , and landed at the crossroads of stem cell biology and computer science .

Editor 's Note :
This research was supported by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the federal agency charged with funding basic research and education across all fields of science and engineering .
As befits a man who has spent years in DC , the MPAA 's Dan Glickman has polished his share of folksy analogies to a shine .
" I used to grow popcorn , and now I sell it , " he told a crowd of bankers and analysts yesterday at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York , a reference to his tenure as Secretary of Agriculture .
Now , though , Glickman is the self - described " chief hired gun or mercenary for the [ motion picture ] industry , " and his comments give us a window into what the movie studios are thinking .
His words yesterday revealed that movie execs are thinking about one thing in particular : the technology that can be used to halt film piracy .
And they expect ISPs to implement it .
Calling " protection of content from theft " the MPAA 's number one issue , Glickman reiterated claims that piracy costs the studios $ 6 billion worldwide every year .
Half the MPAA budget goes toward reducing this number , and the trade group believes that the single best way to do so is through technology .
" Technology will be the key to determine how successful we will become , " Glickman said .
But " technology " in isolation wo n't do much to help the movie business .
The MPAA needs the support of those companies best in a position to implement filtering technology : ISPs .
Acknowledging that the studios have often been " in tension with " the ISP community , Glickman claimed that the two groups have a much better relationship these days .
Dan Glickman
Case in point : AT&T and its publicly - stated plan to implement some sort of filtering system on its network .
No technical details of such a system have yet been revealed , but the announcement has warmed the cold cockles of the MPAA 's heart and has garnered support from companies like NBC Universal .
Glickman also held out the hope that filtering technology would quickly be adopted by many more ISPs .
" The ISP community is going to be at the forefront of this in the future because they have everything to lose and nothing to gain by not seeing that the content is being properly protected , " he said , " and I think that 's a great opportunity . "
It 's not the first time he 's asked ISPs to do more .
ISPs : what 's in it for us ?
ISPs that are concerned with being , well , ISPs are n't likely to see many benefits from installing some sort of industrial - strength packet - sniffing and filtering solution at the core of their network .
It costs money , customers wo n't like the idea , and the potential for backlash remains high .
Should such a system work , it could lower overall bandwidth usage , but whether that would make up for the cost and PR headaches of a filtering regime is unclear .
It wo n't do much for liability issues , since ISPs are already protected under " safe harbor " provisions .
ISPs concerned with getting into the content distribution game , though , could have much to gain from pleasing the content owners .
AT&T is in such a situation as it ramps up the national rollout of its U - verse IPTV system .
Glickman understands that " you will never stop piracy " because " traditional organized criminals would drool " over the margins made by pirates .
But you do your best , he said , and you try to offer customers a better - quality legal product at a reasonable price ( and you filter everything you can ) .
Will more ISPs follow the pied piping of the MPAA ?
Though he sounded hopeful , Glickman had nothing specific to announce .
With so many superhero movies around , such as Spiderman or Hulk , we are used to see people with special abilities in fiction .
But people with amazing abilities actually do exist in real life ; here ’s a list of 10 of the most amazing Real - Life Superheroes !
1 The Incredible Brain ( Daniel Tammet )
Daniel Paul Tammet is a British high - functioning autistic savant gifted with a facility for mathematical calculations , sequence memory , and natural language learning .
He was born with congenital childhood epilepsy .
Experiencing numbers as colors or sensations is a well - documented form of synesthesia , but the detail and specificity of Tammet ’s mental imagery of numbers is unique .
In his mind , he says , each number up to 10,000 has its own unique shape and feel , that he can “ see ” results of calculations as landscapes , and that he can “ sense ” whether a number is prime or composite .
He has described his visual image of 289 as particularly ugly , 333 as particularly attractive , and pi as beautiful .
Tammet not only verbally describes these visions , but also creates artwork , particularly watercolor paintings , such as his painting of Pi .
Tammet holds the European record for memorising and recounting pi to 22,514 digits in just over five hours .
He also speaks a variety of languages including English , French , Finnish , German , Spanish , Lithuanian , Romanian , Estonian , Icelandic , Welsh and Esperanto .
He particularly likes Estonian , because it is rich in vowels .
Tammet is creating a new language called Mänti .
Tammet is capable of learning new languages very quickly .
To prove this for the Channel Five documentary , Tammet was challenged to learn Icelandic in one week .
Seven days later he appeared on Icelandic television conversing in Icelandic , with his Icelandic language instructor saying it was “ not human . ”
2 The Boy who can “ see ” with sound ( Ben Underwood )
Ben Underwoodtaught is blind , both of his eyes were removed ( cancer ) when he was 3 .
Yet , he plays basketball , rides on a bicycle , and lives a quite normal life .
He taught himself to use echo location to navigate around the world .
With no guide - dogs , he does n’t even need hands : he uses sound .
Ben makes a short click sound that bounces back from objects .
Amazingly , his ears pick up the ecos to let him know where the objects are .
He ’s the only person in the world who sees using nothing but eco location , like a sonar or a dolphin .
3 The Rubberboy ( Daniel Browning Smith )
Five time Guiness Record holder , The Rubberboy is the most flexible man alive and the most famous contortionist .
He has been in many professional basketball or baseball games and on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , ESPN ’s Sports Center , Oprah Winfrey , Ripley ’s Believe It or Not , Cirque du Soleil , Best Damn Sports Show Period , The Discovery Channel , Men in Black 2 , HBO ’s Carnivale , and CSI : NY and American got a talent .
He dislocates his arms to crawl through an unstrung tennis racquet .
He performs contortion handstands and unique acrobatics .
4 Mister Eat - it - All ( Michel Lotito )
Michel Lotito ( born 1950 ) is a French entertainer , famous as the consumer of undigestables , and is known as Monsieur Mangetout ( Mister Eat - it - all ) .
Lotito ’s performances are the consumption of metal , glass , rubber and so on in items such as bicycles , televisions , a Cessna 150 , and smaller items which are disassembled , cut - up and swallowed .
The aircraft took roughly two years to be ‘ eaten ’ from 1978 to 1980 .
He began eating unusual material while a child and has been performing publicly since 1966 .
Lotito does not often suffer from ill - effects due to his diet , even after the consumption of materials usually considered poisonous .
When performing he consumes around a kilogram of material daily , preceding it with mineral oil and drinking considerable quantities of water during the ‘ meal ’ .
He apparently possesses a stomach and intestine with walls of twice the expected thickness , and his digestive acids are , allegedly , unusually powerful , allowing him to digest a certain portion of his metallic meals .

5 King Tooth ( Rathakrishnan Velu )
On August 30 , 2007 , the eve of Malaysia ’s 50th Independence Day , Rathakrishnan Velu ( or Raja Gigi , as he is known locally ) broke his own world record for pulling train with his teeth , this time with 6 coaches attached weighing 297.1 tons over a distance of 2.8 metres at the Old Kuala Lumpur Railway Station .
Raja Gigi , from Tampin in Malaysia learned a technique of concentrating his powers to any part of his body from an Indian guru at a young age of 14 .
6 The Magnetic Man ( Liew Thow Lin )
Liew Thow Lin , a 70 - year - old retired contractor in Malaysia , recently made news for pulling a car twenty meters along a level surface by means of an iron chain hooked to an iron plate on his midriff .
He says that he discovered he had the amazing ability to make objects stick “ magnetically ” to his skin , and now he ’s added car - pulling to his repertoire .
After reading an article about a family in Taiwan who possessed such power , he says he took several iron objects and put them on his abdomen , and to his surprise , all the objects including an iron , stuck on his skin and did n’t fall down .
Since this “ gift ” is also present in three of his sons and two grandchildren , he figures it ’s hereditary .
7 The Man who does n’t Sleep ( Thai Ngoc )
Sixty - four - year - old Thai Ngoc , known as Hai Ngoc , said he could not sleep at night after getting a fever in 1973 , and has counted infinite numbers of sheep during more than 11,700 consecutive sleepless nights .
“ I do n’t know whether the insomnia has impacted my health or not .
But I ’m still healthy and can farm normally like others , ” Ngoc said .
Proving his health , the elderly resident of Que Trung commune , Que Son district said he can carry two 50kg bags of fertilizer down 4 km of road to return home every day .
His wife said , “ My husband used to sleep well , but these days , even liquor can not put him down . ”
She said when Ngoc went to Da Nang for a medical examination , doctors gave him a clean bill of health , except a minor decline in liver function .
Ngoc currently lives on his 5 ha farm at the foot of a mountain busy with farming and taking care of pigs and chickens all day .
His six children live at their house in Que Trung .
Ngoc often does extra farm work or guards his farm at night to prevent theft , saying he used three months of sleepless nights to dig two large ponds to raise fish .
8 The Torture King ( Tim Cridland )
Tim Cridland does n’t seem to feel pain like the rest of people .
He astounded everyone by pushing needles into his arms without flinching and he now performs a terrifying act for audiences all over America .
Scientific tests have shown that Tim can tolerate much higher levels of pain than are humanly possible .
He explains that , by using mind over matter , he is able to push skewers through his body and put up with extreme heat and cold unharmed – but to do this safely he has extensively studied human anatomy , because puncturing an artery could be fatal .
9 The Lion Whisperer ( Kevin Richardson )
Animal behaviourist Kevin Richardson says he relies on instinct to win the hearts and form an intimate bond with the big cats .
He can spend the night curled up with them without the slightest fear of being attacked .
His magic works not only work for lions but other animals such as cheetahs , leopards and even hyenas do not hold a threat against him .
Lions are his favourites and its a wonder how he can play , carress , cuddle with them whose teeth are sharp enough to bite through thick steel .
Its a dangerous job but to Kevin , its more of a passion for him .
10 The Eye- Popping Man ( Claudio Pinto )
Claudio Pinto can pop both of his eyes 4 cm ( about 1 and a half inch ) or 95 % out of their sockets .
He ’s now aiming ( poppin ’ ? ) for a world record .
Mr Pinto has undergone various tests and doctors say they have never seen or heard of a person who can pop the eyes as much as him .
Mr Pinto , from Belo Horizonte , said : “ It is a pretty easy way to make money .
“ I can pop my eyes out four centimetres each , it is a gift from God , I feel blessed . ”
When U.S. and Pakistani authorities captured suspected al Qaeda terrorist Abu Zubaydah in March 2002 , he was shot three times , including once in the groin , while trying to escape .
His condition was grave enough that even after medics patched him up , operatives at a secret CIA prison overseas worried he might not survive and decided to videotape him around the clock .
" There were concerns that there be a record of his medical treatment and condition in the event that he died , " says one intelligence official .
" A lot of it is him sitting alone in his cell . "
Of the hundreds of hours of footage , a small portion showed Zubaydah and another prisoner undergoing aggressive interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , a process that simulates drowning .
Revelations that the CIA destroyed the videotapes in 2005 triggered a firestorm on Capitol Hill last week that had the nation 's intelligence community running for cover .
Democrats accused the CIA of keeping them in the dark and obstructing inquiries into the use of so - called enhanced interrogation techniques .
Bush administration critics also question what role , if any , the White House played in their destruction .
The tapes scandal comes on the heels of a surprising new National Intelligence Estimate on Iran that had already put spy agencies under fire from the political right , most vocally neoconservatives unhappy with the report 's conclusion that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
The analytical shift was a blow to hard - liners who have been advocating tougher action , even military strikes , against Tehran .
Critics say the NIE was too narrowly focused on actual weaponization , rather than on the uranium enrichment that could be used to make bomb fuel , and some even suggested an anti-Bush , antiwar agenda by a few key intelligence analysts .
Intelligence community officials were forced by the controversy to publicly defend the process of creating the largely classified NIEs , pointing out that senior officials from all 16 intelligence agencies laboriously pore over the text of each NIE , as well as the underlying intelligence sources .
" They go line by line , " explains a senior intelligence official .
" There was an intensive review . "
This flap is particularly disconcerting for an intelligence community that has been shaken up and scrutinized in the wake of its earlier faulty reporting on Iraq , intelligence that many hawks had trumpeted in the run-up to war .
Neither controversy is likely to diminish soon .
But the burgeoning tapes scandal could stretch on for weeks , even months , as Congress launches a round of closed - door hearings to determine why the tapes had not been previously disclosed — and why they were subsequently destroyed .
Whatever the explanations , the CIA clearly became trapped by the unusual decision to make the tapes in the first place .
" We do n't keep videos of our activities , " says one former clandestine CIA officer .
But Zubaydah was the cia 's first high - value prisoner , and in addition to medical concerns , officials wanted a video record to help monitor the program and evaluate its interrogation techniques .
Face of interrogation .
For several years , CIA officials and lawyers batted around the question of what to do about the potentially explosive tapes , which displayed the faces of CIA interrogators .
" This thing had taken on a life of its own , " says a former official familiar with the discussions .
As the internal debate continued , the cia 's use of waterboarding and other techniques became controversial on Capitol Hill , with Republican Sen .
John McCain , then a presumptive presidential candidate , spearheading an amendment to outlaw some of these measures .
At the cia , officers began to worry that the tapes could help land its interrogators in jail .
" If these tapes were viewed by Congress , it would help to feed the controversy by pushing them to go after the junior officers conducting these interrogations , who were just following orders , " says a former senior CIA official .
" It 's a qualitatively different thing — seeing it versus reading about it . "
In 2005 , José Rodriguez , who headed the cia 's Clandestine Service at the time , made the decision to destroy the tapes .
Officials say that CIA lawyers had advised him that " there was no legal reason to keep the tapes " but did not explicitly suggest destroying them .
It remains unclear whether then CIA Director Porter Goss weighed in on the decision to destroy them or what role , if any , the White House and Justice Department played .
But officials imply that key CIA officials were not informed about Rodriguez 's decision in advance .
" There may have been an expectation that other bases would have been touched before a decision was made and the tapes were destroyed , " says an intelligence official .
Iraq college life better , but not without fear
During his eight - year endeavor to complete his undergraduate degree , Haider Swadi Kareem has witnessed more than he'd care to remember at Baghdad University .
From the vantage point of a plastic table in the student cafeteria , Kareem witnessed the point - blank slaying of a 22 - year - old U.S. soldier , shot in the back of the head after buying a 7 - Up .
That was in the summer of 2003 .
In the same cafeteria , Kareem later saw flyers scattered on the concrete floor demanding that all students abandon the university , by the order of al Qaeda in Iraq .
He has watched as friends have died and teachers have left the country .
His family fled for southern Iraq , and insurgents took over his childhood home in Baghdad , forcing him to live alone in a dorm room on campus .
" When I first got here , it was safe , " he recalled wistfully .
And how is it now ?
For Kareem and some other students , professors and administrators , the answer is " better , " but a tentative , heavily qualified better .
As levels of violence have fallen in Baghdad over the past six months , the tension at the university has lessened , with more people returning to their studies and trying to turn their thoughts to the future .
The campus is something of an oasis in Baghdad , and the diverse student body , from all over the city and the country , offers a glimpse into the national mood at a time when Iraqis are experiencing a relative lull in the war .
With 80,000 undergraduates , Baghdad University is the largest in Iraq .
It is protected on three sides by water and on the fourth by plainclothes gunmen .
Its location on a peninsula formed by a bend in the Tigris River , in a relatively peaceful neighborhood where several prominent politicians have their compounds , has helped keep it from suffering the kind of gruesome bombings inflicted on other campuses in the capital .
Still , about 80 professors and many more students have been killed since the war began , university officials said .
During the last school year , about 50 percent of students went to class regularly , and hundreds of faculty members took unpaid leaves of absence .
This year , attendance is about 80 percent , and many teachers have returned , said Riyadh Aziz Hadi , the university 's assistant president .
" Of course there are many challenges , but less than before , because the security situation , while not 100 percent , has improved , " he said .
" I can't say that I 'm optimistic .
But I hope . "
Outside Hadi's office , on a stone bench shaded by a small tree , first - year student Sajar Khudair Abed , 18 , surveyed the courtyard , filled with groups of chatting friends and students rushing to class .
Her threshold for judging improvement was admittedly low .
" Look around , you cannot see people killing each other , bombing each other .
Of course it 's safer , " she said .
" We feel we are safer here than being at home . "
Several students , however , described a persistent culture of intimidation and intolerance .
Flyers celebrating the family of Muqtada al - Sadr , the leader of one of Iraq 's most powerful Shiite militias , are tacked to campus buildings , despite the administration 's ban on political activity on campus .
The majority of women wear head scarves and say that dressing in a more Western style , which many claim to prefer , attracts dangerous attention in the strict religious climate .
" You know , for example , we are two girls and a man , " said computer science student Nour Kamal , 21 , as she sat with friends eating popcorn in the cafeteria .
" Some people do n't like this idea at all , girls talking to a man .
They will instantly mark you with an X .
These people are savages . "
Abbas Saad , 21 , recalls a heated conversation about Islam he had with a group of classmates during his freshman year .
Two days after the argument , a dozen of the students involved were abducted as they left the campus ; he said their fates were unknown .
" I do n't talk about religion very much anymore , " he said .

I have no plans to ever get married again .
I might have a steady girlfriend if the occasion arises , but she'd have to be pretty damn spectacular for me to make that leap .
I have had all my children , I am financially secure and have a plan for myself that is better done without a typical American woman 's bullshit to goof it up .
I do n't hate women at all by the way , I just know what is worth my time and what is n't .
I date for the occasional bit of company and to occasionally have sex , that 's about it .
I do n't need a woman in my life full time .
I can cook and clean , etc , etc .
If I wanted full time companionship , I 'd get a dog .
Dog 's are much easier to deal with than women at this point in my life .
Call me shallow , etc etc whatever , that 's fine with me .
I know me a helluva lot better than anyone else does .
I do have some rules for dating .
Since I am not a horny , partying twenty something or a desparate to have kids thirty something these rules work for me .
I think everyone ought to come up with what works for them , keeping the reality of their particular situation in mind .
My personal rules : 1 . I never seriously date a woman who terminated her last relationship because she was n't " happy " .
Happiness is an emotional response to external stimuli .
To break the vow of " til ' death do us part " over an emotional state that may or may not be another person 's fault , is shallow and shows a lack of emotional maturity .
It tells me that woman is too self absorbed to be a reliable partner in the future .
2 . I do n't date fat women .
Sorry , all you " BBWs " ; get a grip on reality .
If you are walking around looking like you have a beer keg stuffed in your pants , you do n't give a shit about yourself , so I really do n't expect you to give a shit about me in the long run .
Do n't give me that crap about how happy you are with yourself , you 're not and we both know it .
If you and I had fallen in love twenty years ago , gotten married and had a family and you had put on the weight , I would still be with you , but we did n't and so I see no need to accommodate your lack of character and discipline .
3 .
I wo n't seriously consider dating a woman who has a lot of hangups about sex .
Since I have had all my children , since I can cook and clean and make a damn good living for myself and my children , you bring nothing to the table I need in the traditional sense .
Hell , most women can't or wo n't cook a decent meal anymore and are as a general rule clueless in regard to the domestic arts .
If you have a lot of hangups about sex before we are monogamous , I pretty much see the writing on the wall after we have been together for a while .
You might not like it , but sex is important to men , yes actually , it IS mostly about sex .
Now that we are all well educated as to the dangers of unprotected sex , STDs and birth control , I do n't see the problem .
Your pussy is not the only one in the universe and it is n't plated with gold .
If you wo n't have sex with a man , one of your slutty sisters around the corner will .
4. Feminists .
I do n't date women who are avowed feminists with a " you go girl " mentality .
Sorry , but your little movement fucked things up in a major way .
I think women ought to vote , receive equal pay for equal work etc. etc .
I do have enough sense to recognize that whether by design or chance , men and women are different and since I think that form follows function there is a reason for our differences .
I do n't want to be around a woman who wants to prove to me she is as good as I am at " man " stuff .
It is annoying .
It makes you look stupid and insecure .
5. " Independent " women .
I never date a woman who feels the need to tout her own independence .
First , independent entities by definition do not want or need to be in any type of union with another entity .
When the United States declared independence from Great Britain , we dissolved the ties that had connected us to the British .
I myself am independent and feel no need to tell everyone about it .
It is called being an adult .
Being able to take care of yourself does n't make you special , it makes you " grown folks " .
Second , if you are that independent , why are you looking for a relationship in the first place ?
Independence is the opposite of dependence and being able to depend on others is why we get into relationships of any kind in the first place .
6 . Women who spend every weekend perched on a barstool .
I do n't date these over the hill party girls because as an adult male , I know why men go to bars and clubs and as a mature adult woman you ought to as well .
If you do know and still sit there every weekend you are trying to be something you are n't ( young , unless you are a drunk ) and I have no desire to be with a woman who lives in a fantasy world .
If you have n't figured out why men go to bars and clubs and you are sitting there hoping to meet prince charming , you are clueless and I like to think the women I date have a modicum of intelligence .
7 .
I do n't date women who have their children full time .
Might come across as a shitty attitude to have , but I see no need to be a full time father to someone else 's children and a part time father to my own .
This is a personal preference I developed after having discussions with my own children .
Mine have been through enough already , I 'm the Dad and feel I am doing what is best for my children , they were here first .
8 .
Anyone who is fanatical about much of anything .
If you are religious fanatic , I too believe in God .
I have a degree in Theology as a matter of fact , but as far as I can tell , God did n't assign any woman at anytime to be my moral gatekeeper .
He did tell you to be " keepers at home " , if you are so caught up in church work that you are making your family the second priority in your life you are n't following your own rule book .
I digress , fanaticism of any kind is a psychological addiction and I prefer to spend my time with people who lead a well balanced life .
Addiction of any kind is a turn off .
9 .
Overly materialistic .
My preference .
I grew up dirt poor and have by hard work gotten myself to a pretty good spot in life .
If you have a desire and need to get the latest and greatest and keep up with the Jones family , you are n't for me .
I see no need to potentially work myself into an early grave to keep you in shiny trinkets and new cars .
I am pretty content with a pot of beans and a nice clean , comfortable house in a decent neighborhood and a vehicle that works and is safe .
If $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ is what motivates you , I am not mad at you or knocking you for it , I am personally not interested .
No , I am not " poor " , it is about priorities .
There ya go .
Do n't know why I posted this .
Saw the comments about people in their 40s dating and this is what came to mind .
I have no real interest in getting into another permanent relationship .
I am content to spend the rest of my life single , but that works for me .
For those disparaging the over 40 dating crowd , even 40 somethings get lonely at times , some more than others .
Some of those people are there through no fault of their own .
they were and are good men and women who had an ex get middle aged crazy and left a good man or woman behind to chase after something they thought they were missing .
Maybe the other person was an abusive asshole or addict and the one who is single had to leave for any number of reasons .
All sorts of reasons people over 40 are single .
Keep breathing and you might find yourself there some day .

Lolita means perversion and controversy to many
Woolworths got into trouble for calling something Lolita , but what 's it like to be lumbered with a name with troubling undertones ?
What 's in a name ?
Quite a lot actually , if your name is Lolita .
This is no longer simply a female given name of Spanish origin , a diminutive form of the more popular , better - established name Dolores , Spanish for " suffering " .
Thanks to Vladimir Nabokov 's still notorious novel Lolita , first published in 1955 , and the two films based on his book - Stanley Kubrick 's classic of 1962 and Adrian Lyne 's updated version in 1997 - the name Lolita has become synonymous with a sexualised view of young girls .
I had a real crisis when I found out my name was Lucifer - I went off the rails
Lucifer Howse
We were reminded of the power of the L - name during the " Lolita bed scandal " at the end of last month .
It was discovered that the Woolworths website was selling a bed called the Lolita Midsleeper Combi aimed at girls aged six and over .
After complaints , the Lolita bed was duly banished .
But how do women named Lolita cope in a society where their name is laden with such potential offence it cannot be attached to items of furniture ?
Latvian popularity
Lolita Jones is a 55 - year - old health and beauty therapist in Hunstanton , Norfolk .
" People should not reduce the name ' Lolita ' to one simple meaning " , she says .
" It 's a real name , and it 's a beautiful name . "
When she was younger , other teens sometimes mocked her .
Ms Jones dealt with it by joking : " Oh yes , that book was written about me .
But mostly they just called me ' Lolly Eater ' , " she recalls .
Being named Lolita became sporadically problematic in the world of work .
Working for British Telecom in London in the 1970s , her colleagues preferred Lola , which stuck .
SOME LOLITAS Actress Lolita Davidovich Designer Lolita Lempicka Lolita De Palma , daughter of Brian Actress Lolita Chakrabarti Singer Lolita Sechan Composer Lolita Ritmanis
The shifting fortunes of the name Lolita can be seen in its declining popularity .
According to the US Social Security Administration ( SSA ) , the popularity of Lolita peaked in the US in 1963 , when it was the 467th most popular name for newborn girls .
It dropped after that , and has not made an appearance in the SSA 's top 1,000 names since 1973 .
Lolita Mackey is 85 and lives in Belper .
She says that in her early life , people told her she had a " beautiful name " .
But by the 1970s and 1980s , " people raised their eyebrows when I said my name " .
She thinks things are changing back again , though .
Scandal factor
And Lolitas are not the only ones who have name troubles .
Some think Lucifer 's a nice name , some not
" Monica is a good example in the US .
The name had been inching up and was at number 79 in 1997 .
The Monica character in Friends helped make it popular .
But in 1998 , after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke , the name slipped to 105 and went down even further the next year , never to recover .
" It was just too linked to odious qualities : abuse of power , sexual degradation ... lots of things you would n't want connected with your innocent newborn daughter . "
The name Katrina has also declined in popularity in the US following Hurricane Katrina .
In Britain , the name Myra declined in popularity following the Moors Murders .
And names such as Adolf and Judas are now extremely rare .
One man who has struggled more than most with his moniker is Lucifer Howse , a 33 - year - old alternative medicine practitioner in Brighton .
Mr Howse only discovered his true first name in his late teens - prior to that , his family called him Luke for short .
" I had a real crisis when I found out my name was Lucifer .
I went off the rails , " he says .
When he picked up his driving licence a few years ago , the woman behind the counter barked Biblical phrases at him and shouted : " It 's you .
I know it 's you . "
But he has now embraced his name .
" People do n't automatically call their children William , Henry or Mary anymore .
They are more experimental . "
Ms Satran agrees .
She points out that strange names can sometimes become self - fulfilling prophecies .
" A study has shown that kids with a name like ' Lethal ' are more likely to grow up to commit crimes - though of course parents who would name their child ' Lethal ' are probably not aiming to be class mom . "
But , she says , more exotic , even formerly outrageous names - such as Juno and even Jezebel - are making something of a comeback .
" Somehow these names seem ready for the playground again . "

E-mail to a friend
by Shaun Boyd
It was a harmless question .
He asked it with no malicious intent .
Still , the mere suggestion of it made my pulse race and my palms sweat :
“ Is anyone interested in a game of poker ? ”
He gestured to a card table .
An immediately recognizable chip - case rested on the felt .
Atop the case was a brand new deck of Bicycle playing cards .
My ears felt hot at the temptation .
I desperately wanted to say “ Yes . ”
I have a gambling problem .
I say that now even though I have n’t gambled in three years because I believe that once you ’re addicted to something , the addiction never disappears .
At best it lies dormant within you until an inopportune moment of indiscretion lets it loose again .
My gambling addiction started in college .
I was there on full scholarship , I worked two days a week , and as a result I had a lot of spare money .
I was introduced to a regular game , and was quickly hooked .
My first night , I lost $ 15 .
I remember thinking that it was okay to lose that money —
I justified the loss by telling myself that I had spent that money to learn how to play poker .
With this single thought , I began a trend of justifying my gambling habit .
For newly two years , I met with this group of friends twice a week and got my poker education .
Like anything else , if you do it enough you ’re bound to get good at it .
Interestingly , I know absolutely nothing about these people except their first names , and that they liked to gamble .
That was our common interest , and that ’s all that mattered .
It was n’t about making friends , it was about making money .
On my 21st birthday , I took $ 250 to the Poker Room at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City .
I lost it all within a few hours .
You ’d think that logic would step in and tell me I was throwing money away , but I convinced myself otherwise .
I was n’t a bad player , or an addict , I had simply caught a bad run of cards .
I justified the loss by reminding myself that I had easily won over $ 250 in the games I played at school .
I was just among a different league of players now , and needed to adjust my play style .
I went back to the casino many times , and I had more success with it .
As I became familiar with the other addicts , I learned how to play with them and win .
Eventually , I thought that I had become so good at poker that I could do it as my career .
So that ’s what I did .
I left my day job in early 2004 to begin my new life as a professional gambler .
I signed up for an account with an online gambling website and began playing poker 10 hours a day from the comfort of my own apartment .
For a professional gambler , I was thoroughly successful .
I could pull anywhere from $ 300 - 500 a week .
With these results , I imagined that professional gambling was the perfect life for me : I could earn as much money as I did working my day job , but this was a lot more fun !
Naturally , this success did n’t last long .
The gambling site began promoting the 2004 World Series of Poker — I became enchanted with it .
I imagined that I could play alongside the Poker Stars at the young age of 21 .
With a $ 10,000 buy - in for the tournament , it nearly guaranteed I would be the youngest contestant there .
I would be on TV .
I would be a feature player and given a weird nickname like “ The Kid . ”
And if I won the World Series , I would win several million dollars , retire at 21 , and go down in Poker History .
I became engrossed in the fantasy .
Saying “ I wanted to go ” would be an understatement — I needed to go , so I entered a “ Qualifier ” for the 2004 World Series of Poker .
To quickly explain the idea behind a “ Qualifier ” for the WSOP :
It costs $ 10,000 to compete in the World Series of Poker .
Most addicts are n’t willing to drop 10 grand to participate .
They are , however , willing to drop $ 220 in a “ Satellite . ”
Even more are willing to drop $ 24 in a “ Qualifier . ”
A Satellite is a multi-table tournament where the winners get a ticket to compete in the WSOP .
For every 55 players in the Satellite , one “ WSOP Package ” is created .
In other words , 55 *( $ 220 ) = $ 12,100 .
The site takes $ 1,100 of this for hosting the Satellite .
The remaining $ 11,000 goes to a player ( 10 grand pays for the seat in the World Series , and $ 1000 pays for the trip ) .
So if 500 players participated in a Satellite , then nine “ WSOP Packages ” would be created .
Consequently , the top 9 ranking players in that particular Satellite tournament would go to the World Series of Poker for the low cost of $ 220 .
For the addicts who think $ 220 is too much to spend on a low chance at going to the WSOP , there is the $ 24 Qualifier .
This is a ten person tournament where the top player wins a seat in the Satellite .
In other words , 10 *( $ 24 ) = $ 240 .
The site takes $ 20 for hosting the Qualifier .
The remaining $ 220 reserves the top player a seat in a Satellite .
I ’m sure you see where this is going :
In March of 2004 , I participated in a Qualifier .
I won , and thus received a chance to compete in a Satellite .
There were 660 players in this particular Satellite , meaning that the top 12 would go on to the 2004 World Series of Poker .
I logged in to compete in the Satellite at 8 pm .
I played the best poker of my life for 7 solid hours until 5 am .
I placed 28th out of 660 players .
I did well , but not well enough to walk away with a “ WSOP Package . ”
Losing the Satellite caused the downward spiral of my poker career .
It ’s what poker players call “ tilt ” — you let your emotions affect your game , and lose a lot of money because you ’re no longer playing rationally .
I wanted to go to the World Series that year .
Since I played rather well in one Satellite , I figured I should try again the next week .
I signed up for another Qualifier .
I lost .
I signed up again , and I lost again .
I continued in this manner until I had spent enough money playing Qualifiers that it would actually have been cheaper to simply pay for the seat in the Satellite .
When Saturday came around and I still had n’t won a Qualifier , I dropped another $ 220 so I could play in that week ’s Satellite .
I played horribly , and lost quickly .
Once again , you ’d think that logic would step in — you ’d think that I ’d realize that I was literally throwing money away .
But the next week I wanted to compete again …
I was addicted .
I was no longer gambling as a means of earning income , I was gambling in order to quench my gambling thirst .
Thanks to my overwhelming desire to go to the WSOP , I lost everything that I had previously earned from gambling profits .
I quickly ended up “ in the hole . ”
Consequently , my “ tilt ” condition worsened because I started chasing my losses .
Before long I was nearly $ 5000 in the hole .
If I did n’t stop gambling , my situation would keep getting worse .
I finally made the choice to cut my losses and quit .
I faced facts : I tried a career as a professional gambler and failed miserably .
The money was gone — and it did n’t matter how much I regretted losing it .
It had already been done — I made bad choices , and I paid for them .
Conquering my addiction took only one step : Eliminate Temptation .
I cut gambling out of my life .
When anyone from my college poker group invites me to a game , I say no .
Whenever I ’m invited to a night at the casino , I say no .
When the person who unknowingly asked a gambling addict “ Is anyone interested in a game of poker ? ” , I said no .
“ I heard that you played poker , ” he said to me .
“ I used to , but I ca n’t anymore .
I have a gambling addiction . ”
“ I highly doubt you ’ll get addicted from just one game , ” he insisted .
“ Look , I once had a 9 - month stint as a professional gambler .
It grew into a real problem for me and I had to stop .
I made a promise to myself that I would n’t gamble again , no matter how harmless it seemed .
So ‘ No thank you , ’ alright ? ”
In order to truly conquer an addiction , you have to commit to your decision to quit every day — because one moment of indiscretion could lead to a lifetime of regret .

The much - anticipated dating and meeting site WooMe is launching to the public today , with some new features and plans .
We first wrote about the company during its alpha launch , at the TechCrunch40 conference .
Dating is both one of the more challenging and more lucrative niches on the internet .
From eHarmony to HotorNot , iminlikewithyou to Match.com , sites have struggled to overcome the social stigma of internet dating and the difficulty of getting people to show off their personalities online — without making them work too much at it .
WooMe ’s angle is speed dating .
Its real - time , minute - long video meetings let users see and talk to each other immediately , allowing the site to get away with only asking for skeletal user profiles and avoid the time - consuming profile - building of other sites .
However , WooMe would prefer to slip around the stigma of the “ dating ” label entirely by encouraging non-dating uses .
CEO Stephen Sokols told us that initial users have been using the platform to meet potential traveling or carpooling companions .
The site will also allow “ Any to Any ” meeting sessions , in which there are no restrictions on the sexes of the participants ; even before the feature was in , we spotted a few business networking sessions taking place on the alpha version of the site .
For those who are actually interested in dating , the sessions are quick and easy , and end with a simple yes or no choice of whether they ’re interested in a particular person .
Also recently added are a “ Flake - o - meter ” to point out users who tend to sign up but not show for sessions , a voice - only option , and the ability to invite others to sessions through Facebook .
But the really neat new feature of WooMe centers around its plan for ads .
When we first talked to the founders of WooMe , they were still deciding how to handle monetizing the site , aside from a $ 1 charge required for users interested in each other to gain the ability to contact each other directly ( something users will be able to get around easily enough , by simply opening a new session and telling each other their email addresses ) .
They ’ve decided to keep the site clean , not placing any display ads .
However , WooMe will selectively slip video advertisements into sessions that have extra room .
For example , if a session is set up for five men and five women , and only four women sign up , the extra minute - long slot will be filled by a video ad .
( If less than three women sign on , the session will be canceled . )
However , if you decide that the ad is annoying , you can reject it — just like any of the other participants in the session .
Alternatively , if it was a good ad , you can Woo it and see similar ones next time there ’s an open slot .
That will provide some built - in targeting , and also give advertisers some valuable feedback on whether their ads are making an impression , or simply irritating people .
Sokols says that WooMe is already in discussions with one of the top three dating sites in the US to offer its video sessions as an add - on ; later , it may offer a white - label version to other companies that have a use for it ( for example , a recruiting firm that wants to interview batches of candidates ) .
Overall , WooMe has a better design and more innovative features than its only competitor , SpeedDate.com , which has the sickly - sweet look of an 80 ’s video dating service .
We think it ’s likely to succeed — how about you ?
The site is open to all registrations today .
Yesterday , we saw the most extraordinary failure of economic leadership in recent years , when the US Federal Reserve pressed the “ emergency morphine ” button and cut Federal Reserve rates by 0.75 % .
It will not help .
These are extremely testing times , and thus far , the US Fed under Bernanke has been found wanting .
Historians may well lay the real blame for current distress at the door of Alan Greenspan , who pioneered the use of morphine to dull economic pain , but they will probably also credit him with a certain level of discretion in its prescription .
During Greenspan ’s tenure at the Fed , economic leaders became convinced that the solution to market distress was to ensure that the financial system had access to easy money .
This proved effective in the short term .
When LTCM looked set to explode ( private investments , leveraged up dramatically , managed by Nobel prize - winning financial theorists , placed a bet on a sure thing which did n’t pan out quite as expected )
Greenspan engineered an orderly unwinding of its affairs .
When the dot com bubble burst , Greenspan kept the financial system energised by lowering rates so far that they were , for a substantial period , at negative levels .
A negative real interest rate means we are effectively paid to take out loans .
That might sound good , but how would you feel if I used the words “ paid to take a few more hits of crack cocaine ” ?
The underlying problem was that people had become accustomed to high rates of return and did not want to accept that real rates of return in the US were moving down .
They had become accustomed to easy money , and Greenspan ’s policy ensured that money remained accessible at a time when people had demonstrated a low ability to invest that easy money well .
Low rates give people an incentive to invest in stocks , even if those stocks are not earning very much .
This meant stock prices recovered quickly , and the effect was amplified by the fact that low rates increased corporate earnings .
This was a so - called “ soft landing ” – disaster averted .
He must have known the risks , but the one big warning sign that would likely have convinced Greenspan to return to normal rates was missing : inflation .
Low rates , and especially negative rates , have historically always resulted in inflation .
Greenspan kept rates low because there were no signs of inflation .
It seemed as if the US had entered a new era where the correlation of rates and inflation no long held true .
People explained it by saying that the US was increasing its productivity dramatically ( productivity increases are like anti-inflation medicine ) .
Now , with hindsight , it appears that the real reason for the absence of inflation was that the Chinese were increasing their productivity dramatically , and that US consumers were spending so much on Chinese goods that Chinese productivity growth , not US productivity growth , was keeping US prices low .
When tech came off the boil and people should have been using the pause to clean up their affairs , Greenspan made it easy for people to get themselves into a worse position .
Easy money made stock market prices artificially high , so stock market investors felt rich .
Worse , easy money made house prices artificially high ( by about 45 % ) , so everybody felt wealthier than they had planned or expected to .
To make matters worse , a series of financial innovations created a whole industry designed to help people go back into debt on their houses .
I remember trying to watch TV in the US and being amazed at the number of advertisements for “ home equity withdrawals ” .
They made it sound like turning your major personal financial asset – your paid - off house – into an ATM machine was a good thing .
In fact , it was a means to spend all of your primary store of wealth .
And with inflated house prices , it was a way to spend money that you did not really have .
A convenient way to get into a deep , dark hole of family debt .
The result ?
The average American owns less of her home today than she did 30 years ago – 55 % as opposed to 68 % .
Easy money makes people poorer .
The company with the most irritating ads , Ditech ( and I feel ashamed to be contributing to their website search ranking with the mention , perhaps it will help instead to link to their customer feedback ) , has a tagline “ People are smart ” and a business model built on the idea that “ People are dumb ” .
Their “ most popular ” product strikes me as being tailor - made to make it easy to turn home equity – an asset – into new debt .
Why did Greenspan do it ?
I think he genuinely believed that there was something different about the modern world that had altered the laws of economic gravity .
I suspect he no longer feels that way .
But Greenspan is no longer Chairman of the Fed .
Ben Bernanke blinked , yesterday , and in that blink we have the measure of the man .
Greenspan acted carefully , logically , and basically prudently .
Several years of anomalous economic data are a reasonable basis to think that the rules have evolved .
You would have to have a Swiss ( 700 years of stability ) or Chinese ( “ we think it ’s too early to tell if the French Revolution was a good idea ” ) approach to stick with economic theories that are at odds with the facts for very long .
Greenspan made a mistake , and it will have huge consequences for the US for a generation , but he had reasons for that mistake .
Bernanke just blinked , he panicked , despite knowing better .
We now have rigorous economic explanations for all that is happening .
We have come to understand , quite clearly , what is going on in the world .
The deflationary Eastern wind has been identified .
We know there is no productivity miracle in the US , no change in the laws of physics or economics .
So we know that the US patient is addicted to easy money morphine , medicine that was prescribed with good intentions by Dr Greenspan , medicine that has in the last 7 years made the patient more ill and not less .
More morphine today constitutes malpractice , not economic innovation .
We know the consequences of more morphine – stock prices will rise artificially ( 4 % yesterday , on the news of the shot ) , house prices will stumble along , companies will take longer to default on their loans .
Bernanke might be hoping to do what Greenspan did – retire before the addiction becomes entirely obvious .
Too late .
While the Fed is clearly not willing to admit it , the markets have just as clearly taken their own view , that the prognosis is not good .
They are smart enough to see that all Bernanke has done is cover up the symptoms of malaise , and many are using the temporary pain relief to head for safer territory .
I expect that any relief will be brief , market recoveries will fade , the rout has been deferred but not averted .
I started out by describing the Fed ’s actions as a failure of economic leadership .
Some folks are lucky enough to lead from the bottom of the cycle , up – they take over when things are miserable and can only really get better .
They look like heroes even if their voodoo has no mojo , so to speak .
Others are less lucky , they get handed custodianship of an asset that is at the peak .
As for Bernanke , he ’s in that latter category .
He needs to be able to speak clearly and frankly about the hard work that lies ahead in the US .
He needs to appeal to the very best of American industriousness – a traditional willingness to work hard , be smart , and accept the consequences of refusing to do so .
He needs to lead under the most difficult circumstances .
But that ’s what leadership is about .
Fortunately for Bernanke , central bank independence is widely believed to be the only credible approach to economic governance .
That independence gives Bernanke the right to stand at odds with political leaders if needed .
Given the recent White House announcements – more morphine , further indebtedness for the worlds most indebted country – there ’s no stomache for a real program of rehabilitation in the Bush Administration .
Bernanke will have to lead without political support , a very difficult task indeed .
Our greatest and most memorable leaders are those who lead through difficult times .
The same is true of failures of leadership .
Appeasement , or rehabilitation .
Chamberlain , or Churchill .
Thus far , Chamberlain .

Bus Scheme : A Scheme Interpreter Written In Ruby ( And Sometimes On A Bus )
By Peter Cooper
License : CC Attribution Credit : conner395 @ Flickr
Bus Scheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language ( a dialect of Lisp ) in Ruby being developed by Phil Hagelberg .
It 's called " Bus " Scheme because it 's being developed while Phil travels on the bus , but Ryan Davis called Phil out on that sly fabrication !
Curiously , Phil claims to have never used any existing Scheme implementations , relying instead on knowledge gleaned from SICP and these incredible computer science lectures ( if you have not seen the Abelson / Sussman lectures yet , you are missing a major programming treat . )
Bus Scheme runs on Ruby 1.8 , 1.9 and Rubinius , and the repository ( where you can view the source without downloading it ) is available here at GitHub , although as noted in the documentation , you can also use gem install bus - scheme
Meanwhile , in a land far , far , away Jim Weirich is working on an implementation of Lisp within Ruby too , although Jim 's clever attempt uses Ruby pre-existing data structures and not a typical parsing and interpretation system .

Melanie Boivin 's daughter has a genetic condition
Should the girl opt to use the eggs and gain regulatory approval , she would effectively have a baby that was her half - brother or sister .
Critics said the work , presented at a fertility conference in Lyon , was deeply concerning .
But the doctors from the McGill Reproductive Center , Montreal , called the donation an act of motherly love .
Would I look at the child as my grandchild or as my own ?
Melanie Boivin
Also , the girl and any future partner would have a choice as to whether to use the eggs or not , they said .
The girl , Flavie Boivin , cannot have children naturally because of a chromosomal condition called Turner 's syndrome .
Desperate to help , mum Melanie , who is 35 and a lawyer , investigated whether she could donate her own eggs .
After much research , she came across Professor Seang Lin Tan 's team at McGill who run an egg freezing programme for cancer patients and those who want to delay childbearing .
Melanie said she discussed the decision with her partner and Flavie 's father , Martin Cote , also 35 and a financial analyst .
Emotional impact
" We were concerned about the ethical questions - would I look at the child as my grandchild or as my own ?
We were also concerned about the financial impact , the physical impact on me and the emotional impact on the family . "
After a year they decided to go ahead .
Could it possibly get more bewildering than this ?

" What made us sure was the fact that I was there to help my daughter .
If I could do anything in my power to help her I had to do it and because of my age I had to do it now .
" I told myself if she had needed another organ like a kidney I would volunteer without any hesitation and it is the same kind of thought process for this . "
Melanie said her daughter would be the real mother as she would be caring for the child .
" I do not want to oblige her to use the eggs ; I want to give her the option . "
Professor
Tan said they had asked for the advice of an independent ethics committee .
" The ethic committee agreed to it because the mother giving to a daughter is out of love and it is up to the daughter and partner in future years to decide whether to use the eggs or not .
" And ethical considerations change with time .
Who knows what the ethics will be in 20 years from now . "
Identity problems
Professor
Tan said this was the first case of mother - to - daughter egg donation .
There have been cases of donation from sister to sister .
TURNER'S SYNDROME
A genetic condition that causes impaired growth and learning difficulties Destroys eggs , leading to an unusually early menopause
Dr Richard Kennedy , of the British Fertility Society , said : " This altruistic behaviour is not dissimilar to the scenario where a parent donates a kidney to a child .
" In this case , instead of using eggs from an unknown donor , she will get the opportunity to know the source .
" Although this means the resulting offspring will be similar in genetics , an unrelated sperm will be used - and this means that the offspring will not be a true sister . "
Josephine Quintavalle , of Comment on Reproductive Ethics , expressed sympathy with the family , but could not support storing the mother 's eggs .
She said : " The psychological welfare of the baby itself has to be the principal concern .
" Such a baby would be a sibling of the birth mother at the same time as the direct genetic offspring of the grandmother donor .
" In psychiatry we are hearing more and more of children suffering from identity problems , and specifically a condition called ' genealogical bewilderment ' .
Could it possibly get more bewildering than this ?
" We have to stop thinking of women only in terms of their reproductive potential .
" The daughter could live a full and happy life without having children of her own . "

MySQL - Proxy , announced in June , is a binary application that sits between your MySQL client and server , and supports the embedded scripting language Lua .
The proxy can be used to analyze , monitor and transform communication , and supports a wide range of scenarios including :
One of the more powerful features of MySQL Proxy is the ability to do " Read / Write Splitting " .
The basic concept is to have a master database handle transactional queries while slaves handle SELECT queries .
Replication is used to synchronize the changes due to transactional queries with the slaves in the cluster .
Jan Kneschke writing about the technique in " MySQL Proxy learns R/ W Splitting " , discusses connection pooling :
The LUA script to handle read / write splitting is straightforward : Jan notes that the technique can also be used to implement other data distribution strategies , such as sharding .

Police spotted the cleric 's unusual demeanour amid a group of girls
Security forces seized Maulana Abdul Aziz as he tried to leave the Red Mosque amid a crowd of women .
The mosque is surrounded by Pakistani troops after gun battles with armed students killed 16 on Tuesday .
They have been told to give themselves up .
Clerics at the mosque are campaigning for Islamic Sharia law to be enforced .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says that there is a feeling that the siege may be entering its end stages as three senior Muslim clerics have entered the mosque to try negotiate with Abdul Rashid Ghazi , the deputy leader of the mosque and brother to Abdul Aziz .
Security forces have also been moving around inside the compound , our correspondent says .
Abdul Rashid is reportedly saying that he is willing to surrender if certain demands are met however , the government remains adamant that all armed people inside the mosque should surrender unconditionally .
The deputy commissioner of police in Islamabad , Chaudhry Muhammad Ali , described how Abdul Aziz tried to escape wearing the all - enveloping dress worn by Muslim women .
" The maulana came out of the mosque with a group of girls wearing a burka and carrying a handbag .
The girls protested when he was stopped .
But officers were suspicious and after a search , Maulana Abdul Aziz was identified and arrested , " he told the BBC .
Another security official told AFP that the cleric had been picked out because of his " unusual demeanour " .
" The rest of the girls looked like girls , but he was taller and had a pot belly , " the official said .
Abdul Aziz was captured as more than 700 of his followers surrendered to government forces .
Protests
As news of the arrest filtered through , a small group of his supporters gathered outside the cordoned - off area to protest .
Female students who were let out were being allowed to go home , while male students were being held and searched .
The authorities have extended the deadline for students to surrender .
They say they want to allow as many as possible to leave peacefully , but they also say they are prepared for force , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .
Security officials estimate that eventually a hard core of several hundred militants will be left , but it is not clear whether the arrest of Abdul Aziz will help to resolve the situation , our correspondent says .
Earlier , troops in armoured personnel carriers surrounded the mosque as helicopter gunships circled overhead and gunfire was heard .
Several thousand people remain inside the Red Mosque ( Lal Masjid ) complex , and many of them are young students at a girls ' school .
In addition to the 16 people killed during Tuesday 's violence , more than 140 people were hurt , officials said .
Curfew
Troops sealed off the area around the mosque after Tuesday 's clashes and no - one is able to get within about one kilometre of the site .
At daybreak , soldiers strung barbed wire across streets near the mosque , where armed students have barricaded themselves in .
An indefinite curfew is in place around the Red Mosque , and power and water supplies have been cut off .
Those inside have been ordered to give up their weapons , although officials have said they do not want more bloodshed .
Clerics , acting as intermediaries , held overnight talks with both sides , but there has been no sign of a breakthrough .
At least two deadlines set by the government for students to surrender have passed .
The government has said women and children can go free - with offers of money and safe passage - but top mosque leaders and males involved in killings and other crimes will face prosecution .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , said in a statement that Saudi national Shaker Aamer would not be released because the US government had " expressed significant additional security concerns " and had rejected the foreign office 's request .
News of the refusal contradicted reports last Thursday that Aamer would be one of four British residents who would be released imminently from the camp , albeit to his home country of Saudi Arabia .
The continued detention of Aamer will be an embarrassment for Gordon Brown , as the release of all four men was seen as a triumph for the government , following apparently frank discussions with the US .
" They have so far declined the request for the release and return of Mr Aamer and we are no longer in active discussions regarding his transfer to the UK , " said Miliband .
He said that another British resident , Ethiopian - born Binyam Mohamed , would not be released , confirming last Thursday 's reports , but said the foreign office was " still discussing " his case , even though " the US government is not inclined to agree to his release and return " .
Miliband confirmed that the US had agreed the release of Jordanian Jamil el - Banna , Libyan - born Omar Deghayes and Algerian Abdennour Sameur .
He said the five detainees who were the subject of the statement were the only individuals remaining at Guantánamo who had been " given leave to enter or remain in the UK under the immigration acts " .
He added that the foreign office had been in contact with the families of el - Banna , Deghayes and Sameur but said the decision did not " constitute a commitment that they may remain permanently in the UK " , amid concerns raised by the opposition over the threat they might pose to national security .
" We will continue to discuss with the US government how best we can work with them to see the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility , " he said .
The foreign secretary said he would also encourage Britain 's allies " to consider taking steps similar to our own to reduce the numbers of those detained at Guantánamo Bay , such as accepting the transfer of eligible detainees , thereby hastening the closure of the detention facility " .
I have joined up with some of the guys from ODYNUG who have started meeting for breakfast and learning Common Lisp together .
We are all using some version of Emacs , SLIME , and SBCL .
Blaine shared a cool way to make SLIME load much faster by taking advantage of the fact that Lisp uses images like Smalltalk ( or more accurately , Smalltalk uses images like Lisp ) .
He posted it for the group to see , but I wanted to post it here for my readers .
SBCL allows you to specify an image , or as they call it a core , by passing the -- core option along with ( as far as I can tell ) an absolute path to the core file ( well , at least it does n’t know that ~ means $ HOME ) .
It , of course , also provides a way to create these core files , so you can load a bunch of stuff in , and then save a core file that has all of that already loaded .
So first , go into your SLIME directory and copy swank - loader .lisp to swank - loader - original.lisp .
Then make swank - loader .lisp look like this ( changing slime - dir to be wherever your SLIME is , of course ) :
( if ( not ( find - package ' swank - loader ) ) ;; Edit SLIME - DIR to be where you have SLIME installed .
( let ( ( slime - dir ( merge- pathnames " .elisp / slime / " ( user- homedir - pathname ) ) ) ) ( load ( merge - pathnames " swank - loader - original " slime - dir ) ) ) )
Then , make a file called bootstrap.lisp with the following content :
;; Load Swank ( load ( merge- pathnames " .elisp/slime/ swank - loader " ( user - homedir - pathname ) ) ) ;;
Save image ( sb-ext: save-lisp-and -die " sbcl-with-slime.core " )
And run this command :
$ sbcl -- load bootstrap.lisp
Then copy sbcl - with - slime .core somewhere safe , I put mine in with my slime code to keep it all together .
Then you just have to add the following to your .emacs :
( let* ( ( slime - dir ( concat elisp - dir " / slime " ) ) ( core - file ( concat slime - dir " / sbcl-with-slime.core " ) ) ) ( setq inferior - lisp - program ( concat " sbcl -- core " core - file ) ) )
Climatologists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York City have found that 2007 tied with 1998 for Earth ’s second warmest year in a century .
Goddard Institute researchers used temperature data from weather stations on land , satellite measurements of sea ice temperature since 1982 and data from ships for earlier years .
The greatest warming in 2007 occurred in the Arctic , and neighboring high latitude regions .
Global warming has a larger affect in polar areas , as the loss of snow and ice leads to more open water , which absorbs more sunlight and warmth .
Snow and ice reflect sunlight ; when they disappear , so too does their ability to deflect warming rays .
The large Arctic warm anomaly of 2007 is consistent with observations of record low geographic extent of Arctic sea ice in September 2007 .
" As we predicted last year , 2007 was warmer than 2006 , continuing the strong warming trend of the past 30 years that has been confidently attributed to the effect of increasing human - made greenhouse gases , " said James Hansen , director of NASA GISS .
" It is unlikely that 2008 will be a year with truly exceptional global mean temperature , " said Hansen .
" Barring a large volcanic eruption , a record global temperature clearly exceeding that of 2005 can be expected within the next few years , at the time of the next El Nino , because of the background warming trend attributable to continuing increases of greenhouse gases . "
The eight warmest years in the GISS record have all occurred since 1998 , and the 14 warmest years in the record have all occurred since 1990 .
A minor data processing error found in the GISS temperature analysis in early 2007 does not affect the present analysis .
The data processing flaw was failure to apply NOAA adjustments to United States Historical Climatology Network stations in 2000 - 2006 , as the records for those years were taken from a different data base ( Global Historical Climatology Network ) .
This flaw affected only 1.6 % of the Earth ’s surface ( contiguous 48 states ) and only the several years in the 21st century .
The data processing flaw did not alter the ordering of the warmest years on record and the global ranks were unaffected .
In the contiguous 48 states , the statistical tie among 1934 , 1998 and 2005 as the warmest year (s ) was unchanged .
In the current analysis , in the flawed analysis , and in the published GISS analysis , 1934 is the warmest year in the contiguous states ( but not globally ) by an amount ( magnitude of the order of 0.01 °C ) that is an order of magnitude smaller than the certainty .

R6RS Ratification Vote
Here are the final results of the ratification vote .
67 electors voted to ratify draft 5.97 as R6RS. 35 electors were opposed to ratification .
Thus 65.7 % of those who voted , voted in favor of ratification .
This is more than the 60 % required for ratification .
The Steering Committee therefore ratifies the draft numbered 5.97 as the official " Revised6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme " .
A companion document containing some additional correspondence received after the poll closed is available here .
Voting in favor of ratification :
Voting against ratification :
The language is described and explained very well .
Let me begin this addendum to my vote with thanks to the editors of the report , and everyone involved in the Scheme standardization process .
I imagine it must have been a monumental effort , and I appreciate the work put into this wonderful programming language that I like so much .
On reading the report and associated documents , and pondering what they contained and did not contain , I ultimately reached a position I expect to be isomorphic to that of all those who vote to ratify the proposal ---
' This putative standard is not perfect , but it is enough of an improvement over the previous state of affairs that it deserves to be ratified . '
I have , on reflection , found that all of the imperfections that troubled me are solvable with standard - consistent SRFIs ( which admittedly are not necessarily implementable portably ) and support from the programming environment .
Nevertheless , I feel that two of these imperfections deserve description here , perhaps as fodder for additions to the Rationale document , and perhaps to stimulate the production of said SRFIs .
One of the imperfections that troubled me is the apparent inflexibility of the library system .
It appears that it is difficult to define and use a library for , say , generic arithmetic , that would extend + and * to work on , say , matrices .
Specifically , it appears that if one were to just import ( rnrs ( 6 ) ) and ( generic - arithmetic ) , one would get a symbol conflict and one 's program would not run .
Consequently , one must explicitly exclude or rename the ( rnrs ( 6 ) ) symbols that are also exported by the putative ( generic - arithmetic ) library .
One is forced to choose whether to exclude all the symbols that ( generic - arithmetic ) redefines or only to import those symbols from ( generic - arithmetic ) that one wants , and exclude only them .
Both options are unfortunate .
Excluding all ( generic - arithmetic ) symbols from one 's ( rnrs ( 6 ) ) import is annoying , especially in the situation where ( generic - arithmetic ) exports many symbols , such as cos or expt , many of which one might not care about , and which one might need to seek out in the library 's documentation .
Doing so is also unstable if the ( generic - arithmetic ) library is updated to overwrite more ( or fewer ! ) symbols from ( rnrs ( 6 ) ) .
On the other hand , importing only the symbols one wants from ( generic - arithmetic ) is also annoying , because it is difficult to remember all the operations one may wish to use , because one has to mention them in both the exclude and the import only clauses , and of course because one will then change one 's mind about which exports of ( generic - arithmetic ) one wants .
I have high hopes , however , that either a SRFI that extends the library import syntax with a shadow form and / or a clever M-x organize - imports function will alleviate this trouble .
The other imperfection that troubled me is the absence of a facility analagous to Common Lisp 's reader macros , and even an apparent obstacle to the definition of such a facility .
I have several specific use cases for such a facility in mind , mostly to do with literal strings and regular expressions .
Regular expressions , for better or for worse , use the backslash as an escape character just like strings do , but with a different set of escapable characters .
If one tries to write literal regular expressions in Scheme , therefore , one is forced to double those of one 's backslashes that are intended for the regular expression parser rather than the string parser .
Furthermore , the natural printed representations of regular expressions will include backslashes , and are therefore grossly unsuitable for copying and pasting into Scheme source .
All this is irritating in the extreme , and I wish Scheme had a mechanism whereby I could write a user - land library that permitted something like # / foo|bar / as literal syntax for a regular expression ( in this case , one that matched either ' foo ' or ' bar ' ) .
In the particular case of regular expressions , a macro wo n't have the desired effect , because the string out of which one would build a regular expression gets read by the reader , with the attendant substitution of backslash escapes , before the macro - expander sees it .
[ Note that while I am all for an s-expression language for semantically specifying complex regular expressions , the compact , string - based notation is , in my experience , far easier to read for short , simple ones . ]
Another use - case for reader macros would be a facility analagous to Ruby 's and Perl 's string substitution mechanisms .
I would like to be able to write what amounts to quasiquote for strings , and while the bulk of the work can certainly be done by a macro , it would be nice to have a short cut analagous to the backquote , perhaps sharpsign doublequote , for all of the same reasons .
Yet another use - case for reader macros are here documents , again inspired by Perl and Ruby .
Those languages provide a facility for embedding comparatively long documents into one 's source code as string literals .
Long literal strings have different needs from short ones , for instance in that the usual string delimiter characters may appear in them .
Therefore , the here document facilities I am familiar with give the programmer control over the end delimiter used ( often the word END or HERE on a line by itself , hence the name of the facility ) and some control over the amount of string interpolation that is done on such embedded texts .
Scheme could benefit from a library for this , and it seems that such a facility cannot be implemented as a macro over data that has already been processed by the reader .
I have made the case that there are extensions to Scheme 's lexical syntax that are worth considering adding to the language .
They are sufficiently disparate and special - purpose that it would be aesthetically displeasing , to say the least , to implement them all as separate , one - off additions to the syntax of the language .
They are also complex enough that it would be very valuable to be able to implement them as user libraries and actually experiment with how well they work , without having to recompile one 's Scheme , before submitting SRFIs proposing specific variations to the larger community .
In fact , it would be valuable to be able to use such extensions in one 's own work , portably across implementations , without having to secure the community 's consensus at all .
I am therefore troubled by the paragraph immediately preceding Section 4.1 of the main report , which appears to throw up an obstacle to the implementation of reader macros or any analagous facility as a SRFI , in the form of a prohibition against any changes of the lexical syntax of Scheme whatever .
One reading of that paragraph suggests that that impression may be mistaken , as a SRFI that introduced a shebang directive like #! srfi-314 - reader - macros which signalled that subsequent code was subject to interpretation according to the reader macro facility specified in this hypothetical SRFI 314 would constitute a standard - compliant extension adding reader macros , but such a directive feels like an awkward increase in boilerplate , and begins to smack of a thrid - party code distribution mechanism completely orthogonal to the library system .
Whether or not that reading of the report is , in fact , the intended one , I would greatly appreciate a rewording of the relevant segments to make that clearer , as well as a section of the Rationale document explaining why the editors of the report reached the decision that they did about reader macros .
I think the draft is a good continuation of the current standard .
In particular , I like the newly introduced concept of libraries , that the handling of unicode characters is specified and that error conditions can be handled within a Scheme program in a standardized way .
I am an idiot for not replacing this text .
While there are some aspects of R5.97RS that I 'm uncomfortable with , I think it 's an overall step in the right direction .
I 'm confident that time will tell which aspects of the report need to be corrected , and that this will be done for R7RS .
I am voting ' Yes ' for ratification of the current R6RS draft .
My belief is that the draft represents a step forward for Scheme and that it accomplishes stated goals of the editors like unicode support , libraries and exceptions .
In addition , I wrote in my registration statement that one of the criteria by which we should judge this standard is whether it provides clear direction on how to accomplish basic programming tasks in a way that does not require building your own infrastructure , or resorting to implementation - specific features .
I believe that the current draft standard does an acceptable job meeting this criteria by providing standard mechanisms for things like exceptions and tagged records .
I would like the thank the editors for their hard work and dedication in bringing the standard to its current state .
I confess that I did n't follow the development process of R6RS closely , but I have spent considerable time over the last few weeks reading the report and the various email trails carefully .
I started out feeling pretty negative about the report .
I really liked the 50 - page tight simplicity of R5RS .
But I 've made my peace with most of R6RS .
I do appreciate that there are a number of things that are specified in much greater detail , and / or better explained , and / or made more consistent .
And while I 'm not sure of the need for * all * the macro facilities , I 'm willing to believe that they were felt necessary by people with more expertise in this area than me .
A few minor observations :
The terms * static * and * dynamic * scoping are used , and perhaps it can be assumed that the reader of this report would know what they mean .
But it could n't hurt , for instance , when explaining how a lambda expression evaluates to a procedure , that the particular method of evaluation implements static scoping .
The term * deprecated * is used twice in the report , and twice in the rationale , but as far as I can see , is never defined .
And I think in addition , that some justification should be given for the deprecation of features .
I 'm particularly concerned about force and delay , but the point is general .
Some answers are hinted at near the end of the rationale document , in a very terse fashion , and force and delay are n't dealt with at all .
I do n't understand the way the base library functions in the report .
In particular , I do n't see why the base library is n't just part of the language .
I mean , you do n't have much of a language without arithmetic , for example , right ?
Why does a program need to explicitly import it ?
( Or did I miss something ? )
I know that in general , there is no definitive answer to why something gets in a language report .
The ultimate answer simply is that the vote went that way .
Nevertheless , I think the time may be right for an expository piece -- perhaps even a short book -- that attempts to justify the current definition of the language .
Another obvious question , for instance , is this :
Since call / cc has always been regarded largely as the Scheme escape mechanism , why was a new escape mechanism introduced in addition ?
And does this now do away with the need for call / cc ?
( I assume the answer is no , and I think I could even come up with a reason myself , but I 'd like to see some discussion of this .
It would at least be interesting , I think . )
Maybe the answers to all these questions are available in the report or the email trail .
But I 'll bet that if I missed them , then a lot of other people did , or will , as well .
I find the current draft to be an excellent compromise .
Building a standard that is acceptable to the community as a whole , especially one as opinionated as the Scheme community , is clearly going to make no one completely happy .
However , R5.97RS contains all of the elements that I feel the new standard needs , perhaps not in exactly the same form as I would have specified them , but definitely in a form that should be acceptable to any implementer .
Therefore I am voting TO RATIFY this draft of R6RS .
R6RS is a huge step forward .
May its fulfillment match its promise .
The 5.97 draft standard brings Scheme up - to - date , helping to make it a viable alternative to more popular languages such as Java and Python .
It library feature promises to facilitate a much larger body of portable Scheme code .
And although these languages are improving , by borrowing ideas from Scheme and other functional languages , they still sorely lack features of Scheme which are important for my work , such as s-expressions and macros , which are incredibly useful for implementing domain specific languages .
I understand that 5.97 may not be perfect from an academic point of view , but Scheme standards are living documents .
The SRFI process and future versions of the Revised Report provide procedures for continuing to improve the standard .
And Scheme implementors are surely free to make non-standard improvements and extensions , as they have in the past .
R5.97RS is a reasonable candidate .
Ratifying it now is better than wait and quibble about details for an indefinite time .
There is no doubt that this report has numerous advantages over R5RS and implementations should support it as soon as possible .
Reading through all of the electorates stated concerns makes me feel nostalgic ; thinking back to that moment I first fell in love with computer science .
Scheme seems to have that effect on people ; love at first sight .
Having read once that ' any truly good language , no matter what its original goals , will eventually become a general purpose programming language ; that is the nature of a good language ' , I can't help but think that Scheme has this nature .
Scheme is special .
It draws people in .
It is a place to learn , and play .
My hope is that the direction set forth by R6RS will prepare Scheme for the masses , giving it an opportunity truly shine .
The proposed standard is an enormous improvement in my opinion .
It makes the language much more complete and easier to use for various tasks .
Most importantly , it will allow practical support for the language to grow rapidly .
I would not be surprised if the proposed standard , if accepted , turns out to be a major breakthrough for the language .
No comments
I think that this version ( 5.97 ) is good progress to a better standard of Scheme , the basic ideas --- lexical scoping , continuations , ...--- being still present .
Concerning the language itself , I especially appreciate : --- the notion of libraries , --- the way the standard libraries have been built , --- the definition of exceptions .
My regrets : --- some functionalities related to handling files and directories are missing , --- the functions dealing with Unicode could have been more powerful .
About the report , I appreciate the clear distinction among must / must not / should / shoud not / may .
To conclude with a personal touch , I would be ready to rewrite MlBibTeX --- my new implementation of the BibTeX program --- using this new version .
I vote yes , not because I think R5.97RS is perfect , or because I agree with every detail of it , but because I think it is good enough to become the next generation of Scheme .
See my registration for further explanations .
R5.97RS is a compromise , and a well - crafted compromise is in my opinion the most sacred thing that a secular age knows .
Almost all of the proposed changes increase Scheme 's usability more than they reduce its simplicity and elegance , even for novice programmers .
Scheme needs facilities for portable development .
I believe that R6RS will unite the Scheme community and reduce incompatibility between implementations .
Other people express their opinions so good that I will refer to them .
Essay of Matthew Flatt says it all about a process of standartization : polishing current document will take lots of time and will add very little , we can wait for perfection forever .
Let 's make a milestone and see what will happen next .
Developers of Scheme implementations who will like the result will soon make their products to be standard - compliant , others will stay with old standards , so we will clearly see how popular new standard will be .
Previous standards also had some missing parts , which were added by subsequent standards , and had some unnesessary parts , removed by subsequent standards .
Regarding a direction where Scheme standard is going , I will refer to essay of John Clements who calls for unity in areas which are no longer experimental field , but practical nesessity .
I 've looked over the 5.97 draft and read the criticism that it includes too much .
However , I disagree .
While simplicity has always been one of the hallmarks of Scheme , the extremely small core language makes fragmentation between implementations inevitable .
I believe that a more thorough standard is required to ensure potability .
The current 5.97 draft standard represents a reasonable consensus among the Scheme community and will serve well as the basis for future evolution of the language .
Although not perfect and still containing many areas that can be improved ( as seen in the electronic discussion ) , I vote for approval .
What we have here is a solid basis from which we can continue to guide the evolution of the Scheme standard .
I see R6RS not as having reached the end goal , but as a step in the devlopement process .
I thank the members of the committee for their time and effort .
The library system is an incredible step forward .
It brings us closer to being able to write large systems that are portable across multiple implementations .
R6RS is " perfect " .
Progress before perfection
I wanted to vote against ratification because some aspects of the standard are less than perfect .
It 's the tension between " the right thing " vs. " worse is better " .
This time Scheme needs a splash of " worse is better " to move the language standard forward .
Let 's hope some experience can help the next standards group reach for the right thing .
It 's not perfect , but it 's good enough , and I 'm happy to leave pursuit of perfection to the r7rs editors .
A more extensive standard will make it easier to convince colleagues to use it .
Reason for voting yes : pragmatism .
If I am to continue to write Scheme code , I must be able to make use of multiple implementations without bending over backwards to do so .
The current draft is not perfect , but it is a clear improvement on R5RS and takes Scheme forward in the correct direction .
It is time for Scheme to move forward .
Well , it 's not terribly clever of me but I will steal a quote that J.H. Conway uses in the preface to ' On Numbers and Games ' from Bunyan 's ' Apology for his Book ( Pilgrim 's Progress ) :
Some said ' John , print it ' ; others said ' Not so . '
Some said ' It might do good ' ; others said ' No . '
It will be a waste of time to drag out discussion of the draft much longer and , even for all the objections raised , ' it might do good . '
Meanwhile , if there is long - term substance to the dissent , I am hopeful that that that dissent can gracefully congeal in and exploit the SRFI process to evolve things beyond the current draft .
If it seems I 'm saying ' Sigh .
It 'll do I guess .
Good enough , ' well , I suppose I am .
That 's not feint praise , though -- not for R_RS .
I no longer feel strongly enough about the case - sensitivity issue to throw a monkey - wrench into the whole ratification process .
Besides , with Unicode being allowed as < constituent >s of < identifier >s , the case mapping would get complicated .
If it was only < letter > s that were at issue , then it would expose a certain ' Roman ' bias in the language .
After all , it is easy to imagine someone having a good reason for an upper - case Greek letter being destinct from its lower - case counterpart .
greater compatibility between implementations
I would gladly trade a report full of mistakes --- not that I think this is such a report , but some do --- for a library system which properly handles hygienic macros .
Therefore , I am voting " Yes " on R6RS .
( The exception specification is just icing on the cake , as far as I 'm concerned . )
Some consolation for those who do think this report is full of mistakes : 1 . I expect we 'll be seeing lots of " ( r6rs base ) " - compliant implementations which leave off libraries they do n't like , and 2 . " ... in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right . "
--- Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co. , 285 U.S. 393 , 406--408 ( 1932 ) ( Justice Brandeis dissenting ) .
There are a number of good , nice things that I see being made available in this draft at a high level , and I greatly applaud the efforts of the committee to develop something that fosters the important goals of portability and simplicity .
However , if I were to sum up my objections to ratifying this current draft , it would simply be that this draft no longer maintains what I have come to believe to be the core philosophical values of the Scheme language .
This draft appears to diverge so significantly from the other drafts in terms of organization , size , and scope , that it seems like it should not even be considered the same species .
While I cannot call myself qualified enough to discuss the minute details of language specification and detail , I can come at this from an user who has utilized Scheme for pedagogical , professional , and research uses .
If the language fails to be able to provide for these three sectors , it fails to adequately serve its purpose .
I believe that the standard falls short of meeting what I would consider essential advantages of Scheme in all three of these areas .
It appears as though this standard attempts to bring in the ideas or concepts of other languages in an attempt to convert the language from a Beautiful Lisp language , to just another common programming language with some cool features and a strange syntax .
That is to say , the focus seems to have been lost .
Let me first deal with the pedagogical area .
This draft removes the aspects of elegant simplicity and limited scope that make Scheme such a great language for teaching .
Right now , Scheme is easy to learn , because the core concepts are simple , and they extend outward in reasonable , predictable ways .
A student who is learning to program can focus on a small aspect of the language and feel comfortable with tackling the rest of it later .
As I see it now , the standard has become massive relative to R5RS .
Not only does its size hinder a new student , but it also makes creating simple conforming Schemes that are easy for a newcomer to learn impossible .
Now , I do teach , but more pressing on my needs are research and professional development .
I see severe limitations of the language with regards to professional development .
Something that was great about using Scheme for professional development was that I could precisely mold my implementation and code to fit the task at hand precisely , rather than using large , sledge hammer tactics , such as is often the case with over engineered OO designs .
Many of these features included in this draft are absolutely useful features that I like to have in an implementation .
However , to require them in the standard limits the capacity of the implementors to work in small , specialized fields .
Embedded devices immediately come to mind , but other things also come to mind , such as applications that may not desire unicode , libraries , or other pieces .
Granted , I do believe in the goals of interoperability , which is one of the most problematic issues with Scheme's .
I am not happy with the way the library , unicode , disregard for very standard SRFI 's , such as SRFI - 1 .
There does not seem to be enough flexibility given to the implementors to do things in ways that might suit particular applications .
Put simply , the goal of interoperability should not be achieved by demanding that one size fits all .
Rather , there should be discovered some way to simplify , rather than add on features , and to reduce the total bloat in a way that permits such bloat as extensions if desirable , but allows this to be done in a way so that applications may have confidence of running unmodified on other implementations assuming that the needed extensions exist .
Rather , this standard assumes that features exist , and hopes to provide portability in this way .
I do not like this .
While I would love to see the features outlined here in implementations , I also wish to respect the flexibility of the language to permit specialized and very minimal implementations , without having to break with the standard .
Now I 'd like to come to one of my own personal rants .
Case - sensitivity .
The change to case sensitivity flies in the face of Scheme tradition , for little to no benefit .
To suggest such a major change in the standard , imo , for absolutely no significant benefit , against the traditions of Scheme , seems to be very , very ugly .
Besides the fact that its easier to add Case - sensitivity in than to remove it in individual implementations , I very much dislike this new addition , and take it as my example that this standard is trying to change the heart of Scheme .
Thus , therefore , No .
As many other schemers I think that what makes Scheme great is its reduction to the strict minimum .
I must agree that nowadays , a language that does not handle UTF - 8 , should it be in strings or identifiers , irritates me quite a bit .
I also believe that a language that clearly lacks a module / library / embedded - regexps system often ends up being a real pain to use .
And I am not the only one to reimplement FOLD - LEFT or FILTER more than once a day .
Of course , there are some SRFI 's out there supposed to make our lives easier .
And I believe in that .
In fact , I believe a lot more in time spent developping new SRFIs , than in time spent wondering about the best character set .
For this reason , although I agree more than I disagree with the R6RS draft , I decided to vote ' No ' .
I personnaly stick more to R4RS than even R5RS ( for I like plain old dirty DEFINE - MACRO and its lack of hygiene ) , and I see no point in supporting R6RS .
Moreover , I reckon that it will make Scheme too much complicated for a gain not worth it .
I suggest well all focus on defining vital SRFIs , and that we all agree on portable extensions of Scheme , to implement , say , TCP / IP , non blocking IOs or bindings to a graphical library .
I think that it costs too much to add a module system , and that this should be left to the maintainer of implementations to give their own if they want .
Yet , whatever system they use ( shoud it even be built - in or ' built - over ' as Snow ) , we should agree on definining and sharing APIs for just anything we find useful .
Eventually , I decided to say
No to R6RS , not because I think its fundamentally bad , but because I think that it is definitely not what we should be focusing on .
Think of it as an ' I say no for your own good ' .
I hope that the community will always be open and eager to share and compare opinions , as it is now , and that the next major evolution of our langage will not rely on its already genetically well fitted design , but rather on its ease of use for whatever challenging task we encounter .
And that sockets will be implemented eventhough no generic portable implementation could be given .
In fact , I see Scheme as someone with a psychic disorder .
We have a well defined language , we can think with it .
But we spent ( and still spend ) so much time in defining the language itself that we eventually forgot to define the way to speak and communicate with the outside world .
And R6RS does not solve this issue , neither does it offer the tools to solve it .
Let 's keep Scheme small , but let 's add some new plugs to it .
( No Scheme implementation was hurt during the redaction of this ballot .
And the camel was already dead , I swear . )
1. Prolog =========
The candidate R6RS has been prepared over several years by a distinguished group of editors .
They have worked hard to identify and solve problems in the R5RS to make Scheme a more useful language while remaining faithful to its origins .
In particular , they have engaged in a public discussion of various drafts over most of the last year .
We are indebted to the editors .
2 . Vote =======
With regret , I vote to REJECT the candidate R6RS .
3 . Reasons For Rejection ========================
The steering committee requires that votes to reject the candidate be accompanied by an explanation .
My five reasons are given in this section .
3.1 . Implicit mantissa widths
-----------------------------
Section 4.2.8 of the candidate R6RS requires
If x is an external representation of an inexact real number object that contains no vertical bar , then its numerical value should be computed as though it had a mantissa width of 53 or more .
Such implicit mantissa widths have not been justified in the rationale or in discussions on the r6rs - discuss mailing list .
It is not clear what problem they solve .
The use of ' should ' indicates that this is a recommendation .
As such , this does nothing to solve problems of incompatibilities between implementations .
On the other hand , it is simultaneously harmless and dangerous .
Harmless because the ' or more ' implies that the value might be calculated in infinite precision ( i.e. , exactly ) and dangerous because it permits double rounding ( e.g. , if the implementation would represent the result using an IEEE double - precision format and the value is subnormal or if the implementation would represent the result using an IEEE single - precision format ) .
3.2 No Rounding Mode for Mantissa Widths
----------------------------------------
The candidate R6RS does not specify whether 0.75|1 should round to 0.5 or 1.0 .
This makes the mantissa widths unportable between implementations .
3.3 Explicit Mantissa Widths
----------------------------
Two reasons have been given for including explicit mantissa widths .
Will Clinger [ 1 ] stated :
The |p notation is a replacement for the # notation that the R5RS used for nonsignificant digits .
One of the things we learned from this process is that many Scheme programmers , perhaps even a majority , and apparently including several implementors , were interpreting # to mean 5 rather than 0 .
That does n't work , because it makes the numerical value depend upon the number of trailing #s , which are supposed to be insignificant .
We also learned that hardly anyone is using the R5RS notation .
Mike Sperber [ 2 ] stated :
The way we have it now ( I hope ) at least gives implementations a chance to exactly represent binary floating - point numbers on output in external representations .
I note that these justifications are in apparent conflict .
One suggests that the |p notation is supposed to be an indicator of less precision and the other suggests that the same notation is supposed to be an indicator of a more precision .
I would suggest that the |p notation goes against the guiding principle that ' programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary . '
I would suggest : Continuing to use # to indicate imprecision , but tightening up the definition so that it is clear that it is to be interpreted as 0 and not 5 .
Alternatively , since ' hardly anyone is using ' this notation , eliminate it .
Extend the lexical syntax of inexact numbers to allow mantissas to be read and written in binary , octal , decimal , and hexadecimal .
( An ambiguity in the syntax for non-decimals could be required by requiring a point at the end of the number or immediately before the exponent so , # x0e0 is an exact integer not an inexact zero whereas # x0 .
and # x0.e0 are inexact zeros . )
The number -> string procedure should also be extended to allow for non-decimal radixes for inexact numbers .
3.4 Records -----------
Andre van Tonder [ 3 ] and Will Clinger [ 4 ] have pointed out an incompatibility between the procedural and syntactic record layers .
I would like to see this issue discussed and , if possible , solved .
3.5 Library Versions
--------------------
I am completely unconvinced by the need to embed library versions in import specifications .
I might support a means to label libraries with versions and to make that information available to importing programs or libraries at run-time ( e.g. , so they can abort if version X.Y of a certain library is imported ) .
However , in general I believe that matching library versions should be solved outside of the language .
4 Other Issues ==============
In this section I describe two issues which in themselves are not reasons to reject the candidate R6RS , but which I find very uncomfortable .
4.1 No Characters Beyond Unicode --------------------------------
Tom Lord [ 5 ] and John Cowan [ 6 ] have suggested that implementations be allowed to support characters beyond Unicode .
I support this suggestion .
4.2 Inappropriate Syntax ------------------------
I am uncomfortable with the implementation of file - options , buffer - mode , etc. , as syntax rather than procedure . [ 1 ]

' Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary . '
This is the first sentence in the introduction to RnRS for a reason .
It is the heart of what Scheme is - a powerful general purpose programming language expressed with just a few primitives .
As with any other good idea , it can be taken to an absurd extreme , and there 's more than a little room for leeway in its interpretation , but the R6RS draft is so far removed from the idea that it destroys the whole spirit of the language .
To be clear , I do n't mind the large report , and am in fact happy that a large selection of standard libraries was included .
What I object to is the fact that these libraries are not built on simple primitives , but many of them are in fact incompatible extensions to the language , and features which imply core semantic changes .
The R6RS draft has piled feature on top of feature with no attempt to minimize .
There are many minor points to the draft I dislike that I wo n't bother to mention - below I list only those issues which I consider the most egregious .
* Identifier syntax .
Anything done with identifier syntax can be done with normal syntax , replacing X and ( SET ! X Y ) with ( X ) and ( X Y ) or similar .
Thus this is purely syntactic sugar .
It 's an interesting idea , with the intent of making pseudo - variables , but at the same time complicates the semantics of the language .
Identifiers may no longer be simple variable references , making code potentially more difficult to read .
Moreover , it weakens every macro in the entire language by removing knowledge about the language the macros are expanding .
For example , the simplest implementation of the LET - OPTIONALS * macro used in many SRFI implementations I 'm aware of is the following : ( define - syntax let - optionals * ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( _ opt-ls ( ) body ... ) ( let ( ) body ... ) ) (( _ ( expr ... ) vars body ... ) ( let ( ( tmp ( expr ... ) ) ) ( let - optionals * tmp vars body ... ) ) ) ( ( _ tmp ( ( var default ) . rest ) body ... ) ( let ( ( var ( if ( pair ? tmp ) ( car tmp ) default ) ) ( tmp2 ( if ( pair ? tmp ) ( cdr tmp ) '( ) ) ) ) ( let - optionals * tmp2 rest body ... ) ) ) ))
This takes advantage of the fact that only parenthetical expressions need to be bound to temporary variables .
With identifier syntax , this is no longer true , and the above macro cannot even be written without helper macros or artificial pattern literals .
This is a complication and inconvenience , but there are workarounds .
There are other macros , however , such as the FAST - MATH macro at http://synthcode.com/scheme/fast-math.scm which are no longer even feasible .
The introduction of identifier syntax makes it impossible to write this kind of macro .
Identifier syntax is a cute gimmick but is seldom used , and no one is clamoring for it to write portable code .
For the weaknesses it introduces , to make it a required feature of every Scheme implementation is absurd .
* SYNTAX - CASE .
Almost everyone wants low - level and unhygienic macros , but SYNTAX - CASE is an unfortunate choice of systems .
Both syntactic closures and explicit renaming macros are older , and are simpler and more in the spirit of Scheme .
SYNTAX - CASE provides a bizarre mix of low - level macros with high - level pattern matching , but a true low - level system should be orthogonal to such matching , allowing the programmer his choice of pattern matching or other utilities .
* `_ ' and `...' patterns .
It 's unfortunate that R5RS macros can't match `...' as a literal in templates , but with the same restriction on `_ ' many existing macros will break , and moreover they have no easy workaround , requiring otherwise simple pattern matching macros to be rewritten in much longer and more convoluted low - level code .
Simply allowing these as pattern literals solves the issue without introducing any new issues or ambiguities , and this was even suggested on the list but was ignored .
* Versioning in modules .
This is just premature .
There are a lot of different possible ways of handle the problem of library versions , and they need more exploration before standardization .
Everything done with versions in the current draft could be added in a backwards compatible manner in future drafts .
* Unicode .
Scheme has been around for a long time , and has seen many encodings come and go - there 's no reason to bind it to a single encoding forever .
An appendix or separate document ( s ) specifying behavior for Unicode - based implementations could always be written for compatibility .
** Normalization forms .
STRING - NORMALIZE-NFD and the other three normalization procedures handle normalization at the wrong level .
It 's inherently an encoding issue , and is best treated as such .
Providing this functionality at the string level forbids the implementation strategy of keeping all strings in the same normalization form - a very appealing strategy on many levels .
** O( 1 ) string access .
This suggests all Schemes to use UCS - 4 character vectors for their string representation , discouraging the use of alternate representations such as UTF - 8 and ropes or trees .
** Character - level case mappings .
Case in Unicode is a string - level concept - providing case utilities at the character level encourages programmers to write broken algorithms .
* I/O . The I/ O system was totally rewritten for no reason , and all aspects of it controlled with gratuitous syntactic forms - second class forms which discourage high - level procedures .
* Enumerations .
There 's simply no reason for this , since Scheme has traditionally used symbols for the same purpose .
The one place where enumerations are truly required would be in an FFI , but the R6RS draft provides no FFI , and the enumerations provided would be insufficient for any FFI since they do n't even let you override the integer values of individual symbols .
* Exceptions .
The exception system is far too large and over - specified .
Exceptional situations should be treated as such , and implementations should be free to experiment with extensions in these areas .
For these and other reasons I feel I have no choice but to vote against ratification of the current R6RS draft .
The extent of the change is so great I feel the draft can only be considered a new Lisp dialect - the name ` Scheme ' does not suit it .
IMPORT LEVELS :
The draft does not specify how to write portable libraries that define or use macros with literals .
In particular , the draft does not say whether uses of literals such as DEFINE , ELSE , ellipses , and so on ( in other words , the arguments of free - identifier= ? - when the comparison succeeds ) count as references for level checking .
Thus , users will be forced to resort to cargo - cult programming in the hope that their code will be portable .
RECORDS : I think the constructor - related parts of the syntactic record layer and of the procedural layer are bewilderingly complex .
The custom constructor design is a good example of premature generalization and piling feature upon feature , and since their current API adversely affects other aspects , such as modularity , of the design , as discussed on the list by Will Clinger and myself , I believe it would be better to drop custom constructors completely unless a simpler and better design can be agreed on .
Such a design may be better left for a future SRFI .
Only a minority of record applications use custom constructors , and these can always be expressed in terms of standard constructors ( we have libraries for hiding unexposed names from the client if necessary ) .
By the way , I do not think inheritance makes custom constructors necessary in the base API , since users can easily roll the current custom constructor functionality themselves without , I believe , loss of performance or modularity .
LIBRARY VERSIONING : I do not think that versioning information should be in source code .
Also , the version reference syntax is very complex and rather ugly .
ENUMERATIONS : I cannot reconcile the presence of this library with the philosophy of prior Scheme reports or with the r6rs mandate .
It seems an example of premature generalization and piling feature upon feature .
I would prefer that it be dropped completely and left for a future SRFI if enough people feel the need for it .
SET !:
There is no way of importing set ! for a single level .
This limits the languages that a library designer can create .
I would suggest the addition of a library ( rnrs mutation ) that exports only set ! for level 0 .
The ( rnrs base ) library can still export set ! for levels 0 and 1 if desired .
LIBRARY INSTANTIATION :
The draft links library instantiation and visitation not to import clauses , but instead to the presence of identifier references in the client , and provides no guarantee of instantiation otherwise .
Again , I worry that this may force users to resort to cargo - cult - like programming ( such as inserting otherwise unnecessary variable or macro references in client code whose only purpose is to force an instantiation or visitation ) in an attempt to ensure portability .
I would urge instantiation and visitation to be guaranteed at least for the declared import phases ( this should be compatible with both explicit and implicit phasing models ) .
CONDITIONS : Although the conditions API has seen improvement , I worry that the division into simple and compound conditions , along with the infrastructure required to manipulate these , is overly complex and may be awkward to use in practice .
I would love to see a simpler design - perhaps something as simple as an alist - like object may work quite well and allow the current plethora of types to be replaced by properties instead .
=======
I do not consider the following objections dealbreakers , but I would like to list them for the record : SYNTAX - CASE :
The description of the mark - antimark algorithm significantly lengthens and increases the complexity of this chapter .
It is hard for me to understand despite being an implementor ( granted , I use a different algorithm ) .
The draft could be simplified by cutting this operational description , especially since this is not the only algorithm , or even ( to me ) the simplest algorithm for implementing hygiene .
A more declarative description in the spirit of r5rs , as already given in the introductory paragraphs of the draft section on hygiene ( perhaps with some small refinements and examples ) , already says it all and could make this chapter considerably cleaner and shorter .
COMPOSITE LIBRARY : I do not think ( rnrs ) should export define - syntax and let [rec ] - syntax for level 1 , or syntax - rules for level 0 .
In the context of the ( rnrs ) import , there is nothing one can do with these bindings at those levels .
Deliberating on the latest R5.97RS draft I find much that is agreeable about it , and it would be tempting to vote for its ratification .
Indeed if but the programming language described therein would be named anything else than Scheme , it might seem the promising start of a practical and useful modern Lisp dialect .
Yet as the R5.97RS main and library reports still read today , the resulting language is most definitely not Scheme .
My primary issue with the draft is that it betrays the spirit of its very own opening paragraph : ' Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary . '
I should very much hope that paragraph will never be removed in future RnRS reports !
Evaluating the rest of the main and library report against that principle , I think it stands out that the draft has simply suffered considerable feature creep and is vastly overspecified and overcomplex .
In a word , it is too ambitious ( or presumptuous , depending on your point of view ) .
I 'm convinced the draft as it stands would derail Scheme , in the sense of putting the language on a course that it is unlikely could be easily corrected through later RnRS iterations .
Thus I must at this time , with apologies to the editors , vote against ratification and hope that there will be enough dissenting voices to reopen the editorial process .
If the vote concerned only the main report in something not too far from its present form , ratification would not be an unfeasible prospect ; and this despite the report having almost doubled in size .
I do share others ' misgivings on issues such as requiring the full numeric tower and chaining Scheme at the hip to Unicode ; still , the main report all in all appears decent , and a standardized library definition facility , even if the current proposal seems rather overcomplex , would be a most important practical benefit provided by core R6RS .
However , the proposed standard library report is simply unacceptable .
Not only does it gratuitously eschew important and widely - used existing SRFIs ( such as the SRFI - 1 list library , and SRFI - 69 hash tables ) in favor of its equivalent incompatible functionality , but one must ask why features such as , say , byte vectors , enumerations and hash tables should even be included in the RnRS reports in the first place ?
The desire for a standard library is widespread , both for reasons of portability and practicability , but I think it is clear that when it comes to library functionality , the SRFI process has proven itself and works better than the committee process being voted on here .
Attempting to evolve a standard library through the rightly slow - moving RnRS process seems to me shortsighted and counterproductive in the long run .
Thus , I consider the standard library report largely superfluous and indeed harmful .
Instead of attempting to set in stone a controversially large standard library with the RnRS process , I believe the R6RS committee should strictly confine itself to the core language only , and fully embrace the SRFI process for the standardization and dissemination of all non-essential library features .
There are many flawed aspects of R5.97RS , which time does not permit me to cover .
I will describe three .
Macros
In the R5.97RS introduction : Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions , with no restrictions on how they are composed , suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today .
This was true of R3RS and R4RS , but not for R5RS and R5.97RS .
In R3RS and R4RS there were a small number of rules for forming expressions : DEFINE , QUOTE , LAMBDA , IF , SET ! , BEGIN , COND , AND , OR , CASE , LET , LET * , LETREC , DO , DELAY , QUASIQUOTE , and combinations .
I have 70,000 lines of mathematical , scientific , engineering , database , and scripting software written in ( R4RS ) Scheme showing that this small number of rules is " flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today . "
One reason that this large multi-author corpus of ( free software )
Scheme code can be actively developed and maintained is because R4RS code is very readable .
In a R4RS compliant file , it is easy to see which lists are expressions which might be evaluated ; there are no new syntactic tokens which can be mistaken for identifiers .
The use of LAMBDA in arguments to procedures establishes binding scope , no matter what those procedures do .
The significance of this achievement by R4RS is not widely appreciated .
Procedure are sufficient to create nearly any new features .
Even new control features do not require new syntax .
EVAL , VALUES , CALL - WITH -VALUES , and DYNAMIC - WIND , added in R5RS , are all procedures .
In the R5RS introduction : More recently , Scheme became the first programming language to support hygienic macros , which permit the syntax of a block - structured language to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner .
Extending the syntax would be desirable if Scheme 's " small number of rules " were * not* sufficient " to form a practical and efficient programming language ... " .
But SLIB and other softwares show that R4RS is sufficient .
The effect of adding macros to Scheme has been the proliferation of mutually incomprehensible language dialects .
We have seen the growth of " convenience " macros like WHENNOT and UNLESS , use of macros as a substitute for compiler optimization , and use of macros to avoid using symbols as tokens .
None of these uses increases the expressive power of the language .
In a reusable software world , the use of incompatible dialects is detrimental ; it is only through documenting , publishing , and deliberating , say in a SRFI , that new forms should be adopted into that " very small number of rules for forming expressions " .
Arrays Computations have been organized into multidimensional arrays for over 200 years .
Applications for multi-dimensional arrays are widespread and continue to arise .
Computer graphics and imaging , whether vector or raster based , use arrays .
A general - purpose computer language without multidimensional arrays is an oxymoron .
Although multidimensional arrays are the subject of SRFI - 25 , SRFI - 47 , SRFI - 58 , and SRFI - 63 , and portably supported by SLIB , search of http://www.r6rs.org/r6rs-editors/ finds nothing to indicate that the editors ever considered their inclusion in R6RS .
Can R5.97R
Scheme be extended to support SRFI - 63 arrays ?
Libraries SRFI - 63 redefines EQUAL ? to work on arrays .
But in the R5.97RS module system , a SRFI - 63 library exporting EQUAL ? will conflict with the RNRS language export of the same name .
Thus any import of the array library ( and there are many in SLIB ) will require that EQUAL ?
be excluded from the import of RNRS .
Thus the R5.97RS library mechanism fails to be modular ; users must know and exclude from modules any exported redefinitions , whether or not they use those identifiers !
This is more than an inconvenience .
R5.97RS prevents the sort of language extensions which are a hallmark of LISPs .
Consider SLIB's COMMUTATIVE -RING
module , which captures and redefines * , + , - , / , and ZERO ? to work on expressions : ( require ' commutative - ring ) ( set ! * ruleset * ( combined - rulesets distribute * distribute / ) ) ( define a ' a ) ... ( define z 'z ) (* (+ a b ) (- a b ) ) == > (- ( ^ a 2 ) ( ^ b 2 ) ) ( require ' determinant ) ( determinant '# 2A ( ( a b c ) ( d e f ) ( g h i ) ) ) == > (- (+ (* a e i ) (* b f g ) ( * c d h ) ) (* a f h ) (* b d i ) ( * c e g ) )
In R5.97RS , the DETERMINANT module bindings for * , + , - , and / would be unaffected by the COMMUTATIVE - RING extension .
Even creating a new language binding to supplant RNRS is no help without modifying the source code of the DETERMINANT module .
The R5.97RS library system has significantly reduced the expressive power of Scheme ; it is no longer possible to extend built - in procedures to new types in a modular fashion .
Conclusion
The framework to extend R4RS and R5RS ( through redefinition ) made it possible to provide those features that Scheme lacked in a portable and modular fashion .
R5.97RS not only lacks the multidimensional arrays essential to my work , it has removed the means for remediation of its deficiencies .
- Requiring the full numeric tower works against using Scheme in smaller environments such as embedded systems .
- Procedures such as div0 - and - mod0 , exact - integer - sqrt simply do not belong in a base language .
In fact a lot of the numerical procedures belong in a library .
It is perfectly meaningful to say that if a specific library is implemented , it must meet the entire spec .
but * all * libraries must be optional in a base language and a base language implemener * does not* have to provide all libraries .
Even C does this !
Surely , one of the rationale for Scheme was minimalism ?
- R6RS is not good enough for commericial usage since it lacks a FFI to interface it with libraries implented in C / C++ ( such as system libraries , graphics etc ) .
And it specifies too much for an experimental language .
Neither fish nor fowl . - I would have preferred R6RS to be * smaller * than R5RS , where some of the required features get moved to optional .
When this process started , I expected to reluctantly vote for approval .
However the discussion has been very illuminating , and the arguments against ratification have been both cogent and convincing , while those in favour have , at least to my mind , been less so .
Here are the arguments that convinced me .
Some are due to an excellent post by Alex Shinn dated 29 - May - 2007 , while others are distilled from posts by David Rush and Jeffrey Mark Siskind .
First , there is the question of why we want or need an Official Scheme Standard , and what the goal of the " RnRS process " should be .
It seems to me that , broadly speaking , the draft R6RS has the goal of making Scheme be like C or perl : a workable programming language like other programming languages .
This seems reasonable on its face , but Scheme has survived for a long time by not being a programming language like others , but rather by being an oddball : minimally specified , usable for real - world programming only by using numerous implementation - specific features , but ideal for teaching and research .
Scheme is the defacto lingua - franca for programming language theory .
R6RS and its associated mindset flies directly in the face of Scheme 's historic strengths , and to my mind risks diluting them .
If this were to occur it would be a disaster .
In other words , it is not clear to me that the draft R6RS is moving Scheme in an appropriate direction .
Second , it is not clear to me that the draft R6RS even specifies the right things to make Scheme industrial strength .
This argument was made quite forcefully by people who actually do use Scheme in real - world settings .
Third , the draft R6RS contains many features that are highly complex to specify and that are quite un - lispy .
The enum stuff comes to mind .
Records .
The exception handling system .
Symbol macros .
Unicode enshrined .
Each is individually motivated , but all together we end up with a very large ball of mud .
The size of this ball directly impairs one of Scheme 's important features from an industrial perspective : its role as a small language suitable for automatic program transformation and other PLT sorts of techniques .
To sum up : I have come to the conclusion that ratification of the draft R6RS will not be healthy for the Scheme community .
This draft , and the process behind it , puts the mindset of the community at risk , and is moreover unlikely to achieve its intended effect of industrial acceptance .
For these reasons , I have been reluctantly dragged into a negative vote .
The following is not as polished as I 'd like it to be , sorry .
Most of my codes have the following features : 1 . Homogeneous numeric vectors .
2 . Various I / O features ( read / write pgm / ppm / ... files , open tcp sockets , .. 3 . Unsafe arithmetic / list operations /...
The standard does not explicitly help me in these areas .
I 'll comment a bit more .
Re : Unsafe arithmetic and other operations .
I understand that draft does not address these issues ; that is fine .
Re : Homogenous numeric vectors .
The suggestion is made in the rationale that bytevectors plus sealed and opaque types can lead to efficient implementations of homogeneous vector types .
To my mind , this assumes the existence of a " suitably smart compiler " , and I no longer believe in such a thing .
I appreciate Will Clinger 's attempts to explain how various features in the proposed draft ( including this one ) could be implemented efficiently , but I do n't think that these efficient implementation of specific features will be found in most R6RS systems .
I 've participated ( mainly as an observer ) in compiler development ( gcc and gambit ) , and there are a lot of considerations that people bring to the table ; a fancy implementation of a specific feature that is nearly trivial to implement as a primitive ( homogeneous numeric vectors ) is going to be hard to get to the top of a Scheme implementer 's priorities .
The parts of the proposal that I most object to are bytevectors and the I/O library .
As the draft explains , these two features are intertwined .
I think both of them are ad hoc , having a plethora of related procedures that still do not cover the facilities offered by other R5RS I/O extensions in existing Scheme systems .
The fact that bytevectors are , by their nature , type aliasing nightmares is too lightly ignored in the draft .
Making these the basic implementation strategy of homogenous vectors makes it harder for Scheme systems that compile to C for portability to implement homogeneous vectors efficiently , due to the C aliasing rules .
( The authors of the draft clearly had certain implementation strategies in mind when they inserted or deleted various features into the draft ; in this case I think their estimate of the affect of this feature was incorrect . )
And this situation does not lead to portable code .
( And , BTW , IEEE - 754 does * not* specify the bit patterns for single - and double - precision floating - point numbers in a way that this report seems to think can be exploited in bytevectors . )
I tried to go over some of my own codes to see if the changes in the I/ O system would allow me to do what I wanted to do inside R6RS , either ( what I would consider ) reasonably , or at all .
The answer generally was no .
I consider the proposed I / O system and bytevectors to be a solution to problems that are nowhere near as important to me as they appear to the editors of the draft ; at the same time the draft does n't offer solutions to the problems I find in my code .
I 'm stating this in a very personal way so as not to claim universality for my perspectives or needs , but I think my concerns are valid .
I consider the proposed bytevectors and I/O large parts of the draft that would be difficult or impossible to fix in R7RS , so I vote no .
Although my initial impression of the draft was mildly positive , after looking it over more thoroughly I am voting against ratification .
My vote is based on my overall impression of the draft , but here are some illustrative examples of particular things I do n't like about it :
Fist , the problem of two record systems that do n't quite work together .
This was raised by Will Clinger , most recently in his essay " Fixing the Syntactic Record Layer " < http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/R6RS/essay.txt>.
Second , the fact that you cannot simply take a record value and access one of its fields by name .
I explained my problem with that on the mailing list < http://lists.r6rs.org/pipermail/r6rs-discuss/2007-August/thread.html#3145>
< http://lists.r6rs.org/pipermail/r6rs-discuss/2007-August/thread.html#3146>.
None of the explanations given for this in the rationale , the mailing list , or the srfi discussions satisfy me .
( And the only direct reply seemed to misunderstand the example -- we want a container that requires certain behavior of the values it contains while not requiring that they be on an approved list or inherit from the same ancestor .
Importing the accessors of each type of value we wish to contain makes the container 's import list the approved list . )
Third , the condition system with its simple conditions and compound conditions .
After reading through this part of the specification and disliking it , I found a reasonable counterproposal on the mailing list < http://lists.r6rs.org/pipermail/r6rs-discuss/2007-February/thread.html#1458>.
It was rejected with a statement that it conflicted with other decisions of the editors and did not appear to be different in any other way .
( It is , however quite different .
It makes all condition types record types , eliminating the need for almost everything in section 7.2 , and it makes it much easier to handle an exception by supplementing the condition with more information and re-raising it . )
Those three are just illustrative examples .
I am casting my vote based on my overall impression of r5.97rs :
Too many things in the draft are designed primarily to work around limitations imposed by other things in the draft .
The explanation of the condition system in particular helped me crystallize what I had felt while reading the draft .
It was yet another explanation of the form " We must do X because we have decided to do Y and Z. "
Meanwhile , Y and Z are required by W , which is required by P and Q , which we need because we have X and Y .
The editors are happy to explain each feature by pointing to the features that require it ( or at least conflict with every alternative they are aware of ) but do n't seem to have considered the glaring possibility that all are bad and that this is why they are mutually forcing each other into a series of workarounds .
The introduction to the draft still begins with , " Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary . "
I feel I understand that principle much better now that I have seen r5.97rs itself violate it .
If you start by planning to add lots of features , add them in ways that introduce weaknesses and restrictions , then refuse to remove or replace any of your additions as a way of repairing the damage , you end up with a mess that piles workaround on top of workaround and calls them features .
There are several reasons why I am unable to vote in favor of this set of documents .
First , I am deeply disturbed by the size and scope of the proposed changes to R5RS .
While many of these changes are sensible , there are very many changes , and rather than getting to vote on each change separately , we 're forced into voting on all of them at once .
This is very like the way national deliberative bodies work , and is even more distasteful in this context .
A more incremental process would foster more thoughtful development , allow users and implementers to digest and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each feature before moving on to the next .
( I certainly do n't have time to fully understand all that is being proposed here . )
One interpretation of this process is that it 's driven by fear : the fear that the current set of authors have only a limited extent of control over the standards process , and are trying to make the most of it while they can .
I do n't think that 's exactly what 's happening here , but I do think there 's a certain amount of distrust in the future , based more than likely on the dismal experiences of the past .
Nonetheless
I think we should start from the assumption that small successes now will lead to more small successes in the future , and that over time those successes will accumulate to make something great .
We have to trust our ability to work together , and we have to trust that spreading control of the standards process more broadly through the community is best in the long run .
So , what I 'm advocating here is something more like the " bazaar " software development model : release early , release often , and be open to participation by the community .
The second problem I have is the fairly low priority given to backwards compatibility .
This is made all the more important by scope of the documents .
I understand that the standard answer to this is that implementations are expected to provide mechanisms for switching between modes -- but this does n't really address what to do with existing bodies of code .
It also makes it more difficult to update existing code to the new language , since there 's no incremental update path ; each program must be completely transformed all at once , which effectively means it will never happen .
Contrast this with ANSI C , for example , in which it 's possible to incrementally update programs from traditional to ANSI C , and have them continue to run when only partially updated .
This is a huge win that I 've taken advantage of in my own code .
The third problem I see is that two core features of the language have been designed as entirely new sub- languages : specifically , the module system and SYNTAX - CASE .
Not only are these new languages , but they are declarative languages , which makes them fundamentally different from the core language , which has always been imperative .
Worse , these sub- languages solve problems that could have been solved by application of the core language , meaning they lead to additional cognitive complexity while getting little in return .
The module system is basically a way to tell the linker how to construct programs from parts .
Rather than invent a new language to do this , it 's possible to build the linker such that the programmer can insert code to control aspects of the linking process .
Such code could do _more_ than the current module system does , and because of the added expressivity , it could do so more concisely in many cases .
For example , I sometimes use a trivial module system in which names starting with " % " are local , and all other names are exported .
This is a trivial program to write , and does n't depend on the details of the names , but it can't be said at all with the proposed module system .
SYNTAX - CASE has similar problems , although not as extreme : it implements a term - rewriting system , with limited programmability , to solve a problem for which there are significantly simpler solutions .
This sub-language introduces a new kind of variable that behaves differently from the variables we 're used to , and pushes pattern - matching and templating to the center of the macro- writing process .
Yet with this added complexity it is arguably no better than the syntactic closures or explicit renaming mechanisms proposed years ago , which have very little cognitive overhead .
I think it is pointless to ratify a Scheme standard that does n't hold true to the founding principles -- expressiveness and simplicity -- of Scheme .
The key benefit to me , portability derives from standardization ; but developers of significant compilers do not support this draft -- this fractures the community and reduces the likelihood of portability .
Another summarized it this way : this draft seems to nail down the ( more - or- less ) easy - to - nail down things , and reduces the scope of solutions to the difficult issues without making substantial progress on them .
Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary .
The R6RS draft strays far away from the simplicity that characterized earlier versions of the report .
As a result , the effort required to implement a standard - compliant Scheme becomes much larger than before .
This will discouraging future implementors , endangering the diversity that is one of Scheme 's present strengths ( there are Schemes running in almost any imaginable environment -- embedded , desktop , in a browser , on top of Java and Ocaml etc ) .
Furthermore , because of this complexity ( as well as because R6RS is controversial ) many existing implementations will choose not to support R6RS , thus splitting the Scheme community and codebase ( some authors will choose to write R6RS code that will not be directly usable by those running R5 RS - only implementations ) .
I believe that , given Scheme 's present maturity , the proper way to evolve and enhance the language is via SRFIs , which provide a more democratic and less biased process , and which minimize the destructive effect of poor design decisions .
Other reasons for which I do not believe the R6RS should be ratified are : identifier macros , which make the job of code - walking macros much more difficult ( especially as there is no way to programatically expand macros ) ; the syntax - case macro system ( even if relegated to the standard library ) ; the complex and over - specified exception system ; and immutable pairs , which may make optimization easier , but do not fit at all with the practice and spirit of Lisp .
It seems to me that , at 91 pages , the proposed Revised ^6 Report would make Scheme something bigger than it should be .
I think that this violates an important part of the spirit of Scheme , which is to keep the language small , so that learning and implementing it remains relatively easy .
Yet the proposed Report , as far as I can tell , fails to address some criticisms that are more than likely in our day and age , such as the absence of network connection capabilities .
If such features are to be omitted from the Report , why could not many other features be deemed " recommended yet optional " , and grouped in a common library , that does not have to be a de jure standard ?
Other languages appear to live quite successfully with de facto standard libraries that are separate from the language description .
One thing I definitely would not like is to have the R6RS be a widely - ignored standard , in the way that , many years after its publication , C99 has but very few implementations , none of them popular .
The shortest explanation for my dissatisfaction with the R6RS is that it appears to have gone fairly far off - track .
There are some things I like in it , and would like to vote ' maybe ' except for the core structural issues that I see .
I have always felt that the brevity of the RnRS spec was one of it 's stringest points .
Now , with R5.97 , the document has expanded to cover 4 interrelated specifications - which would not be bad in and of itself , but the documents seem heavily interdependent .
Make no mistake about it , I actually * wanted * the standard split into core and library components , but I was looking at something rather closer to the SML 2000 split .
The library machinery ; however , is quite nice and I would like to see it preserved .
In fact , it is the primary reason why I would like to vote maybe or even yes .
It specifies modularization in terms of build processes , which is exactly the right level of abstraction .
One minor error though seems to be the in the definition of top - level programs : it appears that only one import form is allowed for a program , which will certainly be violated in an interactive session .
Perhaps I have missed the text which allows the REPL to behave differently from a program - but I 'm not sure that such a behavior is actually desirable , anyway .
An example of where the library / core breakdown is inadequately addressed is the persistence of DYNAMIC - WIND .
It has been clearly shown that DYNAMIC - WIND ( and R5RS CALL / CC ) is implementable in terms of R4RS CALL / CC , but that the reverse is not true .
Given the renaming facilities available in the library system , it would seem * really * obvious that R4RS CALL / CC should be in the core and R5RS ' DYNAMIC - WIND and CALL / CC should be a separate library .
I am quite ambivalent on the topic of exceptions and conditions .
I have found that the under - specification of R5RS in this area has actually led me to write better and more comprehensive error handling code .
However ; I have often wished for a better standardization of error - handling procedures across implementations .
The gripping hand holds that the exception and condition - handling behavior is insufficiently worked out .
First of all , this functionality * should * be part of the core specification - as is shown by the inclusion of a section on exceptions in the formal semantics .
Secondly , the interaction of exceptions and continuations is not clear .
It is clear that someone has a notion of how it should all interact , but that does not come out in the document .
This last issue is a definite showstopper and points out something that I would very much like to see in the Scheme specification : a solid model for asynchronous events .
That alone would be justification enough for R6RS , but it is sadly lacking .
A sound asynchronous semantics would enable more things than I can even begin to list at this point .
I also feel that the approach to Unicode and non-ascii character sets to also be immature .
There are two areas of concern here : program text and I/O .
In Scheme the line between these two blurs because of the traditional representations of programs as s-expressions .
After seeinng the example of Ruby , I am not convinced ( in fact I have begun to be unconvinced as Ruby had its origins in a non-english environment ) of the value of supporting unicode for program text .
That said , the capability of sexp read makes it hard to avoid .
I will only say that the addition of Unicode escapes is ugly to say the least .
I am actually moderately pleased with what I see in the I/O system changes .
I feel there is a fairly sound basis for extensions to include non-blocking I/O and ( dare I say it ) interrupt - driven I/O.
Multiple - return values * still * has not been fixed .
The most straightforward solution is simply to make all continuations multi-valued - or rather that apply a single - argument continuation to multiple values results in the coercion of the actual arguments to some list form .
I hate to appeal to Ruby for examples of The Right Thing , but this is a Ruby practice which does seem to work well in practice * and * it would alleviate a major asymmetry in Scheme continuation semantics .
It would actually be even better to eliminate multi-valued continuations entirely , but that would be at the cost of breaking existing code ( SRFI code even ) .
Personally I have shunned call - with - values and use explicit CPS whenever I have multiple values to return .
There are a number of other issues about which I have heard rumblings from the more editorially involved and / or experienced implementors which leave me very worried .
While I have not been able to fully evaluate their claims , I will state that I am in agreement with any concerns which reduce the ability of compilers to optimize my code .
I am also quite concerned that there are gotchas waiting for prospective implementors ( I * do* intend to become one :) - the R5RS spec was much clearer in that respect .
A petty irritant for me is the official sanction of square brackets .
Given the extensive training the my optical neural networks have received , I find the use of square brackets ugly and unhelpful in reading code .
They create a very discordant visual rhythm and should be summarily outlawed .
Square brackets are a gross violation of the LISP Party Ethic and offending implementors shall be required to submit thorough self - criticism of their motivations and then will be summarily shot .
I really mean this .
Finally I will say that it is nice to have a 3 - state vote , although perhaps a continuous rating system would have been even better yet .
I am not happy enough with the R^( 5.97 ) RS to vote ' yes ' , or even ' maybe ' , but I am not far from it .
I suppose the fault is mine for not engaging the process at an earlier date .
Either way , my vote for the current draft is : NO .
R6RS completely breaks with Scheme 's traditional values of simplicity , and throws in gratuitous assortments of needless features , while lacking coherency and generally appearing to be thrown together in haste .
R6RS is controversial even among the R6RS editors , and tries to standardize insuffienct compromise solutions for things that are better left unspecified .
R6RS is a misguided attempt to make Scheme more suitable for the mainstream , but effectively does the very opposite by removing the assets that always distinguished Scheme from other dialects : smallness and simplicity .
I feel not represented by the people that call themselves ' R6RS editors ' .
This s-expr text format is idiotic .
What the heck do you mean with ' an explanation is mandatory ' ?
Need a refresher in democracy , folks ?
I think an update to R5RS is needed , particularly to add a module system .
Unfortunately , the current proposal does n't simply add what is missing to R5RS : it tries to do much more .
However we put it , the base library is a fundamental part of the proposal .
But its design ignores a significant part of the SRFI process , for example by being incompatible with SRFI - 1 .
It is also big and gratuitously complicated .
The records , I/O and exceptions are good examples of the unneeded complexity .
I 'm against making Scheme a bloated and complicated language .
I think the current proposal does n't respect the philosophy of Scheme .
For me the single most important aspect of R6RS is what I will refer to as specifying a suitable system for " standardized portability " : portable programming for library and application developers who want to move more easily beyond Scheme 's solid established niches , while not endangering the virtues of the language that support both these niches and what we are trying to accomplish beyond them .
The core language is the crown jewel of Scheme , and most of us would say the crown jewel of programming languages .
In its current minimalist form , it is critical to Ivan Raikov 's " holy grail of high - performance scientific computing " , and the work of many others .
But the failure of our community " to build a large collection of shared libraries " ( Ryan Rhodes Newton ) must be addressed .
Or as Arthur A. Gleckler put it : I want to help make sure that R6RS maintains the right balance between the diamond - like jewel Scheme has always been and the practical everyday programming language that we have always wanted Scheme to be .
The proposal took the tried and true approach of making a core language definition , a library mechanism , and a set of standard required libraries , and I approve of this .
It is the only approach I can see that satisfies the needs of all the stakeholders .
If done right , this approach does not have to compromise Scheme 's current strengths --- in fact , this can profitably be used to reduce the size of the core , while at the same time a few necessary things are added to it , like exceptions .
While I appreciate the concerns of those who want to keep Scheme minimalist , to the point that I am voting against ratification first and foremost because this proposal does not satisfy them , I fail to see how any considerations beyond hooks in the core for library efficiency provide a compelling reason to not standardize it beyond the core , for those who want to get work done beyond the domains a minimalist core excels in .
The devil is in details , and that is where this proposal most grievously fails , in the particulars of drawing the lines between the core and its various libraries at various levels .
I therefore I pose this question : if the proposal is sufficiently bad that it endangers what we 've got in an effort to get something more , why accept it ?
It is rather common in this sort of effort to lose what one has and thus never gain what is attempted .
It is better to reach * correctly * for something new , or as David Rush in comp.lang.scheme put it " In RnRS , the middle ' R ' means ' Report ' and initially reflected the common and agreed practices in the Scheme community - this is a * retrospective * term and could never reflect the bleeding edge of language innovation . "
There is much good in this proposal ; a lack of time and relevance to the voting process prompts me to focus on only two specific issues related to the all - important library mechanism that I caught on my first reading of it , and that I found had prompted formal comments :
1 . The reason for ABSOLUTELY prohibiting linking to multiple versions of the same library per formal comment # 130 is very weak .
Scheme and the LISP family in general are incisive , powerful languages that give their users great power that can be easily misused .
They are not " restraint " languages ( e.g. Java ) , and the " potential for confusion " here seems to be balanced by the information and control the library system gives the user .
I am certain that situations as outlined in the comment will occur and harm the efforts of developers , if a sufficiently rich set of library implementations following the standard 's mechanism are developed --- which is the motivation of creating such a library mechanism in the first place .
Those of us who have plenty of scars from " DLLHell " are POWERFULLY motivated to avoid anything like it , but this goes too far , too against the grain .
This single problem 's damage to the raison d'etre of libraries and R6RS itself is a show stopper .
2 . I feel that Scheme should accommodate the desires of library writers to intermix definitions and expressions [ insert usual platitudes about needless restrictions --- and how Scheme is perhaps more than anything else a system for communicating to other programmers ... ] .
I found the response to formal comment # 212 to be singularly unimpressive : that this " might be more useful , but there is no a priori reason to think so " is in frank contrast to the code survey made to reply to formal comment # 117 .
The crowning touch of the response 's justification by how it might confuse a Java programmer learning Scheme was for me the final nail in the coffin of R5.97RS .
What I 'd like to see happen if the proposal is not ratified and the community tries again for a R6RS :
It should be * in the direction * of previous revised reports in requiring unanimous consent * for the core * ( which includes the library mechanism , but precious few libraries ) .
Therefore the process in the future must continue to require super - majorities for core ratification and maybe even greater ones than the current 60 %--- and that helps to properly draw the line between it and the required standard libraries .
Library ratification does not need to be as strict : as long as they are " acceptable " and have nothing dreadfully wrong with them , it is better to have usable standards than no standards at all , and in theory the SFRI process has allowed the community to discover what works in practice and it worth standardizing .
Therefore if this proposed version of R6RS is not ratified ( and even if it is ) , I recommend serious consideration of separating the standardization of the core and standard libraries .
They 're different beasts for sometimes different audiences .
As for what that next R6RS should be : it should define as absolutely minimal a core as is reasonable , keeping all the good things in R5.nnRS , especially exceptions ( I think ) and a requirement to implement the full numeric tower .
Raising the bar for a minimally compliant implementation is worth it for these features --- but maybe not Unicode per se , so that the embedded community is not overly taxed by that requirement .
The above core will include a library mechanism like the proposed one with the show stopper problems fixed .
Then a standard library set * with a reference implementation written in pure Scheme using only the core language * ( and other required standard libraries ) .
Part of the required standard core will be hooks required by the above standard libraries needed for minimal efficiency .
Implementors wishing compliance with the full standard need only implement the core and ship the reference libraries with it .
They and their users can write more efficient implementations of the standard libraries that take advantage of their lower level extensions and special capabilities as they see fit .
The core should be satisfactory to the " minimalists " as long as it is not soiled by the additions and is not too " big " for them .
The total should be a satisfactory base for those who want do things that would move well beyond what the core supplies .
( The above is mostly from a discussion in comp.lang.scheme . )
In the longer term , certain things should be added to the core , e.g .
I think that continuations should be extended to full first class status , but it should become pretty stable pretty soon .
* Ideally * there should be no major * changes * ( e.g. case significance ) to the core after not many more RnRSs .
What I 'll do if the proposal is ratified : I will decide that we no longer live in an civilized age ( http://xkcd.com/297/ ) , for official " Scheme " will have lost too much of the elegance and correctness that has up to now defined it ( I did n't realize it at the time , but so did our parent community when they standardized on Common Lisp , a harsh object lesson in language stagnafication we would do well to remember ) .
There are many signs that ratification of this proposed standard will shatter the Scheme community .
For many language implementors , the position of the standard is akin to that of Glendower in Shakespeare 's King Henry the IV : I can call spirits from the vasty deep .
Because as Hotspur replied :
Why , so can I , or so can any man ;
But will they come when you do call for them ?
This standard if ratified cannot perforce move the entire community to it .
Enough of the wrong things in the proposal can never be undone , and it is very unlikely the splintering of the community that this proposal will cause if ratified will ever be undone , precisely because these wrong things cannot be undone .
The lead developer of my favorite Scheme implementation will not vote in favor of this proposed standard , and I would not be at all surprised if he and others fork off their own standard ... call it " Uncommon Scheme " .
And I think there will be more than enough people going in this direction to make a community with critical mass ,
That would be an truly unfortunate development , but while my most important personal interests are best served by a widespread acceptance of standardized portability , I cannot support it if it destroys that which makes Scheme so attractive in the first place , including the core upon which my other interests depend .
- Harold
I find that Scheme R5RS has become a convenient tool for research and education because it is small and elegant .
Its orthogonal feature set invites experimentation with the language .
Because of its small size , the programmer has to learn only a few fundamental principles in order to master it .
Consequently , there is a proliferation of competing R5RS implementations , which puts Scheme in a unique position , as no other current programming language can claim it has fostered such a diverse software ecosystem .
I believe that the R6RS proposal is moving Scheme in a fundamentally wrong direction .
It is my opinion that the Scheme community will benefit far more by rejecting the R6RS proposal and continuing the experimentation and innovation fostered by R5RS , than it would benefit from any potential interoperability gained by a new and far - reaching standard .
I believe that a high - level language based on lambda calculus must permit precise formal algorithmic specifications of software systems that are invariant on all possible hardware platforms , operating systems , and that are independent of data formats , protocols and standards .
Historically , Scheme has fulfilled such a role , and it is my opinion that any features that specify implementation details , as opposed to formal semantics and abstract implementation requirements , do not belong in the core language .
The SRFI process has evolved to be the universally accepted standardization process for Scheme libraries , and R6RS must not attempt to subvert it .
Each library must undergo its own standardization process .
If one wants a standardized Unicode Library for Scheme , then the proper way is to develop an SRFI for a Scheme Unicode library and convince the implementors and users of existing Scheme systems to adopt that SRFI .
However , the R6RS proposal demands a large set of extra libraries that are not universally adopted by existing implementations .
It does not include widely used and implemented SRFIs , such as SRFI - 1 , yet it features SRFIs that impose very particular restrictions in fixnum representations , it relies heavily on Unicode , which may evolve and change as a standard , it imposes an imperative hashtable API , where many Scheme implementations feature purely functional dictionary structures ,
If the core language is sufficiently minimal and well - thought - out , and if the libraries are sufficiently high - level and general , the issues of organization and interoperability can be left to the implementations .
A good language standard should support interoperability , not impose it .
Following is a list of R6RS proposal features that I consider unnecessary and complicating the language : 1 ) Unicode
It is perhaps better to remove those features of R5RS that prohibit Unicode implementation ( such as char - > integer and integer -> char ) , and relying on extended SRFI - 13 and SRFI - 14 for Unicode support .
If Unicode support is relegated to a library , the character and string representations will not be rigidly coupled to the language specification , and core Scheme will remain implementable on platforms without Unicode support .
2 ) Byte-vectors
The core language must only include abstract vector type .
Having particular types of vector representations is precisely the domain of SRFIs .
The R6RS proposal byte vector syntax is not widely agreed upon , and it requires two sets of vector procedures in the core language .
3 ) Lists SRFI - 1 is a well - thought API , which is widely implemented and used in the Scheme community .
Yet the R6RS proposal uses incompatible names to several SRFI - 1 procedures .
Although R6RS claims to emphasize the role of the community , it seems that it is ignoring a previous community effort , and puts future SRFI work in a questionable position .
4 ) Dictionaries & hash tables
The core specification must not mandate any particular standard for dictionary structures , as the existing implementations vary widely in APIs .
A side effect free association list structure may be permitted , but anything more sophisticated must be relegated to a library .
5 ) Exceptions
The R5RS report used the phrase " an error is signaled " to indicate that implementations must detect and report an error , without going into specifics .
In contrast , the R6RS proposal requires the signaling of exceptions , and it goes further to propose a complex and very specific hierarchy of exceptions .
Once again , common practices in the Scheme community are ignore , and instead of relying on the SRFI process , exceptions are mandated in the core language .
6 ) Modules
The enforced phase separation in the module system described in the R6RS proposal overspecifies the module system and disallows different implementation strategies , thus prohibiting the Scheme community from experimenting and innovating .
In addition , the module system becomes an obstacle to the use of Scheme as a teaching language , because beginners now must deal with it long before it can be explained to them why .
Syntactically , library descriptions need to be enclosed in an additional layer of parentheses , as opposed to a single definition at the top of the file .
The versioning system is complex and not obviously necessary , or tried in practice .
Again , matters like these must be relegated to the SRFI process .
7 ) I/O All but fundamental I/O primitives should be put in a library .
As with vectors , non-abstract operations do not belong in the core language .
8 ) R5RS compatibility
The identifier macros in the R6RS proposal break R5RS compatibility by eliminating a specific invariant on which R5RS programs and macros can rely , namely that a reference to an identifier has no side effects .
With identifier macros as proposed for the R6RS , an identifier may not actually be a variable reference , which can be confusing both for programmers and for code analysis algorithms -- again obstructing experimentation with compilers and language semantics .
In the few cases where identifier macros are useful , it is again better to relegate them to a library .
The proposed R6 draft materials are almost four times as long as the R5 report :
That 's scary in its own right , the more so because the Scheme community relies in considerable part on the efforts of individual developers , or small teams of developers , who have to implement these reports -- or who would presumably like to do so if it did not take forever .
I think the Scheme community would be better served by a much smaller language , whose features included the minimum necessary so that the language could easily be extended by loading Scheme source code itself ( and perhaps compiling it ) .
In that case , implementers could concentrate on getting a small feature set correct and fast , feature - developers could work on whatever enhancements they liked , and users could use such enhancements as they chose .
Perhaps the community would eventually settle on a standard group of libraries for common use ( though not everyone would have to use them ) ; but such a development might take a while .
The current thrust of Scheme development makes me worry that the language will go the way of C++ , which seems to have given rise to a large variety of mutually nearly incomprehensible C++ dialects and programming styles , and to a great deal of confusion about what the various features are supposed to do : I do n't know anyone who claims to understand the entire C++ language , and I _do_ know at least one product - development team at a large computer company that will remain nameless here , who are forbidden to use certain features of C++ because they are allegedly so ill - defined that they behave substantially differently in different widely - used implementations .
I do n't want to see Scheme go that way , so I am voting against the R5.97 draft .

I have explained some of my sentiment in the following post to comp.lang .
scheme on 6 August 2007 : >
Guys come on it is not as though Schemers are a bunch of stodgy old > uptight conservative worry warts who are n't willing to experiment , is > it ? >
Scheme was an experiment , and the results were pretty good .

How many people get things perfect on the first try ? :)
It is precisely for this reason that some of us argue against standardization efforts such as R5.97RS and R6RS .
We want to experiment and innovate .
And the purpose of standardization is the exact opposite : to prevent experimentation and innovation .
The objective of standardization * is* to get it right on the first try , to allow long term stability and interoperability , when the benefits of such outweigh the benefits of innovation .
It is my opinion that the Scheme community will benefit far more from experimentation and innovation by rejecting R5.97RS / R6RS that it would from any potential for interoperability that it would afford .
We are not an electric power utility .
Nor are we C .
I think most of the proponents of R5.97RS / R6RS confuse the desire for features in the implementation that they use with desire for standardization .
R5.97RS should not be ratified as R6RS .
That would be disasterous for the community .
But that should not prevent anybody from experimenting with any or all of the features from R5.97RS in their favorite implementation .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have explained some more of my sentiment in the following post that I have prepared for comp.lang .
scheme but have not yet sent :
There are fundamental flaws in your argument .
I suspect that these flaws are what motivate many of those who advocate adoption of R6RS .
1 . To the best of my knowledge there is only one vendor of Scheme implementations : Chez .
What I mean by vendor is a person or organization that is paid by customers to maintain and develop the core of the implementation .
2 . To the best of my knowledge , there is only one community - supported Scheme implementation : Guile .
What I mean by community supported is that there is a sustainable community distinct from the original implementor that actively maintains and develops the core of the implementation .
The vast majority of Scheme implementations are part time labors of love of a single person or a small group that includes current and former graduate students of a single person .
While most such implementations are open source , none has attracted an exogenous developer community .
Many / most of such efforts are motivated by the fact that such implementations are part of the implementor 's research program .
For them , innovation is the driving force .
Satisfying a customer base is not .
Almost all of us in the Scheme community would love for Scheme to catch on in the mainstream .
We would love for there to be many profitable vendors selling high - quality Scheme implementations .
We would love for there to be a vibrant open - source community that actively maintains and develops many high - quality Scheme implementations .
And we would love for there to be a large customer base of real - world Scheme users that would create a demand for the above .
Some people believe that the only factor that prevents this from happening is standardization ( of a big language ) .
Thus they advocate adoption of R6RS .
I think that there is a huge body of compelling historical evidence that this belief is false .
There are at least three prior efforts to standardize Lisp : Common Lisp , IS Lisp , and EuLisp .
All adopted standards that were essentially supersets of the functionality of R6RS .
At one time , there were numerous profitable commercial vendors of Common Lisp implementations : Symbolics , LMI , TI , Gold Hill , Chestnut Hill , Lucid , Harlequin , Franz , Xerox , MCL , ExperCommon Lisp , Star Sapphire , IBCL , ... just to name a few .
( There were others that I can't remember at the moment . )
And there were many noncommercial implementations actively maintained and developed either by individuals or by well funded research efforts : KCL , AKCL , GCL , CMULISP , CLISP , ... just to name a few .
( Again , there were many others that I can't remember at the moment . )
And there were many large mainstream companies that developed products that relied on these implementations .
That marketplace demand fueled the supply .
But that marketplace has essentially disappeared .
Today there is only one commercial vendor : Franz .
And only one active community - supported development effort : CMULISP .
I find it untenable to believe that standardization of R6RS with all of its `real world ' features will catalyze growth of a Scheme marketplace .
What does R6RS provide that the real - world needs that is not provided by Common Lisp ?
( No , as much as I like call / cc and a single namespace , they do not fit the bill . )
Scheme occupies a unique niche .
A research niche and an educational niche .
It is not a language .
Not R6RS , not R5RS , not R4RS .
It is an idea .
Or a collection of ideas .
It is a framework .
It is a way of thinking .
It is a mindset .
All of this is embodied in an ever growing family of languages or dialects , not a single language .
It is a virus .
It is the ultimate programming - language virus .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A spectacular Brazilian blue parrot , the Lear ’s Macaw , has come back from the brink of extinction with more than 750 birds in the wild counted in a recent survey , wildlife conservationists said on Wednesday .
That is more than 10 times the number reported in the wild in the late 1980s , according to the American Bird Conservancy , which attributed the creature ’s comeback to protection of its natural habitat in the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil .
The macaw has brilliant blue feathers with yellow patches around its beak and eyes .
It nests on sandstone cliffs and feeds primarily on licuri palm nuts , the conservancy said in a statement .
Conservationists counted the number of macaws in June as the birds flew from the canyons where they roost to the feeding grounds .
They found 751 Lear ’s Macaws .
The global population of this species was just 70 birds in 1987 ; in 2003 it was 455 , and until the June count , the estimated population was 600 .
The species is currently threatened by hunting and the illegal pet trade , the conservation group said .
Easy Restful Rails Screencast 2008 January 25 , 20:26 h
I ’ve been wanting to explore the Restful Rails concepts in a screencast .
First and foremost , I highly recommend Geoffrey Grosenbach ’s Peepcode screencast as one of the most comprehensive and easy to understand out there .
My screencast is not nearly at the same level of quality or depth .
But on the other hand I did n’t want to reinvent the wheel .
This is my second try to make a useful screencast .
I think my last one The First Rails 2.0 Screencast was reasonably good but far from good enough .
I thank everybody that has seen it and helped making it one of the most successful pieces I ’ve ever made .
Update 28/01 : Seems like myself and James Golick were in sync here :-)
We both did screencasts at the same time .
He just recorded one for his other great plugin “ attribute_fu ” and I did it for “ resource_controller ” .
He posted both at his blog .
Check it out .
Update 2013 : This video is very obsolete .
It has been superceded by Inherited Resources later , but most programmers prefer to not go so deep in metaprogramming “ magic ” and keep the controllers less implicit for maintenance purposes .
Explanation
So , the idea came when I saw James Golick ’s excelent resource_controller plugin .
It does what I always thought should be part of Rails itself : it made Restful Controller as easy to use and understand as ActiveRecord originally does for Models and the database .
This screencast is a quick rendition to this plugin and how to use to leverage the power of Restful controller in your applications .
This is one of those great ideas that – who knows – could find its place in the Rails Core one day , the same way Sexy Migrations did .
The concept is that now that we treat a controller ’s action in a standardized way ( through the abstraction of HTTP verbs ) it could perfectly be refactored away from the day - to - day development .
So , instead of scaffold creating a bunch of repeated code in every controller , why not have a bare - bone controller , totally empty , to start with ?
Another clever idea was to create dynamic helpers for named routes in the views .
That way you can move your views around , and even reuse them in different sections without ever copying & pasting several different named routes between them .
This is particularly useful for polymorphic controllers and namespaced routes as I show in this video .
At the very end of the video I do a quick summary of what Restful Rails provides you in terms of routes organization , that could be helpful to some .
Hope you enjoy it !
Disclaimer : this video is long , around 50 min long .
I first recorded it , live , in english and I tried to do voice over it in portuguese .
But it was so difficult that I decided to record again another version in portuguese .
This second video ended up being having a different concept and I explain Restful Rails in a bit more detail because the Brazilian audience can’t understand english well enough to learn through Peepcode .
So , if you can understand portuguese , you will want to check it out as well .
Other media sources reported on Friday that Hagel was announcing his future plans on Monday .
This article is dated Saturday , and thus probably came through within the last hour or two .
This will likely trigger a chain of events .
What may well end up happening , is that former democratic senator Bob Kerrey decides to seek Hagel 's seat .
Kerrey has already told the New School University , where he is president , that he may be leaving his position soon .
This would put a filibuster - proof senate majority a little closer .
I still do n't think we will get there in 2008 , but we may get close .
I think that if we do n't do it in 2008 , we will have a very good chance in 2010 .
There are so many vulnerable republican senators up in 2010 ( in NC , FL , NH , MO , KY , PA , OH , ect ) .
We may finally be able to undo the damage that the fringe right wing has done to this country .
Now we just need to convince Mark Warner , Bob Kerrey , and Jeanne Shaheen to run for senate .
Update : Another newspaper is confirming the retirement story .
This looks real , folks .

Julie Amero , the substitute teacher who could have received 40 years in jail after porn appeared on classroom PCs , was spared that fate — for now .
Instead , Amero will get a new trial after revelations that the original computer analysis was flawed .
The backstory in a nutshell : Amero was substituting for an English class .
She went to the restroom , and when she returned , students were gathered around a computer that was displaying porn pop-ups .
Amero , who describes herself as a total computer novice , could n't make them stop , and she eventually ran to the teacher 's lounge to get help .
In court , school officials admitted that the antivirus software installed on the PC was out of date and antispyware programs were not installed .
A school official did tell parents , however , that the school district had comprehensive filtering and firewall software in place at the time .
Although it 's hard to conjure up a simple explanation for why a substitute teacher would show middle - school students porn pop-ups on purpose , Amero was prosecuted on the ground that she had done this intentionally .
She was eventually found guilty and faced the prospect of 40 years in jail because of the incident .
A defense witness , who analyzed the computer but was unable to present all of his findings in court , called the case " one of the most frustrating experiences of my career , knowing full well that the person is innocent and not being allowed to provide logical proof . "
Her sentencing was scheduled for today , but the hearing instead turned into a motion for a new trial , according to the AP .
The computer in question was sent to a Connecticut state laboratory after the original trial finished , and the judge announced today that the lab findings may contradict those presented by the prosecution 's computer expert at trial .
Amero 's lawyers asked for and received a new trial , and the request was not opposed by the prosecution .
A date has yet to be set .
For Amero , it 's been a long , strange trip , and though she 'll have to wade through the details of the case once again in a new trial , today 's result will certainly come as more relief than the alternative .
The comic is true , I did switch phones because I wanted to try out Game Pass streaming .
I bought a couple different controller options and my favorite is by far the Razer Kishi .
This is a really slick little device that essentially turns your phone into a Switch .
The two sides of the controller split apart but remain connected via a flexible strap that sits behind your phone once it has locked into the USB C port in the right hand controller .
Once your phone is tucked in there the entire thing feels very solid .
As you can see I recently got back into No Man ’s Sky after not having played for about two years .
The latest patch and the fact that it is on Game Pass got me to reinstall .
The ability to play on my PC with my Ultrawide monitor and then go downstairs to the Xbox already makes Game Pass a compelling deal imo but the cloud streaming really is the cherry on top .
I ’m not sure I ’d want to play every type of game through a cloud streaming service but No Man ’s Sky is damn near perfect .
In fact , having played hours of it now on my phone with the Kishi , I think it runs better there than it does on my XBox One !
The way your save file follows you from device to device is the other incredible feat here .
I log off on my PC and I can pick up on my phone right where I left off !
The technology is amazing but it ’s not perfect and there are occasional stutters that remind you that you 're playing a game through the internet .
That ’s why I say it ’s still too early to base an entire subscription service on it .
To me it makes sense as a novel value add but not as the star of the show .
In other hardware related news I think it ’s important to let you all know that I have a headphone problem .
Not in the sense that my headphones do n’t work , but in that I like to collect them .
I do n’t know what it is about them that calls to me but if you mention the headphone situation in our house to my wife Kara , her intense and protracted eye roll will tell you everything you need to know .
My latest acquisition is a set of Logitech G733 ’s which I have had my eye on since they sold out at their launch a while back .
Logitech brought in former Nike designer Tiffany Beers to head up their gaming line and I think the results are really cool .
The biggest thing you notice about the G733 ’s is how ridiculously light they are .
The entire set weighs just under 10 ounces and you honestly hardly feel them on your head .
The next thing I noticed when I put them on was the elastic band that sits between your head and the rigid frame of the headset .
Combined with their lighter weight , this makes them really comfy on the head zone even for extended periods of time .
They also have an RGB strip along the front of the cans that you can customize via their G Hub app .
If you have other Logitech G gear you can sync it all up together so you have a single consistent lighting effect across all your stuff .
You can also activate “ Blue voice ” through the same app and this will goose the quality of your mic while giving you some fun presets to modify it as well .
Feeling how light they were I expected the sound to be thin but I was pleasantly surprised !
These sound excellent especially after turning on the bass boost feature in the " advanced EQ " .
The 733's also support simulated surround sound but you 'll need to go into G Hub to activate some of this stuff .
As an artist I ca n’t describe how refreshing it is to see new colors , textures and materials in this space .
I have plenty of heavy black rigs but the G733 legitimately feels like someone has come to “ gaming headphones ” with a fresh set of eyes and just said “ fuck it ” to a lot of the preconceptions .
I could not be happier with my purchase and just to be safe I ordered Kara a pair of the purple ones .
My only problem with them is n’t even their fault .
I ca n’t figure out how to use them during my streams .
The issue is that when I turn them on my Stereo Mix which I use to send the audio form the racing rig to the streaming PC stops getting any signal .
I ’m not the most tech savvy guy , but I ’ve been able to set up a pretty cool streaming studio here at home .
I ’ve done some googling myself but the audio side of things is someplace I still really struggle and I can’t seem to find a solution .
Currently my racing rig is set to take the signal from the Stereo Mix and pump in through the same HDMI cable that carries video to the capture card in my streaming PC .
Like I said , bluetooth headphones seem to screw this up .
If you have any suggestions please hit me up on my Tweeter as I ’d love to ditch my wired headphones for the stream and wear these super comfy ones full time .

The Federal Reserve ’s insistence on rewarding its own failures by granting itself new powers was harshly rebuked by Congressman Ron Paul during yesterday ’s Joint Economic Committee meeting , as Paul all but accused Ben Bernanke of contributing economicallly to a broader move towards fascism in America .
" There ’s a political philosophy that advocates merging together the interests of business and government at the same time with a loss of civil liberties of the people and I ’m afraid we ’re moving in that direction , " said the Congressman , citing warrantless searches , lack of medical , Internet and financial privacy as well as the loss of habeas corpus since 9/11 .
" I see … .
the proposal by the Treasury as a massive move to a lot closer association of business and government , " said Paul , adding that a military - industrial complex , a medical - industrial complex and a media - industrial complex were already in place .
Paul was refering to the Treasury Department ’s recent proposal to give the Fed , " Broad new authority to oversee financial market stability , in effect allowing it to send SWAT teams into any corner of the industry or any institution that might pose a risk to the overall system , " as the New York Times reported .
" We should be regulating the government – when you think of the authority you as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve can do , it really goes unaudited and very little oversight , " said Paul , adding that the creation of the President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets meant that " we had really given up on the Republic , freedom , the marketplace and sound money " .
" It looks like this is a massive increase in the combination of government and big business , " said the Congressman .

Special Report : US elections 2008
From on - demand video services that were overly demanding , to underwhelming operating - system updates , 2007 was full of disappointments .
We surveyed the landscape and polled some old friends to come up with the 15 products , companies , and industries that left the most sour taste in our mouths .
From last to first , here 's our list of the year 's biggest losers .
Read 'em and weep .
# 15 . Box Unpopuli : Amazon Unbox
Yes , entertainment on demand is the new black .
But Amazon 's video delivery service left us mostly blue .
The interface is cluttered and ugly -- lacking both the simplicity and sophistication of the Apple iTunes Store or NetFlix 's Watch Instantly .
The selection is weird , and searching is cumbersome .
For example , you can rent ( $ 3.99 ) or buy ( $ 14.99 ) a digital copy of Ocean 's 13 , but a search for " Ocean 's 11 " turns up an ancient concert video from the old prog-rock group Yes .
You can send Unbox movies to your TiVo , but you have to wait for them to fully download before you can watch them - - or 2 to 4 hours for a standard - length movie over a cable modem connection .
Not exactly what we 'd call ' on demand ' .
When Unbox debuted in late 2006 , we were willing to cut it some slack .
After all , we 're talking about Amazon , the guys who put the e in e-commerce .
We thought by now they'd have figured out how on - demand video is supposed to work .
We were wrong .
# 14 . Screwed up to the Max : Municipal WiMax
It sounded like a great idea : big cities would offer wide - area wireless Internet access as part of their infrastructure , the same as roads , traffic lights , and sewers .
A cheap , fast Net connection anywhere within city limits , 24/ 7 .
What 's not to love ?
Then public and private WiMax ventures started dropping like flies .
Sprint and Clearwire called off their plans to build a nationwide WiMax network , after Sprint CEO Gary " bet the company on WiMax " Forsee got canned last October .
Earlier this year EarthLink bailed on its offer to foot the bill for a Wi -Fi network in San Francisco .
Similar city - funded projects have bought the farm in Chicago ; Milwaukee ; and Anchorage , Alaska .
Even Silicon Valley -- arguably the most Net-centric community this side of Mars - - has had a hard time getting its WiMax plans off the ground .
The big reason ?
Cost .
Unwiring the whole valley would cost an estimated $ 200 million , or $ 133 K a square mile .
SV geeks can always park their cars near the Googleplex in Mountain View , whose wireless network covers 12 square miles .
As for the rest of us , well , we can hope and pray that the search titans win the FCC auction for the 700 - MHz wireless spectrum next January , and then decide to open their network to the world .
Does Google have to do everything ?
# 13 . Web 2 Woe : Social Networks
Memo to Badoo , Bebo , Catster , Dogster , Facebook , Faceparty , Flickr , Flixster , Hi5 , Hyves , Imbee , Imeem , MySpace , Mixi , Pizco , Pownce , Takkle , Twitter , Virb , Vox , Xanga , Xing , Zoomr ... and the 3,245,687 other social networks clamoring for our limited attention spans :
We got it .
Making connections between friends is cool .
Sharing photos and videos , even cooler .
But it 's all so ... 2006 .
Have n't you got anything new to show us ?
Here 's a safe bet :
Two years from now , 90 percent of these networks will be gone and their founders will be back working at Starbucks .
I 'll have a double mocha frappucino , please .
I wonder what would happen if the people and their representatives were to shock the powerful and their funders for a change ?
What if on November 16th , the Iraq Moratorium day , everybody together took major actions ?
What if everyone with a job took the day off work ?
What if everyone wore orange ?
What if everyone with a tax bill wrote to the IRS to say not to expect another dollar of that portion of taxes that goes to war ?
What if everyone who gives money to Democrats wrote to them to say not one more dime before impeachment ?
What if everyone left their homes in the morning and went straight to the nearest district office of their congress member , sat down , and picnicked on the floor , refusing to leave without two written commitments : 1 . to vote no on any more money to occupy Iraq , and 2 . to cosponsor articles of impeachment against Cheney and Bush ?
What if everyone brought cell phones and media lists and spent all day phoning the media from their congress member 's office ?
If everyone did these things , the congress members would be shocked , the police would be shocked , the media would be shocked , and the White House would be in a state of total panic .
The risk to the millions taking action would be minimized by the numbers involved , and the agenda in Congress would be a blank slate for the public to write its will upon .
Illegal reactions from the White House would aggravate the crisis , to the disadvantage of those in power .
If the people shocked the country , we would shock the political parties and the activist groups as well .
We could divert the $ 100 million election funds now being pulled together to waste on Senator Clinton 's electoral defeat into creating networks and media outlets that report the news without influence from corporate owners or advertisers .
We could create funds to support members of the military who refuse illegal orders , members of the government who report illegal activities , and members of the military - industrial - media complex who quit their jobs .
We could shift the political conversation in ways that impact every candidate , and we could legislate publicly funded clean elections with free and fair use of our airwaves .
We could inspire lawyers to file civil and criminal cases against Bush and Cheney , as many of them as possible , case after case after case .
We could inspire activist groups that claim to stand for justice to stand with us behind the Constitution and insist on impeachment .
On Monday , November 19th , Congress could hit Bush and Cheney hard with announcements from Pelosi and Reid that there would be no more funding for the occupation of Iraq , and that every troop , contractor , and mercenary must be brought home by New Year's .
While the White House was swallowing that awesome announcement , Congressman John Conyers could hit it with this shocking one : Impeachment hearings begin in the full House Judiciary Committee today , beginning with the obvious charges for which investigations are not needed or possible , and proceeding to the more complex investigations , passing each Article of Impeachment in turn on to the full House of Representatives .
Before lunch , Bush , Cheney , and Rice would be impeached for refusing to comply with subpoenas , and the trial in the Senate would be scheduled .
Before Thanksgiving , we'd have impeachments for FISA violations , signing statements , a CIA agent outing , misleading Congress , misappropriating funds , torture , war of aggression , threat of war of aggression , detentions without charge or legal process , war profiteering , and election fraud .
Hearings would be scheduled in an extended session of Congress to begin impeachment hearings on 9 - 11 , Katrina , global warming , whistleblower protection , the production of phony news reports , the politicization of the Justice Department , and the long list of war crimes in Iraq .
Now the public 's role would shift from blanket opposition to include support for those Representatives now acting on behalf of the public .
It would become very clear to every congress member and senator exactly where they could stand if they wanted to turn intense opposition into adulation .
Bush 's and Cheney 's days would be numbered .
Congress would take back its Constitutional power and refuse to confirm replacements for Cheney ( or Bush ) who did not commit to faithfully executing the laws of the land .
The November 2008 election would look very different from how it looks today .
But waiting for that election to change the nation 's course would miss the opportunity provided by the reverse shock of a democratic un - disaster .
The next 12 months , even while Bush was still in office but now on the defensive , would be the time to push through legislation backed by the public that would be very hard to take away from us again .
Social Security seems unimaginable today , but we have it and they have failed in every attempt to eliminate it .
We need to be thinking on the scale of Social Security .
Before the dust settles , here 's what we 'll legislate : publicly funded elections with free air time and hand - counted paper ballots overseen in total transparency by non-partisan officials , the elimination of NAFTA , the WTO , the IMF , the World Bank , and all their children , the creation of single - payer health coverage , a green - energy jobs program , the right to card - check union organizing , fully funded pre-school and college , fair taxation of corporations and multi-millionaires , repeal of the PATRIOT Act and the Protect America Act , drastically tighter limits on monopolistic media ownership , and the elimination of large sections of the military and intelligence budgets , including a ban on all privatized military operations , and shifting a portion of the eliminated funding to diplomacy and foreign aid .
Just watch them try to rebuild their plutocracy .
It ca n't be done .
Neither can we accomplish our goals slowly .
It 's too difficult , and we do n't have the time to spare .
Now is the moment for reverse shock .
An activist in Florida , the scene of Bush 's first presidential crime , recently proposed to me that citizens counter Bush with their own signing statements .
His is posted here .
You can write your own and post it there as well .
Write down what you intend to do and not do , and then get out there and do it , starting Friday , November 16th .
And send this ( and print it and hand it ) to everyone you know , and ask them to do the same .

This post is by a guest blogger .
John Guzman aka logtar is a computer programmer that rants about daily life , movies and culture .
He was born in Colombia and also does translation and interpretation .
Now that I have liberated myself from the last zoo I worked at , I feel that it is my duty to document the IT ( Information Technology ) ecosystem for those that happen to enter it .
I ’m intending this as a good PSA ( Public Service Announcement ) for all the non-IT people out there .
It is no accident that I have made all of the managers predators .
You may find yourself fitting one of the animal profiles .
The Eager Beaver
I think there is a little Eager Beaver in all of us when we start in a new department .
This character is the one that is always coming up with new innovative ideas that , while brilliant , will never be implemented .
There are many varieties of this beaver , from the one that eventually gets beat down and controlled to the one that actually tells his boss he is just stupid .
And , yes , to his face … and , yes , I have seen this one in the wild .
Eager Beavers know what they are doing when it comes to technology ; however they spent too much time on new ideas and not enough on actual production .
The Barracuda
Very hard to spot and very dangerous .
This is the one animal you think is a friend but it is only gaining your trust to gather information while your guard is down .
When the Barracuda attacks , you will never see it coming .
The Barracuda has a vast knowledge of the company .
They have probably been working with the company since its inception , and because of that they have immunity to attacks from any other animal .
The Porcupine
I am very proud of this animal .
They are masters at not doing their job .
When anyone approaches them , bosses included , they ball up and sometimes even shoot back .
They have very good knowledge of an old system and refuse to learn something new .
It is very amusing to see a Porcupine and a brand new Eager Beaver interact .
The Worker Bee
Thank God for the Worker Bee .
Without the Worker Bee most companies would have closed long ago .
You can see the Worker Bee getting to work before anyone else and working very late .
The worker bee picks up the pieces that everyone else drops and actually makes them work together .
Do not confuse the worker bee with our next friend the Remora .
The Worker Bee at times is not as technical or talented as other animals , but thanks to hard work they always accomplish the task .
The Shark - sucking Remora
My all time favorite animal … if I was a predator that could actually eat them .
They are the all time boss - servicing fish that keeps them clean and shiny .
They pretend to be Worker Bees because they are masters at taking credit for everything that is done right in the company .
They might have some talent , but it is hard to tell the difference between accomplishments and stolen credit .
The Peacock
It is amazing how this animal even makes it in IT .
They are characterized by a display of knowledge that is outstanding .
They chose their feathers wisely since their knowledge cannot be countered by anyone else in the organization .
They are so crafty , that at times they even become managers .
The Migratory Geese
Also known as consultants .
These birds , that sometimes come from India , come in and promise to fix everything .
They are always very knowledgeable , talented and at times cheap .
However , at the last second , they are called back to their mother ship and leave the project halfway done .
At that point , they promise to send other birds , but these ones are even more expensive and harder to track .
The Skunk
We can all recognize it by its smell .
They are an animal that always knows when to appear .
They are the ones that love to gather information about how the project is progressing .
Everyone thinks they are not too bad , but when under pressure , they release a cloud of confusion that leaves projects paralyzed .
Do not be fooled by their laborious nature , in the end they will leave you smelling for a long time .
They use their cloud of perfume to confuse everyone and take credit for anything that is accomplished .
The Irish Setter
They are masters at pointing fingers .
They never solve a problem but have an uncanny nose that tells them who messed up and they spend their live simply pointing .
All other animals fear them because , even though they are not true predators , they have the ability to call one at will .
They also have the ability to divert attention by not moving a muscle while the problem is being troubleshooted .
The Orangutan Architect
I could make a whole post about this animal .
They have a genius that no one else understands .
They create the most complex systems for simple solutions .
If you have ever had a conversation with someone that talks in circles , never getting to a point , you might have encoutered an Orangutan .
Like their conversational skills their code is extremely hard to follow and it resembles a bowl of spaghetti .
Somehow they are also backed by the predators , I believe because of their uncanny capability to confuse .
The Dodo Bird
Every manager that I have encountered has claimed to be this animal .
However , I have yet to find it .
This manager says that he will always stick up for you , provide you with training and never look for blame .
They are always talking about great benefits , compensation and comp time .
Comp time is a fictitious IT tool used to lured employees into working extra hours and weekend in the hope of future time off .
The comp time never equals the effort if it ever appears .
Once you think you have found a dodo bird he suddenly dissapears .
Along with his disappearance , comp time also disappears .
The Shark
The most feared animal in the animal kingdom .
While there are other animals thar are stronger than him , his razor sharp teeth will give you nightmares .
When he is not in his habitat he is not much of a treat , but he will still try to call you at home and try to use his power of persuasion .
When in the office he swims around looking for victims .
Through fear he can make anyone do anything and always manages to look good to those on top .
Never ask a shark for comp time if you want to keep all of your limbs .
The 900lb Gorilla
Like other managers , this one rules through fear , using its brute temper to dominate all other animals in the kingdom .
If it starts pounding its chest , it is time to leave the premises .
Do not taunt this brute or you will be hurt .
The Narnia Lion
Like its book and movie counterpart this one comes and then goes .
This animal is close to the dodo bird on being the perfect manager but they always seem to disappear or morph into another .
I have actually worked with one Narnia lion and it was a wonderful experience .
He was the only manager that ever gave me a heads up and told me , “ Leave this company , they are going to collapse . ”
In other instances , these are the managers that end up leaving because the Barracuda , the Orangutan and the Irish Setter conspire against him and end up killing him at the stone table .
Where do you fit in your office ecosystem ?
Acid3
Now the top four browsers have either released or announced a version of their browser that passes Acid2 work on Acid3 has restarted and Ian Hickson has been adding testcases over the last few weeks .
Acid3 is primarily concerned with ECMAScript and the DOM though Selectors Level 3 , Media Queries , and data : URIs are also tested .
The idea of the test is to run a hundred ECMAScript functions that either return true ( pass ) or false ( fail ) .
I believe sixteen of those functions are missing at the moment and people are encouraged to contribute .
Tests need to be justified by a specification at W3C Candidate Recommendation , W3C Recommendation , or equivalent for non-W3C consortia , and be from 2004 or before .
I believe that if browsers once again commit to fixing the bugs found by this test Web authoring will improve tremendously .

A Sense of Scale
At roughly minus 460 F , absolute zero is abysmally cold , yet at least we can imagine it .
Being only a few hundred degrees below zero , it 's in the realm of something we can put our minds around .
This is not true of the opposite of absolute zero , the theoretical highest possible temperature .
In conventional physics , this is approximately 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 degrees .
In this interactive , get a taste of temperatures from absolute zero to absolute hot , and see why , for instance , even the core of the sun is relatively " chilly " compared to what many physicists believe the temperature of the universe was an instant after the Big Bang .

The Bush administration has further tightened supplies by announcing that it would add to the nation ’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the coming weeks , a move that some leading Democrats have urged President Bush to call off to ease the tight oil market .
Investors and hedge funds have contributed to the run-up in prices .
Oil , like other commodities , has become a perceived safe haven for traders who are skittish about the weakening dollar and fallout from the American credit crisis .
“ There is a momentum for higher prices because of the lack of cushions and because surprises are everyday events , ” said Larry Goldstein , a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation .
“ When anything goes wrong now , it gets immediately priced in not by pennies , nickels or dimes but by dollars . ”
Oil is now within reach of its inflation - adjusted high , reached in April 1980 in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution when oil prices jumped to the equivalent of $ 102.81 in today ’s money .
The brief stab at $ 100 on Wednesday broke the previous intraday trading record of $ 99.29 , reached on Nov. 21 .
The price at the end of the day , $ 99.62 , surpassed the record close of $ 98.18 , set on Nov. 23 .
Other commodities also rose , spurring more speculation that inflation could be a problem this year .
Spot gold climbed over $ 860 an ounce , and soybeans , wheat , platinum , heating oil and natural gas soared .
Unlike the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s , the current spike in oil prices has not caused a recession or contracted consumer spending in a major way so far .
But it has widened the trade deficit and raised concerns about inflation at a time when a growing number of economists fear a recession may be coming .
Energy experts are divided about how high oil prices can go , with some predicting that an economic slowdown will ultimately ease demand pressures .

Windows has finally crossed the line , and there 's nothing Microsoft can do about it .
It 's the beginning of the end .
It 's a pattern that I 've experienced first hand .
You start with something excellent , and in the service of your customers you try , try , try to keep it moving along .
It succeeds for a long time .
It becomes number one .
But , you become so involved in the idea of the product that you forget about what it 's like to be a customer .
You assume that it must be good because that 's what the market share tells you .
Then a line is crossed .
You know that something is wrong .
Your engineers can feel it .
There 's a malaise in the air .
But , nobody says anything .
At the lunch table , you read PC Week 's scathing criticism .
People stare around the room , some even laugh or scoff .
Most say nothing .
You go back to your work , you immerse yourself in further enhancements to your product .
You convince yourself everything is OK .
You look at competitive products only for purposes of punching holes in their strategy .
You find the holes .
You reassure yourself .
Everyone smiles .
Repeat until fail .
I recognize the pattern .
That 's where Windows is right now .
I just figured that out .
I think it 's the Windows Vista slip that triggered my realization .
The NYT Why Is Windows So Slow ?
article almost literally describes the phenomenon .
It was also the Scoble debacle that seems to have finally ended with Robert 's Better Mail than Jail posting , where he realizes he should n't have been so defensive .
That is the leak in the dike .
I see it on other Microsoft blogs too .
I do n't want to single Robert out , but I think Robert , as well as others , feel the malaise I described above .
The " unspoken truth " that something , though no one can say what , is wrong .
In 1988 , I was fortunate to be the archtect of The dBASE Professional Compiler , a product that was never released .
Remember dBASE ?
From Ashton - Tate ?
You do n't know what I 'm talking about do you ?
In 1988 , dBASE had 63 % market share of the database market .
That 's not just the PC database market , we 're talking about the entire database market .
Ashton - tate was on top of the world , and knew it .
My company was designing the compiler , so we were n't part of Ashton - Tate , but we worked closely with all the developers .
They were motivated , interested in their product , their customers , and confident they had the best solution for everybody .
Just like Microsoft today feels about Windows .
But , we were a small company of innovative engineers .
We looked at dBASE more objectively and saw clearly that dBASE was a mish - mash of features which had been built up one layer at a time until the whole no longer made sense .
Sure , we were doing the compiler .
It was an important problem to solve , and there were many people in the market who needed it .
It was a good thing to do .
But we knew what we were doing .
We knew we were creating a compiler for a language that should , by all rights , be obsolete .
At Ashton - Tate , such words were heresy .
Only rarely did we mention how we felt , and when we did , we knew we had stepped on some emotions .
There were some brilliant people at Ashton - Tate , and I was fortunate to know many of them .
When talking about dBASE , they were proud of their product , and it was the size of the customer base that was the de facto definition of why dBASE was a good product .
This is part of the pattern .
We are number one !
Our product clearly must be the reason .
As I got to know people during that project , eventually there was more trust .
Engineers at Ashton - Tate knew something was wrong .
There was almost a sadness in discussions about how to fix it , as if they knew it was unfixable .
dBASE had become a huge albatross , a product that had years of features heaped on top of an architecture that was never designed to handle such a load .
By 1989 , dBASE 's market share dropped to 43 % .
That 's a 20 % drop in just one year .
When Microsoft Access came out in 1992 , dBASE was dead .
Crashed to the ground in no more than 4 years .
Compatibility .
That 's what killed them .
dBASE had to be upward compatible at any cost , even if it meant creating extremely bloated and arcane features to support such compatibility .
Why ?
Because of the market .
The market was all Ashton - Tate had .
With over 60 % of the database market , and with the hint that the product may be far from perfect , compatibility became the holy grail .
Compatibility assured Ashton - Tate that their market would " come along " , that the effort to switch would remain higher than the effort to keep using the product .
Today , I saw the clear signs of the pattern in Microsoft 's behavior .
It 's clear that Vista is a struggle .
Regardless of whether the code rumors are true ( they probably are not ) , the product is slipping .
Worse , as an engineer I can read between the lines in the New York Times article :
Several thousand engineers have labored to build and test Windows Vista , a sprawling , complex software construction project with 50 million lines of code , or more than 40 percent larger than Windows XP .
I can't tell you the feeling of deja vu I had when I read that .
40 percent larger than Windows XP ?
There is no possibility that Windows is in good health .
NONE .
They 're adding , but they 're not removing .
They 're not moving forward , they are stuck so deep in the muck that every step is painful .
Dan Farber at ZDNet sees the same desparate quandry for Microsoft .
Good engineering does not result in products such as this .
Every single aspect of this matches the dBASE experience .
Microsoft is defensive about new features , with Brad Goldberg saying " The perception that nothing new has come out of the Windows group since XP is just so far from the truth " .
When they talk about things that are new , the list is almost laughable , consisting of " Tablet PC versions " as proof of Microsoft 's continuing " innovations " .
I dug up an old review of the newly - released dBASE IV by John Pochodowicz .
It 's a kitchen sink of sad additions which lead to the unbelievably bloated dBASE IV product which really had only one thing to offer : Compatibility .
I 'm expecting Vista to be close .
Can Microsoft maintain their lead with Windows ?
I do n't think so , though it may be a slower death .
Microsoft is n't as bad off Ashton - Tate was .
Their products are better - built than dBASE was , and Microsoft has more market - share , so , as a corporation , they can remain blind longer .
But the only answer for Microsoft will be to finally throw away the shackles of compatibility .
Microsoft has more time than Ashton - Tate did , and a lot depends whether they use it wisely .
Microsoft knows this .
NYT pointed to an internal memo by Ray Ozzie , chief technical officer , who said , " Complexity kills .
It sucks the life out of developers , it makes products difficult to plan , build and test , it introduces security challenges and it causes end - user and administrator frustration . "
Mike Benson was Ashton - Tate 's most brilliant architect .
He knew what needed to be done , and talking to him at the time was a breath of fresh air .
But , Ashton - Tate had crippled his ability to act by isolating his thinking in a " new products " division .
His work never came to light .
So Ray Ozzie knows , just like Mike Benson did .
But , from the behavior of the company , the politics of compatibility is winning .
The flawed belief that compatibility will assure market share has been disproven time and time again .
I was just lucky enough to have been there once , and know the pattern .

The Gilpin County Sheriff ’s Office was apologizing Monday after a weekend effort to help a research group led to complaints about what appeared to be a DUI checkpoint – but was n’t .
Sheriff ’s officials who participated in the stops now acknowledge that the nonprofit organization requesting voluntary DUI and drug tests from drivers was overly persistent , according to complaints .
“ It was like a telemarketer that you could n’t hang up on , ” said Gilpin County Undersheriff John Bayne .
Sgt. Bob Enney said deputies assisted the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in stopping motorists at five sites along Colorado 119 for surveys on any drug and alcohol use .
Surveyors then asked the motorists to voluntarily submit to tests of their breath , blood and saliva .
At least 200 drivers were tested , Enney said .
About five motorists later complained , he said .
Roberto Sequeira , 51 , said he and his wife , Terry , were detained for 15 minutes Friday evening despite their protestations that they needed to get their sleepy 10 - year - old child back to their home in Nederland .
He said they had to deal with two Pacific Institute researchers .
After Sequeira ’s repeated refusals , the officials offered his wife , who was driving , $ 100 in an attempt to get the couple to participate in a DUI breath test .
“ I think it ’s very dangerous , ” said Sequeira , a Boulder radio personality on Latino issues .
“ Sometimes at checkpoints , unfortunate things happen .
I do n’t think they ’re authorized to do what they ’re doing , and I view it as a gross violation of law - enforcement protocol . ”
The research is part of a nationwide study partly financed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Pacific Institute officials defended the initiative .
They said the collection of vital statistics measuring , over time , the number of people driving under the influence helps gauge the impact of laws and enforcement policy changes .
The survey , which began in July and will continue in other locations through November , is conducted every 10 years .
“ We ’ve been literally surveying thousands of people , ” said John Lacey , the director of the Alcohol , Policy and Safety Research Center in Calverton , Md. , through which Pacific Institute conducted its research .
“ So you can imagine if you stop people in the middle of the night , there will be complaints . ”
The survey results are anonymous and are n’t shared with police , he said .
He said the researchers try to be sensitive to those not wanting to participate , but they push a small subset of those who initially refuse to reconsider – even offering incentives .
“ If we do n’t do that , the criticism will come out that we had so many who were refusers , ” Lacey said .
Bayne said a similar study conducted in Gilpin County 2 1/ 2 years ago by the same researchers resulted in no complaints .
But he added that last weekend ’s effort was more aggressive .
“ The people were too persistent , ” Bayne said .
“ Some people did n’t feel it was voluntary . ”
Cathryn Hazouri , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado , said the participation of sheriff ’s officials and the blue jumpsuits worn by the survey team may have confused some of those who were stopped .
But she said the fact that surveyors stressed that the DUI and drug tests were voluntary eased her concerns about the incident .
Sequeira has invited Pacific Institute officials to appear on his radio show broadcast in Boulder and Denver on KGNU community radio , 88.5 FM and 1390 AM .
The show airs at 7 p.m. Tuesdays .
Recalling Friday ’s incident , he said Gilpin County sheriff ’s officials directed him to pull over on Colorado 119 about 10:45 p.m. when his family was returning from a dinner .
He said neither he nor his wife had been drinking .
They were greeted by “ youthful , college ” surveyors dressed in jumpsuits and blue generic caps .
“ We had a 10 - year - old in the back who ’s tired , we tell them thanks but no thanks , we have to get this child back home to bed , ” Sequeira said .
He said a worker persisted , saying that the researchers would assist in driving the family home if they needed assistance .
When the Sequeiras again demurred , a supervisor offered them a $ 100 money order .
“ We say , ‘ No , thank you , we have to get our child home , ” ‘ Sequeira recalled .
“ At this point , both clones start chortling at us and ridiculing us . ”
Sequeira plans to file a complaint at the Gilpin County courthouse seeking to force the organization to stop the roadside tests .
“ I want them to cease and desist their unethical , unsafe and unqualified roadside practice , ” Sequeira said .
For now , Gilpin County officials do n’t have to decide whether they would participate with the group again .
For now , the surveys in that county are completed .

Between April 2003 and June 2004 , $ 12 billion in U.S. currency — much of it belonging to the Iraqi people — was shipped from the Federal Reserve to Baghdad , where it was dispensed by the Coalition Provisional Authority .
Some of the cash went to pay for projects and keep ministries afloat , but , incredibly , at least $ 9 billion has gone missing , unaccounted for , in a frenzy of mismanagement and greed .
Following a trail that leads from a safe in one of Saddam 's palaces to a house near San Diego , to a P.O. box in the Bahamas , the authors discover just how little anyone cared about how the money was handled .

Hidden in plain sight , 10 miles west of Manhattan , amid a suburban community of middle - class homes and small businesses , stands a fortress - like building shielded by big trees and lush plantings behind an iron fence .
The steel - gray structure , in East Rutherford , New Jersey , is all but invisible to the thousands of commuters who whiz by every day on Route 17 .
Even if they noticed it , they would scarcely guess that it is the largest repository of American currency in the world .
Officially , 100 Orchard Street is referred to by the acronym < spanclass = " sc " >eroc , for the East Rutherford Operations Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
The brains of the New York Fed may lie in Manhattan , but < spanclass = " sc " > xeroc is the beating heart of its operations — a secretive , heavily guarded compound where the bank processes checks , makes wire transfers , and receives and ships out its most precious commodity : new and used paper money .

| |||Pallets of American currency arriving in Baghdad .
On Tuesday , June 22 , 2004 , a tractor - trailer truck turned off Route 17 onto Orchard Street , stopped at a guard station for clearance , and then entered the < spanclass = " sc " > eroc compound .
What happened next would have been the stuff of routine — procedures followed countless times .
Inside an immense three - story cavern known as the currency vault , the truck 's next cargo was made ready for shipment .
With storage space to rival a Wal - Mart 's , the currency vault can reportedly hold upwards of $ 60 billion in cash .
Human beings do n't perform many functions inside the vault , and few are allowed in ; a robotic system , immune to human temptation , handles everything .
On that Tuesday in June the machines were especially busy .
Though accustomed to receiving and shipping large quantities of cash , the vault had never before processed a single order of this magnitude : $ 2.4 billion in $ 100 bills .
Under the watchful eye of bank employees in a glass - enclosed control room , and under the even steadier gaze of a video surveillance system , pallets of shrink - wrapped bills were lifted out of currency bays by unmanned " storage and retrieval vehicles " and loaded onto conveyors that transported the 24 million bills , sorted into " bricks , " to the waiting trailer .
No human being would have touched this cargo , which is how the Fed wants it : the bank aims to " minimize the handling of currency by < spanclass = " sc " > eroc employees and create an audit trail of all currency movement from initial receipt through final disposition . "
Forty pallets of cash , weighing 30 tons , were loaded that day .
The tractor - trailer turned back onto Route 17 and after three miles merged onto a southbound lane of the New Jersey Turnpike , looking like any other big rig on a busy highway .
Hours later the truck arrived at Andrews Air Force Base , near Washington , D.C.
There the seals on the truck were broken , and the cash was off - loaded and counted by Treasury Department personnel .
The money was transferred to a C - 130 transport plane .
The next day , it arrived in Baghdad .
That transfer of cash to Iraq was the largest one - day shipment of currency in the history of the New York Fed .
It was not , however , the first such shipment of cash to Iraq .
Beginning soon after the invasion and continuing for more than a year , $ 12 billion in U.S. currency was airlifted to Baghdad , ostensibly as a stopgap measure to help run the Iraqi government and pay for basic services until a new Iraqi currency could be put into people 's hands .
In effect , the entire nation of Iraq needed walking - around money , and Washington mobilized to provide it .
What Washington did not do was mobilize to keep track of it .
By all accounts , the New York Fed and the Treasury Department exercised strict surveillance and control over all of this money while it was on American soil .
But after the money was delivered to Iraq , oversight and control evaporated .
Of the $ 12 billion in U.S. banknotes delivered to Iraq in 2003 and 2004 , at least $ 9 billion cannot be accounted for .
A portion of that money may have been spent wisely and honestly ; much of it probably was n't .
Some of it was stolen .
Once the money arrived in Iraq it entered a free - for - all environment where virtually anyone with fingers could take some of it .
Moreover , the company that was hired to keep tabs on the outflow of money existed mainly on paper .
Based in a private home in San Diego , it was a shell corporation with no certified public accountants .
Its address of record is a post - office box in the Bahamas , where it is legally incorporated .
That post - office box has been associated with shadowy offshore activities .
Coalition of the Billing
The first shipment of cash to Iraq took place on April 11 , 2003 — it consisted of $ 20 million in $ 1 , $ 5 , and $ 10 bills .
It was arranged in small bills on the theory that these could quickly be circulated into the Iraqi economy " to prevent a monetary and financial collapse , " as one former Treasury official put it .
Those were the days when American officials worried that the gravest threat facing Iraq might be low - grade civilian unrest in Baghdad .
They did n't have a clue as to the power of the insurgency that was to come .
The initial $ 20 million came exclusively from Iraqi assets that had been frozen in U.S. banks as long ago as the Gulf War , in 1990 .
Subsequent airlifts of cash also included billions from Iraqi oil revenues controlled by the United Nations .
After the creation of the Development Fund for Iraq ( D.F.I. ) — a kind of holding pit of money to be spent for " purposes benefitting the people of Iraq " — the U.N. turned over control of Iraq 's oil billions to the United States .
When the U.S. military delivered the cash to Baghdad , the money passed into the hands of an entirely new set of players — the staff of the American - led Coalition Provisional Authority .
To many Americans , the initials C.P.A. would soon be as familiar as those of long - established government agencies such as D.O.D. or < spanclass = " sc " >hud .
But the C.P.A. was anything but a conventional agency .
And , as events would show , its initials would have nothing in common with " certified public accountant . "
The C.P.A. had been hastily created to serve as the interim government of Iraq , but its legality and paternity were murky from the start .
The Authority was in effect established by edict outside the traditional framework of American government .
Not subject to the usual restrictions and oversight of most agencies , the C.P.A. during the 14 months of its existence would become a sump for American and Iraqi money as it disappeared into the hands of Iraqi ministries and American contractors .
The Coalition of the Willing , as one commentator observed , had turned into the Coalition of the Billing .
The first mention of the C.P.A. came on April 16 , 2003 , in a so - called freedom message to the Iraqi people by General Tommy R. Franks , commander of the coalition forces .
A week after mobs ransacked Iraq 's National Museum of its treasures , unchallenged by American troops , General Franks arrived in Baghdad for a six - hour whirlwind tour .
He met with his commanders in one of Saddam Hussein 's palaces , held a video conference with President Bush , and then quickly flew off .
" Our stay in Iraq will be temporary , " General Franks wrote , " no longer than it takes to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction , and to establish stability and help Iraqis form a functioning government that respects the rule of law . "
With that in mind , General Franks wrote that he created the Coalition Provisional Authority " to exercise powers of government temporarily , and as necessary , especially to provide security , to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction . "
Three weeks later , on May 8 , 2003 , the U.S. and British ambassadors to the United Nations sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council , effectively delivering the C.P.A. to the United Nations as a fait accompli .
The day before , President Bush had appointed L. Paul Bremer III , a retired diplomat , as presidential envoy to Iraq and the president 's " personal representative , " with the understanding that he would become the C.P.A. administrator .
Bremer had held State Department posts in Afghanistan , Norway , and the Netherlands ; had served as an assistant to Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig ; and had closed out his diplomatic career in 1989 as ambassador - at - large for counterterrorism .
More recently , he had been the chairman and chief executive officer of a crisis - management business called Marsh Crisis Consulting .
Despite his State Department background , Bremer had been selected by the Pentagon , which had elbowed aside all contenders for authority in post- invasion Iraq .
The C.P.A. itself was a creature of the Pentagon , and it would be Pentagon personnel who did the C.P.A.'s hiring .
Over the next year , a compliant Congress gave $ 1.6 billion to Bremer to administer the C.P.A .
This was over and above the $ 12 billion in cash that the C.P.A. had been given to disburse from Iraqi oil revenues and unfrozen Iraqi funds .
Few in Congress actually had any idea about the true nature of the C.P.A. as an institution .
Lawmakers had never discussed the establishment of the C.P.A. , much less authorized it — odd , given that the agency would be receiving taxpayer dollars .
Confused members of Congress believed that the C.P.A. was a U.S. government agency , which it was not , or that at the very least it had been authorized by the United Nations , which it had not .
One congressional funding measure makes reference to the C.P.A. as " an entity of the United States Government " — highly inaccurate .
The same congressional measure states that the C.P.A. was " established pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions " — just as inaccurate .
The bizarre truth , as a U.S. District Court judge would point out in an opinion , is that " no formal document … plainly establishes the C.P.A. or provides for its formation . "
Accountable really to no one , its finances " off the books " for U.S. government purposes , the C.P.A. provided an unprecedented opportunity for fraud , waste , and corruption involving American government officials , American contractors , renegade Iraqis , and many others .
In its short life more than $ 23 billion would pass through its hands .
And that did n't include potentially billions more in oil shipments the C.P.A. neglected to meter .
At stake was an ocean of cash that would evaporate whenever the C.P.A. did .
All parties understood that there was a sell - by date , and that it was everyone for himself .
An Iraqi hospital administrator told The Guardian of England that , when he arrived to sign a contract , the army officer representing the C.P.A. had crossed out the original price and doubled it .
" The American officer explained that the increase ( more than $ 1 million ) was his retirement package . "
Alan Grayson , a Washington , D.C. , lawyer for whistle - blowers who have worked for American contractors in Iraq , says simply that during that first year under the C.P.A. the country was turned into " a free - fraud zone . "
Bremer has expressed general satisfaction with the C.P.A.'s work while at the same time acknowledging that mistakes were made .
" I believe the C.P.A. discharged its responsibilities to manage these Iraqi funds on behalf of the Iraqi people , " he told a congressional committee .
" With the benefit of hindsight , I would have made some decisions differently .
But on the whole , I think we made great progress under some of the most difficult conditions imaginable , including putting Iraq on the path to democracy . "
< h4 > The Bottomless Vault
To be fair , the C.P.A. really did need money desperately , and it really did need to start spreading it among the traumatized Iraqi population .
It also needed to jump - start Iraq 's basic services .
As the C.P.A. demanded ever greater amounts of cash , the pallets of $ 1 , $ 5 , and $ 10 bills were soon replaced by bundles of $ 100 bills .
During the C.P.A.'s little more than a year of life , the New York Federal Reserve Bank made 21 shipments of currency to Iraq totaling $ 11,981,531,000 .
All told , the Fed would ship 281 million individual banknotes , in bricks weighing a total of 363 tons .
After arriving in Baghdad , some of the cash was shipped to outlying regions , but most of it stayed in the capital , where it was delivered to Iraqi banks , to installations such as Camp Victory , the mammoth U.S. Army facility adjacent to the Baghdad airport , and to Saddam 's former presidential palace , in the Green Zone , which had become the home of Bremer 's C.P.A. and the makeshift Iraqi government .
At the palace the cash disappeared into a vault in the basement .
Few people ever saw the vault , but the word was that during one short period it held as much as $ 3 billion .
Whatever the figure , it was a major repository of the banknotes from America during the brief time the cash was under the care of the C.P.A .
The money flowed in and out rapidly .
When someone needed cash , a unit called the Program Review Board , composed of senior C.P.A. officials , reviewed the request and decided whether to recommend a disbursement .
A military officer would then present that authorization to personnel at the vault .
Even those who picked up large sums usually did not actually see the vault .
Once a disbursement had been made , the cash was brought to an adjoining room for pickup .
This " secure room , " as one military officer called it , looked a lot like a vault itself : a thick metal door at the entrance , with the room beyond starkly furnished with only a table and chairs .
The table would be piled high with cash .
An authorized officer would sign papers for the money , then begin carting it upstairs — sometimes in sacks or metal boxes — to the Iraqi ministry or C.P.A. office that had requested it .
Upon turning over the cash , the officer would be required to obtain a receipt — nothing more .
C.P.A. officials tried to keep a rough running tab on the amount disbursed to individual Iraqi agencies such as the Ministry of Finance ( $ 7.7 billion ) .
But there was little detail , nothing specific , on how the money was actually used .
The system basically operated on " trust and faith , " as one former C.P.A. official put it .
Once the cash passed into the hands of the Iraqis or any other party , no one knew where it went .
The C.P.A. turned over $ 1.5 billion in cash to Iraqi banks , for instance , but later auditors could account for less than $ 500 million .
The United Nations retained a team of auditors to look over American shoulders .
They did n't see much , because they were largely cut off from access while the C.P.A. held power .
As a report by the U.N. 's accounting consultant , KPMG , noted dryly , " We encountered difficulties in performing our duties and meeting with key C.P.A. personnel . "
" There was corruption everywhere , " said one former military officer who worked with the C.P.A. in Baghdad in the months after the invasion .
Some of the Iraqis who were put in charge of ministries after Saddam 's fall had never run a government agency before .
Their inexperience aside , he said , they lived in constant fear of losing their jobs or their lives .
All many cared about , he added , was taking care of themselves .
" You could see that a lot of them were trying their best to get a quick retirement fund before they were ousted or killed , " he added .
" You just get what you can while you 're in that position of power .
Instead of trying to build the nation , you build yourself . "
Did any withdrawals from the vault pay for secret activities by government personnel ?
It is an obvious possibility .
Much of the cash was clearly destined for American contractors or Iraqi subcontractors .
Sometimes the Iraqis came to the palace to collect their cash ; other times , when they were reluctant to show up at the American compound , U.S. military personnel had to deliver it themselves .
One of the riskier jobs for some U.S. military men was to fill up a car with bags of cash and drive the money to contractors in Baghdad neighborhoods , handing it over like a postal worker delivering mail .
Fraud " was simply another word for " business as usual . "
Of 8,206 " guards " drawing paychecks courtesy of the C.P.A. , only 602 warm bodies could in fact be found ; the other 7,604 were ghost employees .
Halliburton , the government contractor once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney , charged the C.P.A. for 42,000 daily meals for soldiers while in fact serving only 14,000 of them .
Cash was handed out from the backs of pickup trucks .
On one occasion a C.P.A. official received $ 6.75 million in cash with the expectation he would shell it out in one week .
Another time , the C.P.A. decided to spend $ 500 million on " security . "
No specifics , just a half - billion dollars for security , with this cryptic explanation : " Composition TBD " — that is , " to be determined . "
The pervasiveness of this Why - should - I - care ?
attitude was driven home in an exchange with retired admiral David Oliver , the C.P.A.'s director of management and budget .
Oliver was asked by a BBC reporter what had happened to all the cash airlifted to Baghdad : Oliver : " I have no idea — I can't tell you whether or not the money went to the right things or did n't — nor do I actually think it 's important . "
Q : " Not important ? "
Oliver : " No .
The coalition — and I think it was between 300 and 600 people , civilians — and you want to bring in 3,000 auditors to make sure money 's being spent ? "
Q : " Yes , but the fact is that billions of dollars have disappeared without a trace . "
Oliver : " Of their money .
Billions of dollars of their money , yeah , I understand .
I 'm saying what difference does it make ? "
The difference it made was that some American contractors correctly believed they could walk off with as much money as they could carry .
The circumstances that surround the handling of comparatively small sums help explain the billions that ultimately vanished .
In the south - central region of Iraq a contracting officer stored $ 2 million in a safe in his bathroom .
One agent kept $ 678,000 in an unsecured footlocker .
Another agent turned over some $ 23 million to his team of " paying agents " to deliver to contractors , but documentation could be found for only $ 6.3 million of it .
One project officer received $ 350,000 to fund human - rights projects , but in the end could account for less than $ 200,000 of it .
Two C.P.A. agents left Iraq without accounting for two payments of $ 715,000 and $ 777,000 .
The money has never been found .
The calls for the impeachment of Dick Cheney , and possibly President Bush are beginning to reach a crescendo , and we know the fascists in our country are getting worried when the MSM refuses to give a US Congressman any credence or airtime when he is calling for the Impeachment of Dick Cheney .
If people doubt the Internet is a serious medium for political discussion and a way to get across a message , watch how the message of Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) will permeate every major political site on the Internet .
These are some excerpts from Rep Wexler from RAW Story , and it ’s a story made for Christmas the way it warms the hearts of those attempting to bring democracy back to America :
Spurned by major newspapers , Dem Congressman takes ‘ impeach Cheney ’ appeal to Web As the House Judiciary Committee continues to refuse any action on proposals to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney , three of that panel ’s members tried to take their case to influential op - ed pages of the nation ’s largest newspapers .
They were turned down by every one — including the New York Times , Washington Post and Miami Herald — so now one of the lawmakers has taken his campaign to the Internet .
( Emphasis added .
So much for the New York Crimes attempting to report real news again … )
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) on Friday launched a new Web site , WexlerWantsHearings.com to advance his call to impeach Cheney .
The site hosts an op - ed article censored by the nation ’s major newspapers and outlines the case for impeaching Cheney .
“ The truth is the mainstream media have no interest in this issue , ” Wexler said Friday .
“ They have bought into the notion that impeachment hearings are outside the bounds of what the congress ought to be doing , ” the six - term Congressman elaborated during a conference call Friday .
MUCH MORE
In an interview that almost made me gasp , I read where ABC ’s John Stossel interviewed Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul , and they actually allowed him enough time to express his opinion , and the words he stated should be echoed on every television in America !
Maybe Christmas will hold a special meaning this year , and as the average American is struggling to buy gifts and still keep up with the bills , Bush ’s fiscal mismanagement is touching people all across the nation , up close and personal .
Our lives are progressively getting worse financially as prices are spiraling out of control , and then Ron Paul spoke words that should go down in history for his brutal honesty , a trait that ’s almost non-existent in most of the Presidential candidates .
( Except for Dennis Kucinich , and even I have n’t heard words from him this strong ! )
When The Media Grew Ears : ABC by William Westmiller http://www.opednews.com
The American media has discovered that Ron Paul has something to say , knows his facts , and is able to offer a cogent defense of his political positions .
Most of the other candidates have had ample opportunities to respond to questions in an open interview format , but those have been rare and brief segments for Ron Paul .
It seems that some media outlets have grown ears and are now ready to listen .
ABC News ’ John Stossel has always had libertarian inclinations – they ’re evident in his 20 /20 segments and specials .
This week , he sat down with Ron Paul to discuss a host of issues … and allowed him to offer complete responses to each question .
The interview is posted on the web and will likely be broadcast at an opportune moment .
The chat between “ Two Libertarians ” , is offered in six segments :
# Constitutional Freedoms Stossel :
You talk about freedom and tyranny .
I seldom hear politicians use those words .
Paul :
That ’s right .
I think those are our only two choices and we ’ve had a grand experiment in this country , where we emphasize freedom .
If you read the constitution , the constitution was designed to protect individual liberty , to restrain the government .
…
Freedom is new .
Tyranny is old … it ’s ancient .

Nicole Richie & Joel Madden First Evening Out ( Photos )
andhad their first night out on Friday .
The two were photographed as they were attending Hollywood talent agent Bennie Medina 's 40th birthday party .
Nicole looked great in a little back dress and jacket .
Joel is in formal wear for the occasion .
Lionel Richie was reportedly also in attendance at the Los Angeles event .
We have to say that Nicole looks wonderful .
There is another full length photo that shows the actress in her full glory .
It is hard to imagine that she only recently gave birth to their new daughter Harlow Winter Kate Madden .
Like any new parents , odd are they made several phone calls home to check on their little one .
Japan has become the second nation to acquire functioning ballistic - missile defence equipment , carrying out a successful shootdown yesterday .
A target rocket representing a medium - range enemy missile was engaged and destroyed 100 miles above the Pacific by a Standard SM - 3 interceptor fired from a Japanese warship , JS Kongo .
The target took off from the US Navy missile range facility on Kauai , Hawaii .
JS Kongo pops one off .
The Japanese Maritime Self - Defence Force ( JMSDF , the title given to the country 's navy after World War II ) has operated destroyers carrying US Aegis air - defence technology for some time .
In 2003 , the JMSDF was authorised to upgrade its ships with the latest SM - 3 interceptor weapons and tracking kit .
This gear has been developed by America for shooting down short and medium - range , Scud - type ballistic missiles of the kind found in the arsenals of many minor powers .
The SM - 3 can't pick off a true , triple - stage intercontinental missile - ICBMs fly too high - but the Aegis radar can help to track such threats .
Japan has moved to acquire Aegis missile defences in response to menacing moves by North Korea in recent years , which have included firing a " test " weapon right over Japan into the Pacific .
Kongo - class ships deployed west of Japan could offer a useful defence against the current North Korean armoury , though Kim Jong - Il 's regime is working on a proper ICBM .
Aegis and Standard gear is made by Boeing , at considerable cost .
Yesterday 's shootdown was the 12th score for SM - 3 in testing , the company said .
" This successful test brings a new level of defensive capability and security for our ally Japan , " added Debra Rub - Zenko , Boeing veep .
" We will continue to strive to increase the system 's credibility , " Japanese Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba told AFP .
" We can't talk about how much money should be spent when human lives are at stake . "
The news wire said , however , that the missile - interceptor test had " outraged peace activists " in Japan , and quoted Tokyo professor Yoshikazu Sakamoto as saying that it could arouse " suspicion in enemy countries " .
A number of other countries have equipped their navies with Aegis equipment from America , including Spain and South Korea .
They too could potentially acquire similar Scud - buster upgrades . ®
Saudi women are not allowed to mingle with unrelated men
The case of the unidentified woman , 19 , drew international criticism after an appeal increased her 90 - lash sentence to 200 lashes and six months ' jail .
The justice ministry statement rejected " foreign interference " in the case .
It insisted the ruling was legal and that the woman had " confessed to doing what God has forbidden " .
The statement carried by the official press agency late on Saturday said the sentence would be carried out in accordance with Saudi law .
The woman was initially to be punished for violating strict gender segregation laws in Saudi Arabia , for riding in the car of a man who was not related to her when they were both attacked .
" The Saudi justice minister expressed his regret about the media reports over the role of the woman in this case which put out false information and wrongly defend her , " the statement said .
" The charged girl is a married woman who confessed to having an affair with the man she was caught with . "
Barbaric
Adultery is a punishable offence in Saudi Arabia 's strict system of Islamic law , and correspondents say judges are given wide powers to impose custodial sentences or corporal punishment .
The justice ministry statement is at odds with previous published testimony of the woman , who is a Shia Muslim from the Qatif area .
She has reportedly said she met the car - owner in order to retrieve a photo of them together , having herself recently got married .
She says two men entered the car and drove them to a secluded area where others were waiting , and both she and her male companion were raped .
Her sentence was increased on appeal after judges wanted to punish her for attempting to use the media to influence the case .
Her attackers ' sentences - originally up to five years - were also doubled .
The woman 's companion was sentenced to 90 lashes .
Several governments and human rights groups have condemned her sentence and urged it to be lifted .
Canada described it as " barbaric " .
The US , a major Saudi ally , declined to comment specifically on the sentence , but did call the case " astonishing " .
1 . We are here with Zed Shaw , king of the Internet .
Why do n't you tell us a little bit about yourself ?
Basically I am the guy that wrote Mongrel , and developed it for a bunch of people and then basically that 's the only thing that I have done in my entire life .
That 's all that people care about .
I wrote Mongrel and I worked on a bunch of other open source projects and I do Rails professionally and also writing a book .
I have been doing open source for about 10 years and lived all over the place , all over US .
I 've done just about everything you can imagine .
2 . Tell us in a nutshell what Mongrel is and what is so special about it ?
Mongrel is a web server that helps you run any Ruby web application , not just Rails , lots of different stuff , it 's embeddable , it 's an API and it 's very , very small .
It 's only about 2500 lines of code .
3 . Your presentation today dealt with the intersection of open source and business interests .
And you have some views on how business should interact with open source projects .
Not so much should , but how it generally works better .
And for the most part I tried to tell people that when you are working with open source projects it's not a company , it 's a bunch of people doing it as a hobby more or less , even if there is a company fronting it , it 's still going to be open source .
The majority of my presentation was around how you interact with it , and the fact that you have to deal with a lot more crap and basically about the ways that I hear companies that deal with me especially complain about how they do n't get service , and if you give nothing you get nothing , and that 's the nutshell for the whole presentation .
And then there 's also a kind of a general thing that I think a lot of these companies have no sense of humor .
There 's some funny things out there , especially with my project and other projects and they consider that the wrong thing unprofessional .
4 . What does it mean to have a sense of humor relating to an open source project ?
With my projects it tends to be able to accept some vulgarity .
In general it 's more just that in a lot of business they expect it to be memo quality , they expect to be something put on the memo and sent it out , and so when they do it open source it's an open fairly straight forward , very uncensored communication channel .
In the two types of companies I have seen , there is a company that 's using an open source project , they will come in and demand things , because they are used to demanding things from companies that have contracts with , whereas this does n't work with an open source project .
And then from the company that is trying to sell stuff to an open source , I see that they come in and it 's really obvious that they are selling , that 's the key , and they do n't have the sense of soft sell and how to talk to folks , you really just have to be a friend with general people in an open source project .
A lot of my presentation was trying to tell people " This is people I 've seen trying to use Mongrel and work with Mongrel and how they can do better to help the project and themselves " .
5 . How has Mongrel enabled the Rails community would you say ?
I think it 's coming from two directions : the first one is that it simplified the deployment , made it so much easier for a lot of folks , and that indirectly caused this cottage industry .
Before there were 2 or 3 hosting companies for Rails and now there are 10 or 15 .
That 's partially because Rails became more popular but also because it became simpler to do different types of hosting .
You have the hosting and capabilities from Xen , but then the ability to run Mongrel and put a gigantic load balancer in front of it the way some places do , simplified things .
On the other side though is that Ruby pushed the limits , Mongrel pushed the limits of Ruby , and I think a lot of my criticism are about the garbage collection , the threads , the array bugs , the supporting of MenTaLguY guy so that he can get his threads faster at working , his work including it , I think a lot of that helped by making Ruby more solid as a server platform .
Before people were n't pushing it as hard as it could go and it 's just that big push really stabilized a lot of Ruby applications .
Still not as stable as I would like , but it really helped a lot , it really pushed it a lot further .
6 . What is the fast thread fix by MenTaLguY guy ?
The fast thread stuff is actually known in [ Ruby ] 1.8.6 and what it does is the threading before was written using Ruby and arrays and the weird Ruby locking system they have .
And what ends up happening is there were these leaks that just came about by the way Array was implemented and there were some patches by Erik Mahurin - if I say his name right - that fixed array but they were fairly invasive .
Those patches went in to the 1.9/2.0 stream and on to the 18 .
MenTaLguY came about and what he did is using Ruby monkey patching and things .
Basically he wrote a really nice clean C only version of all the thread locking primitives .
The basic threading is still there , it 's just the primitives locking , syncing , queuing , all those things are now done in C and very well controlled .
By doing this you basically install the fast read library and then boom all these bugs went away you do n't have memory leaks , you do n't have problems with stalling for no apparent reason , all this stuff goes away .
Which is really interesting because when I first started complaining about this most people told me it did n't exist .
It 's funny that I say it did n't exist and start pushing and right after that we get a patch for Array which fixes a bunch of things , and then a nice patch for threads that fixes a bunch of things .
I think that 's one of the things that if there is going to be a lasting impact of Mongrel it will get rid of those bugs because before that , nobody would even believe that there could be these bugs in the Ruby platform .
And then after , it 's obvious that there are bugs that infect them .
7 . Is Ruby fast enough for Rails production ?
It is , you can basically get down and because of a system like Mongrel you do n't have to use Rails only .
You can actually branch out and start doing additional things outside Rails .
I think it really helped a lot of folks ; you 've got Ezra doing all this Mongrel uploads using his framework which uses the same gear but does n't use Rails .
He 's getting really good upload timings and he can use a few Mongrels to do what used to take tons and tons .
It is ready for doing heavy loads and things like that .
I do n't think it 's as good as I would like , I would like it to be much more robust on the other hand , staying up , and management and being able to monitor and control .
But on the other side of speed and performance you can use it , it 's pretty fast , and lots of other frameworks once you put the application on the framework , the raw speed goes away too .
As an observation , totally not backable , I found that your first version of a lot of your bigger stuff , does n't matter what framework it is , but the first version of bigger pages and bigger functionality usually only gets one or two requests for a second anyway , so you always have to do some kind of tuning .
Nowadays I tell people they can totally go Mongrel , you can go light speed LightHTTP , what was really killing it before were the bugs , the leaks and the bugs and now those are pretty much gone , and much better .
8 . Is Mongrel part of a coming enterprise Ruby stack ?
I do n't even know what enterprise Ruby stack is .
As far as I can tell it is people saying " We could probably sell this to some folks " .
I have talked to people and there are two sides : I hear rumors of enterprise Ruby stacks all over the place , various companies , and then I talk to people asking what they think that is and they say " I do n't know " .
The only thing I think of is if there is going to be some kind of coming more supportable framework and stack it's has got to keep a lot of the stuff that made Mongrel successful , the simple deployments , simple setups simple starting , the same way you do development is the same way you deploy .
If they break any of that , when I am using Mongrel to do development and then pushing something else to do deployment , I do n't think it is going to work very well .
I also think that if anyone does anything like that , they pretty much have to give it away and do the support contracts .
It 's just the trend .
You can't really sell web servers anymore .
The only people that seam to sell web servers though , which is interesting , are on the Java and .
Net side people who sell entire stacks .
What I think they are trying to do is build a stack which is all these services written in Ruby , queuing and data store and session management , all these things , and sell that .
It would be interesting to see if they come out and do that .
The thing I think would be interesting is if they keep it all Ruby , which I do n't think is going to work , for various reasons I do n't think Ruby can do all those things very well , or worse they go multi language like we have talked about the RabbitMQ using that for your queuing , various other techniques that 's written in Erlang and it is very small too , I was checking it out and it 's tiny and really slick .
If you did something where if you want to do it now and you did Mongrel , RabbitMQ and a nice UI on top of that , it will be pretty much 90 % of what you are getting from the WebSphere and these other things .
And with those two combos you can do some nice session management , you can solve concurrency and start up , all that stuff .
9 . Are you intending to profit of Mongrel now that it 's successful in a commercial sense ?
I do n't really think you can , I mean I actually have more fun just putting it out there , even if I may rant about people I say are idiots and morons , they are the most fun part .
And also I like the folks that need my help , the people that come to me and ask for help , I am always helping them out .
The only thing I can see to make money through Mongrel would be maybe the support contract point of view , but like I said in my presentation it is only 2500 lines of code .
If you really want to productize it and turn it to something to make money on that 's a lot of investment .
You got to build user interfaces and management tools , things that people expect from corporations .
They expect the WebSphere or .
Net management framework for this , and I like having something small and tiny .
Originally it was pretty bad with Mongrel , it was n't making any money and most of job offers were getting more retarded and I decided I was n't going to code for anyone anymore , mostly because of Mongrel .
But now it 's calmed down , people are using it , there 's no pressure from a lot of folks .
For me it 's a really fun project to work on , and if it came up that there 's a way I can balance still helping people out and still making cash out of it , I will totally do it , capitalist - I would go for it .
10 .
You were a programmer for a long time in the Java world , now you are a programmer in the Ruby world , compare and contrast , what are some of the differences ?
When I was a programmer in the Java world there was actually easier to get contracts and it was easier to get internal contracts .
It was easier for me to work internally for companies building services that really did n't go outside the company .
And that was the majority of the Java work that I did .
I never worked on any sites for Java that became gigantic external sites .
Except for a few university portals and things like that , most of it was internal .
I have always considered that more valuable work , because I worked for the department of correction , the internal services I wrote saved millions and millions of tax paid dollars that were spend somewhere else .
If you do a public face and say " You are not saving any money you are only spending it " you are not really able to show if it gives any benefits .
Now that I am doing Ruby it 's a complete inverse , it 's all external stuff , products people want to do and so on .
What I find is that the majority of people come at me with an offer , lots are just con men horrible people , they would have some dumb idea they will try to con you into it , they would give me contracts , just heinous contracts , weird contracts trying to take my inventions and make me list things out .
I do n't think it 's Ruby , but I think it 's people smell money , and when people smell money you get con men basically evil bastards try to take you , and lucky for me I have been around the block and I can spot it , but it is also kind of horrid in that I expected when I did Mongrel that I will be able to go work for someone doing something else cool , and instead the only offers I got come from people who have no clue at all .
11 . For Java people that still have n't made the leap , maybe they are doing web application stuff and they are considering moving on to Ruby , what 's some advice you can give them ?
First of I would say , moving to Ruby is a really good move , I have been crunching some statistics and doing some stuff and if I run into them , I do a blog post of just tracking trends as far as language adoption , and there is a guy who keeps statistics of message posts to the various comp.lang Usenet groups .
And Ruby went up and then about 3 years ago dropped significantly .
I think its peak was 48.000 messages that year and then when it dropped it 's down to 18.000 .
There 's a serious drop and the thing I noticed is that it's a shift , it 's not necessarily the other languages are increasing , it 's almost as if those programmers that were doing Java have actually shifted down to Python , Ruby and PHP .
I 'm telling people that right now Java is turning into the new COBOL .
If you are good at it , you got a good entrenched job and you can continue doing it , then you should keep doing it .
If you go into Ruby , then there 's a lot of work out there for Ruby , most of it that I see is being pitched to consulting firms .
And the firms are picking up the Ruby work .
There are tones of work for it , it 's possible for people to learn it .
I would right now if I had a friend who is doing Java I would say " You got to go learn Ruby or Python and go pick those two , like pick up Rails or Django or any other Python frameworks , and go branch out and start learning those just because the trend is going away from Java for new development , and it's a good career move " .
Even of you never moved out of Java and you are able to stay where you are at , it 's just a good career move , it 's a good safety net .
12 . To wrap it up , you are a programming language enthusiast I would say .
What 's the next language for you after Ruby ?
I have got a few , I 'm constantly tinkering with the languages : so I do Lua every once in a while , and I play with D , which is pretty cool .
I 'm telling people who are doing C++ to go do D , it 's a really slick one , it 's like C++ done right , compiles all that good stuff garbage collection .
I may go check out Erlang now that there is a book , although it 's just the functional Prolog thing , it drives me nuts , but the ideas in Erlang are really tight .
The language I have been playing with a lot and only really for desktop applications , because of the way it is designed is called Factor , but that 's mostly kind of an esoteric language it's a modernized Forth so it 's got all the stuff you get from LISP and functional programming languages .
You got comprehension and list processing , but it 's done in a stack language style , you can build really nice DSLs with it , really sweet looking programs , code is very efficient and fun to work in , but the main thing is that in just in three years they cranked out so much stuff .
Very few people manage to produce way more capability than even Ruby has got , full GUI languages , web servers , web frameworks , multi protocols , every kind of compressions , algorithms , in a very small amount of time , very small space and their virtual machine is only 6000 lines of C code which is impressive .
They have a multi platform compiles on about 16 platforms and runs in 6 K of C code .
At the grocery store , I have noticed that organic food in general costs about 25 – 50 % more than regular items , and in some cases the mark up is more than 200 % .
According to the USDA certification guidelines – “ Organic meat , poultry , eggs , and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones .
Organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides ; fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge ; bioengineering ; or ionizing radiation . ”
For some , especially those with young children , it may seem like the benefits of using organic foods justifies the extra cost .
But like everything else , it is important to look beyond the label to get the best bang for the buck .
Here is some information that can help decide which organic purchases are worth the extra cost and which may not be .
Pesticide Retention
Let ’s start out with the “ Dirty Dozen ” , a list put together by not - for - profit Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) .
This list is based on the results of nearly 43,000 tests for pesticides on produce collected by the USDA and the FDA between 2000 and 2004 .
This list identifies the foods and vegetables that retain the most pesticide content in them .
By switching to the organic equivalents of these items you can cut down the pesticide content in your daily food intake dramatically , hence maximizing the bang for the buck of your “ organics budget ” .
Peaches Apples Sweet Bell Peppers Celery Nectarines Strawberries Cherries Lettuce Grapes ( Imported ) Pears Spinach Potatoes
On the other hand , if you are buying organic Onions , Avocado , Sweet Corn ( Frozen ) , Pineapples , Mango , Sweet Peas ( Frozen ) , Asparagus , Kiwi , Bananas , Cabbage , Broccoli or Eggplant , you may not be getting much benefit from spending the extra dollars for going organic .
The same study as above indicates that these fruits and veggies retain very few pesticides .
For full information about the items that you most often buy and to determine if the additional cost for going organic is really worth it , check out this detailed article or their complete data set .
Growth Hormones
Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone ( rBGH or rBST ) is a genetically engineered hormone that is injected into cows to increase milk production .
Even though FDA approved the use of rBGH as safe for consumption in 1993 , further studies have linked rBGH in humans to susceptibility to breast and colon cancer ( Note : the results are not conclusive , though ) .
In addition the cows treated with rBGH are more susceptible to diseases and hence likely to be treated with antibiotics , the remnants of which could be found in milk and other dairy products .
Hence , spending your organic food budget on organic dairy products may be a wise decision .
Here is a listing of artificial hormone - free brands listed by states .
Genetically Engineered Food
It is not quite clear if genetic / bio engineering will make the agricultural produce better or create frankenfoods .
The debate rages on .
If you would like to avoid the genetically engineered foods however , you might want to watch out for products containing corn , soy , canola and cotton .
According to the True Food website , these four crops account for nearly 99 % of the genetically engineered crop acreage in North America .
As mentioned above , the USDA description of “ organic ” precludes the use of bioengineered ingredients , and so going organic for items that use corn , soy , canola and cotton seed can get you the best bang for the buck if you want to avoid genetically engineered food .
Here is a list of brands that use / avoid genetically engineered ingredients for items ranging from baby foods to cookies to frozen dinners .
Shelf life
An informal study conducted by the authors of this MSNBC article found many organic items had much lower shelf life compared to conventional products .
They used lettuce , broccoli , chicken and milk in their tests .
They found that there was a significant difference , and in case of lettuce , broccoli and chicken , the organic produce went bad much sooner than the conventional produce .
However , in the case of milk , they found that the organic milk had similar shelf life as regular milk .
In general , when you plan your menus , make sure you use up the organic food items before you reach for the conventional groceries , to prevent wastage of those items that you have already a paid a premium for !
Understanding the labels
Finally , it is very important to understand what the labels mean when you purchase something organic .
According to the USDA National Organic Program the labels can be interpreted as follows
“ 100 % Organic ”
Products labeled as “ 100 % organic ” must contain 100 percent organically produced ingredients , not counting added water and salt .
Label may show the USDA organic seal and / or certifying agent seal (s ) .
“ Organic ”
Products labeled as “ Organic ” must contain at least 95 % organic ingredients , not counting added water and salt .
Also , they must not contain added sulfites .
They may contain up to 5 % of non-organically produced agricultural ingredients which are not commercially available in organic form .
Label may show the USDA organic seal and / or certifying agent seal (s ) .
The label may also show “ X % Organic ” .
“ Made with organic ingredients ”
For products labeled as “ made with organic ingredients ” the percentage of organic - only ingredients drops down to 70 % .
Up to 30 % of the ingredients may be non-organic .
The label may show the certifying agent seal (s ) , but NOT the USDA organic seal .
Any product with less than 70 % organic ingredients may not claim to be organic and may not show the USDA or any other certifying agent seal .
They can however , list individual organic ingredients used .
So to sum it up , if you have a limited budget to spend on organic items make sure you understand which items offer the best benefits by going organic .
Also , to me it looks like the best bang for the buck will be to buy something with the USDA seal since it guarantees that at least 95 % of the ingredients are organic and the product does not contain sulfites , which cause allergies and asthma in some people .
And finally , consume organic produce soon since they are likely to have smaller shelf life .

At a time when southern California is a blazing inferno , this action alert from Bill Lackemacher of Sacramento for Democracy urges Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to bring the California National Guard back home from Iraq .
As CA burns , where is the CA National Guard ? by Bill Lackemacher , Sacramento for DemocracyAs Southern CA goes up in flames , where is the CA National Guard ?
According to CNN , there are only 1,500 CA National Guardsmen fighting these fires .
Where are the rest of our National Guardsmen , and why are they not helping to fight these fires ?
Are they in Iraq ?
If so , how many are still in California ?
To the best of my knowledge , there are about 20,000 CA Army National Guardsmen .
When I called their office , I could n't get a straight answer about how many CA Air National Guardsmen there are .
I 'm not sure why they wo n't tell me .
They wanted to know who I was and why I wanted to know how many there were .
What are they hiding ?
We all know that our guardsmen are in Iraq protecting Halliburton and the Multi-national Oil Corporations .
I think it 's well past time to tell our Governor to Bring Our CA National Guard Home !
Please call the governor 's office and tell him that we want our Guard Home Now to protect our great state !
Call Governor Schwarzenegger today !!
916-445-2841
( Press 1 for English , then 5 for " Hot topic issues " , then 0 to speak to someone ) I believe it is due time that we revive Loni Hancock 's , AJR 36 , to bring our CA National Guard home !

Voters in small - town Hailey , Idaho , Tuesday approved three out four marijuana initiatives placed on the ballot over the objections of town officials .
Initiatives to legalize the medical use of marijuana , make marijuana the lowest law enforcement priority , and legalize industrial hemp all passed .
A fourth measure , which would have mandated the city to tax and regulate marijuana sales , failed .
Some 1,288 eligible voters went to the polls in Hailey , with medical marijuana gaining the most votes ( 687 ) , followed by hemp ( 683 ) and lowest priority ( 637 ) .
Taxation and regulation lost by a margin of 573-674 .
The initiatives were the brainchild of Ryan Davidson , chairman of the Idaho Liberty Lobby , who three years ago began efforts to put marijuana on the ballot in the Wood River Valley towns of Hailey , Sun Valley , and Ketchum .
Local authorities in all three communities denied his petitions , and a series of court battles ensued , out of which Davidson emerged victorious .
Davidson is working on initiatives for Sun Valley and Ketchum .
The initiatives require the city of Hailey to create a Community Oversight Committee to oversee implementation .
They also require the city of Hailey to lobby other branches of government for reform of the marijuana laws .
State and local officials are likely not happy .
The Idaho Attorney General 's Office issued a statement last week reminding voters that marijuana possession is a crime under both state and federal law , and Hailey City Attorney Ned Williamson predicted before the vote that the city could be the subject of expensive litigation at taxpayer expense if voters approved the measures .
But now the voters have spoken , and it is up to city officials to heed their will .
I 'm learning a relatively new programming language called OCaml , or Objective Caml .
All the Ph.D. candidates have been raving about it for the past few years , and a few of the finest programmers I 've ever known have cited it as their language of choice .
OCaml programmers and programming teams have been winning and placing in challenging programming competitions .
Microsoft research has created a version of it ( called F# ) for .
NET .
So I thought I 'd take a look .
OCaml is a very high - level language , similar perhaps to Lisp or Prolog , but with strong type - checking that helps your programs run correctly the first time .
However , it appears to be as fast or faster than C++ , in any number of language shootouts .
I 've verified this myself , for small programs , by solving the same problems in OCaml and C++ , and it appears ( at least initially ) to be true .
How is that possible , you ask ?
Well , that 's complicated , and it involves a lot of proofs .
The nutshell version is that the ML language family has an elegant type - system that allows the compiler to deduce things about your program that a C++ compiler cannot possibly deduce about a C++ program .
Some ML compilers can , for example , turn much of your heap - allocated memory into stack - managed memory .
They can also use more compact representations for your data types , eliminate or inline virtual method calls , turn tail recursion into iteration , and take advantage of immutability and side - effect - free functional programming to do internal parallelism , object pooling , and assembly - language - level optimizations that a C++ compiler has no hope of achieving , since it does n't really know what the hell you 're doing .
In the past year , I 've studied and written code in many languages , including ( but not limited to ) Perl , Python , Ruby , Emacs - Lisp , Scheme , Common Lisp , Pascal , JavaScript , C# , Java , Objective - C , Haskell , Prolog , C , C++ , XSLT , Standard ML , OCaml , and others .
I 've been on a quest to find the Right Language (s ) for my own software development , ever since about 2 years ago when I found that I 'd pretty much hit a wall with Java , after having written about 600,000 lines of Java code .
I got to the point where I knew exactly how long it would take me to write and debug any given project in Java , typing at full speed - and it was too long .
As much as I like Java ( the platform ) , I think Java ( the language ) is unpleasantly verbose and inexpressive - it's " uncompressable " beyond a certain point .
For X amount of functionality , you 're going to have Y lines of code , with no way around it .
And for large enough systems , the sheer bulk of the code begins to be problematic by itself .
Making big changes can require editing thousands of files .
Understanding the program flow requires reading through a bunch of infrastructural boilerplate that there 's no way to eliminate .
AspectJ may help with this significantly , but it 's still ( IMO ) an inelegant hack : a precompiler that adds metaprogramming facilities to a language that does n't support them natively .
It 's a brilliant move by Gregor Kiczales , in some ways - he 's realized the unwashed masses of programmers will never graduate to a real language , and that Java is here to stay , so he 's implemented something remotely resembling aspects of his CLOS system as a Java preprocessor , and added branding and marketing to it in the form of new terminlogy ( e.g. " crosscutting " , " aspects " ) to an idea that 's been around for 20 or 30 years .
Kudos .
But I 'm not going to use it unless it becomes part of the Java language standard .
As it stands , I do n't think it 's well - integrated enough .
However , most of the other languages I 've used make me unhappy as well .
OCaml looks like the first one that might have everything I want and perform well .
It has Win32 bindings , so you can write native Windows applications .
( This statement is initially a bit of a mind - bender for people who associate " native " with assembly , C , and C++ , but if you think about it , there 's absolutely no reason you could n't write a " native " Windows application in any language for which you wrote an appropriate compiler . )
It works wonderfully on Linux and Cygwin , which are the only two Unixes I care about anymore .
It supports functional , imperative , object - oriented , and logic programming all in the same language , and you can intermix the styles freely .
It has great Emacs support .
It comes with an interactive interpreter that you can use for incremental development , Lisp - style .
There are books about it available from your favorite bookstore - at least about SML , which is very similar to OCaml .
OCaml has threads , exceptions , call - with - continuation , calling conventions to and from C , a rich standard library with collections , networking , I/O , graphics , a complete interface to the Unix programming API , and a powerful module system that blows Java 's packages away .
It has interfaces and bindings for Oracle , MySQL , postgres , berkeley DBs , CORBA , COM , xml-rpc , SOAP , XML , perl - compatible regular expressions ... the list goes on .
You name it , it 's there .
OCaml has the potential to make me happy as a programmer , finally .
We 'll see .
( Published sometime in June 2004 )
8/4/2005 : I wound up not using OCaml much after that .
I do still like it , and I 'd enjoy programming in it .
I just found myself migrating towards Lisp .
However , OCaml 's mix of expressiveness and performance is astonishing , and I 'd like to work with it again at some point .

At stake in the election is control of the three state governments , as well as their seats in the upper house of the federal Parliament .
But beyond the short - term political tussle lies the question of long - term damage to the country ’s halting attempts to integrate its newcomers , many of whom were born here but are still viewed as outside society ’s mainstream .
Politically , the Christian Democrats have everything to lose , since they already control all three governments .
Even if they manage to maintain control , simply losing seats would likely be interpreted as a sign of weakness , as the campaign for the next national elections in 2009 already looms large .
Mrs. Merkel hopes to win a large enough share of votes to break up the marriage of convenience with the Social Democrats known as the “ grand coalition . ”
She struck a more measured tone when she spoke at the rally after Mr. Koch .
“ Violence in this country , whoever is responsible , is not acceptable , ” Mrs. Merkel said .
She asked for a discussion “ in all calmness ” with the Social Democrats .
When the debate first flared up , Mrs. Merkel seemed to steer clear of the controversy .
Then a few days later she stepped up to support Mr. Koch .
“ It can not be that a minority in this country creates fear in the majority , ” she said , leaving wiggle room as to whether she was referring to immigrant youth specifically or to young people generally .
Mrs. Merkel pointed to the high share  43 percent  of violent crimes committed by those under 21 , and the fact that close to half of those were by what she called “ foreign youths . ”
Critics argue that the problem lies in disproportionately disadvantaged backgrounds , and that poor German youths are as likely to commit crimes as poor Turks or Russians .
Statistics show that juvenile crime rates fell in 2007 from the prior year , but the debate has been more rhetorical than statistical .
Immigrant groups , Germany ’s Jewish community and in particular the rival Social Democrats have called Mr. Koch a populist xenophobe and worse .
Peter Struck , parliamentary floor leader for the Social Democrats , went so far as to accuse Mr. Koch of being “ glad at heart ” that the Munich subway attack had happened , a charge Mr. Koch denied .
Critics say the racial overtones cross the line .
A campaign poster in Bavaria showed a still image from a surveillance video of the attack , in which the one attacker in the frame is a black silhouette .
The victim ’s image is cut out , making him a pure white shape .
Where he slumps on the ground are written the words , “ So that you are not the next . ”
Citizens , industrial polluters , and scholars do not usually see eye to eye — but that may change with a new Web site that monitors corporate environmental performance in the United States .
According to the university professors who created it , MapEcos ( mapecos.org ) is a breakthrough for visualizing and interpreting data about industrial environment performance because it brings together information about companies ' environmental management , provided voluntarily by managers in real time , with companies ' pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
" MapEcos itself is a public service , because it makes this data , most of which exist in archival databases of the EPA , much more readily accessible , " says Michael Toffel , an expert on industry self - regulation and an assistant professor in the Technology and Operations Management unit at Harvard Business School .
You do n't need to be " green " to see the value of such an endeavor .
What makes MapEcos attractive for managers in any industry is the opportunity to watch peer companies — and in some cases , subsidiaries of their own companies — provide environmental information on the map and easily disclose information themselves .
Besides managers , the site 's creators hope MapEcos will grab the attention of members of the public , including environmental activists .
Users can track factories ' pollution activity over time , compare factories in their community , and compare the pollution of local factories to others in their industry across the country — but just as important , monitor what mitigating steps facility managers are taking .
Toffel and his colleagues also developed MapEcos as a mechanism to support their academic research .
" Often public impact conflicts with scholarship and vice versa , " says Toffel .
" We decided to bridge this impasse by creating the experiment inherent in MapEcos , providing a diverse group of companies the opportunity to disclose their environmental management efforts .
The map provides both the stimulus and the public good , and we can remain completely impartial . "
Toffel planned and stewards the site with colleagues whose research is similarly devoted to issues surrounding business and the environment : Andrew King , an associate professor at Dartmouth 's Tuck School and currently a Marvin Bower Fellow at Harvard Business School , and Michael Lenox , an associate professor at the Fuqua School and faculty director of Duke University 's Corporate Sustainability Initiative .
They received essential technical expertise from student programmers who were fascinated by environmental issues , technologically talented — and tireless .
" It was a huge amount of work , " King recalls with a grin .
The name MapEcos emphasizes an attempt to integrate information that is relevant to both ecology and economics .
A Niche To Fill
The observation that led to the site 's founding is a common one that vexes businesspeople as well as scholars concerned with markets : information bottlenecks .
" On many of the projects that I 've been involved in , it seemed that a major flaw was that information was n't getting to the people who needed to make decisions , " says King .
" All 3 of us are interested in the concept of voluntary activities that firms do as alternatives to regulation — one of which is the voluntary disclosure of information .
That is perhaps the critical issue , I think , for environmental performance .
" We needed a way of getting information about unobserved environmental attributes and getting that information credibly , " he continues .
" And so a Web project seemed like a great opportunity for us to explore that process . "
The researchers decided to join forces in early 2007 while attending the Institutional Foundations for Industry Self - Regulation Conference they organized for researchers and policymakers .
By December , the site launched .
Research Matters
According to Toffel , 2 research projects are associated with the map : looking at what facilities do , and what the public at large is concerned about .
For the first project , the researchers sent a survey to as many of the facilities on the map as possible based on the availability of e-mail addresses in the EPA database , and asked them to describe their environmental management activities , environmental awards , and the " ecolabels " their products use .
( An ecolabel is meant to denote that a product is particularly " green . " )
" From a research point of view , we want to get a better understanding of why some firms are more transparent than others about their environmental practices and performance , " Toffel explains .
In the second project , the researchers hope that usage patterns on MapEcos will provide insight into the dynamics of stakeholder interest .
For instance , which companies and industries attract more attention from stakeholders ?
Which communities are particularly interested in the environmental performance and activities of local companies ?
Taking Action
On the site , users , whether company executives or private citizens , can view detailed environmental performance information on facilities across the United States .
Each facility on the map is color - coded according to emission level ( blue is low , red is high ; a green ring indicates that a company disclosed some information about its environmental management activities by responding to the researchers ' survey ) .
In their survey responses , managers can outline what their companies are doing about environmental protection and community engagement , and see their responses posted in real time .
Companies are aware that by responding their data may be analyzed .
Other stakeholders can view the entire United States , or focus on data about particular geographic regions .
“ We want to get a better understanding of why some firms are more transparent than others about their environmental practices and performance . "
— Michael Toffel
With the entire United States on view , where are the most flagrant polluters ?
Well , the United States has a lot of red dots .
Toffel mentions that power plants and metal mines are the 2 industries with the greatest amount of toxic pollution , and that counties with the largest emissions in the country are in Utah , Ohio , Tennessee , Kentucky , West Virginia , and Texas .
Users can search on variables such as emission level or health hazard level , rated from 0 to 9 , with 9 being worst .
By typing in 7 , 8 , or 9 , they can see highest polluters indicated all across the map , either by raw sum of pounds of toxic chemical emissions or by pounds weighted by human toxicity .
According to King , emissions in the United States are highly skewed : Several make the lion 's share of emissions while a great number make relatively few .
" Knowing that some factories have vast emissions really puts the situation in perspective , " says King .
" It makes you wonder whether all the attention that gets paid to a local dry cleaner is worth it .
Now of course , there are other factors that weigh in : for instance , whether a dry cleaner is in a highly populated area . "
Geospatial research on business and the environment is still in its infancy , Toffel concurs .
From a public health perspective , it would be quite useful to map , for instance , how individuals are exposed to pollutants based on where they live :
Living upwind or downwind from a smokestack , at the same distance , can carry dramatically different health implications , and mapping this difference could help easily communicate this to a variety of stakeholders .
A number of countries already require a subset of their regulated community to report information on their own environmental performance .
" Wherever such data exists , this map can expand , " says King .
The MapEcos researchers would like to add Canada and Mexico to the site , and possibly build a portal for countries that do not currently have voluntary reporting by firms .
King suggests that for such a non-U.S. site , citizens could report information about the companies in their communities , and the companies themselves could be asked to report information , creating a virtual , transparent mechanism for stakeholder engagement .
Such projects would be difficult but worthwhile .
According to the scholars , the array of research possibilities is immense and ever growing .
As environment sciences continue to rapidly develop , mapping can bring together specialists in fields as diverse as environmental engineering and graphics .
As Toffel concludes , " The notion of how to display environmental information geographically is something that people are getting very excited about , because while the world faces some serious global environmental problems like climate change , a great deal of pollution and many environmental impacts are local .

Funny how it works : the dead Osama threatens the EU a mere day after Gordon Brown suggests a National Security Strategy for the European Union .
In a new audio message purportedly from Osama Bin Laden , the al - Qaeda leader threatens the EU over the re-printing of a cartoon offensive to Muslims .
The voice on it says the cartoon , re-published recently in all major Danish newspapers , was part of a crusade involving Pope Benedict XVI .
The drawing , first published in 2005 , depicts the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban .
The voice on the audio has not yet been verified as belonging to Bin Laden .
The message comes on the fifth anniversary of the US - led invasion of Iraq .
But the BBC ’s Jonathan Beale in Washington says that the message was probably released to not to mark that anniversary , but rather the anniversary of the birth of Prophet Muhammad , which Sunni Muslims mark on Thursday .
It appeared on a Islamist website that has carried al - Qaeda messages in the past .

I HAVE BEEN SO VERY PROUD to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences or AMPAS or the Oscar people for seventeen years .
When I was accepted for membership I was given a certificate of membership and an Academy Card .
I ’ve lost the certificate , but each year I have been issued a new card .
I use my Academy Card to get into screenings at movie theaters or sometimes at the Academy itself , which is in Beverly Hills on Wilshire Boulevard .
And each year when it ’s time to submit nominations for the Academy Awards I receive what are called screeners , which are films that the studios want the members of the Academy to consider for Awards .
“ For your consideration ” it will say on the cover of the screener .
Now they are in the form of DVDs , but originally they were video tapes .
I ’ve always been very happy to receive these screeners ; they have made me feel very important .
The Academy Awards !
I would sit in front of our TV and play the tape or DVD and make notes on a legal pad ; I would write the name of a film or actor that might deserve to be nominated .
And then when the ballots came I would vote .
There are two ballots : a nominating ballot and a final ballot for the Academy Awards themselves .
The Awards take place after that show on the red carpet , The Red Carpet Show .
I took my responsibility very seriously , wrote my notes on a legal pad .
I have received as many as seventy - five screeners during an Academy Awards season .
A FEW YEARS AGO the film studios ’ organization , the MPAA ( Motion Picture Association of America ) became concerned about piracy and losing revenue from films that had been copied from screeners and sold illegally , pirated , without the studios getting any money .
With DVDs it had become easier to duplicate films I guess .
So a legal document was sent out to members of the Academy that we all had to sign .
By signing it we promised that we would never allow anybody to take possession of our screeners for any reason , and that we would be very careful with them .
I think that the Academy sent it out or it could have been the MPAA or maybe it was sent jointly .
Anyway , I signed it even though it made me feel strange , like a criminal or something .
Like “ Academy Member ” equals “ criminal . ”
It was insulting , but I signed it .
Not long after that document was sent out , a company came up with a special kind of DVD player that would play DVDs that were encoded to play only on uniquely identified machines ; and I was sent my very own machine , without charge .
There 's a picture of the screen that comes on the TV when you turn the player on .
But not all the movie studios would support this special DVD player for some reason .
So a possible solution to the piracy problem had been rejected ; and the studios were still very worried , so worried that they began to put all kinds of threatening notices on their films , notices that cited the FBI and Interpol and detailed how the individual screeners were watermarked and how all their “ industry colleagues ” had better be careful or face severe penalties .
They sent me letters of warning about what would happen to me if I ever ever let any of their screeners fall into the wrong hands .
This is from the Sony Pictures letter : Each of these screeners may be individually coded with an invisible unique watermark that identifies the screener and any copies of the screener , with you personally .
If any unauthorized copies of the films are traced back to your screeners , you risk civil and criminal penalties .
We are asking you to be especially careful in your handling of these screeners — please do not circulate , transfer , distribute , loan [ sic ] , sell , reproduce , or give the screeners to anyone else .
And the letter made me very worried .
So now we 're all worried ; the studios are worried and I 'm worried .
The studios made it very clear that screeners could be traced back to me .
There , to the right , is a typical statement that appears on the screen before the film begins .
That was shown before I could watch “ Michael Clayton , ” a Warner Brothers film with George Clooney .
In case that ’s hard to read , here ’s what it said .
“ You are personally responsible for this disc and its content .
This screener is digitally watermarked to identify you , the member .
Do not loan [ sic ] , rent , sell give away or otherwise transfer to any third party for any reason . ”
And those warnings from the FBI and Interpol were also shown on the screen before I could watch a film , and I could n't fast - forward through them either .
Try it and “ N / A ” shows up in the upper right hand corner .
In red .
That kind of thing makes you worried .
I mean what would happen to me and my family if one of my screeners got into the wrong hands and was duplicated and they were able to trace it back to me ?
Would Interpol , the FBI , come and get me ?
What about my wife ?
My cats ?
It made me very worried .
I could go to prison .
I mean what if somebody broke into my apartment ?
Or what if somebody who happened to be working here one day decided to steal one of my screeners ?
I could go to prison .
SO I DECIDED that I just had to make my apartment more screener - secure so that no one could ever steal my valuable screeners ; I began to explore security measures .
Here ’s a surveillance camera .
It cost around $ 180.00 .
I thought about putting it above the étagère where I store my screeners .
I would attach it to some kind of video recorder , the kind they have in convenience stores to record robberies .
But then I thought what if the power went out and the camera stopped working and a screener thief got in during the power blackout ?
So it came to me that in those situations I could really use a good guard dog .
A really good German shepherd guard dog that is already trained and would kill or seriously maim a screener thief .
Such a dog costs about $ 7000.00 ( seven - thousand dollars ) .
The dog itself is n’t that expensive but the training is , and to complicate things the dog understands only German .
So I would have to learn German in order to communicate with my screener dog .
That 's even more expense — for the German lessons .
But then I thought that a dog can get sick or even poisoned or made very drowsy .
I mean what if somebody who knew that I had screeners and knew also about my screener guard dog came to my apartment and broke a window and threw something in , piece of meat , with some dog sleeping stuff on it or even worse , poison ?
Put my screener guard dog to sleep or killed it , broke in and stole my screeners ?
So in addition to the trained German Shepherd I thought about a full security system for my apartment .
A company called ADT is very good I hear so I contacted them and found that their service cost $ 850.00 for starters .
plus the safe they recommended for my screeners .
Yes , I forgot to mention that ADT recommended that I buy a safe and keep my screeners in that safe until I wanted to watch one , return it immediately after watching .
And a good screener - sized safe costs between five and seven - hundred dollars .
So that ’s the cost of a surveillance camera , guard dog , German lessons , a safe , plus ADT , making a total of $ 8730.00 as an initial , screener - security investment plus my Academy dues of $ 250 per year .
And who knows how much yearly maintenance of all that would cost .
Dog food , vet bills .
That ’s a lot of money for us , We live on my actor 's pension and Social Security plus Cathy ’s paycheck .
So I was thinking that maybe I would need to get a job to support screener security and Academy membership .
And it seemed that going back to acting might be a choice , but at my age the only parts open for me are for very sick people or cadavers .
And there are already so many old character actors out there looking for those jobs that I do n’t think that I could make enough money to support screener security and Academy membership , too much competition .
So acting was out .
And anyway we only have one car and Cathy needs it to get to work so it would n’t be available to get me to interviews .
$ 9000.00 for starters plus yearly maintenance .
I just could n’t figure out how to do it .
Even if we moved to a smaller apartment .
Even if took a job managing an apartment building again ; I just could n’t figure how to do it .
And I have reluctantly come to a decision .
So that I wo n't contribute to film piracy by inadvertently allowing one of my screeners to fall into the wrong hands , pirating hands , thereby costing the film industry millions of dollars ( not to mention putting me in prison ) , I will not renew my membership in the Academy .
It makes me sad , but I ’m also happy in a way .
Because without those screeners being delivered to my vulnerable little home , with its multiple and human inefficiencies , I know that it will no longer be possible for me to harm the studios , my industry colleagues and the Academy .
Yes , so by resigning from the Academy I will contribute to saving the film industry , and I have to be happy about that .

NEW YORK / LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Time Warner Inc's TWX.N Warner Bros studio on Friday said it would exclusively release high - definition DVDs in Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T Blu-ray format , dealing a big blow to Toshiba Corp 's 6502 .
T rival HD DVD technology .
Some saw the move as an end to the war that has confused consumers and delayed the development of a multibillion - dollar market .
Warner Bros , Hollywood ’s biggest seller of DVDs , represents about 18 to 20 percent of sales in the United States and was one of the few studios that backed both formats .
“ We expect HD DVD to ‘ die ’ a quick death , versus a prolonged format war , ” Pali Capital analyst Rich Greenfield told investors in a note .
But Toshiba said it was “ quite surprised ” by the move and vowed to fight on .
Blu -ray discs outsold HD DVD by nearly two - to - one in the United States last year , but HD DVD won major allies in August when Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation SKG
Inc said they would go exclusively with the Toshiba technology .
“ I have not seen anyone give up in this fight .
Every time one shoe drops and you think ‘ Oh , it ’s over , ’ the other side comes up with something else , ” said Stephanie Prange , Home Media Magazine editor in chief .
The battle has confused consumers , she confirmed , but many people do n’t see the need for high - definition anyway , she added .
The stakes are particularly high because sales of traditional DVDs last year posted their first significant drop since the disc format debuted in 1997 , according to Adams Media Research .
Total DVD unit sales fell 4.5 percent in 2007 and sales fell 4.8 percent to $ 15.7 billion .
“ The window of opportunity for high - definition DVD could be missed if format confusion continues to linger .
We believe that exclusively distributing in Blu-ray will further the potential for mass market success and ultimately benefit retailers , producers , and most importantly , consumers , ” Warner Bros Chairman and Chief Executive Barry Meyer said in a statement .
News Corp's NWSa .N 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney Co DIS.N , and Lionsgate LGF.N are among studios backing the Blu-ray format .
Viacom Inc's VIAb .N Paramount studios and General Electric 's GE.N NBC Universal release movies in HD DVD format .
In addition , Sony 's PlayStation 3 video game system can play Blu-ray movies while Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox 360 works with HD DVD .
Warner said it would continue releasing in the HD DVD format until the end of May , although those releases would follow the standard DVD and Blu-ray releases .

A man whose common - law marriage to a 14 - year - old girl so outraged state lawmakers that they quickly made such unions illegal has reunited with his young bride following his release from prison .
After a series of humiliations including being charged with child molestation , Willis Rouse said he intends to sue the state for preventing him from leading a normal life with his wife and their 4 - year - old son , Alex .
“ They robbed something from my wife and me , ” Rouse said a few days after he was released from prison .
“ I did n’t get to see my son ’s first steps or hear his first words .
They subjected me with the stigma of being a sex offender , depriving me of the right to provide for my family . ”
Rouse was originally charged with sexual assault by someone in a position of trust .
He later agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of stalking after a judge ruled his common - law marriage was illegal .
Rouse was sentenced in 2005 and was due to be released in 2008 , according to state records .
Through a series of appeals filed by Rouse , the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that such common - law marriages could be legal .
Meeting in an emergency session Sept. 1 , 2006 , the Colorado legislature made it illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to enter into a common - law marriage .
In April , a judge lifted all restrictions placed on Rouse that prevented him from having any contact with his wife , Jaime , who is now 19 – 20 years younger than he is .
For her part , Jaime Rouse said she is relieved she is no longer forbidden from speaking with her husband .
People kept telling her that her marriage was wrong , but she said she knew it was founded in love .
“ They did try to tell me I could find someone else and ( that ) he brainwashed me , ” she said .
“ I told them I love him and that I was going to be with him regardless .
My feelings for him did n’t change . ”
Now , the only leverage authorities have to prevent a reunification of the family is through a custody question involving their child .
Jaime gave birth to Alex when she was 15 , and the state has had custody of him .
Although Jaime Rouse has temporary custody of Alex , the state still controls Willis Rouse ’s access to his son , whom he has never seen .
“ It was rough , ” Jaime Rouse said of being separated from her husband .
“ I went through some hard times raising ( Alex ) myself .
If we made it through all this the last four years , we can make it through anything . ”
She said her father committed suicide because he could n’t take care of her .
She was raising Alex while moving in and out of foster homes and institutions .
Had she written a letter to her husband or called him or tried to visit him , she could have lost custody of her son , she said .
Alex was anxious to see his father , and when he learned where he was , he made up an imaginary friend and said the friend was living with his dad , Jaime Rouse said .
People thought the Rouses ’ relationship was based on sex , but it was founded in friendship , Willis Rouse said .
He said he did n’t set out to fall in love with a 14 - year - old girl .
He met her at his uncle ’s house , and she did n’t act up like a young girl because she grew up fast on the streets , he said .
The two became friends first .
He said he ca n’t explain why he fell in love with her , but he knows what it feels like .
It was n’t about sex ; it was based on sincere affection for her as a person , Willis Rouse said .
“ It stood the test of time even when we were apart , ” he said .
“ How many people can say that ?
I hope people see our relationship for what it is . ”
However , for the time being , Willis Rouse is staying with relatives in Littleton and his wife is living in a Denver apartment aided by welfare .
They meet during the day .
Willis Rouse said his conviction has done permanent damage and that he is appealing the verdict , contending in part that charging him was a violation of his constitutional rights .
“ What they charged me for , every married couple in the world does , ” he said .
“ They did n’t approve of the relationship .
But I followed the law , and they did n’t want to . ”
Willis Rouse said he would like to work as a car salesman but that he is concerned that the stigma of his prison sentence may prevent him from getting a job .
Jaime Rouse , who is unemployed , said she would like to go to college and eventually become a pediatrician .

Barbara Peterson's Nov. 14 article points out how Bush 's Homeland Security is trying to make the case that web sites that publish articles questioning the events of 9/11 are terrorist recruiters .
Given
Bush 's recourse to calling everyone who does n't agree with him a terrorist and combined with his executive order confiscating all the worldly goods of anyone who disagrees with him , Barbara Peterson 's article did n't get the attention it deserves .
The sinister effect of what Bush is doing is that Barbara 's article , this article , and others here on OpEdNews that question the motives of the Bush administration and the events of 9/11 can be determined to be " terrorist recruiters . "
I 'm quoting and paraphrasing from Barbara 's article , but it is well worth repeating .
Here 's the part from her article that makes the connection :
At a Homeland Security sub - committee hearing on terrorism risk assessment where the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth website is presented along with Taliban recruitment sites , training manuals and bomb making techniques , Representative Jane Harmon asked Bruce Hoffman , Chairman of the Rand Corporation in Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency , " So this movement develops them into violent killers ? "
Hoffman stated that , " falsehoods and conspiracy theorists have become so ubiquitous and believed that you almost have some sort of parallel truth , and it has become a very effective tool for recruiting people . "
Barbara points out that Hoffman is talking about A & E for Truth , calling them conspiracy theorists and equating them with the recruiting sites of the Taliban .
If that were true , which it is n't , Bush could determine that that is an act undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq .
Now , here 's the scary part that ties it all together .
Bush 's Executive Order of July 17 , 2007 , stripped down to its meaning :
" All property and interests in property of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred , paid , exported , withdrawn or otherwise dealt in , detemined by the Secretary of the Treasury , to pose a significant risk of committing an act undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq . "
Does questioning what happened on 9/11 pose a risk of undermining efforts in Iraq ?
That 's not for us to determine , that 's strictly up to Bush and his Treasury Secretary .
We have no say in the matter , but if Bush takes it into his head that we might , could , maybe , possibly pose a risk , we lose everything we have .
All we have to do is ask , " Is that the way it happened ? "
Notice the lack of subtlety used by lumping professional architects and engineers in with Taliban terrorists .
Bush is trying to get a handle on a way to shut down anyone who questions what happened on 9/11 , starting with the web sites that have the most authoritative , professional people , the ones most likely to get at the truth .
He 's afraid if they keep it up , the truth just might come out .
Bush has given it away , here .
By trying to prevent the truth from coming out , by not wanting the truth exposed , he 's just making it more obvious that the truth can hurt him .
That 's what he 's trying to hide .
By applying qui bono , who benefits , to this thing , we can draw some obvious conclusions .
Five months after Bush took office , he was dragging along with a dismal 50 % approval rating , and he had n't even done anything .
There was nothing to approve or disapprove of but the nonentity , Bush , himself .
He was nothing going nowhere .
Right after 9/11 , his approval rating shot up to a phenomenal 90 % and he had just about the whole country kissing his ass , getting everything he wanted .
And , he became what he always wanted to be , a self - described " War President , " using 9/11 as the basis of his lies to create his own , personal war .
The events of 9/11 benefited George Bush enormously , more than any other man .
And , he 's going to use his executive order to confiscate everything we have to keep us from asking how that came about .
The Presidential discourse has shifted recently from the war and healthcare to the economy , which seems to benefit the GOP 's tax cut position .
However the federal government 's capacity to affect the economy is limited compared to private market forces .
Of course there are good arguments both ways as to the degree of impact government policy plays in avoiding recession , but by engaging in these arguments we shift our attention away from the roles government is designed to fill .
The President 's ability to change foreign policy is undeniable .
Recently Mitt Romney dismissed Ron Paul 's warning against acting over - aggressively toward Iran following the speedboat incident by saying , “ I think Congressman Paul should not be reading as many of Ahmadinejad 's press releases . ”
It is odd that the media and the Republican Party in general find this to be an acceptable response , and no attention has been given to Romney 's inablility to address the issue in the weeks since the debate .
Well , that is not entirely accurate .
The progressive and highly democratic blog , crooksandliars.com , took notice of Romney 's cop-out .
Even though the website leans toward Edwards , they give a surprise compliment to Paul 's ability to calmly and rationally analyze the situation .
Ron Paul understands that foreign policy involves more than an aggressive military , and he takes the time to understand what other nations are communicating .
We all saw Reagan and Rumsfeld shake Sadaam Hussein's hand , yet the Bush Whitehouse was able to vilify him in the eyes of Americans .
This is problematic to say the least .
“ Yee - haw ! ” is not a foreign policy .
This switch to the economy in the coverage of the Presidential primaries is providing a distraction from the foreign policy debate and allowing candidates like Romney , and of course Giuliani , to get away with their intellectual absenteeism regarding the role of the Presidency .
Furthermore , it is obvious that our foreign policy is in no way benefiting the economy .
There are only a select group of people getting rich in the last eight years – the oil companies and the military - industrial complex .
Hundreds of bureaucrats from the Department of Homeland Security and other “ terror protection agencies ” have taken lucrative jobs in the private sector with companies that produce the bombs and rebuild the bridges ( with our tax dollars . )
The war is a gaping money pit draining the economy .
So by letting the candidates appear on FOXnews ( and also during the Fox coverage of the Super Bowl !!! ) and talk about tax cuts , the media is effectively distracting voters from the real issues at hand .
Issues which require knowledge not only of the economy , but also knowledge of Ahmadinejad 's press releases .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Problems in housing , the financial markets and the first job decline in four years all played a role in the Federal Reserve making an aggressive rate cut Tuesday .
But it has also raised talk about a recession - and whether the Fed is able to prevent one .
The Fed , citing the growing risk to continued economic growth , cut the benchmark fed funds rate by half a percent Tuesday , a bigger cut than many economists had forecast .
It was the biggest cut since a half - point cut in November 2002 , and the first rate cut of any kind since June 2003 .
It 's not clear how much Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will be able to do if the U.S. economy does start to slide toward recession .
While most economists still do n't believe the nation will fall into a recession , there is general agreement that the economy now faces a greater risk than there was only a month or two ago .
But many economists also say that the Fed can do little at this point to address many of the factors threatening continued economic growth .
Some economists even argue that rate cuts could make matters worse .
The mortgage market would seem to be where the Fed could have the most effect .
Most directly , a rate cut will reduce the rates for adjustable rate mortgages , one type of loan that has caused the problems for lenders and subprime borrowers , those with less - than - perfect credit .
An estimated 2 million homeowners face sharply higher mortgage payments when their current loans reset over the next year .
So a Fed rate cut could possibly stave off a wave of foreclosures .
That 's key since more foreclosures could have the potential to hurt consumer spending as a whole , said David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor's .
" About 1 or 2 percent of the population is going to be seriously affected by these resets .
That 's not trivial , " said Wyss .
" One thing a Fed rate cut will do is reduce that reset shock fairly quickly . "
But others say even a series of rate cuts wo n't solve the problem for those who have been paying low teaser rates on their mortgages with the expectations that they would be able to refinance before rates reset .
The fact that investors no longer are willing to buy securities backed by such non-traditional mortgages could make it impossible for hundreds of thousands of those homeowners to refinance .
" A rate cut even down to zero percent does n't make those attractive investments , " said Edward Leamer , director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast , which now puts the chance of recession at about 30 to 35 percent .
" The Fed is in the situation where they should not be thinking about saving housing .
They should be thinking about isolating the problem strictly to the housing sector . "
The mortgage problems have clearly led to a broader credit crunch in financial markets , which has already put a crimp on the financing of some proposed mergers .
The Fed 's statement Tuesday mentioned the risk to the economy from that market turmoil as a motivation for the cut .
" Today 's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time , " the statementread .
While rate cuts may help get those markets functioning more fluidly once again , there is debate among economists about how great a risk the credit crunch poses to the overall economy .
" It 's pretty hard to draw strong lines between the credit crunch on Wall Street and the economy , except in real estate , " said David Kelly , economic adviser for Putnam Investments .
" If there are some deals delayed , it 's not a problem for real economic activity .
In fact , usually mergers and acquisitions cost jobs .
They do n't create jobs , except with Wall Street firms .
Outside New York , there should n't be much impact . "
But Gus Faucher , director of macroeconomics for Moody 's Economy.com , said that getting the credit markets working again is important for business confidence , which is a key driver in decisions by companies whether to hire new workers and invest in plants and equipment .
" Businesses are still sitting on a ton of cash .
The question is if they are going to go out and use that , " he said .
And he believes this is an area where a Fed rate cut can have the most positive effect .
" They need to know if the Fed is on the job and ready to respond , " he said .
But Putnam 's Kelly said if markets start to assume that Tuesday 's cut was the first of a series of many , it could put some needed spending by businesses and consumers on hold , as they wait to see how low the rates will fall , and how much the economy is going to slow down .
" I do n't think they signaled that there will be more cuts ; I do n't think they know what they 'll do at the next meeting , " said Kelly .
He added that he believes the Fed did its best to signal that future cuts are not certain .
" But there will be economists out there predicting this is the first of a series of cuts , " he said .
" If people believe that , it gives them reasons to have doubts about the economy and a reason to wait to make investment decisions .
If you 're trying to pick up a house at a bargain , will you do it now or wait six months ?
You 'll wait six months . "
Another risk to the economy would be a drop in foreign investment here , according to some economists .
And a Fed rate cut might cause more problems than it fixes because lower rates would make some U.S. investments , such as government - issued Treasurys , less attractive to foreigners .
Leamer and Wyss said a steeper drop in foreign investment would be a big problem for the economy because that flow of funds has been key to keeping long - term rates low .
" Last year we had $ 1 trillion come in net foreign investment , most of it into the bond market , and most into private bonds , not Treasurys , " said Wyss .
" If that money stops coming in , that 's going to be a big increase in borrowing costs . "
A sharp drop in foreign investment would also feed into the slide in the value of the dollar .
While that would make U.S. exports more competitive , it also would likely raise the price of imported goods and hurt the spending power of U.S. consumers , who have come to count on low - price imports for everything from food to clothes to cars .
Wyss and Leamer say they 're not predicting a sharp drop in foreign investment , but that it is a concern .
And economists say there 's relatively little the Fed can do to keep investors from outside the United States from pulling back on U.S. assets if it is cutting rates .
" The Fed has to make its primary concern what is happening to the domestic economy , " said Wyss .
" You ca n't focus on the dollar . "
The Fed also has little ability to affect another risk to the economy : high oil prices .
Crude oil prices hit $ 80 a barrel for the first time Sept. 12 , and hit record - high closes both Monday and Tuesday .
While the economy has kept growing with oil in the $ 60s and $ 70s , economists say rising prices are a bigger risk now given how vulnerable the economy is .
High oil and gas prices would be just one more thing for an already nervous consumer to worry about .
" I think if this lasts for two to three months , it 's going to be a problem , " said Faucher about oil prices .
" If this was happening when the economy was going great guns , I would n't be as concerned .
But more than just the costs , this can affect consumer psychology .
If it shows up at the pump , then we 've got some problems . "
WASHINGTON , Jan 22 ( Reuters ) -
The following is the text of a statement released by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday :
“ The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3 - 1/ 2 percent .
The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth .
While strains in short - term funding markets have eased somewhat , broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households .
Moreover , incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets .
The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters , but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully .
Appreciable downside risks to growth remain .
The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks .
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were : Ben S. Bernanke , Chairman ; Timothy F. Geithner , Vice Chairman ; Charles L. Evans ; Thomas M. Hoenig ; Donald L. Kohn ; Randall S. Kroszner ; Eric S. Rosengren ; and Kevin M. Warsh .
Voting against was William Poole , who did not believe that current conditions justified policy action before the regularly scheduled meeting next week .
Absent and not voting was Frederic S. Mishkin .
In a related action , the Board of Governors approved a 75 - basis - point decrease in the discount rate to 4 percent .
In taking this action , the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Minneapolis . ”
( CNN ) -- Red Cross President and CEO Mark W. Everson has stepped down after revelations he was " engaged in a personal relationship with a subordinate employee , " the organization announced Tuesday .
Mark W. Everson says he is leaving his post , effective immediately , for " personal and family reasons . "
The Red Cross Board of Governors asked for and received Everson 's resignation after it " concluded that the situation reflected poor judgment on Mr. Everson 's part and diminished his ability to lead the organization in the future , " the Red Cross said in a statement on its Web site .
Everson , 53 , said in a written statement that he was leaving the $ 500,000 - per - year job " for personal and family reasons , and deeply regret it is impossible for me to continue in a job so recently undertaken . "
Everson -- who is married and has two children -- joined the Red Cross as president and CEO last May .
The organization became aware of Everson 's relationship with a female Red Cross employee 10 days ago , Chief Public Affairs Officer Suzy C. DeFrancis told CNN in a telephone interview .
" I think the board acted very quickly , " she said , adding that the woman remains in her job .
About Everson , DeFrancis said , " We 're grateful for his service . "
The board of governors on Tuesday appointed Mary S. Elcano , general counsel and five - year Red Cross employee , as interim president and CEO .
Everson had worked in the Bush administration from August 2001 -- including serving as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service -- until he was hired by the Red Cross .
" This is flabbergasting , that 's all I can say .
It 's completely contrary to his public persona that he evidenced while he was at the IRS , " said Suzanne Ross McDowell , a Washington - based attorney who served on an advisory committee to the IRS division that deals with tax - exempt organizations .
" From the standpoint of exempt organizations on the non- profit sector , it 's just another news story that we would rather not see , " she said .
" It 's got nothing to do with the Red Cross , " said Ira Milstein , a New York lawyer specializing in corporate governance who has worked with the organization and was impressed with Everson .
" He was a team player and a good leader .
To have him fall off a cliff like this is just sad . "
A search committee has been formed to begin the process of finding Everson 's permanent replacement , the organization said .
The job has been a challenging one .
Marsha J. Evans resigned as president in 2005 , after the Red Cross response to Hurricane Katrina came under fire .
Four years earlier , Bernadine Healy quit the post after the organization was criticized for mishandling donations intended for victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks and collecting vast quantities of blood that was not needed and ultimately thrown out .
Healy told reporters she " had no choice " about her resignation .
Meanwhile , DeFrancis acknowledged Tuesday that , 14 years after a court ordered the agency to improve its collection of blood , it has yet to meet federal safety and quality - control requirements .

CPS : Mother leaves 8 kids to wed in Africa CPS : Harris County mother leaves brood to wed in Africa
A Harris County woman could face child endangerment charges after allegedly leaving eight children home alone while she traveled to Africa to marry a man she met on the Internet , authorities said Thursday .
Charges are pending against the woman , whose name was withheld Thursday .
She reportedly flew to Nigeria on Monday , leaving the children with little food and no money .
Veteran Harris County authorities said the children 's case is one of the saddest they 've seen .
" It 's just terrible , " said Lt. John Martin of the Harris County Sheriff 's Office .
A deputy making a welfare check at a home in the 11000 block of Barker Grove Lane in Cypress about 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday found six children between the ages of 1 and 9 alone inside , Martin said .
" At first the children would not answer the door , but the deputy managed to persuade them to let him in , " he said .
" What he found inside the house was just deplorable conditions .
There was trash everywhere , roaches everywhere .
He said every item of clothing in the house was dirty and there was very little food . "
The children told the deputy their mother had left several days ago and they did n't know how to reach her , Martin said .
" The children were given no way to contact the mother , even if there was some kind of emergency , " he said .
Later on Wednesday night a 15 - year - old girl arrived at the house and told authorities her mother had flown to Nigeria on New Year 's Eve .
The teen said her mother left her in charge of four siblings — a 1 - year - old boy , a 7 - year - old boy , an 8 - year - old girl and a 9 - year - old boy , said Estella Olguin , a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services .
The teen was also caring for a neighbor 's 3 - year - old boy and 4 - year - old girl , Olguin said .
Investigators spoke with the neighbor , who said he regularly left his two toddlers at the woman 's house while he worked .
The man said he did n't know the conditions inside the home were so bad , Olguin said .
The neighbor , who authorities did not identify , told investigators he had driven the woman to the airport for a one - to two - month trip to Africa , where she planned to marry a man she 'd met online .
The neighbor said the woman had told him that her sister was due to arrive by bus from New Orleans to look after the children .
The sister , however , had not arrived by the time deputies discovered the children alone three days later , Olguin said .
Investigators are in the process of contacting the sister and other relatives to confirm the story and find out what happened , she said .
CPS is also investigating the neighbor , Olguin said .
Meanwhile , the children have been placed in foster homes , she said .
The children 's situation first came to authorities ' attention after the 15 - year - old crashed her mother 's van into the garage on Monday , Olguin said .
The teen called a volunteer child advocate , terrified .
" She wanted to run away because she was afraid how her mother was going to react , " Olguin said .
She said the teen was simply overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for so many other children .
" There was no food in the home and mom did n't leave them any money , " Olguin said .
" The 15 - year - old said she had to steal food and diapers . "
The burden of caring for the others fell on the teenager because her older sister , who is 16 , spends most of her time out of the house with friends and her 14 - year - old and 18 - year - old brothers are serving time in juvenile detention and prison for robbery and aggravated assault , respectively , Olguin said .
The family apparently evacuated to LaPorte from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and then evacuated to Houston from LaPorte after Hurricane Rita , she said .
Hungry and scared , the children are otherwise healthy , Olguin said , although the 1 - year - old baby appeared to be malnourished .
" They 're little survivors , " she said .
Burt and Stasia Venecia were walking by the home where the children lived Thursday night , shocked by the damage to the garage door and the news that children in their neighborhood were neglected .
" You work hard and move to a nice neighborhood and never in a million years think that this will happen down the street , " Burt Venecia said .
Another neighbor , who asked not to be identified , said he is n't surprised to learn that the children next door were left alone for days .
The family , who moved from Louisiana to Texas after Hurricane Katrina , have had problems , he added .
" But it 's not the kids ' fault .
I still can't believe that we were throwing out food next door at our house and they had no food , " he said .
" I hope they 're in a better place , " he said .
" They do n't stand a chance at a good life in that home . "

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
it ’s easy to see why a local newspaper editor could fall in love with Stacey N. Getz :
She ’s a summa cum laude Florida State graduate , a twentysomething public - relations executive with the gift of gab and the face of a sorority president .
When the Tallahassee Democrat combed the community in early 2007 for residents whose blogs and articles could fill out the paper ’s local coverage , Getz , a new - media whiz , was one of the first to jump aboard .
Getz ’s Let ’s Talk Tallahassee blog is a paean to civic boosterism , inviting readers to submit ideas to help business leaders and developers improve the city .
“ I ’ve found plenty of great reasons to live here .
But I ’m still not completely satisfied , ” Getz wrote , “ so I ’m asking you for help . ”
Her blog was so successful that the Gannett - owned Democrat ( a newspaper I once worked for ) “ reverse published ” many of its posts — along with Getz ’s photo , in color , whenever possible — as articles in its metro section .
One of Getz ’s topics was the city ’s ambitious plan to convert its downtown area into an arts district , which hit resistance when the Democrat reported that city officials were entertaining a proposal to erect a Wal - Mart there .
“ I do n’t know what it is about that place , but the mere mention of the name turns some otherwise reasonable people into illogical lunatics , ” she wrote in a blog post that the Democrat reprinted .
“ At least take a moment to consider the city ’s line of thought . ”
It was n’t the first time Getz had urged readers to calmly consider the pluses of urban development .
But this time she was asking them to give a fair shake to a former client .
According to the website of CoreMessage , the PR firm she works for , the young executive led an “ award - winning legislative , grassroots and media campaign ” for the big - box corporation in 2005 , spearheading an effort to repeal Florida ’s fuel - price controls so that Wal - Mart could undercut local gas -station prices .
Neither she nor the Democrat disclosed this .
Getz still sees no conflict of interest .
“ We ’re kind of off and on with them , ” she told me of her firm ’s relationship with the chain .
When she blogged about the downtown plan , “ at that point , we were n’t working with Wal - Mart , and I was n’t being paid to talk about them or put them in a positive light . ”
As newspapers ’ circulation numbers and ad revenues free - fall , their executives have decided that publications must go “ hyper- local ” and online , and they ’ve enlisted the help of amateurs such as Getz to do it .
But as her Wal - Mart plug shows , the newspaper industry ’s embrace of “ citizen journalism ” has a downside .
Reader - submitted content rarely gets vetted by editors .
In the same month as Getz ’s Wal - Mart post , the Democrat published a story by a retirement home ’s development director about the complex ’s great new golf course — without disclosing her job — and a woman wrote an article about a boy who ’d organized a cancer charity event without noting that she ’s his mom .
This may sound like small - time stuff , but it exemplifies the self - defeating side effects of newspapers ’ new strategy for survival .
Call it the second phase of the usa Today - ification of the press ; after all , the media empire that gave us the McPaper is now setting newspapers ’ online agenda .
“ Gannett is about local , local content , ” declared Chairman Craig Dubow shortly after taking control of usa Today ‘s parent company in 2006 .
The company ’s 85 dailies have since doubled the amount of local news in their pages .
Content has become “ platform agnostic ” — making print and online versions interchangeable .
The chain ’s newsrooms were rechristened “ information centers ” and reporters became “ mojos ” — mobile journalists who shoot their own photos and videos ( badly , it turns out ) and post them to the web without editing .
Long - form and investigative stories were replaced by short , searchable bursts of information .
The corollary of the shorter - faster - more plan was crowdsourcing : enlisting unpaid citizen journalists like Getz to fill the local - content hole .
The Tallahassee Democrat ‘s website now features reader - written blogs on topics ranging from Florida State football rumors to “ trashology ” — ruminations on poor , white , rural living authored by one “ Miss Trashahassee . ”
The print edition now includes a smorgasbord of reader - submitted content such as “ HomeRoom , ” a page of school news generated by parents and school administrators .
Rather than freeing up time for reporters to cover important stories , the new model often means simply laying off salaried pros and putting the squeeze on whoever survives the cuts .
As Ryan Sholin , a new - media blogger , writes , “ It ’s hard for lifelong newsroom types to see layoffs one day and reader participation initiatives the next and not feel a bit slighted . ”
The wave of journalistic outsourcing has some new - media advocates hailing the death of the “ fortress newsroom ” mentality and touting the beginning of an era where newspapers not only listen to their readers but invite them into the inner sanctum .
“ In fortress newsroom , readers are something of a necessary inconvenience .
We need their business , but not their ideas , ” writes Steve Smith , editor of Spokane ’s Spokesman - Review .
Smith and other citizen - journalism boosters are fond of repeating the mantra of Dan Gillmor , author of We the Media : Grassroots Journalism by the People , for the People and the director of the Center for Citizen Media : “ Our readers know more than we do . ”
But if the elitist fortress - newsroom mentality held John Q. Public at arm ’s length , it also kept PR flacks and unqualified hacks out of the newsroom .
By forcing their beleaguered staffs to depend on outsiders for content , then running the content without much editorial oversight , newspapers may be taken in by crackpots and sly marketers who make Jayson Blair look like a grade - school plagiarist .
Lobbyists and spin doctors have already taken notice of the new model .
Take the South Dakota Politics and Daschle V. Thune blogs , which influenced the Gannett - owned Sioux Falls Argus Leader ‘s coverage of the state ’s 2004 United States Senate race ; eventually , the bloggers were found to be on the payroll of just - elected Republican Senator John Thune .
“ Got a story you ca n’t convince a mainstream reporter to run ? ” wrote Chris Suellentrop in Slate .
“ Leak it anonymously to a blog on your payroll .
Then get a local reporter to write a story on the controversial , gossipy , local political blog .
Soon everyone in town will be talking about the story you leaked to the blog… .
And no one will know that the blog post was a paid placement until after the election . ”
But why bother with costly Astroturf blogs when it ’s never been easier to get the instant aura of legitimacy that comes from getting your story printed in a newspaper — or on its website ?
Of course , that aura of legitimacy is diminished as newspapers replace reported news with unmediated — and sometimes unreliable — information .
Craig Newmark , Craigslist founder and a news junkie , has expressed his concern about the “ increasing disinformation ” in citizen journalism .
“ The problem is that with blogging , the model is publish first , maybe fact - check later , ” he told pbs ‘s Frontline in 2006 .
“ In newspapers , the model is you fact - check first and then publish .
But those models are merging . ”
New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen says that newspapers should be more diligent in fact - checking their blogs .
But Rosen ( a proponent of journalistic crowdsourcing with whom I tangled over Mother Jones ‘ July / August 2007 package , “ Politics 2.0 ” ) and other advocates of Journalism 2.0 say newspaper professionals must embrace new media ’s open participation and freewheeling discourse .
Doc Searls , a programmer and new - media writer based at the University of California - Santa Barbara , agrees .
“ The key challenge is to reframe the newspaper business as one that happens in a wide - open , networked world , ” he says , “ not as a print business that happens to do some stuff on the web . ”
Rosen says the critics of Gannett - style crowdsourcing are out of touch .
As he told me , “ The curmudgeon class has its answer : Bitch about it ! ”
Cut me a slice of curmudgeon pie , please .
If you could convince me that crowdsourcing and mojos and information centers were n’t about cost cutting or lazy journalism , I ’d be all for them .
The blogosphere and the 24/7 news cycle are realities , and editors and reporters have a lot of ink - stained baggage to dump if they want to thrive in the new - media world .
But that does n’t mean that bean - counting publishers must recruit mercenary bloggers or convert their cub reporters into untrained , overworked , self - editing news tickers .
The only thing newspapers still have going for them is their reputation for telling the truth , going deep , and reporting good stories .
Bring on enough Stacey Getzes and you ’ll destroy the brand name newspapers have built up over the last century even faster than the Internet can do it on its own .
This brave new world requires more work by newspaper publishers and editors , not less .
There ’s a place for reader blogs and community participation in the 21st - century newspaper , but let ’s not kid ourselves that they are a substitute for what people look for in their morning paper .
As Stacey Getz readily admits about her blog , “ This is not true journalism . ”
In the pursuit of an elusive enemy the US loosely labels AQI ( Al Qaeda in Iraq ) , US Green Berets and soldiers in this remote corner of Iraq have enlisted the help of a new ally that they have christened LRF , the " Legitimate Resistance Force . "
It includes ex-insurgents , police dropouts with checkered backgrounds , and former Al Qaeda - linked fighters – all united by a desire to rid Diyala Province of the network 's influence , say US officers .
" A lot of them are former Al Qaeda operatives ... but when they saw the stealing , murder , and terrorism , they realized it was not the way forward for Iraq , " says Maj .
John Woodward of San Antonio .
But the risks of such a temporary solution are high , say critics , and the plan could foster new , powerful militias outside the control of the Iraqi Army .
It 's a strategy that also threatens to further fuel sectarian battles as LRFs are largely Sunni , posing a major threat to Shiite militias .
So far , however , it is too early to judge the effectiveness of this new group , but its creation clearly demonstrates a desire by the US to look for grass - roots solutions amid increasing frustration with the combat readiness – and even loyalty – of Iraqi forces .
It also seems to indicate that the Americans are willing to take a short - term gamble on the LRFs in order to show some successes in the fight against AQI before September , when a highly anticipated progress report on Iraq is due to Congress .
The idea for LRFs was born out of the links US troops have sought to foster with Iraqi tribal leaders in Diyala Province as part of the US - led offensive " Arrowhead Ripper , " which has been under way here for about a month .
But the LRF initiative has little in common with the high - profile tribal Anbar Salvation Council , which was formally endorsed by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and helped reduce violence there .
Mr. Maliki has backed a Diyala version of that group called the Isnad ( support ) Council , but it has had much less impact due to the more fragmented nature of Diyala 's tribal , ethnic , and sectarian makeup .
Maliki warned US forces last month against creating new militias in their fight against Al Qaeda - linked operatives .
He insisted that all collaboration with local groups must be done through his government .
" What the Americans are doing is very risky and unwise .
They are planting the seeds for future wars , " warned Sami al - Askari , a parliamentarian close to Maliki , commenting on groups like the LRF .
After a raid , holding the ground
Early last week , the US bombed suspected AQI hideouts and several bridges over the Diyala River that were said to be used by the militants in the farmlands of Sherween , about 35 miles northeast of Baquba .
On the ground , about 200 Iraqi and US soldiers along with members of the LRF clashed with militants in Rabie Najem , a Sherween - area village .
The US military said it killed 20 " Al Qaeda terrorists " and detained 20 in the operation , which it qualified as a success .
" It 's very important that we go back and take control of our area .
After [ the US military ] helped us , we need to hold the terrain .
I have 40 of my guys waiting for me , " says Najem Abdullah , one of the LRF members , in an interview at the US base Normandy the day after the bombing raid .
Mr. Abdullah and three of his comrades , all Sunnis from the Jubour tribe , were brought back to the base after the operation to talk to a US special forces team , which is charged with vetting them and supplying them with ammunition , according to officers in the 6th Squadron of the US Army 's 9th Cavalry Regiment stationed at Normandy .
Mr. Abdullah is a former policeman and said he once collaborated with insurgent groups like the 1920 Revolution Brigades , one of the earliest Sunni Arab insurgent groups that fought US presence after the invasion .
His friend Mazen Hamid is also a former Iraqi police officer and said that several of his relatives have joined the ranks of the Al Qaeda - linked militants and that they were being paid about $ 300 per operation .
" This is a lot of money for people in our villages who are groveling from poverty , " says Raad Abed , another member of the group .
They described how the Al Qaeda - linked fighters , many of them masked and clad in black and wearing headbands bearing the words " Islamic State in Iraq , " raided several villages in Sherween 10 days ago , blowing up homes and killing anyone associated with the government .
The militants extorted about $ 3,000 from one wealthy local sheikh and took over mosques broadcasting over loud speakers : " Long live the Islamic State in Iraq , " according to Mr. Hamid .
Most of them were indigenous fighters with a few Arab nationals among them , says Hamid .
This matched the assessment of several US Army officers in the area .
Hamid said that out of an original population of about 400 only 40 men from Rabie Najem are left .
His own wife fled farther north , and he might join her soon if the campaign to reclaim their village fails .
Last week , neither he nor his 40 LRF comrades were able to return to their village .
It is now in the grips of AQI militants , who even rebuilt , within hours , all the footbridges destroyed by the US aerial bombardment just two days before , according to Col.
Mahmoud Tayeh , the police chief in the Sherween area 's main town , Dalli Abbas .
Fear of the militants has also crept up to Dalli Abbas itself .
Nearly 100 of the 180 policemen in town quit after the mutilated body of one of their colleagues was found outside the station .
Attached to it was a succinct handwritten message : " Quit or you 're next . "
Colonel Tayeh says that the fleeing policemen took with them AK - 47s and pistols , and added that " some of them were coerced to join the terrorists . "
The remaining policemen slept at the station .
When they ventured out to the town 's potholed and garbage - littered streets , they wore black ski masks for fear of being identified by militants .
And , in a further twist , some of these same holdouts are suspected of being on the payroll of Al Qaeda militants , says Tayeh .
Temporary friends
These ever - shifting allegiances and the fine line between friend and foe provide a hint of the dangers associated with this new US strategy despite its short - term viability .
" The long - term problem is that you are working with fractured social forces , " says Toby Dodge , an Iraq expert at Queen Mary , University of London .
" The danger is that once they run Al Qaeda out , they may turn on you , the Iraqi government , or both . "
Lt. Col. Keith Gogas , who commands the Diyala - based 6 - 9 Army unit , agrees with the concept of the LRF , but says he thinks the term itself may be problematic .
He 's working to cement local ties in other creative ways .
Last Friday , he reunited a local tribal sheikh with his nephew , whom he helped get released from a US - run prison after the man had been detained for nearly 10 months on suspicion of being a member of the Shiite Mahdi Army militia and committing crimes against Sunnis in Diyala .
" You see how loyal and truthful the Americans are , " says Sheikh Saad al - Siriwati to his kinsmen as he puts his arm around Colonel Gogas .
" My tribe and I are eternally indebted to Gogas . "
Abu Saida , the predominantly Shiite town of Shiekh Saad , has come a long way from being one of the most violent in Diyala to the most cooperative with US forces in the fight against extremists .
But just as the line between friend and foe is murky so , too , is the division between war and peace .
As Gogas and his men returned to their base , they encountered Iraqi policemen on the road who reported an attack on the mixed village of Harbitla in which 12 Shiites were killed .
Separately , the commander of the Iraqi Army battalion who the Americans had been working with was killed by a roadside bomb .

Mr Putin 's party said the result showed he was " national leader "
Only two other pro-Kremlin parties and the opposition Communists appear to have got sufficient votes to pass the threshold needed for seats in the Duma .
United Russia said the result showed Russians supported Mr Putin 's course .
The US has urged Moscow to investigate claims of voting irregularities by opposition leaders and the OSCE .
United Russia has admitted there were some irregularities on Sunday , but said they were not significant enough to affect the result .
Mr Putin has said a strong result would give him the authority to retain political power after his presidential term ends next year , possibly as prime minister .
With nearly 98 % of ballots counted , the Central Election Commission announced on Monday morning that United Russia was leading with 64.1 % , while the opposition Communists trailed with 11.6 % .
Only two other parties - the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and A Fair Russia , which are allied to United Russia - are on track to clear the 7 % threshold required to qualify for seats .
National leader
The result would mean pro-Kremlin parties would have the two - thirds majority in the Duma required to able to amend the constitution .
Yabloko , the standard - bearer of the liberal left in the country , was a distant sixth with only 1.6 % of the vote .
The election commission said the turnout amongst Russia 's 109 m voters had been 63 % , up from 56 % in the last parliamentary election four years ago .
United Russia 's leader , parliamentary speaker Boris Gryzlov , hailed the result as a signal from Russian voters that they wanted President Putin to retain influence and his policies to be maintained even after he leaves office in 2008 .
" The vote affirmed the main idea - that Vladimir Putin is the national leader , that the people support his course , and this course will continue , " he said after the results of exit polls were announced on Sunday .
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the result was " extremely important from the point of view of continuation ... of the reforms started in the last eight years " .
Mr Putin is constitutionally obliged to stand down after his second term as president ends in March next year .
Mr Peskov said Mr Putin planned to " transfer his presidency to another man " following the presidential election in March , while United Russia announced it would nominate its candidate for the post at a party congress on 17 December .
The BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow says United Russia 's landslide win on Sunday will enable Mr Putin to continue wielding great influence in politics - even if he is no longer in high office .
The executive branch acted as though it practically elected the parliament
Kimmo Kiljunen
Deputy Head , OSCE Parliamentary Assembly
However opponents have been crying foul .
The Communists and several smaller opposition parties have said they will mount a legal challenge in the Supreme Court .
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the election had been the " most irresponsible and dirty " in the post - Soviet era and warned that the new parliament would be a " subsidiary of the Kremlin , a rubber - stamp factory " .
The election also came under strong criticism from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) .
Reports of fraud
" The executive branch acted as though it practically elected the parliament , " the OSCE 's Kimmo Kiljunen told the Moscow Echo radio station .
The OSCE abandoned its plans to send a big team of election observers , accusing Moscow of imposing curbs and delaying visas .
Russia denied the claims .
The independent Russian monitoring group Golos said violations had amounted to " an organised campaign " .
Turnout at the election is believed to have been very high
Spokeswoman Tatyana Bogdanova said observers had reported cases where state employees and students had been pressured to vote .
The White House urged Russian authorities to investigate the reports of fraud .
However , the chairman of the Central Election Commission , Vladimir Churov , told Russian television he knew of " no serious violations in the course of polling day " .
Mr Gryzlov also acknowledged there had been violations but dismissed them as insignificant .
The election also appears to have delivered a parliamentary seat to Andrei Lugovoi , the man the UK wants to put on trial for the murder of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko .
He has denied the charge , but status as a member of parliament for the Liberal Democratic Party would bring with it immunity from prosecution in Russia .
Mike Huckabee wants to amend the Constitution to prevent children born in the U.S. to illegal aliens from automatically becoming American citizens , according to his top immigration surrogate — a radical step no other major presidential candidate has embraced .
Mr. Huckabee , who won last week ’s Republican Iowa caucuses , promised Minuteman Project founder James Gilchrist that he would force a test case to the Supreme Court to challenge birthright citizenship , and would push Congress to pass a 28th Amendment to the Constitution to remove any doubt .
The former Arkansas governor thinks the case against U.S. Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean was railroaded , Mr. Gilchrist said .
Ramos and Compean are serving lengthy prison sentences for shooting a fleeing drug - smuggling suspect in the buttocks .
Another slight for Ron Paul ?
Comment here
“ I would make it my first act as president to pardon agents Ramos and Compean , ” Mr. Gilchrist said Mr. Huckabee told him .
“ I regret that they have spent yet another Christmas locked up in a windowless cell like animals and unable to be free and with their families . ”
Mr. Gilchrist , who campaigned with Mr. Huckabee in Iowa last week , said Mr. Huckabee explained his positions in a half - hour conversation on the campaign trail .
“ I read back my notes to him twice and I told him I did not want to put words in his mouth , ” said Mr. Gilchrist , who also issued a press release from the Minuteman Project detailing Mr. Huckabee ’s positions .
“ The guy looked me right in the eye . ”
Campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Fedewa said Mr. Huckabee intends to review the case against Ramos and Compean as one of his first acts as president , but she did n’t otherwise dispute Mr. Gilchrist ’s quotes as provided by The Washington Times .
Miss Fedewa said Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Gilchrest are “ united by a mutual desire to end illegal immigration and are political allies toward that end . ”
Mr. Huckabee has defended his policies on illegal aliens while he was Arkansas governor .
He pressed for illegal aliens to gain college tuition benefits , complained about federal immigration raids in his state and declined to have state police enforce immigration laws , although the state legislature gave him the authority to do so .
Mr. Huckabee now has adopted one of the strictest immigration platforms of any campaign .
He has proposed a policy requiring all illegal aliens to return home and apply for immigration through legal channels .
His new position on birthright citizenship also puts him alone among the candidates .
Many legal scholars say the 14th Amendment , which says “ all persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States , ” grants automatic citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. , except in diplomatic cases .
Members of Congress have never tried to change birthright citizenship by law .
Mr. Huckabee told Mr. Gilchrist that he supports a Supreme Court test case but also would encourage Congress to introduce a constitutional amendment to exclude from automatic citizenship any children born to illegal aliens .
Mr. Gilchrist endorsed Mr. Huckabee last month and has campaigned with him ever since .
Mr. Gilchrist said Mr. Huckabee is the best candidate on the immigration issue still in the race and who has a chance of being the presidential nominee .
Others calling for stricter immigration policy have accused Mr. Gilchrist of opportunism and backing a bad candidate .
Brook Young , who runs ImmigrationWatchdog.com , produced a Web video criticizing Mr. Gilchrist ’s endorsement .
Mr. Gilchrist fired back last week with an e-mail that appeared to threaten to publicly accuse the man of being a pedophile .
“ I have been hearing on the blogs , over the telephone and through e-mails that you are a pedophile , Brook .
Will that accusation also reach the news media soon ? ” Mr. Gilchrist wrote .
“ If the blogs and e-mails say so , then are n’t you guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt ? ”
Mr. Young posted the e-mail on his Web site and said he had to go public because Mr. Gilchrist has exceeded the bounds of the immigration debate , “ to promote and actually lie about Mike Huckabee and his immigration plan and his past record .
Now we feel like we have to say something . ”
“ It ’s crazy , ” he said .
“ You get e-mails from this guy and it ’s like this guy is truly out of his mind . ”
Mr. Huckabee has promised to run a clean campaign .
William Gheen , president of Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee , said Mr. Gilchrist ’s campaigning reflects badly on Mr. Huckabee .
“ He ’s an intrinsic front - row part of the campaign who ’s sending out e-mails to people who oppose Huckabee to try to lie about them , ” said Mr. Gheen , who has tangled with Mr. Gilchrist and is trying to block Mr. Huckabee from winning the Republican nomination .
Mr. Huckabee ’s campaign said the governor was not available to comment on the e-mail exchange .
Mr. Gilchrist said he was not accusing Mr. Young of pedophilia , but making a point about making up charges .
He also said he was not speaking on behalf of Mr. Huckabee when he sent the e-mail , and that the criticism pushed him to the limit .
“ That was a private e-mail and what I was doing was setting up an example : ‘ This is what you ’ve done to me , I ’m not going to do this to you , but how would you like it if I did this to you ? ’ ” Mr. Gilchrist said .
Australians got a wonderful xmas surprise this month — the new Labour government has scrapped the plan for a universal surveillance identity card .
Opponents of Australia 's controversial Access Card received an early Christmas present earlier this month when the incoming Rudd Labor Government finally axed the controversial ID program .
Had it been implemented , the Access Card program would have required Australians to present the smart card anytime they dealt with certain federal departments , including Medicare , Centrelink , the Child Support Agency , or Veterans ' Affairs …
Encrypted information contained within the card 's RFID chip would have included a person 's legal name , date of birth , gender , address , signature , card number , card expiration date , and Medicare number .
Provisions were also included that would allow additional information deemed to be necessary for either " the administration or purposes of the Act . "
Australians were unhappy about being forced to carry a unique ID card merely for the purpose of interacting with basic human and health services , and the proposal faced opposition from its very inception .
The defeat of John Howard in the Australian polls was the last gasp of the Access Card program , which was killed off as one of the very first acts of the new Labor government , lead by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
Ilustration by Jac
THE late Rudi Dornbusch , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , once remarked : “ None of the post - war expansions died of old age .
They were all murdered by the Fed . ”
Every recession since 1945 , with the exception of the one in 2001 , was preceded by a sharp rise in inflation that forced the central bank to raise interest rates .
But today 's Federal Reserve is no serial killer .
It seems keener on blood transfusions than on bloodletting .
When the Fed cut its discount rate on August 17th , it admitted for the first time that the credit crunch could hurt the economy .
The markets are betting it will soon cut its main federal funds rate .
Economists are arguing vigorously about how much damage falling house prices and the subprime mortgage crisis will do .
But there is one question that is rarely asked : even if a downturn is in the offing , should the Fed try to prevent it ?
Most people think the question smacks of madness .
According to received wisdom , the Fed should not cut interest rates to bail out lenders and investors , because this creates moral hazard and encourages greater risk - taking ; but if financial troubles harm spending and jobs the Fed should immediately ease policy so long as inflation remains modest .
Central bankers should be guided by the “ Taylor rule ” — and set interest rates in response to deviations in both output and inflation from desired levels .
A necessary evil
But should a central bank always try to avoid recessions ?
Some economists argue that this could create a much wider form of moral hazard .
If long periods of uninterrupted expansions lead people to believe that the Fed can prevent any future recession , consumers , firms , investors and borrowers will be encouraged to take bigger risks , borrowing more and saving less .
During the past quarter century the American economy has been in recession for only 5 % of the time , compared with 22 % of the previous 25 years .
Partly this is due to welcome structural changes that have made the economy more stable .
But what if it is due to repeated injections of adrenaline every time the economy slows ?
Many of America 's current financial troubles can be blamed on the mildness of the 2001 recession after the dotcom bubble burst .
After its longest unbroken expansion in history , GDP did not even fall for two consecutive quarters , the traditional definition of a recession .
It is popularly argued that the tameness of the downturn was the benign result of the American economy 's increased flexibility , better inventory control and the Fed 's firmer grip on inflation .
But the economy also received the biggest monetary and fiscal boost in its history .
By slashing interest rates ( by more than the Taylor rule prescribed ) , the Fed encouraged a house - price boom which offset equity losses and allowed households to take out bigger mortgages to prop up their spending .
And by sheer luck , tax cuts , planned when the economy was still strong , inflated demand at exactly the right time .
Many hope that the Fed will now repeat the trick .
Slashing interest rates would help to prop up house prices and encourage households to keep borrowing and spending .
But after such a long binge , might the economy not benefit from a cold shower ?
Contrary to popular wisdom , it is not a central bank 's job to prevent recession at any cost .
Its task is to keep inflation down ( helping smooth out the economic cycle ) , to protect the financial system , and to prevent a recession turning into a deep slump .
The economic and social costs of recession are painful : unemployment , lower wages and profits , and bankruptcy .
These can not be dismissed lightly .
But there are also some purported benefits .
Some economists believe that recessions are a necessary feature of economic growth .
Joseph Schumpeter argued that recessions are a process of creative destruction in which inefficient firms are weeded out .
Only by allowing the “ winds of creative destruction ” to blow freely could capital be released from dying firms to new industries .
Some evidence from cross-country studies suggests that economies with higher output volatility tend to have slightly faster productivity growth .
Japan 's zero interest rates allowed “ zombie ” companies to survive in the 1990s .
This depressed Japan 's productivity growth , and the excess capacity undercut the profits of other firms .
Another “ benefit ” of a recession is that it purges the excesses of the previous boom , leaving the economy in a healthier state .
The Fed 's massive easing after the dotcom bubble burst delayed this cleansing process and simply replaced one bubble with another , leaving America 's imbalances ( inadequate saving , excessive debt and a huge current - account deficit ) in place .
A recession now would reduce America 's trade gap as consumers would at last be forced to trim their spending .
Delaying the correction of past excesses by pumping in more money and encouraging more borrowing is likely to make the eventual correction more painful .
The policy dilemma facing the Fed may not be a choice of recession or no recession .
It may be a choice between a mild recession now and a nastier one later .
This does not mean that the Fed should follow the advice of Andrew Mellon , the treasury secretary , after the 1929 crash : “ liquidate labour , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , and liquidate real estate ... It will purge the rottenness out of the system . ”
America 's output fell by 30 % as the Fed sat on its hands .
As a scholar of the Great Depression , Ben Bernanke , the Fed 's chairman , will not make that mistake .
Central banks must stop recessions from turning into deep depressions .
But it may be wrong to prevent them altogether .
Of course , even if a recession were in America 's long - term economic interest , it would be political suicide .
A central banker who mentioned the idea might soon be out of a job .
But that should not stop undiplomatic economists asking whether a recession once in a while might actually be a good thing .

( AP ) CHARLESTON , W.Va . - A Charleston radio station is observing Valentine ’s Day with a reminder that Cupid sometimes misses his mark .
WKLC -FM , better known as Rock 105 , is giving away a free divorce .
Valentine ’s
Day is n’t all hearts and flowers , says WKLC Program Director Jay Nunley .
There is a darker side , he said , " where maybe you despise your spouse and resent the entire day . "
Through 4 p.m. on Thursday , Valentine ’s Day , applications for the free divorce will be accepted on the classic rock station ’s Web site , http://www.wklc.com.
The winning name will be drawn at 5 p.m .
Nunley cautions that this is a real divorce and people should n’t enter if they are n’t serious .
Also , people expecting a long , drawn - out legal battle should hire a lawyer because the Rock 105 contest is for a relatively uncomplicated divorce .
Charleston attorney Rusty Webb will handle the actual filing .
" Sure we can give away concert tickets , and we do , " said Nunley .
" That ’s going to make you happy for a little while .
This is the chance to make someone happy for the rest of their life . "

I 'm still mystified by certain aspects of Major League Baseball 's drug policy .
Consider the following :
An aging pitcher is suffering from a variety of persistent injuries .
They are healing slowly .
He is depressed and lethargic , and anxious about his career .
He goes to see his doctor .
The doctor finds that the patient 's testosterone count is low .
He prescribes the pitcher a small dose of testosterone , as part of his rehab .
The patient is desperate , and the doctor agrees to experiment with testosterone , and see if it speeds recovery .
Questions :
1 . Has the pitcher violated MLB 's drug policy ?
As far as I can tell , yes .
Testosterone is on baseball 's list of banned substances .
2 . Has the patient violated the law ?
Of course not .
Testosterone is an FDA approved medication .
3 . Has the doctor done anything wrong ?
Not at all .
The doctor could also have prescribed human growth hormone , if he wanted to .
Even though HGH is not approved for injury recovery , a physician is free to prescrbe virtually any drug he / she wants to , in an off - label manner .
4 . Should the doctor and the athlete feel guilty about what they 've done ?
I do n't see why .
The foundation of our medical system is that physicans have broad leeway to act in the best interests of their patients , and if the physician thinks that testosterone might help the athlete he 's entirely within his rights to prescribe it .
The pitcher is also entitled to take every step he can to regain his health .
Surely it is wrong -- if not unconstitutional -- for an employer to impede an employee from receiving the best medical attention .
5. Will Major League Baseball ever find out about the pitcher 's testosterone use ?
Not unless the pitcher tells someone .
The transaction between a patient and a doctor is , of course , covered by patient confidentiality laws .
6 . Does this mean that lots of professional athletes may already be using substances like testosterone -- and we have no way of finding out ?
Of course !
7 . So why did Vina and Pettitte and Bennett get in trouble ?
Because , presumably , they obtained their HGH without an prescription -- which is illegal .
8 . So wait .
The league 's drug policy is an attempt to prevent the use of drugs without a prescription ?
No .
Its supposed to prevent the use of a broad class of drugs .
But since the league 's policies clearly can't govern drugs prescribed legally by a physican -- particuarly if they are undetectable -- it has the effect of only preventing the use of drugs obtained illegally .
9 . I 'm confused .
Are n't there already laws in place in America preventing the use of drugs without a prescription ?
Yes .
( And I 'm confused too . )
Will someone please tell me if I 've got this right ?

British tour operators suspended holidays to Kenya yesterday as fresh violence flared in the heart of the capital Nairobi .
Anti-government protesters defied riot police who were using tear gas and water cannons and taunted them with cries of " Kill us all " .
At one stage police fired live rounds over the heads of supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga in the city 's slum areas .
Scroll down for more ...
A rally to protest at the disputed re-election of President Mwai Kibaki was called off " to save lives " but rescheduled for tomorrow , providing another potential flashpoint .
Kenya's Attorney General Amos Wako pleaded for an independent investigation into the election as the US and the EU called on the increasingly beleaguered Kibaki to create a coalition government .
But with bodies , including those of women and children , piling up in hospitals and drunken youths wielding machetes at blazing roadblocks , the chances of an early settlement appeared remote .
The decision by the Federation of Tour Operators to suspend Kenyan holidays until tomorrow will affect hundreds of UK tourists due to fly out for sand - and - safari breaks on the Equator .
Those involved , including travellers due to fly from Gatwick to Mombasa today on a First Choice Holidays break , have been offered alternatives or a full refund .
About 6,000 Britons - including 3,000 on package holidays - are currently on trips in Kenya , where more than 300 people have died .
Both British Airways and Virgin flights were continuing and stopovers will not be affected .
The Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to the strife - torn East African country and the suspension comes as the peak season for British tourism to Kenya approaches .
Thousands of holidaymakers , mainly couples , are fleeing the dark and cold of a British winter to visit some of the world 's top game parks and relax at luxury beach resorts .
Refunds will cost UK tour operators many thousands of pounds while any lengthy suspension of package tours will have serious implications for the Kenyan economy , which receives £ 400 million a year from tourism , the country 's biggest earner .
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu flew into Nairobi to try to mediate in the crisis .
" This is a country that has been held up as a model of stability , " he said .
" This picture has been shattered . "
The Nobel peace laureate added : " I do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church .
" This is not the Kenya that we know . "
As he prepared to meet Tutu , Odinga called Kibaki a " thief " who had carried out " a civilian coup " .
He said he would be prepared to accept international mediation and proposed setting up an interim powersharing government to prepare for a re-run of the vote .
" The people will not take this vote - rigging by the government lying down , " he said .
Earlier , Odinga toured a dozen freezing rooms at Nairobi's City Mortuary , full of the bodies of babies , children , young men and women .
Some bodies were burned but many did not have visible wounds .
" What we have just seen defies description , " Odinga said .
" We can only describe it as genocide on a grand scale . "
In Nairobi , thousands poured out of the pro-opposition Kibera slum and other shanty towns after dawn to head for Freedom Park , for the planned million - strong rally that Kibaki 's government had banned .
Police marched on them using teargas and water cannon .
They also fired in the air as the crowd kneeled , shouting " Kill us all " .
Opposition spokesman Salam Lone said there will be a mass rally of thousands of supporters in a central Nairobi park today .
" The rally is on , " he said .
Further protest could damage the chances of peace .
Last night President Kibaki softened his stance by saying : " I am ready to have dialogue with the concerned parties once the nation is calm . "
Despite deep cuts in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's proposal to bridge the state 's $ 14.5 billion deficit , about half of his budget - balancing plan involves borrowing money , deferring debt payments and the counting future tax revenue , according to a report released today by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 's Office .
The governor is proposing to issue $ 3.3 billion in bonds , delay payment on debt worth $ 1.5 billion and shift $ 2 billion of tax revenue that would otherwise be counted in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year to the coming fiscal year , which begins July 1 , the report said .
NEW YORK , Jan 10 ( Reuters ) - Moody ’s Investors Service said on Thursday the United States ’ “ triple - A ” government bond rating could come under pressure in the very long - term if the Medicare and Social Security programs are not reformed .
“ These two programs are the largest threats to the long - term financial health of the United States and to the government ’s Aaa rating , ” Moody ’s analyst Steven Hess said in the agency ’s annual report on the United States .
The report is not a rating action .
Hess also said that risks from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis are not affecting the nation ’s credit rating .
However , the housing downturn and subprime crisis could result in “ a period of slower growth in coming quarters , although further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could help to maintain positive growth , ” he said .
John McCarthy , director of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York , noted that “ some are saying comments about the possible downgrade of the U.S. long - term rating is hitting the dollar a bit . ”
The United States ’ “ Aaa ” foreign currency ceiling and “ Aaa ” bond ratings and stable outlook are supported by the nation ’s large and diverse economy and moderate level of debt , Moody ’s said .
Federal debt ratios relative to gross domestic product and to revenue appear “ set to improve modestly in the next few years , ” the agency said .

From Daily Kos ' partial transcript of a video ( link to REAL stream ) of Seymour Hersh speaking at an ACLU event .
He says the US government has videotapes of children being raped at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
"
Some of the worst things that happened you do n't know about , okay ?
Videos , um , there are women there .
Some of you may have read that they were passing letters out , communications out to their men .
This is at Abu Ghraib …
The women were passing messages out saying ' Please come and kill me , because of what 's happened ' and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys , children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
And the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror .
It 's going to come out . "
Link ( via Warren ) .
There 's also a piece worth reading in this week 's Newsweek about new allegations of rape and sexual torture at Abu Ghraib .
Feature includes details on the identities of the Iraqi prisoners shown in those widely - circulated photographs — including Satar Jabar ( charged with carjacking , not terrorism ) , whose iconic hooded figure with wires attached is derisively described by many Iraqis as the " Statue of Liberty . "
Link
Update : Geraldine Sealey at Salon on Hersh 's remarks :
After Donald Rumsfeld testified on the Hill about Abu Ghraib in May , there was talk of more photos and video in the Pentagon 's custody more horrific than anything made public so far .
" If these are released to the public , obviously it 's going to make matters worse , " Rumsfeld said .
Since then , the Washington Post has disclosed some new details and images of abuse at the prison .
But if Seymour Hersh is right , it all gets much worse .
(…)
Notes from a similar speech Hersh gave in Chicago in June were posted on Brad DeLong 's blog .
Rick Pearlstein , who watched the speech , wrote : " [ Hersh ] said that after he broke Abu Ghraib people are coming out of the woodwork to tell him this stuff .
He said he had seen all the Abu Ghraib pictures .
He said , ' You have n't begun to see evil … ' then trailed off .
He said , ' horrible things done to children of women prisoners , as the cameras run . '
He looked frightened . "
There are several questions here : Has Hersh actually seen the video he described to the ACLU , and why has n't he written about it yet ?
Will he be forced to elaborate in more public venues now that these two speeches are getting so much attention , at least in the blogosphere ?
And who else has seen the video , if it exists — will journalists see and report on it ?
did senators see these images when they had their closed - door sessions with the Abu Ghraib evidence ? — and what is being done about it ?
Link to Salon item .
Update 2 : BB guestbar alum Russ Kick of Memory Hole reminds us of a post he made in May about the type of as - yet - unreleased evidence Hersh is presumably discussing .
Here , Russ quotes Republican Senator Lindsay Graham : " The American public needs to understand , we 're talking about rape and murder here .
We 're not just talking about giving people a humiliating experience .
We 're talking about rape and murder and some very serious charges . "
Update 3 : BoingBoing reader Lars has an update from Germany — some European media perspective on the allegations :
" Report Mainz " is a German TV show / magazine of the SWR ( Sudwest - Rundfunk = South - West broadcasting ) .
" Report Mainz " reported already on 5th July 2004 about the potential abuse of children in Abu Ghraib .
( Link ) .
A video ( in German ) of the feature is available at the page ( Link to streaming Real file ) .
You can see interviews with persons who testify that they have seen children arrested in Abu Ghraib and who have seen and have heard of a boy and a 12 year old girl terrified ( cold water and mud were spilled over them ) by guards or military personal .
The boy and the girl were then used to terrify their also arrested parents who were willing to cooperate after seeing their children terrified by the guards / military personnel .
Another TV show / magazine covered the issue too : " Kulturzeit " , of the German - Austrian - Swiss broadcaster " 3Sat " ( Link ) .
The main theme in these features is the concern about the fact that children are arrested and that they are used to apply pressure on their parents . "
Debbie Schlussel , a minor - league pundit wingnut who sees Muslim terrorists around every corner and questions whether Obama should be president " when we are fighting the war of our lives against Islam , " went on Fox and Friends today to talk about how it could possibly be that the former Republican Congressman she used to work for was just indicted in a terrorist fund - raising conspiracy .

Debbie Schlussel : I am so shocked and saddened by this .
It 's heartbreaking because when I worked for Mark Siljander he was probably the most anti-Islamist Congressman on the Hill .
He was the one who most understood the Jihadist threat decades before 9 - 11 and before most people in America I think really understood the seriousness of it .
She just can't explain how it is that her " anti-Islamist Congressman " could have done what he 's accused of except that he must have needed the money .
And John Cole noticed something funny about that old ID she posted .
Geez , it was one of the biggest stories in a long time and Mr. Huckabee had n’t even heard about it by yesterday evening .
My God , who does this guy have working for him ?
From Hotline On Call :
During an on - the - record dinner here at the conclusion of Mike Huckabee ’s two - day swing through the state , the governor hoped to impress national and local reporters with all that he knew about about governance , education , and Iowa know - how .
But journalists came away amazed by what he did n’t know – almost anything about today ’s National Intelligence Estimate report on nuclear weapons in Iran , reports NBC / NJ ’s Carrie Dann .
Asked about the report , Huckabee shook his head slightly to indicate he was n’t familiar with its content .
The Politico ’s David Paul Kuhn incredulously asked if he had seen the report or had been briefed on it .
“ No , ” replied the governor .
Greene proceeded to explain the NIE ’s findings .
You know those handy mailers that you 've been sending back to Netflix for ages as you eagerly await the next few flicks in your queue ?
Apparently , those buggers have cost the US Postal Service a staggering $ 41.9 million in additional labor costs over the past two years due to their " nonmachinable nature , " and if things are n't changed , it could cost 'em another $ 61.5 million over the next couple years .
In a letter from the Inspector General 's office , Netflix is being , um , asked to rework its mailers or face a $ 0.17 surcharge per envelope , and if such a fee was tacked on , it would reportedly decrease the outfit 's monthly operating income per paying subscriber by a whopping 67 - percent .
Not surprisingly , it sounds as if Netflix will bite the bullet and redesign the problematic mailer if the USPS is serious about the charges , so feel free to keep an eye out for a design change in the not - too - distant future .

Foreword
Introduction
Scared of command lines and Linux ?
Do n't be .
We 'll take you through step by step to
build one of the most useful boxes you could ever get your hands on - from spare parts .
Hardware
If you 're anything like me ( even before I got really involved with ) , you 've got spare parts everywhere .
You know what I mean - systems that you have put aside as you 've upgraded over the years , like Northwood P4s and Athlon XP boards that have gone the way of the dodo .
They are n't your top gaming rig - they do n't even need 200W to run , much less have 200W for the graphics card .
In my goal of helping you find new and useful ways to use that old crap , it dawned on me - everyone I know complains about files on this computer or that computer , or not being able to get the things they need or want while they 're out or away from their home desk .
They needed a file server - a REAL file server , with web interface and bit - torrent and the capacity to not tie up your precious screens and keyboards , which are ( at least in my house ) in less supply than motherboards and hard drives .
It needs to be fast , extensible , flexible , run on old spare parts , and be completely headless after about two hours .
It needs to be Linux .
And apparently I need to be our resident Linux expert , Ken " Glider " Gypen ... " GLIIIIDDEEERRR !!!
" After showing that one of the known pitfalls of Linux is n't as bad as most expected , it 's about time to get things into gear and show one of the strengths of Linux .
It 's a known fact that Linux ( or any other flavour of ' Nix ) is a great OS to run on that low power , the - day - before - yesterday 's - generation hardware .
That 's because the strength of Linux lies in its Command Line Interface ( CLI ) .
While scary to those who are used to point and click , CLI offers a no -nonsense , straight to the point and low - overhead powerhouse .
Many accustomed to graphical interfaces find the CLI old and obsolete .
But they just do n't grasp the strength of the interface .
Since most things in Linux are done through the manipulation of ( small ) files , there often is no need for some eye candy .
With a relative small number of commands you can totally change the functioning of a Linux system .
CLI is n't hard to learn and Linux offers a great tool for learning it , the “ man ” pages .
But enough of the chatting , Brett asked me to write a guide on how to install a home file server , with a GUI ( sigh ) .
In addition to that , he wanted it to run headless , thus requiring a remote administration .
Also , a web - based P2P solution was offered to run on the box , so that you can shut down your power hungry workstation , and leave the downloading for the economic box .
And to finish things up , I 'll briefly touch the area of scripting .
Scripting is the edge that Linux has to offer over Windows - Mac users will know of it a bit if you are familiar with Automator .
Most tasks can be automated through scripts - a ( lesser ) known saying in the Linux world goes : “ If you need to do something more than 3 times , you should write a script for it .
" But enough of the chatting , lets get this party started ... As already touched in the introduction , Linux needs next to no hardware to run on .
I know plenty of people who run a Linux gateway on a old 486 .
That is an impressive clock speed of 16MHz !
Unfortunately we are n't building a gateway right now .
Given the requirements of this article , we need something a lot more beefy .
Certainly things like an X - and web - server require a fair bit more power .
Certainly the X server .
That 's why I chose Xubuntu .
Ubuntu is considered as one of the most newbiefriendly distributions out there , but it uses the heavier Gnome window managers , while Xubuntu uses XFCE .
Minimum requirements for Gnome are a 500MHz CPU , opposed to the 133MHz needed for XFCE .
However , since our box will be multi role , the minimum specification of 133MHz might be a little low .
Do n't get me wrong , all will work , but not as smoothly .
Anything 750MHz or up will do just fine .
RAM wise , Xubuntu once again is the limiting factor .
The install requires 192MB to complete .
Afterwards , the system is n't as RAM hungry , so 192MB should be plenty .
In the area of disk space , we are building a file server so the more the better .
The OS does n't require a lot , about 2.5GB .
Disk space is considered to be cheap , so nothing problematic on this front either .
Basically , anything halfway decent from two years ago will do .
Maybe you could use that hardware you had to throw out to run Vista ?
In case you have some lesser hardware lying around , do n't fear .
By letting go of the GUI you can lower the requirements quite a bit .
Also , all Linux flavours are different , yet so similar .
To get the requirements down you can just use the “ Ubuntu Server ” install .
Then you wo n't get the GUI , but none the less all will function .
If you want even more control , try another distribution , like Debian or Gentoo if you are feeling lucky .
Personally , I 've ' assembled ' a virtual PC , thanks to the guys over at VirtualBox .
The system has 256MB of RAM and 10 GB of disk space at its disposal .
For those of you working on a real machine , here 's a tip - the first thing I do when I build a server is walk around in the BIOS .
I then disable all unneeded things that I discover on my journey .
If it is n't needed , turn it off .
That way it can't break .
Susan Zelman , head of Ohio 's education department , has visited classrooms in China , India , and Japan .
She 's met young people with whom her students will potentially be competing – and collaborating – when they start careers .
And she 's impressed .
In Ohio , " our economy is in the tubes , " she says , " so there 's really an economic need to think about , How can we build the workforce ?...
How can we build a world - class learning system ? "
In the quest to answer that , Ohio is the first state to use an analysis of the best - performing nations as a benchmark for its own academic policies .
But it 's certainly not the only state or school district that 's looking beyond domestic borders to gauge how well it 's doing .
There 's no universal agreement on the best way to compare vastly different education systems around the world – or on what lessons to draw from data available so far .
But there 's clearly an appetite for more information .
Despite such momentum , improvements in education in the United States are n't coming fast enough for some – particularly those in the business community .
" As a nation , our ability to create intellectual property is pretty much fundamental to continue to drive our economy , and we do n't want to see the US fall behind there , " says William Swope , a vice president of Intel Corp. , whose philanthropy helps train math and science teachers in the US and abroad .
" The governments of the world that are serious about education are applying the best known methods for improving the quality of their graduates , " he says .
For states interested in international benchmarking , a new report just added a piece to the puzzle .
It takes data from each state 's 8th - grade scores in math and science on the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) and links it to the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) .
The two tests were designed to be compatible , says Gary Phillips , chief scientist at American Institutes for Research ( AIR , www.air.org), a nonprofit in Washington that released the data Nov. 13 .
Each state can see where it ranks on a scale with 45 industrialized and developing countries .
" Most [ states ] are doing as well as or better than most countries , " Mr. Phillips says .
But he 's concerned because " our best states are ... lower than the best countries – so even though we 're in the race , we 're not winning the race . "
Another common concern :
The number of bachelor 's degrees in science and technology in the US , while still on the rise , has not kept pace with gains in other countries , the American Council on Education reports .
Several nations now spend a higher portion of their gross domestic product on R&D than does the US .
India and China are not yet ranked in the most common international comparisons , but they are seen as competitors because of their sheer size and their fast development .
America 's economic dominance emerged in a context that wo n't be repeated , notes Vivien Stewart , vice president for education at the nonprofit Asia Society in New York .
After World War II , much of the world was rebuilding or was still undeveloped .
The US invested heavily in education , becoming the first to approach universal high school attendance .
More recently , the removal of Communist barriers and the emergence of world trade agreements have produced " a kind of a seismic shift , " Ms. Stewart says .
" The competition is going to get tougher for the US on every dimension .
And therefore the state of our education system becomes more important than when we were the sole economic superpower . "
Stewart has led state education officials on visits to China and India .
In China , there are large gaps between rural and urban education levels , " but the rate of progress is extraordinary , " she says .
At the best high schools , 15 - year - olds talked to the visitors in English about academic work equal to or above what 's common at the best schools in the US .
Visitors found that Chinese students know a great deal about the US and world history .
What pervades is " the intensity of commitment to education , not only on the part of government but also the students , " Stewart says .
Ms. Zelman of Ohio took note on her visit that some of China 's elite high schools are partnerships among businesses , universities , and the K - 12 system .
Ohio is working to create such partnerships , she says , but " quite frankly , we do n't have anything comparable . "
Some voices are pushing back against the growing sense of competition with China and other nations .
There 's too much of a cold - war mentality , says Yong Zhao , a professor and director of the US - China Center for Research on Educational Excel­lence at Mich­­igan State Uni­­versity .
He believes some international tests have been misinterpreted as spelling doom for America 's economy .
" I think the tests are biased to reflect the talents that other cultures emphasize more , " says Mr. Zhao .
Asian countries tend to score higher on science and math tests because that 's what they focus on narrowly , but in the US , " we have many more possible outlets for talents , and that 's actually much more important , " he says .
Chi­­nese educa­tors look to US education for the creativity and entrepreneurship it sparks .
" Americans should be more American – not more Chinese or Japanese or Singaporean – in our education , " Zhao says .
One downside in China , where he attended school himself , is that after so much focus on doing well on tests to advance , many " lose the internal motivation to learn " and slack off in college .
To be prepared for future jobs , what Americans really need , Zhao says , is " the ability to manage across different cultures . "
Zelman agrees that the issue should n't just be framed as one of competition .
" We can be part of an international community where we can learn from each other . "
To foster cross-cultural understanding , Ohio has recently received a federal grant to promote education in " critical " languages such as Chinese .
International benchmarking is perhaps a natural extension of the work many states are already doing to improve high school students ' preparation for college or the US job market .
Thirty states have joined the American Diploma Project Network , organized by Achieve Inc. , a nonprofit in Washington .
Achieve president Michael Cohen says that in Ohio , Arizona , Delaware , and several other states , " governors and chief state school officers ... basically have said , ' Well , it 's great that you want us to align our expectations with the real world kids will face domestically ... but that 's not enough ; we need to know what our expectations ought to be in order for our kids to succeed [ globally ] . ' "
Earlier this year , Ohio received a report it commissioned from Achieve and the McKinsey & Company consulting group .
It drew in part on research by Sir Michael Barber , head of the Education Interest Group at McKinsey .
Sir Michael analyzed top - performing school systems , as well as systems that are improving rapidly ( including a number of US urban districts ) .
He found three elements they shared :
• The top nations recruit teachers from among the best graduates ( the top 30 percent in Singapore and top 5 percent in South Korea ) .
• They focus on developing teacher recruits into effective instructors .
( Boston , for instance , has teacher apprenticeships and instructional coaches to assist teachers . )
• They set high expectations , monitor achievement , and intervene with children who are falling behind .
Ohio's Zelman , taking such comparisons to heart , plans to recommend legislation to revise state standards , have Ohio participate in international comparisons , and improve teacher and principal development .
" We feel we 've made some good progress in Ohio , but we know we still have incredible achievement gaps .... [ We want ] to make sure that our children will be able to compete and reap the benefits of a global economy . "
