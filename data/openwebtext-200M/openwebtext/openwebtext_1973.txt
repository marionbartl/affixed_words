ALVIN — Did a former Pentagon employee take a file cabinet filled with sensitive information about America 's top Army generals — including former Secretary of State Colin Powell — and then leave them behind in an Alvin house sold in a sheriff 's sale ?
That 's what police and the Department of Defense would like to know .
Members of an Alvin family looking for salvageable materials a few days ago hauled the file cabinet holding the records home from a small house on Lee Street that is being renovated .
" The contractor told us to take whatever we wanted , " said Alfredo Moreno III .
His uncle , Martin Ortiz , later looked through the cabinet and got a shock when he opened one of the drawers .
" I thought , what is this doing here ? " he said .
" I knew this was important . "
" Here we are in little old Alvin , " Police Chief Mike Merkel said Friday , " and I have a folder in my hand that contains Colin Powell 's Social Security number . "
After a brief look through some of the files , which appeared to be from the 1980s and 1990s , Merkel said he saw " sensitive information that does n't need to get out . "
He ordered the file cabinet and its contents to be hauled to the police station and locked in an evidence room .
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Brian Maka said military investigators will review the files , see if they are genuine and investigate how they got to Alvin .
" We take any release of sensitive information of military personnel as being very serious , " Maka said .
Also in the file cabinet were certificates indicating that a former owner of the small house worked at the Pentagon from 1987 to 1994 .
Attempts by the Houston Chronicle to reach the woman were not successful .
Tax records indicate she owned the house from 1999 until last May when it was sold in a sheriff 's sale .
The new owners are renovating the house .
The front file in the drawer was labeled " Generals list " and included names , addresses , phone numbers , Social Security numbers and other information on dozens of Army generals .
The file labeled Colin Powell listed him as a lieutenant general , a rank he held from 1986 to 1989 .
Merkel said he will let the military investigate the mystery .
" There 's no law against hauling away a file cabinet that 's being thrown away , " he said .
The chief praised Moreno and his family for handing over the files .
" It 's a good thing that this did n't get out and end up on the Internet , " he said .
Moreno said he 's glad to be rid of the files .
" They made us nervous , " he said .
" We did n't want them . "

The middle ages ( 5th – 15th Centuries AD ) , often termed The Dark Ages , were actually a time of great discovery and invention .
The Middle ages also saw major advances in technologies that already existed , and the adoption of many Eastern technologies in the West .
This is a list of the ten greatest inventions of the Middle Ages ( excluding military inventions ) .
1. The Heavy Plough 5th Century AD
In the basic mouldboard plough the depth of the cut is adjusted by lifting against the runner in the furrow , which limited the weight of the plough to what the ploughman could easily lift .
These ploughs were fairly fragile , and were unsuitable for breaking up the heavier soils of northern Europe .
The introduction of wheels to replace the runner allowed the weight of the plough to increase , and in turn allowed the use of a much larger mouldboard that was faced with metal .
These heavy ploughs led to greater food production and eventually a significant population increase around 600 AD .

2. Tidal Mills 7th Century AD
A tide mill is a specialist type of water mill driven by tidal rise and fall .
A dam with a sluice is created across a suitable tidal inlet , or a section of river estuary is made into a reservoir .
As the tide comes in , it enters the mill pond through a one way gate , and this gate closes automatically when the tide begins to fall .
When the tide is low enough , the stored water can be released to turn a water wheel .
The earliest excavated tide mill , dating from 787 , is the Nendrum Monastery mill on an island in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland .
Its millstones are 830 mm in diameter and the horizontal wheel is estimated to have developed 7 /8HP at its peak .
Remains of an earlier mill dated at 619 were also found .
3. The Hourglass 9th Century AD
Since the hourglass was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea , it has been speculated that it was in use as far back as the 11th century , where it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation .
However , it is not until the 14th century that evidence of their existence was found , appearing in a painting by Ambrogio Lorenzetti 1328 .
The earliest written records come from the same period and appear in lists of ships stores .
From the 15th century onwards they were being used in a wide range of applications at sea , in the church , in industry and in cookery .
They were the first dependable , reusable and reasonably accurate measure of time .
During the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan around the globe , his vessels kept 18 hourglasses per ship .
It was the job of a ship ’s page to turn the hourglasses and thus provide the times for the ship ’s log .
Noon was the reference time for navigation , which did not depend on the glass , as the sun would be at its zenith .
4. Blast Furnace 12th Century AD
The oldest known blast furnaces in the West were built in Dürstel in Switzerland , the Märkische Sauerland in Germany , and Sweden at Lapphyttan where the complex was active between 1150 and 1350 .
At Noraskog in the Swedish county of Järnboås there have also been found traces of blast furnaces dated even earlier , possibly to around 1100 .
Knowledge of certain technological advances was transmitted as a result of the General Chapter of the Cistercian monks , including the blast furnace , as the Cistercians are known to have been skilled metallurgists .
According to Jean Gimpel , their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques : “ Every monastery had a model factory , often as large as the church and only several feet away , and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor . ”
Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with forges to extract the iron , and within time surpluses were being offered for sale .
The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in Champagne , France , from the mid-13th century to the 17th century , also using the phosphate - rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertilizer .
5. Liquor 12th Century AD
The first evidence of true distillation comes from Babylonia and dates from the fourth millennium BC .
Specially shaped clay pots were used to extract small amounts of distilled alcohol through natural cooling for use in perfumes , however it is unlikely this device ever played a meaningful role in the history of the development of the still .
Freeze distillation , the “ Mongolian still ” , are known to have been in use in Central Asia as early as the 7th century AD .
The first method involves freezing the alcoholic beverage and removing water crystals .
The development of the still with cooled collector — necessary for the efficient distillation of spirits without freezing — was an invention of Muslim alchemists in the 8th or 9th centuries .
In particular , Geber ( Jabir Ibn Hayyan , 721 –815 ) invented the alembic still ; he observed that heated wine from this still released a flammable vapor , which he described as “ of little use , but of great importance to science ”

6. Eyeglasses 13th Century
In 1268 Roger Bacon made the earliest recorded comment on the use of lenses for optical purposes , but magnifying lenses inserted in frames were used for reading both in Europe and China at this time , and it is a matter of controversy whether the West learned from the East or vice versa .
In Europe eyeglasses first appeared in Italy , their introduction being attributed to Alessandro di Spina of Florence .
The first portrait to show eyeglasses is that of Hugh of Provence by Tommaso da Modena , painted in 1352 .
In 1480 Domenico Ghirlandaio painted St. Jerome at a desk from which dangled eyeglasses ; as a result , St. Jerome became the patron saint of the spectacle - makers ’ guild .
The earliest glasses had convex lenses to aid farsightedness .
A concave lens for myopia , or nearsightedness , is first evident in the portrait of Pope Leo X painted by Raphael in 1517 .
7. The Mechanical Clock 13th Century AD
The origin of the all - mechanical escapement clock is unknown ; the first such devices may have been invented and used in monasteries to toll a bell that called the monks to prayers .
The first mechanical clocks to which clear references exist were large , weight - driven machines fitted into towers and known today as turret clocks .
These early devices struck only the hours and did not have hands or a dial .
The oldest surviving clock in England is that at Salisbury Cathedral , which dates from 1386 .
A clock erected at Rouen , France , in 1389 is still extant ( photo above ) , and one built for Wells Cathedral in England is preserved in the Science Museum in London .
8. Spinning Wheel
13th Century AD
The spinning wheel was probably invented in India , though its origins are obscure .
It reached Europe via the Middle East in the European Middle Ages .
It replaced the earlier method of hand spinning , in which the individual fibres were drawn out of a mass of wool held on a stick , or distaff , twisted together to form a continuous strand , and wound on a second stick , or spindle .
The first stage in mechanizing the process was to mount the spindle horizontally in bearings so that it could be rotated by a cord encircling a large , hand - driven wheel .
The distaff , carrying the mass of fibre , was held in the left hand , and the wheel slowly turned with the right .
Holding the fibre at an angle to the spindle produced the necessary twist .
9. Quarantine 14th Century AD
In the 14th century the growth of maritime trade and the recognition that plague was introduced by ships returning from the Levant led to the adoption of quarantine in Venice .
It was decreed that ships were to be isolated for a limited period to allow for the manifestation of the disease and to dissipate the infection brought by persons and goods .
Originally the period was 30 days , trentina , but this was later extended to 40 days , quarantina .
The choice of this period is said to be based on the period that Christ and Moses spent in isolation in the desert .
In 1423 Venice set up its first lazaretto , or quarantine station , on an island near the city .
The Venetian system became the model for other European countries and the basis for widespread quarantine control for several centuries .
10 . The Printing Press of Gutenberg 15th Century AD
Although movable type , as well as paper , first appeared in China , it was in Europe that printing first became mechanized .
The earliest mention of a printing press is in a lawsuit in Strasbourg in 1439 revealing construction of a press for Johannes Gutenberg and his associates .
( Scant evidence exists to support claims of Laurens Janszoon Coster as the inventor of printing . )
The invention of the printing press itself obviously owed much to the medieval paper press , in turn modeled after the ancient wine - and - olive press of the Mediterranean area .
A long handle was used to turn a heavy wooden screw , exerting downward pressure against the paper , which was laid over the type mounted on a wooden platen .
In its essentials , the wooden press reigned supreme for more than 300 years , with a hardly varying rate of 250 sheets per hour printed on one side .

Larry Summers ' comments about women caused controversy
But why should this be ?
In 2005 , Harvard University president Larry Summers provoked a storm of protest when he suggested that at least part of the reason for the dearth of women in these fields was biological - in other words , the result of innate differences in tastes and aptitudes between the sexes .
Professor Helen Haste , a psychologist at the University of Bath , was working at Harvard at the time .
She recalls how the speech revived some uncomfortable memories : " Women scientists who had gone into the profession before the late 1970s told quite harrowing stories of discrimination - sexist comments by their own supervisors , such as ' women have no place in laboratories , they should be at home looking after their children ' .
" Also some institutions had , for example , a dozen post - doctoral fellowships , only one of which was earmarked for women . "
Nature v nurture
Despite changing attitudes , there are still very few women at the highest levels in certain fields .
In 2005 / 6 , while more than half of all UK students in higher education were female , just 3 % of maths and 2 % of civil engineering professors were women , a recent study revealed .
Professor David Geary , of the University of Missouri in the US , suggests there are two key difference between the sexes that might account for the disparity in numbers .
The first is a difference in spatial abilities - the capacity to visualise things , particularly in three dimensions .
Some say spatial ability may be a factor in the debate
The second is an increased interest in objects and how things work .
According to Professor Geary : " Males are better in both of those areas , and both areas contribute to interest in maths and engineering , and performance in some areas . "
But how can we be sure that these differences are genuinely innate and not a result of upbringing and the culture that surrounds us ?
Professor Geary says : " These differences are found very early on in life .
" If you look at interest in toy cars or mechanical objects , boys like those much more from the pre-school years .
" Also , girls who have been exposed to a testosterone - like hormone in the womb show boy - like toy preferences . "
' Done to death '
But Helen
Haste thinks the evidence on spatial skills is overplayed .
She says : " This is one of these things that 's done to death .
" Even if we found a subject for which it was an absolutely crucial skill , we would expect 60 % of the people taking that subject to be male and 40 % to be female .
" More importantly , we 're only surmising that spatial reasoning is such a crucial element in say engineering or physics that it would cause the kind of differences that we 've found in the past . "
Others believe genetic differences are controlling career choices
More women than ever are entering higher education .
For example , the proportion of women taking medicine has doubled since the 1960s and women now account for more than half of all medical students .
" When these young people are getting to the point of gaining professorial positions , there will be much greater numbers of women " says Professor Haste .
But Dr Helena Cronin , who studies evolutionary theory and sex difference at the London School of Economics , argues that past statistics give no indication of what might happen in the future .
She says : " On that basis , women marathon runners , who have been catching up with men since the 1920s , were predicted to overtake men in the 1990s , and presumably would be running beyond the speed of light if it were continued for long enough . "
According to Dr Cronin , it 's the numbers of men at the extremes of ability that are most telling : " For males , the difference between the worst and the best is far , far greater .
" This is a very important aspect of male - female differences .
" One way of looking at this is that among males there are more dumbbells , but there are also more Nobels . "
Politically correct science
So what conclusions can we draw from this closely - fought scientific argument ?
For Professor Haste , history tells us this is an area in which we should tread carefully .
She says : " I 've never subscribed to the view that it 's the correct feminist line to say there are no differences .
" But let 's not forget that historically , evolutionary arguments have often been used to justify what seemed to be some normal aspect of life at the time - for example , the extreme racism of the late 19th century . "
Dr Cronin disagrees : " If people use the science wrongly , you should be objecting to them , not to the science . "
She describes Harvard 's reaction to Larry Summers ' speech as " shameful " , and sees it as an example of science being hijacked by politically - correct ideology .
She says those who are striving for 50/50 sex ratios across the sciences should look at the scientific evidence first .
She says : " If you want to change the world , first you have to understand it . "

People , the F22 is the Air Force 's replacement of the F15 as the next Air Superiority Fighter .
It 's the F22 Raptor Stealth Fighter with Super - Cruise and vectoring nozzles .
It 's one of the most expensive military aircraft ever , and is built up to the hilt with computers .
So much so that some of those computers crashed a couple of weeks ago forcing one of these expensive babies to do an emergency landing in Australia if I 'm not mistaken .
The JSF is , as gravrain said , the F35 which is still under development and not finalized .
The F22 is finalized and is being field tested and being readied to be officially fielded to Fighter Wings all over the country in a couple of years .
There .
Check out www.airliners.net and search on F22 .
You 'll get some really nice pics of it .
Saab 's latest fighter is the grippen and it looks nothing like the F22 .
There is tight security around academic premises in Baghdad
Abd Dhiab said up to 80 remained in captivity , while some of those who had since been released were badly beaten .
They were among scores of workers taken hostage when the gunmen raided an education ministry building in Baghdad .
In continuing violence , gunmen killed nine people in an ambush on a bakery in the east of the capital .
The government has issued an arrest warrant for the country 's most prominent Sunni cleric .
Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani told Iraqiya state TV the head of the Muslim Clerics Association Harith al - Dari was accused of " supporting terrorism " .
' Broken limbs '
In an interview with the BBC , Mr Dhiab said he was " very much concerned " for the remaining captives ' well - being .
He said there were " rumours and reports that some of them have been killed , even a number of those who have been freed were treated very badly , some of them had their legs and hands broken " .
I hope all the hostages will be released as soon as possible .
[ It is ] a messy situation
Abd Dhiab
Iraqi higher education minister
" I hope all the hostages will be released as soon as possible .
These are human beings and they should be released , " he said , adding that the latest crisis was " a messy situation " .
The Iraqi prime minister 's office , however , has said that out of a group of 40 hostages , no more than five are still being held .
There has been tight security around universities and other institutions since Tuesday 's raid , the latest in a series of attacks against Iraq 's academic community .
Mr Dhiab has said he will suspend co-operation with the government until the remaining hostages are released .
" I am stepping down until something is done actively [ to improve security ] , not just talk , " he said .
' Pools of blood '
In continuing bloodshed in Baghdad , police said gunmen opened fire on customers and workers in the bakery in the religiously - mixed neighbourhood of Zayouna .
Funerals have already been held for victims of the bakery attack
The attack left pools of blood on the floor as people tried to flee in panic .
" The gunmen stormed into the bakery and killed workers while they were baking .
They had done nothing bad , " the Associated Press news agency quoted an unnamed man outside the store as saying .
In other violence , at least three civilians were killed in two explosions elsewhere in the capital .
A bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded in the Amal neighbourhood , killing at least one person , while a blast on Palestine Street in the east of the city killed two others .
The US military also announced the deaths of four of its soldiers in Iraq .
Two were killed by a roadside bomb and another was killed in action in north - east Diyala province on Wednesday ; a fourth died in an operation in Baghdad on Tuesday .

America is finished , washed up , kaput .
Foreign investors and central banks around the world have lost confidence in US markets and are headed for the exits .
The dollar is sinking , the country is insolvent , and its leaders are barking mad .
Investors are voting with their feet .
They ’ve had enough .
Capital is flowing to China and the Far East in a torrent .
It ’s “ sayonara ” downtown Manhattan and “ Hello ” Tiananmen Square .
The dollar fell another 2 per cent last night , gold soared to $ 840 per ounce , oil topped $ 98 per barrel , General Motors reported a $ 39 billion loss after the market closed on Tuesday , the real estate market continued its downward slide , and the major investment banks are marching in lock - step towards bankruptcy .
The news is all bad .
The nation ’s economic foundation is in shambles .
US credibility is shot .
Bush and Greenspan have put us on the road to ruin .
Now their work is done .
We ’re flat broke .
The catalogue of fiscal ailments now facing the country is too long to list .
We ’d need a ledger the size of a small encyclopedia .
There ’s been a stampede away from the dollar even though it ’s already lost over 60 per cent of its value since Bush took office and even though central banks around the world will lose their shirts if it collapses .
They do n’t care .
They ’re getting out while they can .
Cheng Siwei , the vice chairman of China ’s National People ’s Congress , announced yesterday that China would continue to diversify its $ 1.4 trillion reserves away from the dollar to “ stronger currencies ” like the euro .
“ Strong currencies ” ; is n’t that Paulson ’s line ?
Siwei ’s comments ignited a firestorm in the currency markets triggering a big blow - off of the greenback .
The poor dollar has no place to go now but down , and it ’s on a greased pole to the bottom .
With consumer spending paralyzed by the decline in home equity and frozen wages , and the banks “ stuffed to the gills ” with over a trillion dollars of mortgage - backed sludge ; the prognosis for the hobbled dollar is looking grimmer by the day .
The bulging trade deficits and dwindling foreign inflows have n’t helped either .
The greenback has suddenly become the global pariah ; all it needs is a leper ’s rattle and a tin cup .
The news is no better in the real estate industry either , where the nation ’s biggest builders are reporting record losses and inventory is backed up 11 months .
Sales are off 22 per cent in one year alone .
Foreclosures are skyrocketing , jumbo loans ( over $ 417,000 ) are impossible to get regardless of one ’s credit history , 40 per cent of all mortgages ( subprime , Alt - A , piggyback , reverse amortization , interest - only ) have been eliminated , and entire projects in Florida , Arizona , Las Vegas , and California ’s Central Valley have stopped building altogether .
Tens of thousands of unoccupied homes across the Southwest have been reduced to ghost towns .
Nothing is selling .
The building boom , that began when Alan Greenspan ginned - up the Fed ’s printing presses in 2002 , has turned into the biggest housing bust in American history .
On top of that , the banks are tightening lending standards and shunning potential buyers just when the economy needs a boost in demand .
Loan originations are down and bankers are spooked by the gathering storm in the credit markets .
That means that home sales will continue to be sluggish , prices will correct more quickly , and the anticipated “ soft landing ” will turn into a full - blown crash .
New home construction has accounted for 2 out of every 5 new jobs created in the last 5 years .
Most of those workers are either delivering pizzas , cleaning bed pans or are lining up at the soup kitchen .
The BLS ’s numbers on employment are bogus .
It ’s just more government bunkum .
They ’re predicated on a “ birth - death ” model that creates millions of fictitious jobs out of whole cloth .
In truth , unemployment is soaring and the most vulnerable and impoverished among us are taking a beating from the housing debacle .
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of Washington , the total of mortgage loans outstanding in 2006 was $ 10.9 trillion ; $ 6 trillion of which were transformed into securities ( CDOs , MBSs ) About $ 1.5 trillion of those securities are subprime ; another $ 1 trillion Alt - A ( nearly as risky ) and at least another $ 1.5 trillion in adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) .
At least 20 per cent of these shaky liabilities / securities will default , and yet , no one really knows who is holding them on their books .
All of the major financial institutions  the insurance companies , foreign banks , hedge funds , investment banks — have purchased these CDO “ roadside bombs ” and mixed them in with their other performing loans and hard assets .
The projected explosions have already begun to take their toll on the financial giants — Citigroup and Merrill Lynch are just the latest victims ; others will follow .
The problem ca n’t be fixed with Bernanke ’s low interest rates .
The bad debts are everywhere and must accounted for and written down .
That puts us on the threshold of a jarring market - downturn triggered by an unprecedented number of defaults that will rumble through the entire system .
Bankruptcies will pop up everywhere at random .
It is a blueprint for economic chaos .
And it is unavoidable .
The global markets have never seen a financial typhoon of this magnitude before .
Mortgage lenders , homeowners , banks , hedge funds , bond insurers , etc. will all either go under or feel the sting of a slumping market .
Many of the major investment banks are already broke ; it ’s clear from their own reporting .
Charles Hugh Smith sums it up like this in his recent article “ Empire of Debt : The Great Unraveling ” :
“ If their bad bets were marked to market , Citicorp and Merrill Lynch would be declared insolvent .
Why ?
Because they are insolvent — right now .
The meaning of insolvency is straightforward : their losses exceed their capital .
Recall that these firms list assets of $ 100 billion ( or whatever ) but their actual net capital is on the order of 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent — a mere sliver of their stated assets .
In other words : a 5 per cent loss of their stated assets wipes them out .
The game is now over , and the players shuffling losses can only last a few more days or weeks . ”
Up to this point , the banks have been able to place a sizeable portion of their “ hard - to - value ” assets in a Level - 3 grab bag , which allowed company accountants to assign a value to those assets according to their own judgment .
No more .
The new FASB 157 regulation will force the banks to use “ market prices ” to determine the true value of their holdings .
Some analysts believe that these new disclosure rules may result in $ 200 billion write - downs on assets and require the over - leveraged banks to increase their capital reserves .
That will slow down lending and put a wrinkle in the banks ’ bottom line .
In any event , once the law is enacted ; we ’ll see who ’s “ faking ” the value of their assets or as Warren Buffett says , “ Who ’s swimming with their clothes off .
Professor Nouriel Roubinisummed it up like this :
“ The amount of losses that financial institutions have already recognized — $ 20 billion — is just the very tip of the iceberg of much larger losses that will end up in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
Calling this crisis a sub - prime meltdown is ludicrous as by now the contagion has seriously spread to near prime and prime mortgages .
And it is spreading to every corner of the securitized financial system that is either frozen or on the way to freeze .
The reality is that most financial institutions have barely started to recognize the lower “ fair value ” of their impaired securities .
The credit crunch is getting worse and its financial and real fallout will be severe . ” ( Nouriel Roubini blog . )
The constant drumbeat of bad news is having a numbing affect on Wall Street .
Traders ’ are tight - lipped and downcast .
Spirits are sagging .
No one likes losing money , and yet , the credit storm shows no signs of letting up anytime soon .
Yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial ’s took another 360 - point pounding before the bell rang .
Another day , another bloodbath .
The subprime virus has now infected the broader markets leaving the once - brawny financial giants bruised and reeling like Joe Frazier in the Thrilla in Manila .
A few more down - days like yesterday and they ’ll be carrying out hedge funds feet first .
The stock market is looking more and more like a glass pitcher propped up on the edge of a bookshelf .
One little bump , and down she goes .

The Best of Mike Whitney
Yesterday , I pointed out that in Osama Bin Laden ’s latest putative address to the American people , the only references to current events are made at points where the video is curiously frozen , suggesting that an older video was altered for the purpose of creating this new release .
This anomaly is blatantly apparent and cannot have escaped the attention of U.S. intelligence analysts .
Yet the very same day , U.S. Homeland Security advisor Frances Townsend was on Fox News where she stated regarding the video : “ Well , for sure , the intelligence community , having looked at it , believes it is bin Laden .
The indications from the contents of the tape are that it was made recently , certainly in the last several months . ”
Townsend went on to say that analysis of the video is continuing , and cautioned that “ the particulars of the technical analysis are not something we ’re going to reveal . ”
Nonetheless , I think Frances Townsend owes the American people some explanation of how the U.S. intelligence community arrived at the conclusion that this highly dubious video is authentic .
The twenty lies of George W. Bush
By Patrick Martin
20 March 2003
Monday night ’s 15 - minute speech by President Bush , setting a 48 - hour deadline for war against Iraq , went beyond the usual distortions , half - truths , and appeals to fear and backwardness to include a remarkable number of barefaced , easily refuted lies .
The enormous scale of the lying suggests two political conclusions : the Bush administration is going to war against Iraq with utter contempt for democracy and public opinion , and its war propaganda counts heavily on the support of the American media , which not only fails to challenge the lies , but repeats and reinforces them endlessly .
Without attempting to be exhaustive , it is worthwhile listing some of the most important lies and contrasting Bush ’s assertions with the public record .
All of the false statements listed below are directly quoted from the verbatim transcript of Bush ’s remarks published on the Internet .
Lie No. 1 : “ My fellow citizens , events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision . ”
The decision for war with Iraq was made long ago , the intervening time having been spent in an attempt to create the political climate in which US troops could be deployed for an attack .
According to press reports , most recently March 16 in the Baltimore Sun , at one of the first National Security Council meetings of his presidency , months before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon , Bush expressed his determination to overthrow Saddam Hussein and his willingness to commit US ground troops to an attack on Iraq for that purpose .
All that was required was the appropriate pretext — supplied by September 11 , 2001 .
Lie No. 2 : “ For more than a decade , the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war . ”
The US - led United Nations regime of sanctions against Iraq , combined with “ no - fly ” zones and provocative weapons inspections , is one of brutal oppression .
The deliberate withholding of food , medical supplies and other vital necessities is responsible for the death of more than a million Iraqis , half of them children .
Two UN officials who headed the oil - for - food program resigned in protest over the conditions created in Iraq by the sanctions .
The CIA used the inspectors as a front , infiltrating agents into UNSCOM , the original inspections program .
The CIA ’s aim was to spy on Iraq ’s top officials and target Saddam Hussein for assassination .
Lie No. 3 : “ The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage .
It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament ... ”
Iraq has never “ defied ” a Security Council resolution since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 .
It has generally cooperated with the dictates of the UN body , although frequently under protest or with reservations , because many of the resolutions involve gross violations of Iraqi sovereignty .
From 1991 to 1998 , UN inspectors supervised the destruction of the vast bulk of the chemical and biological weapons , as well as delivery systems , which Iraq accumulated ( with the assistance of the US ) during the Iran - Iraq war , and they also destroyed all of Iraq ’s facilities for making new weapons .
Lie No. 4 : “ Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again because we are not dealing with peaceful men . ”
According to the Washington Post of March 16 , referring to the 1991-1998 inspection period : “ [ U ] nder UN supervision , Iraq destroyed 817 of 819 proscribed medium - range missiles , 14 launchers , 9 trailers and 56 fixed missile - launch sites .
It also destroyed 73 of 75 chemical or biological warheads and 163 warheads for conventional explosives .
UN inspectors also supervised destruction of 88,000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions , more than 600 tons of weaponized and bulk chemical weapons agents , 4,000 tons of precursor chemicals and 980 pieces of equipment considered key to production of such weapons . ”
Lie No. 5 : “ The Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised . ”
The Washington Post article cited above noted that CIA officials were concerned “ about whether administration officials have exaggerated intelligence in a desire to convince the American public and foreign governments that Iraq is violating United Nations prohibitions against chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons and long - range missile systems . ”
The article quoted “ a senior intelligence analyst ” who said the inspectors could not locate weapons caches “ because there may not be much of a stockpile . ”
Former British Foreign Minister Robin Cook , who resigned from the Blair government Monday in protest over the decision to go to war without UN authorization , declared , “ Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term . ”
Even if Iraq is concealing some remnants of its 1980s arsenal , these would hardly deserve Bush ’s lurid description , since they are primitive and relatively ineffective .
“ Some of the most lethal weapons ever devised ” are those being unleashed by the United States on Iraq : cruise missiles , smart bombs , fuel - air explosives , the 10,000 - pound “ daisy - cutter ” bomb , the 20,000 - pound MOAB just tested in Florida .
In addition , the US has explicitly refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons .
Lie No. 6 : “ [ Iraq ] has aided , trained and harbored terrorists , including operatives of Al Qaeda . ”
No one , not even US government , seriously believes there is a significant connection between the Islamic fundamentalists and the secular nationalist Ba’athist regime in Iraq , which have been mortal enemies for decades .
The continued assertion of an Al Qaeda - Iraq alliance is a desperate attempt to link Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks .
It also serves to cover up the responsibility of American imperialism for sponsoring Islamic fundamentalist terrorism .
The forces that now comprise Al Qaeda were largely recruited , trained , armed and set in motion by the CIA itself , as part of a long - term policy of using Islamic fundamentalists as a weapon against left - wing movements in the Muslim countries .
This policy was pursued from the 1950s and was escalated prior to and during the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan , which ended in 1989 .
Osama bin Laden himself was part of the CIA - backed mujaheddin forces in Afghanistan before he turned against Washington in the 1990s .
Lie No. 7 : “ America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully . ”
The Bush administration went to the United Nations because it wanted UN sanction for military action and it wanted UN member states to cough up funds for postwar operations , along the lines of its financial shakedown operation for the 1991 Persian Gulf War .
Bush ’s most hawkish advisors , such as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney , initially opposed going to the UN because they did not want diplomacy to slow down the drive to war .
They only agreed after Secretary of State Colin Powell argued that the pace of the US military buildup in the Persian Gulf gave enough time to get the UN to rubber - stamp the war .
Lie No. 8 : “ These governments [ the Security Council majority ] share our assessment of the danger , but not our resolve to meet it . ”
This is belied by virtually every statement on Iraq issued by the governments of France , Russia , China , Germany and other countries opposed to military action , which have repeatedly declared that they see no imminent threat from Iraq .
Bush brands his opponents on the Security Council as cowards , as though they were afraid to take action against Saddam Hussein .
These countries were , in fact , increasingly alarmed — by the United States , not Iraq .
Insofar as they summoned up resolve , to the shock of the Bush administration , it was to deny UN support for the war that Washington had already decided to wage .
Lie No. 9 : “ Many nations , however , do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace , and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world . ”
Only three nations are contributing military forces to the war : 250,000 from the US , 40,000 from Britain , and 2,000 from Australia .
The other members of the “ broad coalition ” are those which have been bribed or browbeaten to allow the US to fly over their countries to bomb Iraq , to station troops , ships or warplanes on their territory , or provide technical assistance or other material aid to the war .
None will do any fighting .
All are acting against the expressed desire of their own population .
Lie No. 10 : “ The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities , so we will rise to ours . ”
Bush defines the UN body ’s responsibility as serving as a rubber stamp for whatever action the United States government demands .
In relation to the UN , however , the United States does have definite responsibilities , including refraining from waging war without Security Council authorization , except in the case of immediate self - defense .
Under Article 42 of the UN Charter , it is for the Security Council , not the US or Britain , to decide how Security Council resolutions such as 1441 are to be enforced .
The US decision to “ enforce ” its interpretation of 1441 regardless of the will of the Security Council is a violation of international law .
Lie No. 11 : “ If we must begin a military campaign , it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you . ”
The widely reported US military strategy is to conduct an aerial bombardment of Iraq so devastating that it will “ shock and awe ” the Iraqi people and compel the Iraqi armed forces to surrender en masse .
According to one press preview , US and British forces “ plan to launch the deadliest first night of air strikes on a single country in the history of air power .
Hundreds of targets in every region of Iraq will be hit simultaneously . ”
Estimates of likely Iraqi civilian casualties from the immediate impact of bombs and missiles range from thousands to hundreds of thousands , and even higher when the long - term effects are included .
Lie No. 12 : “ As our coalition takes their power , we will deliver the food and medicine you need . ”
This is particularly cynical , since the immediate consequence of Bush ’s 48 - hour ultimatum was the withdrawal of all UN humanitarian aid workers and the shutdown of the oil - for - food program , which underwrites the feeding of 60 percent of Iraq ’s population .
As for medicine , the US has systematically deprived the Iraqi people of needed medicine for the past 12 years , insisting that even the most basic medical supplies , like antibiotics and syringes , be banned as “ dual-use ” items that could be used in a program of biological warfare .
Lie No. 13 : “ We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free . ”
The goal of the Bush administration is to install a US puppet regime in Baghdad , initially taking the form of an American military dictatorship .
It is no exaggeration to say that the US government has been the leading promoter of dictatorships around the world , from Pinochet of Chile to Suharto of Indonesia to Saddam Hussein himself , who , according to one recent report , got his political start as an anti-communist hit - man working in a CIA - backed plot to assassinate Iraq ’s left - nationalist President Qasem in 1959 .
A classified State Department report described by the Los Angeles Times of March 14 not only concluded that a democratic Iraq was unlikely to arise from the devastation of war , it suggested that this was not even desirable from the standpoint of American interests , because “ anti-American sentiment is so pervasive that elections in the short term could lead to the rise of Islamic - controlled governments hostile to the United States . ”
Lie No. 14 : “ Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation , the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war and every measure will be taken to win it . ”
This combines a lie and a brutal truth .
The Bush administration has taken every possible measure to insure that war takes place , viewing the resumption of UN weapons inspections with barely disguised hostility and directing its venom against those countries that have suggested a diplomatic settlement with Iraq is achievable .
In prosecuting the war , the Bush administration is indeed prepared to use “ every measure , ” up to an including nuclear weapons , in order to win it .
Lie No. 15 : “ War has no certainty except the certainty of sacrifice . ”
There will be colossal sacrifices for the Iraqi people , and sacrifices in blood and economic well - being for the American people as well .
But for Bush ’s real constituency , the wealthiest layer at the top of American society , there will be no sacrifices at all .
Instead , the administration is seeking a tax cut package of over $ 700 billion , including the abolition of taxation on corporate dividends .
Major US corporations are in line to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from the rebuilding of Iraqi infrastructure shattered by the coming US assault .
These include the oil construction firm Halliburton , which Vice President Cheney headed prior to joining the Bush administration , and which continues to include Cheney on its payroll .
Lie No. 16 : “ [ T ] he only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military , and we are prepared to do so . ”
Every aggressor claims to deplore the suffering of war and seeks to blame the victim for resisting , and thus prolonging the agony .
Bush is no different .
His hypocritical statements of “ concern ” for the Iraqi people cannot disguise the fact that , as many administration apologists freely admit , this is “ a war of choice ” — deliberately sought by the US government to pursue its strategic agenda in the Middle East .
Lie No. 17 : “ The terrorist threat to America and the world will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed . ”
No one , even in the American military - intelligence complex , seriously believes this .
US counter - terrorism officials have repeatedly said that a US conquest and occupation of Iraq , by killing untold thousands of Arabs and Muslims and inflaming public opinion in the Arab world and beyond , will spark more terrorism , not less .
Lie No. 18 : “ We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater .
In one year , or five years , the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over . ”
This is belied by the record of the past twelve years , which has seen a steady decline in Iraqi military power .
Saddam Hussein has never been a threat to any “ free nation , ” if that term has any meaning , only to the reactionary oil sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf and to neighboring Iran , all ruled by regimes that are as repressive as his .
Lie No. 19 : “ As we enforce the just demands of the world , we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country . ”
The demands of the world were expressed by the millions who marched in cities throughout the world on February 15 and March 15 to oppose a unilateral US attack on Iraq .
Bush seeks to have it both ways — claiming to enforce previous Security Council resolutions against Iraq ( “ the just demands of the world ” ) , while flagrantly defying the will of the majority of the Security Council , the majority of the world ’s governments , and the vast majority of the world ’s people .
Lie No. 20 : “ Unlike Saddam Hussein , we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty ...
The United States with other countries will work to advance liberty and peace in that region . ”
For “ the Iraqi people , ” substitute “ the Egyptian people , ” “ the people of the Arabian peninsula , ” “ the Pakistani people ” or those of other US - backed dictatorships , not to mention the Palestinians who live under a brutal Israeli occupation that is supported by Washington .
Does the US government believe that any of them are “ deserving and capable of human liberty ? ”
When the parliament of Turkey , under the pressure of popular opposition , voted to bar the US from using Turkish territory to invade Iraq , the Bush administration appealed to the Turkish military to pressure the government into overturning this democratic decision .

LOS ANGELES , Sept. 9 — Kevin Morris had just negotiated a landmark deal that set Hollywood buzzing , giving the creators of “ South Park , ” Matt Stone and Trey Parker , a precedent - setting 50 percent stake in the cartoon ’s success on the Web and other emerging media .
For Mr. Morris , this might have been the coup of a career .
But he is already onto his next project : trying to build bridges between Hollywood and Silicon Valley .
In November , Mr. Morris wants to put entertainment and technology people together to hash out differences and dream up new deals .
He will model it on the Sun Valley conference for media moguls , but plans to invite producers , directors , agents and others who understand the importance of the shift to new media — including the talent .
“ It ’s great that those guys all meet and talk and ride bikes , ” Mr. Morris said , “ but I ’m not sure the exchange of ideas is happening at a more functional level . ”
He hopes to get people who think things up for a living to start asking questions — like why there is still no Hollywood soap opera , variety show or drama on the Web .
Do n't let others get you down .
Not naysayers , not pretenders , not appeasers , not opportunists ; none of em .
What others do pales beside what YOU do .
Press on ! - The r3VOLution continues ...
" Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence .
Talent will not ; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent .
Genius will not ; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb .
Education will not ; the world is full of educated derelicts .
Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent .
The slogan ' press on ' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race . "

Asked if Iraq war was worth it , President Bush 's Defense Secretary Gates says , ' I do n't know '
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday September 20 , 2007
Print This Email This Bush 's cabinet has gone off - script .
In an interview with New York Times columnist David Brooks Wednesday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked if the Iraq war was worth it .
His response : " If I 'd known then what I know now , would I have done the same ?
I think the answer is , ' I do n't know . ' "

Excerpts from Brooks ' column follow :
After the speech , I asked him about the best ways to spread democracy .
ï¿½We have a variety of tools .
Not all of them are hammers .
Ronald Reagan deployed more of the array than many , ï¿½ he said .
Reagan used forceful rhetoric , but also small displays of force ï¿½ shooting down Libyan jets over the Gulf of Sidra ï¿½ to demonstrate American resolve .
ï¿ ½I donï¿½t think you invade Iraq to bring liberty .
You do it to eliminate an unstable regime and because sanctions are breaking down and you get liberty as a byproduct , ï¿½ he continued .
I asked him whether invading Iraq was a good idea , knowing what we know now .
He looked at me for a bit and said , ï¿ ½I donï¿½t know .ï¿½ ...
Gates says there were serious disagreements among the generals about troop levels before the bombing of a revered Shiite mosque in Samarra in February 2006 , but not so much now .
He initiated various internal reviews of Iraq , and they all came back roughly where Gen. David Petraeus is now .
ï¿½How often is a policy announced without a leak from the Pentagon ?ï¿½ he asks , as proof of unanimity .
Over the long term , Gates represents a shift in the foreign policy center of gravity .
Over the short term , he is , to use a phrase he borrows from the historian Joseph Ellis , ï¿½improvising on the edge of catastrophe .ï¿ ½
Three Devon councillors have quit the Liberal Democrats after discovering that a fellow party member is offering herself as a £ 75 a pop topless stripogram , the Telegraph reports .
Myrna Bushell , 34 , secured a seat on Bideford council in May , along with hubby Mel .
Voters were probably unaware , however , that she leads a double life as " Jessica " , a " very sexy auburn professional multi- talented adult & non-adult entertainer " who 's shamelessly punting herself online .
She also apparently runs a £ 1.50 - a- minute sex line from her home , which proved too much for Tony Inch , his brother Simon , and deputy Mayor Caroline Church who harrumphed out of the Lib Dems and now sit as independents .
A joint statement issued by the three declared : " We believe that our integrity and principles will be compromised if we stay . "
Bushell retorted : " There are elements here that run deeper .
The reason I do them is to pay my bills and be able to spend quality time with my family .
It 's not incompatible with being an elected councillor and it's not illegal .
Three people seem to be upset but no one else is - I 've got to earn a living somehow .
Caroline Church has n't liked me from the beginning . "
Council clerk George McLauchlan confirmed Bushell had " not breached the councillors ' code of conduct because her business activities do not impinge on her duties as a councillor " . ®

37 Reasons to Love Haskell ( playing off the Ruby article )
Here ’s an article on reasons to like Ruby .
It ’s actually very well written and persuasive .
So I took it as a challenge .
How well would Haskell fare when compared against this specific set of criteria , changing the points as little as possible ?
The meanings will inevitably shift a bit , and readers will know that Haskell has its own set of advantages , of course .
The point of this exercise , though , is to see how Haskell does in the benefits mentioned for Ruby in that particular article .
It ’s not a Haskell vs. Ruby ; just a shameless theft of a set of criteria .
Should be fun .
It ’s object oriented .
Although it was n’t designed for it , this paper points out that Haskell scores pretty well in support for object oriented programming features .
It ’s not entirely clear that this is a good way to write code ; but if it is n’t , it ’s not because Haskell does n’t provide the features or support you need to make it work .
It ’s pure .
Haskell chooses to be pure in the functional sense , rather than the object - oriented sense .
The same ideas remain , though ; there are no messy bits that do n’t fit into the prevailing mode of thought .
It ’s a dynamic language .
Yep , you heard right .
Projects like
Yi and hs - plugins and lambdabot prove that it ’s quite possible to write programs with runtime code loading and manipulation and other dynamic features in Haskell .
Indeed , the type system gives you a level of assurance that you have n’t made big mistakes along the way ; something that ’s quite likely when assembling code at runtime from many small pieces .
It ’s an interpreted language .
Honestly , I ’m having trouble understanding this point in the original ; the Ruby article does n’t ever say why this is a good thing .
It helps , of course , in that it lets you work with the program interactively , easily trying out bits at a time rather than having to write a new main method to do any testing .
Unlike Ruby , Haskell can also be compiled to handle any performance concerns ; combining the advantages of both worlds .
It understands regular expressions .
The Text .
Regex module in the Haskell standard library contains functions to do regular expression stuff .
It even uses Haskell ’s operator mechanism to define operators like =~ to look more like other languages sometimes .
It ’s multi-platform .
GHC , the major Haskell compiler , exists for Linux ( many processors and distributions ) , Other UNIX - like systems ( FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD , Solaris ) , many Windows variants ( 95 through Vista ) , and MacOS ( Intel and PowerPC ) .
Nobody cares about MS - DOS :) .
It ’s derivative .
Haskell as a language borrows many of the best features from other languages , especially ML ( its type system ) , and Miranda ( its evaluation order ) .
It borrows libraries from lots of places .
There are Haskell bindings for wxWindows and GTK + , for example .
And yes , printf , too .
It ’s innovative .
If there ’s any single widely used language today that has a claim to being truly innovative , it ’s Haskell .
Haskell is practically a research playground , while still managing to be a practical language .
New language features have been the bread and butter of its progress : type classes , monadic I/O and computational environments ; more recently : GADTs , associated types .
All of these are rare in other languages .
It ’s a Very High - Level Language ( VHLL ) .
I actually doubt this term has any kind of meaning at all ; but if it does , then Haskell has quite a good claim to fitting its meaning .
To the extent that the high / low level language distinction is meaningful , it ’s about the ability of software to transform the program from something that ’s useful to programmers into something that ’s efficient and executable on machines .
More work is going on here in Haskell ( e.g. , see the Data Parallel Haskell project ) than in any other language I ’m aware of .
It has a smart garbage collector .
I ’m not sure this should even be worth a mention on the list .
Languages without automatic memory management are simply not candidates for writing serious application level code in the modern world .
For what it ’s worth , though , yes Haskell does it .
It ’s a scripting language .
Despite having virtually none of the properties that conventional wisdom associates with scripting languages , Haskell is quite usable for scripting .
Function composition and the monadic >>= operator provide the ability to combine pieces every bit as tersely as pipes ; type inference eliminates the cost of static types .
This page talks about using Haskell for scripting , and this one describes the -e option to ghc , which lets you run Haskell code directly from the command line , and gives an example of using it .
It ’s versatile .
As a general purpose programming language , you can do as much with Haskell as practically anything .
Scripting is simple , as described above .
Haskell also has a very advanced application server letting you write complex web applications ; has been used to write a very nice window manager , is widely used in financial and other industries , and has been used to implement other languages — itself and the very first implementation of Perl 6 .
It ’s thread - capable .
And more !
There are basically two languages worth looking at for modern concurrent programming : Erlang and Haskell .
Haskell implements not just multithreading , but three different higher - level abstractions on top of multithreading : Software Transactional Memory , Data Parallel Haskell , and basic Parallel Haskell .
All three provide tools to make it easier to build correct threaded programs .
( Of course , Haskell offers less interesting traditional concurrency abstractions as well . )
It ’s open - source .
All Haskell implementations have the source code fully available .
The major people involved hang out and regularly respond by both mailing lists ( newsgroup interface available , too ) and even IRC channels .
Haskell has one of the most famously open and friendly communities around , so you ’ll fit right in !
It ’s intuitive .
Haskell does n’t have a shallow learning curve , but that ’s because you ’re really learning things ; not just learning a new syntax for the same programming you ’ve done for years .
Haskell stays out of the way and lets your mind be expanded by the concepts you ’re seeing instead of by the arbitrary choices of the language implementors .
That ’s about as intuitive as you can really ask for .
It handles exceptions well .
Unlike practically any other language , Haskell does the right thing for computations that have exceptional cases .
When working in a purely functional way , it gives you simple types like Either and Maybe that help to express those exceptional conditions in a functional manner .
When you ’re working in an imperative way ( e.g. , in the IO monad , or any other MonadPlus environment ) it provides exception handling , since that ’s the right choice for the imperative style .
It has an advanced Array type .
You do n’t have to declare types at compile - time , or allocate memory in advance , or keep up with their length , or worry about indexing out of bounds ( unless you explicitly choose to use unsafe operations ) .
Unlike many other languages , though , arrays are n’t syntactically preferred .
It ’s just as easy to use a map , list , sequence , or many other things depending on what best suits your application .
It ’s extensible .
You can write external libraries in Haskell or in C .
You can declare new instances ( in other words add new behaviors to existing type signatures ; gives you the core benefit of modifying existing classes ) on the fly .
You can also add new operators ( and I do mean new operators , not rehashing a very limited set of operators in error - prone ways like you do in C++ ) and use monads to define whole new computational environments if you like .
It encourages literate programming .
Even if you are n’t really doing literate programming , you can embed comments in your code which the Haddock tool will extract and manipulate .
You can look at type information even if it was never documented at all , simply by asking GHCi or Hugs for the type .
If you ’re really into literate programming , though , major Haskell compilers understand literate source files that default to comments , and only include code delimited in specific ways ( birdtracks , or latex begin / end commands ) .
This lets you , quite literally , compile the same document into either executable code or a details PDF user manual , without even having to do anything unusual to your latex source !
It uses punctuation and capitalization creatively .
Haskell enforces a punctuation scheme that makes the meaning of code clearer .
Types , classes , modules , and data constructors begin with upper - case letters .
Variables ( including type variables ) start with lower - case letters .
Fortunately , though , a lot of very important information is stored in the type — including , for example , whether a function result is Boolean or not , and even whether it destructively updates something !
This information is available at your fingertips either by reading documentation or just by typing :t at the GHCi command prompt , so you do n’t have to repeat it over and over again in your code .
( Some ) reserved words are n’t .
Haskell has very few reserved words compared to most other languages , because the language itself is conceptually simpler ( not to be confused with easier to learn , as mentioned earlier ) .
A few keywords are n’t reserved , but I ca n’t pretend that ’s a good thing .
It allows iterators .
More generally , higher - order functions are useful in a large number of situations .
When combined with lazy evaluation , there are a plethora of powerful techniques for handling collections of data in Haskell .
Iterators loosely correspond to maps and folds , which are well supported and widely used .
It has safety and security features .
Haskell provides as advanced a set of fool - proof safety and security features as is found in basically any language .
Its type system allows you to express security constraints ( even rather generalized ones ) in embedded domain - specific constructs that can be enforced by the compiler , so you never even attempt to run unsafe code !
If a new kind of security issue arises , it ’s generally possible to use the powerful type system to solve the problem without waiting for language support for something like tainted data .
It ( really ) has no pointers .
Unlike the trivial sense in which languages like Java are claimed to have no pointers by restricting the most dangerous operations on them , Haskell really has no pointers .
( It ’s worth noting that the Java language specification was n’t fooled into the “ no pointers ” myth , as a peek as the second sentence of 4.3.1 in the 3rd edition spec will make clear . )
In a pure functional language , there ’s no difference between using pointers and actual values , so the compiler can make the decision based on performance concerns , rather than exposing the distinction between pointers and data to the programmer .
This is part of Haskell ’s being a higher level language .
It pays attention to detail .
This is one of those Orwellian newspeak things where the Ruby article I ’m working from claims one thing ( attention to detail ) and then describes the opposite ( extreme sloppiness ) .
Haskell follows the real attention to detail picture here , though you can define your own synonyms ( for values or types ) if you like .
It has a flexible syntax .
Haskell has a truly flexible syntax in ways that Ruby ca n’t dream of .
It allows programmers to embed domain - specific languages that are significantly and fundamentally different from the imperative model of Ruby .
Parsers can be written by embedding context - free grammars right into the source code .
Logic processing can be added by embedding Prolog - style inference rules into the language .
An infinite supply of operators are available to facilitate these languages .
Higher - order functions and monadic environments are available to make them work well .
It has a rich set of libraries .
Available libraries is one place where Haskell is way above practically all languages with similar community sizes , and in the ballpark of a lot of mainstream languages .
There are libraries for practically anything , including several for GUI programming , web programming , transactional persistence , and plenty else besides .
I would n’t want to try to list them all , so here .
It has a debugger .
Okay , so this is the biggest stretch yet .
The development version of GHC ( to become GHC 6.8 ) actually does have a debugger ; but the debugging tools for released versions of Haskell are sketchy at best .
This is improving .
It can be used interactively .
This is true in the sense that GHCi exists .
It ’s less true in the sense that someone can use it as their login shell .
Yes , it ’s possible ; no , it ’s probably not a good idea .
This is interesting , though .
It is concise .
Haskell code is about comparable to many scripting languages .
Sometimes it ’s a little longer .
Sometimes ( generally when one can make good use of powerful abstraction techniques like monads and higher - order functions ina program of large enough size that it makes a difference ) it ’s a lot shorter .
The xmonad window manager is about 500 lines of code .
It is expression - oriented .
As a purely functional language , of course it ’s expression - oriented .
It is laced with syntactic sugar .
Haskell ’s got all sorts of nice syntax in ways that really matter quite a lot : custom operators and fixity declarations , do blocks for monadic computation , etc .
It has operator overloading .
In fact , operator overloading in Haskell is far nicer than in most other languages , because you can make up your own operators .
No more confusing bit shifting with I/O .
Within a given context , an operator means a specific thing ; but at the same time , it can apply to your custom types ( ah , the magic of type classes ) and you can make up your own different operators to do different things concisely .
Reading a journal paper that uses dotted relational operators to mean something ?
Great !
Use them in Haskell , too .
It has infinite - precision integer arithmetic .
It also has infinite - precision rational arithmetic , and fixed - precision types in case you want those , too .
And you can build your own types somewhat concisely .
It has an exponentiation operator .
Actually , it has three !
This is because there ’s a difference in what the three of them mean in some cases , so you get your choice .
It has powerful string handling .
It does , but more importantly it also has powerful list handling , and these list handling routines are all usable on strings .
It has few exceptions to its rules .
Haskell ’s semantics are basically the lambda calculus .
The whole language is remarkably consistent and behaves in consistent ways .
The semantics are even simpler and easier to understand than any imperative language , which has to do with the distinction between values and variables ; or eager languages , which have to deal with the question of evaluation order .
This makes Haskell programs very easy to understand and manipulate safely .
So there you have it .
WESTERN DIGITAL - FILE LOCK OUT
Western Digital sells a range of networked hard drives , which allows users to share files across both a local network of home computers and across the net .
But the firm has now blocked remote access to 30 different types of media files , including MP3s and MP4s , to users running its Anywhere Access program .
The company says it has done this as an anti-piracy effort , to prevent people from copying and sharing copyright files .
But the block makes no distinction between files which are user generated , such as home movies , and paid - for , DRM - protected content .
ZUNE - SHARE AND SHARE NOT ALIKE
When Microsoft introduced its Zune media player to rival the iPod it boasted a supposed killer feature - the ability to share songs wirelessly with friends .
Unfortunately , the Zune not only failed to support the Digital Rights Management system Microsoft had pioneered for its partners , it also restricted the sharing of a song to " three plays or three days , whichever comes first " .
Users were able to share a song but a friend had a limited number of plays and time , in which to listen to it .
And the restriction applied to any kind of music file - even if it was a track recorded by the user himself .
Strangely , many of the songs offered to Zune users for download from Microsoft 's online store could not be shared at all due to " rights restrictions " .
Microsoft has now lifted the time restrictions for listening to shared tracks .
NOKIA - FREE MUSIC ?
The world 's largest mobile phone manufacturer has decided to tackle rampant music piracy by offering tracks for free to its customers .
The Comes With Music service will let owners of its premium handsets download as much music as they like to their phone or PC from the Universal catalogue .
There is no cost to download or a subscription fee .
But there is a proviso - if users want to burn the music to a CD to play on a separate player , or in the car , they have to pay out .
GOOGLE - NOW YOU SEE IT , NOW YOU DON'T
Before Google bought YouTube its foray into the world of online video was championed by its own - brand video store .
The Google Video store let people buy TV shows such as Star Trek and CSI , which were protected by digital rights management .
Unfortunately , when Google decided to shut down the store in favour of supporting YouTube it left customers who had bought content unable to continue to play their videos .
Google initially offered its customers credit through its own online payment service , called Checkout , but after complaints it changed its mind and offered users a straight refund .
The issue highlighted concerns that digital content bought by consumers that is protected by DRM may not always be accessible if the content producer and / or distributors removes its support for the format .
SONY - THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
In 2005 Sony took a new approach to protecting its CDs from copying by including software on the discs which automatically installed on a PC if the disc was played in a computer .
The software was designed to prevent copying but it also left PCs open to potential hacker and virus attacks .
Consumers were not told of the software on the discs and the discs themselves gave no indication of the copy protection software stored on them .
After the problems were highlighted Sony released a tool which would remove the program from users ' computers - but it too had security issues .
Sony ultimately recalled the discs with the software installed and after a series of high - profile , class - action lawsuits paid out to consumers who had bought the CDs .
ITUNES - DRM HERE BUT NOT THERE
When Steve Jobs issued his open letter decrying DRM on music many observers felt that the tide was beginning to shift against DRM .
Apple 's iTunes store now offers users MP3s of music , without copy restrictions , from the EMI back catalogue .
But Steve Jobs has said the move did not mean an end to DRM on videos it sells via iTunes .
" The music and video markets are not parallel .
The video industry does not deliver 90 % of its content DRM - free , " he said .
CONSOLES - HI -DEF FUTURE ?
The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are capable of producing high definition video , up to 1080 p , or so - called Full HD resolutions .
If you buy the HD - DVD player add - on for the Xbox 360 you can playback movies in the highest resolution available today , assuming your TV can support it , while PS3s can play Blu-ray movies out of the box .
However , all Xbox 360 consoles sold in the first 18 months from launch , and the first few months in the case of the low - end PS3's availability , do not have a so - called HDMI port .
This is a digital interface to output video and audio , which can encrypt the information being sent to the TV to prevent copying .
HDMI is part of a system which allows content producers to protect their material by placing a protection flag on it , called an Image Constraint Token .
This means devices that do not have a HDMI port ( or DVI port ) will not be able to play the content at the fullest resolution .
Potentially , it means many Xbox 360 owners and some early PS3 enthusiasts would not be able to play their legally bought HD - DVD and Blu-ray movies in the best quality , despite the fact Microsoft and Sony are leading supporters of HD technology .
So far , no HD - DVD or Blu-ray titles released have used the protection flag , but the technology is there to be implemented and it could mean millions of console owners would only be able to play their films at a quarter of the potential resolution .
VIRGIN - SHUT OUT
When Virgin launched its digital offering , including a subscription " music club " , in 2004 Sir Richard Branson boasted : " With a strong music heritage behind us , as a record label and a retailer , Virgin has a huge advantage , and platform to launch a digital service that will become the ultimate destination to buy , stream , burn and enjoy the best the music world has to offer . "
Like many online music stores , it came with DRM designed to prevent copyright theft and to enable users to rent their music .
But when the site shut down in September this year it left members of The Music Club unable to play their songs , because they could no longer renew their monthly fee .
For customers who had paid extra to transfer their music to an MP3 player this was doubly frustrating .

Avir harim kalul ba’yayin , ve reach oranim …
The opening lines of Naomi Shemer ’s legendary Yerushalayim Shel Zahav ( Jerusalem of Gold ) can still bring goosebumps to my flesh , even decades after I deconstructed and relinquished the mythology connoted by the old Basque lullaby she repurposed as an ode to Israel ’s conquest of East Jerusalem in June of 1967 .
I first heard the song at age 8 in a documentary film shown at my afternoon Hebrew class ( ugh ! ) , all gorgeous evening sunshine glowing pink off the old city , as it related the “ miracle ” of Israel ’s “ six - day ” triumph over its Arab neighbors in that year .
And it made me feel good , in an epic kind of way .
Already the song had become a kind of anthem , an emotional seduction into the notion of the conquest of East Jerusalem somehow signifying Jewish salvation .
Steven Spielberg even planned to include it in the grossly misleading postcard he tacked on to the end of Schindler ’s List , in which Holocaust survivors are shown in Jerusalem as if this was somehow a triumph over Nazism , although he dropped the idea after Israeli test audiences found the connection discordant .
But rarely has there been a more powerful song in the Israeli imagination , precisely because of the giddily messianic atmosphere that prevailed in Israel in the wake of the war — an atmosphere that blinded Israelis to the calamitous implications of their conquest .
But hey , even at age 6 , I bought into that atmosphere .
There was no such thing as television in South Africa in 1967 , so it was through grainy black - and - white photographs in the evening newspaper that I learned that Mirage jet fighters — the same delta - winged plane flown over my house with great , and occasionally sound barrier - breaking regularity by the South African Air Force to and from nearby Ysterplaat air base , although the ones in the paper bore the Star of David on their wing tips — had destroyed Egypt ’s MiG squadrons on the ground .
And with those images , and later ones of paratroopers in webbed helmets at the Wailing Wall , that I learned of the “ miracle ” — Israel , the tiny Jewish state whose map I knew from the blue and white money tin into which we would put a coin every Friday night after Shabbos dinner , had faced down the combined armies of its Arab neighbors , and had dispatched them within six days .
And they had “ liberated ” our “ holiest ” site , an old stone wall in East Jerusalem pocked with pubic clumps of weeds , into whose cracks and crannies I was told that Jews could insert notes to be read by God — like a hotel message cubby .
( Let ’s just say that by the time I got there , at age 17 , this bubbemeis about holy stones and a celestial post office only fueled my atheism . )
Not only that , they ’d made Israel “ safe ” by “ liberating ” the whole of the West Bank , Gaza and the Golan Heights .
In six days !
A miracle , like the creation story in Genesis !
( Of course , many years later , I would learn that it had n’t even taken that long ; Israel had attacked first and effectively won the war in the opening hours by destroying its enemy ’s air forces on the ground —
Six Days just sounded like a good name for a war given the creation story . )
Even at the age of six , my first year in big school , Israel ’s victory had a profound effect on me .
The previous year , I had heard my older step - brothers describe a Phys - Ed class being turned into a kind of playful pogrom , in some sort of fighting game that had pitched the Jewish boys against the rest .
Being Jewish jocks , they had , according to my brothers ’ account over dinner , given as good as they ’d gotten , and it was a genuinely playful thing , besides — the sort of playful contest I recall from my older years that often saw a class divide on lines of “ Boer against Brit , ” i.e .
Afrikaans kids against English - speakers , recalling the Boer War .
But at six years old , the idea of a small group of Jewish boys being surrounded and set upon by their gentile classmates was absolutely terrifying .
But the news out of Israel in those mid-year months in 1967 was infinitely reassuring .
Israel ’s dramatic victory had proved that we , the prickly little state or the Jewish boys in their white Phys - ed ( we called it PT ) vests and shorts , were not to be fucked with .
( I remember a similar effect a decade later , after the audacious raid on Entebbe had freed a group of passengers held on a hijacked Air France plane in Uganda — by then , my friends and I were literally accepting congratulations on Israel ’s behalf . )
And , I know anecdotally as much as anything else , that anyone ever called a “ Jewboy ” anywhere in the world walked a lot taller after the first week of June in 1967 .
We were certainly granted the recognition on the playground that the epic victory demanded .
The idea of Jews as being weaklings or afraid to fight was buried ; white South Africa with its own narrative pitting it as an embattled minority in a sea of hostile neighbors embraced the Israeli victory as an inspiration .
The word “ Arab ” became synonymous , on the playground and in the classroom , with incompetence and idiocy .
“ Do n’t be an Arab ! ” I heard a teacher exclaim , more than once in response to a student ’s failure to properly carry out his instructions .
And , three years after the 1967 war , when the apartheid regime celebrated the tenth anniversary of South Africa ’s formal independence from Britain , the ceremony in my school playground saw my Jewish friends and I , in our blue Habonim shirts and scarves and kakhi shorts , line up alongside the boy scouts and the Voortrekkers ( the fascist Afrikaner youth movement ) to salute the flag and proclaim our loyalty to the Republic ( even though the whole point of Habonim was to persuade us to emigrate ! ) .
A regime rooted in vicious anti-Semitism and explicit admiration for the Nazis had now come to recognize Israel and its local supporters as a fighting ally in their epic struggle , couched in Cold War language , between white peoples and peoples of color .
Die Vaderland ( The Fatherland ) , a newspaper of the apartheid regime , editorialized in 1969 , on the occasion of a visit to South Africa by Ben Gurion , “ When we , from our side , look realistically at the world situation , we know that Israel ’s continued existence in the Middle East is also an essential element in our own security …
If our Jewish citizens were to rally to the call of our distinguished visitor — to help build up Israel — their contribution would in essence be a contribution to South Africa ’s security . ”
South Africa and Israel became intimate allies in the years that followed the ’ 67 war , with unrepentant former Nazis such as Prime Minister B.J. Vorster welcomed to Israel to seal military deals that resulted in collaboration in the development of weapons ranging from aircraft and assault rifles to , allegedly , nuclear weapons .
I remember well how some products of South Africa ’s Jewish day - school system , where Hebrew was taught as well as the mandatory Afrikaans , finding themselvse with cushy posting during their compulsory military services — as Hebrew - Afrikaans translators for Israeli personnel working with the SADF .
And that alliance raised the comfort level of the South African Jewish community in apartheid South Africa — while a handful of Jewish revolutionaries had made up a dominant share of the white ranks of the national liberation movement , they were largely disowned by the mainstream organized Jewish community , which had chosen the path of quiescence and collaboration with the regime .
Their posture , and Israel ’s , were now in perfect alignment .
Fruitful collaboration : The Israeli
military called it the Galil , the SADF
called it the R - 4 , but it was the same gun
Even as I came to recognize and react to the horrors of apartheid , Israel seemed to me to represent a shining alternative .
I remember shocking the grownups at a Pesach seder in 1974 , my Bar Mitzvah year , by telling them that I would never do my compulsory military service in South Africa .
But they smiled and murmured approvingly when I declared that , instead , I would go to Israel and serve in the army there , because that way “ I could fight for something I believe in . ”
( I had , of course , in my cheesy adolescent way , stolen that line from a Jewish character in James A. Michener ’s “ The Drifters , ” who uses it in relation to Vietnam ; but the image in my mind when I read it , as when I said it , was of those paratroopers at the Wailing Wall . )
I could not conceive of Israel as in any way complicit in the crimes of apartheid , much less as engaged in its own forms of apartheid .
After all , my connection to Israel , by the time I was 14 , came largely through Habonim , a socialist - Zionist youth movement whose Zionism was infused with just the sort of left - wing universalism for which my own anti-apartheid subversive instincts yearned .
My Habonim madrichim , bearded radicals from the University of Cape Town opened by mind to Marx and Marcuse , Bob Dylan and Yevtushenko , Woodie Guthrie and Erich Fromm .
I was already a Jewish atheist , and considered myself a socialist , but in my mind , Israel and Kibbutz were the absolute negation of all that was wrong with South Africa ; as a stepping stone to universal brotherhood and equality as expressed in the idealism of early left - wing Zionist thinkers like Ber Borochov , A.D. Gordon and Martin Buber .
It became clear to me soon enough ( by the time I was 18 , to be specific ) that their Zionist idealism — and mine — had no connection to the reality of Israel , largely because it ignored the elephant in the room : the Arab population of Palestine .
II .
The war of 1967 was a continuation of the war of 1948 , a battle over sovereignty , ownership and possession of the land in what had been British - Mandate Palestine .
Sensing the escalating conflict between the Arab population and the European Jewish settlers who had been allowed by the British , since their conquest of Palestine in 1917 , to settle there and establish the infrastructure of statehood — and moved by the impulse to create a sanctuary for the survivors of the Holocaust while avoiding giving most of them the choice of moving to the U.S. or other Western countries — the U.N. recommended in 1947 that Palestine be partitioned , to create separate Jewish and Arab states .
The Zionists were disappointed by the plan , because they had hoped to have all of Palestine become a Jewish state .
And the fact that it left Jerusalem , where 100,000 Jews lived , within the territory of the Arab zone , albeit run as an international city , was particularly irksome .
But the Zionist leadership also knew that the plan was as good as they were going to get via diplomacy , and accepted the plan .
( The rest , of course , they would acquire in battle , in 1948 and 1967 , in wars that they could blame on their enemies — after all , 40 years after the 1967 war , during which time Israel has been at peace with the enemy it faced on that flank , the West Bank remains very much in Israeli hands , with close to half a million Israelis settled there . )
And , of course , war would likely have looked inevitable , because the Arabs were unlikely to accept a deal in which they were , by definition , the losers .
Today , Israel insists that the demographic “ facts on the ground ” must be taken into account in any peace settlement , and demands that it be allowed to maintain the large settlement blocs built on the best land in the West Bank since 1967 .
And the Bush Administration has formally endorsed this claim .
But look at the “ facts on the ground ” of 1947 / 8 : The Partition Plan awarded 55 % of the land to the Jewish state , including more than 80 % of land under cultivation .
At the time , Jews made up a little over one third of the total population , and owned some 7 % of the land .
Moreover , given the demographic demands of the Zionist movement for a Jewish majority , the plan was an invitation to tragedy :
The population within the boundaries of the Jewish state envisaged in the 1947 partition consisted of around 500,000 Jews and 400,000 Arabs .
Hardly surprising , then , that the Arabs of Palestine and beyond rejected the partition plan .
For the Arab regimes , the creation of a separate Jewish sovereign state in the Holy Land over which the Crusades had been fought was a challenge to their authority ; it was perceived by their citizenry as a test of their ability to protect their land and interests from foreign invasion .
And so they went to war believing they could reverse what the U.N. had ordered on the battlefield .
For the Jews of Palestine in 1948 , a number of them having narrowly survived extermination in Europe , the war was a matter of physical survival .
Although in the mythology , the war pitted a half million Jews against 20 million Arabs , in truth Israel was by far the stronger and better - organized and better - armed military power .
And so what Israel called the War of Independence saw the Jewish state acquire 50 % more territory than had been envisaged in the partition plan .
The maps below describe the difference between the Israel envisaged by the UN in 1947 and the one that came into being in the war of 1948 .
But maps do n’t convey the disaster that befell the Palestinian Arabs in 1948 .
The war also allowed the Zionist movement to resolve its “ demographic concerns , ” as some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs found themselves driven from their homes and land — many driven out at gunpoint , the majority fleeing in fear of further massacres such as the one carried out by the Irgun at Dir Yassein , and all of them subject to the same ethnic - cleansing founding legislation by passed the new Israeli Knesset that seized the property of any Arab absent from his property on May 8 , 1948 , and forbad the refugees from returning .
The revised partition effected by the war left hundreds of thousands of Palestinians destitute in refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries , a drama that continues to play out today in northern Lebanon .
And for the next generation of Arab leaders , pan-Arabists and nationalists who overthrew the feeble Western - allied monarchies , the fundamental challenge of their nationalist vision became “ redeeming ” Arab honor by reversing their defeat of 1948 .
They tried twice , in 1967 and again in 1973 , and failed .
But even today , as political Islam supplants nationalism and pan-Arabism as the dominant ideologies of the Arab world , reversing the defeats of 1973 , 1967 and 1948 remains a singular obsession .
III .
For Jews of my generation who came of age during the anti-apartheid struggle , there was no shaking the nagging sense that what Israel was doing in the West Bank was exactly what the South African regime was doing in the townships .
Even as we waged our own intifada against apartheid in South Africa , we saw daily images of young Palestinians facing heavily armed Israeli police in tanks and armored vehicles with nothing more than stones , gasoline bombs and the occasional light weapon ; a whole community united behind its children who had decided to cast off the yoke under which their parents suffered .
And when Yitzhak Rabin , more famous as a signatory on the Oslo Agreement , ordered the Israeli military to systematically break the arms of young Palestinians in the hope of suppressing an entirely legitimate revolt , thuggery had become a matter of national policy .
It was only when some of those same young men began blowing themselves up in Israeli restaurants and buses that many Israel supporters were once again able to construe the Israelis as the victim in the situation ; during the intifada of the 1980s they could not question who was David and who was Goliath .
Even for those of us who had grown up in the idealism of the left - Zionist youth movements , Israel had become a grotesque parody of everything we stood for .
Even those within the Zionist establishment who came through the same tradition were horrified : Former Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg wrote in 2003 :
It turns out that the 2,000 - year struggle for Jewish survival comes down to a state of settlements , run by an amoral clique of corrupt lawbreakers who are deaf both to their citizens and to their enemies .
A state lacking justice cannot survive .
More and more Israelis are coming to understand this as they ask their children where they expect to live in 25 years .
Children who are honest admit , to their parents ’ shock , that they do not know .
The countdown to the end of Israeli society has begun .
It is very comfortable to be a Zionist in West Bank settlements such as Beit El and Ofra .
The biblical landscape is charming .
You can gaze through the geraniums and bougainvilleas and not see the occupation .
Travelling on the fast highway that skirts barely a half - mile west of the Palestinian roadblocks , it ’s hard to comprehend the humiliating experience of the despised Arab who must creep for hours along the pocked , blockaded roads assigned to him .
One road for the occupier , one road for the occupied .
This can not work .
Even if the Arabs lower their heads and swallow their shame and anger for ever , it wo n’t work .
A structure built on human callousness will inevitably collapse in on itself .
Note this moment well : Zionism ’s superstructure is already collapsing like a cheap Jerusalem wedding hall .
Only madmen continue dancing on the top floor while the pillars below are collapsing …
Israel , having ceased to care about the children of the Palestinians , should not be surprised when they come washed in hatred and blow themselves up in the centres of Israeli escapism .
They consign themselves to Allah in our places of recreation , because their own lives are torture .
They spill their own blood in our restaurants in order to ruin our appetites , because they have children and parents at home who are hungry and humiliated .
We could kill a thousand ringleaders a day and nothing will be solved , because the leaders come up from below – from the wells of hatred and anger , from the “ infrastructures ” of injustice and moral corruption …
Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there is no longer a clear Jewish majority .
And so , fellow citizens , it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price .
We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East .
There can not be democracy without equal rights for all who live here , Arab as well as Jew .
We cannot keep the territories and preserve a Jewish majority in the world ’s only Jewish state – not by means that are humane and moral and Jewish .
Many pro-Israel commentators today lament what they see as a shift in the Palestinian political mindset from the secular nationalism of Fatah to a more implacable Islamist worldview , supposedly infinitely less reasonable because it couches its opposition to Israel in religious terms .
Yet , what is often overlooked is how the Israeli victory in 1967 effected a similar shift
in Zionist ideology away from the secular nationalism of Ben Gurion ’s generation to a far more dangerous religious nationalism .
Tom Segev , my favorite Israeli historian , writes that the 1967 war resulted in many Israelis coming to see the army as an instrument of messianic theology .
The knitted yarmulke of the settlers moving to colonize the West Bank in the wake of the 1967 victory came to replace the cloth cap of the socialist kibbutznik as the symbol of Zionist pioneering .
Segev quotes from Rav Kook , the founder of the settlement movement : “ There is one principal thing : the state .
It is entirely holy , and there is no flaw in it … the state is holy in any and every case . ”
The settlement of Maale Adumim , on the West Bank .
Its permanence signifies that whatever their intentions ,
the Zionists created a single ( apartheid ) state for Jews
and Palestinians after 1967
The religious Zionists saw the West Bank and holy land to be “ redeemed , ” or “ liberated ” by settlement , and with the tacit support of all Israeli governments since then ( and the more active support of some ) they rushed to build permanent structures and settle a civilian population there , in defiance of international law , in order to preclude the possibility of returning that land to the Palestians as a basis for peace .
As David Remnick notes in a review of some of the literature on 1967 , many Israelis quickly realized that the “ Six Day War ” had brought about a potential disaster for the Zionist project , because Israel now found itself not only in control of all of the territory of British - Mandate Palestine , but also all of its current inhabitants .
He quotes Amos Oz ’s dark warning
“ For a month , for a year , or for a whole generation we will have to sit as occupiers in places that touch our hearts with their history .
And we must remember : as occupiers , because there is no alternative .
And as a pressure tactic to hasten peace .
Not as saviors or liberators .
Only in the twilight of myths can one speak of the liberation of a land struggling under a foreign yoke .
Land is not enslaved and there is no such thing as a liberation of lands .
There are enslaved people , and the word “ liberation ” applies only to human beings .
We have not liberated Hebron and Ramallah and El - Arish , nor have we redeemed their inhabitants .
We have conquered them and we are going to rule over them only until our peace is secured . “
But the religious - nationalists and Likudniks , who had always imagined a “ Greater Israel ” [ EM ] the Betar kids I knew in Cape Town used to wear a silver pendant on their chests , depicting a state of Israel running from the Nile to the Euphrates , and they used to sing a song called “ Shte Gadot La Yarden ” ( “ Both Sides of the Jordan ” [ EM ] had something else in mind .
As I ’ve noted previously , it was my South African Habonim elders on Kibbutz Yizreel , in 1978 , who first warned my generation that the settlement policies of the new Likud government would turn Israel into an apartheid state — Israel , they said , could not afford to give the Palestinians on the West Bank the vote , but the objective of the settlements was to ensure that Israel did not withdraw from the land it had conquered .
The result would be that Israel would rule over its Palestinian residents without giving them the rights of citizens — the very essence of the apartheid regime back home .
And that is , indeed , what had transpired .
Today , the West Bank is carved up by hundreds of Israeli settlements , and roads and land reserved for settlers .
And they have no intention of leaving , while no Israeli government for the foreseeable future will muster the political strength to be able to remove them ( even if that was their intent ) .
The black and blue areas are Israeli settlements , and the white parts are the roads and land under Israeli control
For an enlarged version of this map , click here .
Today , talk of a two - state solution to the conflict must reckon with the facts on the ground .
The 1947 Partition plan left the Palestinians with 45 percent of the territory of Palestine ; the 1948 war left them holding onto 22 percent , which fell into Israeli hands in 1967 .
Even when it talks about a two - state solution , Israel still demands to keep some of the best lands and the key water sources within that 22 percent .
A simple glance at the map above should be enough to raise serious questions about the viability of a separate , sovereign Palestinian nation - state .
It ’s hard to imagine such an entity , blessed with few natural resources and with hardly any independent economic base , maintaining an independent economic existence , even as it is forced to accomodate hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees returning from refugee camps in Lebanon and elsewhere ( as most versions of the two - state plan envisage ) .
Indeed , such an entity may well have the feel of an enlarged refugee camp , whose survival is largely dependent on handouts .
When it conquered the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 , Israel put the Palestinian population of those territories under the rule of the Israeli state .
For forty years , now , the entire population of British - Mandate Palestine has been governed by a single state .
The difference , of course , is that those who live within Israel ’s 1967 borders have democratic rights , while those outside are governed by an Israeli colonial and military administration .
The extent of Palestinian “ authority ” in those territories — even Gaza — remains entirely circumscribed by Israeli power .
Suddenly panicked by the demographic implications of the apartheid order its 1967 conquests have created , Israeli leaders talk of “ separating ” from the Palestinians , as if they can dispense with the problem by drawing political boundaries and building a wall around self - governing Palestinian enclaves ( Ariel Sharon himself used the analogy with South Africa ’s apartheid Bantustan policy to describe the idea . )
But the Gaza experience has made clear the limits of that option .
For the Palestinian population , and their Arab neighbors , the crisis of 1948 has never been resolved .
And the Israelis , for the last 40 years , by colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem , have squandered whatever opportunities their victory of 1967 presented for changing the dynamic — instead , they have sought to cling to elements of the “ Greater Israel ” they created in that year , and in the vain hope that the Palestinians will some day surrender in exchange for whatever Israel chooses to offer them .
But precisely because they have continued to expand Israel since 1967 , they have dimmed the prospects for a new partition creating a viable Palestinian state separate from Israel .
Today , more than ever , the fate of the Israelis is inextricably , and intimately linked to the fate of the Palestinians — and vice versa .
The lasting legacy of the 1967 war is the bi-national state it created in the old territory of British - Mandate Palestine .
Well , that did n’t work .
I shut down this blog with the best of intentions , truly .
A few precious hours regained .
But in the absence of b...
PARIS , Oct. 5 — His subjects were mostly children and teenagers at the time , terrified witnesses to mass slaughter .
Some were forced to work at the bottom rung of the Nazi killing machine — as diggers of mass graves , cooks who fed Nazi soldiers and seamstresses who mended clothes stripped from the Jews before execution .
They live today in rural poverty , many without running water or heat , nearing the end of their lives .
So Patrick Desbois has been quietly seeking them out , roaming the back roads and forgotten fields of Ukraine , hearing their stories and searching for the unmarked common graves .
He knows that they are an unparalleled source to document the murder of the 1.5 million Jews of Ukraine , shot dead and buried throughout the country .
He is neither a historian nor an archaeologist , but a French Roman Catholic priest .
And his most powerful tools are his matter - of - fact style — and his clerical collar .
The Nazis killed nearly 1.5 million Jews in Ukraine after their invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 .
But with few exceptions , most notably the 1941 slaughter of nearly 34,000 Jews in the Babi Yar ravine in Kiev , much of that history has gone untold .
During 2007 , the major news item continued to be the war in Iraq .
On January 4th , the 110th Congress convened ; the first time during the Bush Administration Democrats had controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
Many of us expected this changing of the guard would produce a shift in Iraq policy , a real plan for withdrawal of US troops .
Sadly , this did n't happen ; the war not only continued , but President Bush upped the number of troops with his " surge " initiative .
At yearend , many Americans wondered whether it was possible to change anything while Bush was still in office .
A recent Pew Research Poll found that nearly half of the public ( 48 percent ) believe the military effort in Iraq is now " going well or fairly well . "
However , a majority of Americans ( 54 percent ) continue to believe our troops should come home as soon as possible - a plurality that has remained remarkably constant throughout the year .
As the war has dragged on , the US has become deeply polarized - 41 percent of the public wants our troops to stay in Iraq as long as it takes to achieve " victory . "
Even though his approval ratings have hovered in the thirties throughout the year , Bush has rebuffed all Congressional attempts to change course in Iraq .
( As a result , the approval ratings for Congress are now lower than those of the President . )
If you are a supporter of George W. Bush , then it 's likely you believe he 's doing the right thing by staying the course in Iraq .
But if you 're not a Bush fan , then you became very frustrated this year : you thought the Democrats in Congress did n't stand up to the President .
Finally , at the end of the year , Democrats in the House of Representatives responded to Bush 's intransigence by postponing consideration of additional Iraq funding .
There was increasing indication that Dems were ready to battle the President on this issue .
If Democrats do confront the White House , they wo n't get help from the Republican Presidential candidates .
The GOP front - runners - Giuliani , Huckabee , McCain , Romney , and Thompson - all want the US to stay in Iraq until we " win . "
The Republicans are running as mini-Dubyas even while they carefully avoid mentioning Bush 's name .
( On the Democratic side , Clinton , Edwards , and Obama favor a withdrawal plan , but with caveats that could result in thousands of American troops remaining in Iraq at the end of 2011 . )
IN 2008 , two factors may force a change in Iraq policy .
The first is the continuing deterioration of the US economy .
In November , a Newsweek poll reported that , for the first time all year , the public considered " the economy and jobs " to be a more important issue than Iraq .
As America 's focus shifts to the mortgage crisis , the credit crunch , and the possibility of recession , Bush 's scare tactics about Iraq have had less traction .
Since 9/11 , the Administration 's message to the American people has been , " You can have it all , tax cuts and a profligate war on terror , because the economy is robust . "
Now , as US financial systems tank , more and more American are asking if it 's reasonable to continue a war costing $ 2 Billion per week and whose estimated total cost could exceed $ 2 Trillion .
Mounting concern about the cost of the war has been accompanied by the refrain , " when are Iraqis going to be able to govern themselves ? "
Democrats have long taken the position that it is unreasonable for the US military to be asked to serve in the role of the Iraqi police force in the middle of a civil war .
The Iraqi government has yet to achieve any of the political objectives that Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki delineated a year ago .
Nonetheless , the White House downplays the lack of political progress .
Now , key Republican Senators , such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina argue that if the Iraqi government does n't show progress by the end of the year , it 's time for a change in US strategy .
Recently , Washington
Post military writer Thomas Ricks noted : " Senior military commanders here now portray the intransigence of Iraq 's Shiite - dominated government as the key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq , rather than Al Qaeda terrorists , Sunni insurgents or Iranian - backed militias . "
Early in 2008 there will be another showdown over Iraq : whether US involvement is worth the price .
It 's likely that when President Bush says it is , that America has to stumble on , regardless of the cost , he will find he has lost the support of a veto - proof majority in Congress .
Then our troops will begin to come home .

Scott Pelley 's disturbing report on 60 Minutes shows just one angle of the carnage that continues in Iraq despite the surge -- the cleansing of Iraqi Christians .
Pelley interviews Andrew White , a minister who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and runs one of the few remaining Christian churches left in the country .
Transcript :
The situation now is clearly worse ” than under Saddam , White replied .
" There ’s no comparison between Iraq now and then , " he told Pelley .
" Things are the most difficult they have ever been for Christians .
Probably ever in history .
They ’ve never known it like now . "
" Wait a minute , Christians have been here for 2,000 years , " Pelley remarked .
" Yes , " White said .
" And it ’s now the worst it has ever been , " Pelley replied .
White is forced to hold his services underground ( you wo n't see many adult males as they have all been killed or driven from the country ) and risks his life every day to help his parishioners and says life for Iraqi Christians is infinitely worse now than under Saddam .
Many Christians who are lucky enough to make it out of the country alive end up in Syrian ghettos , still fearing for their lives and with little hope for the future .
The Bush administration and our liberal media tell us the surge in Iraq is working , but the world knows that is a lie .
The surge may be helping with security in some parts of the country , but it has come with immeasurable costs to the people of Iraq in the form of ethnic cleansing and a humanitarian crisis for many millions of people , that should anger and sicken us all .
Of course , the plight of Iraqi Christians are just part of this appalling tragedy .
Iraqis of all faiths are still being slaughtered and driven from their homes and country daily , by a civil war we allowed to happen and continues to rage on , uninterrupted by the surge .
The journey begins …
I now live in a van .
My new home is a Roadtrek camper van built on a Dodge chassis .
My plan ( if you want to call it that …
I do n’t really have one ) is to travel the country to discover new things , see new places , meet new people , and just seek out new adventures in whatever form that may take .
I ’m at that age when many of my friends are retired or are about to be ( I ’m still a couple of years away from collecting any social security ) .
I do n’t want to sit at home and watch tv all day … and night .
That is what many of the people I know do .
I have absolutely nothing against those who prefer to do just that .
If that is what you want to do and it makes you happy , well , I ’m all for it .
It ’s just not for me .
I have never been a big tv watcher and just do n’t want to spend the second half ?
of my life doing something I do n’t enjoy .
I believe there has got to be something more to life .
I do n’t know what it is but I do n’t believe there is anything wrong with searching , do you ?
Seeking out new places , meeting new people , just experiencing new experiences .
I realize what I am doing is not for everyone … or anyone else .
I have never tried to talk anyone into doing what I am doing .
And it ’s not the purpose of this blog .
I decided to start this blog just to have a record of my travels and experiences .
And because I get requests from friends to send pictures and answers to the question , “ Where are you now ? ” ( truly , no offense my friends – I ’m glad you ’re interested enough to ask ) .
Another reason I began this journey is because I truly hate and am sick of Midwest winters .
The bitter cold , letting the car warm up and scraping the ice off its windows , shoveling snow , staying inside and staring out the window cause it ’s just too cold to go outside , and if you do go out , what are you going to do ?
– it ’s friggin’ cold !
I do n’t ice fish , I do n’t snowmobile , I do n’t ski , I do n’t like being cold !
Yeah , one can dress for it … but why ?
And you never know , tomorrow is promised to no one .
So why not have some fun ?
So , folks , that ’s why I started this journey and this blog .
Hopefully , you will find it somewhat interesting and will stick around at least long enough to hear about “ where am I ’m now ” and what I ’m up to .
I do n’t plan on writing about what I ate for breakfast that day or any of the other mundane , regular daily stuff .
I plan to write a new post maybe once or twice a month – whenever I change locations , do something that I find interesting , or see something that I think you may enjoy .
So stick around ( I ’m glad to have you here ) …. and signup to be notified whenever something new gets posted .
Also , feel free to leave a comment after any post .
I may not respond to all but they all get read .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate voted 67 - 29 Thursday night to expand the State Children 's Health Insurance program , a measure President Bush has vowed to veto as a step toward universal coverage .
President Bush has threatened to veto the expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
The program would double -- from 4 million to 8 million -- the number of children covered .
Eighteen Republicans joined all of the Democrats in voting to expand the program from its current annual budget of $ 5 billion to $ 12 billion for the next five years .
Four senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas and Democrats Joseph Biden of Delaware and Barack Obama of Illinois -- did not vote .
The reauthorization bill " fails to focus on poor children , and instead creates a new entitlement program for higher - income households , " said White House Press Secretary Dana Perino in a written statement .
" The president will veto this bill because it directs scarce funding to higher incomes at the expense of poor families . "
With the current program scheduled to expire Saturday , the White House encouraged Congress to send the president a continuing resolution extending the program .
" We should take this time to arrive at a more rational , bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization bill that focuses on children in poor families who do n't currently have insurance , rather than raising taxes to cover people who already have private insurance , " Perino added .
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah was among those Republicans who split from the president .
" It 's very difficult for me to be against a man I care so much for , " he told his colleagues on the Senate floor prior to the vote .
" It 's unfortunate that the president has chosen to be on what , to me , is clearly the wrong side of this issue . "
Though 67 votes in the 100 - person chamber would suffice to overturn a veto , the House version , which was approved Tuesday , fell short of the two - thirds majority needed .
Bush and many Republicans contend the program 's original intent would be changed under the current bill .
The program is supposed to give parents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance coverage for their children .
The concern is that parents might be prompted to drop private coverage their children already have in order to get cheaper coverage under the bill .
Though Bush has been clear about his veto plans , Sen. Robert Byrd , D - West Virginia , held out hope he would have a change of heart .
" It is my fervent hope that the president will put away his veto pen so that he can get on with the business of adequately funding programs that contribute , yes , contribute , to a safe and prosperous United States of America , " he said .
Sen . David Vitter , R- Louisiana , said illegal aliens would use " glaring loopholes " in the legislation to enroll in it .
But Sen. Bob Menendez , D - New Jersey , disagreed .
" I bristle when there are colleagues who come to this floor and still bring up the red herring of immigrant children being covered who should n't have the right , " he said .
" Undocumented immigrants have never been eligible for regular Medicaid or the Children 's Health Insurance Program , and this bill maintains that prohibition . "
" Every child deserves health care , " said Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination .
" More than 9 million do not have access to quality , affordable health care .
That is a moral crisis and it should be impelling us to act . "
Though children in a family of four making 250 percent of the poverty level -- or up to $ 52,000 per year -- would be eligible under the bill , that kind of salary " does n't go very far in New York , " she said .
" If the president vetoes this bill , he will be vetoing health care for almost 4 million children , and he will be putting ideology -- not children -- first , " she added .
Sen . Jim Bunning , a Republican from the tobacco - growing state of Kentucky , cited the fact that the bill would get its funds from an increase in tobacco taxes as unfair .
" It redistributes income from low - income smokers to states with the highest per-capita incomes , " he said .
" It could be called Robin Hood in reverse . "
Sen .
Trent Lott , R- Mississippi , was also unimpressed .
" This is a perfect example of the type of partisan politics that goes on in Washington all the time , " he told CNN .
" It 's not about trying to take care of the children ; it 's about how can we get a political advantage . "
Watch Lott give his take on kids ' insurance »
He added , " Do you really believe Republicans do n't want to help poor , low - income children ? "
He credited his colleagues in the House for taking a stand against the bill .
" Thank goodness they 're going to do the right thing for the children and for fiscal responsibility .
They 're going to sustain the president 's veto , and then hopefully we can sit down rationally and work out an agreement to preserve this program . "

Drunken mothers , bestial fathers , paedophilia and incest .
They 're the titillating popcorn of publishing today .
Here , in a furious blast against her own trade , a leading book industry figure attacks the lucrative market in ' misery memoirs '...
You may remember the story of Dana Fowley .
She came to public attention after declaring that she still loves her mother , Catherine Dunsmore , even though Dunsmore " supplied " Dana , now 27 , and her sister to a 15 - strong paedophile ring , which systematically raped and molested her from the age of six to 15 .
She made this statement of forgiveness outside the Edinburgh court in which her mother had just been handed a ten - year sentence for her astonishingly wicked acts .
On seeing one of her abusers less than ten years after her ordeal ended , Dana tried to kill herself with an overdose of insulin , before fully revealing her secrets to her husband Paul .
Scroll down for more ...
As a result , after Dana had kept what happened to her hidden for most of her life , her mother and the gang were brought to justice .
That was in June .
So what has Dana done in the short time since then ?
Well , she 's been talked into selling her story to a publisher for a staggering £ 200,000 , through Susan Smith at literary agency MBA .
Am I the only one to think that the gaggle of publishers who bid so high so quickly have more than a whiff of ambulance - chasers about them ?
This is a young woman only now coming to terms with the appalling suffering she kept hidden for most of her life .
Hers was the kind of experience that takes years to overcome in the gentle and confidential surroundings of the therapist 's room .
But , judging by the current trend for ever more graphic tales of sexual abuse , just months after seeing her mother incarcerated Dana will be expected to perform an emotional striptease and deliver up every graphic detail of her abuse for public consumption .
Every molestation , every forced depravity and every betrayal by her mother is likely to be demanded in full colour for readers who will revel in the pornography of misery .
If Dana 's book follows the disturbing wave of recent misery memoirs , it will read as if you were there : as if you were the victim - or the perpetrator .
Even among the ghoulish world of misery memoir publishing there is a sense of shock at the haste with which Dana has been pounced on .
" I think it is going to be the most horrible yet , " says one ghostwriter , with a hint of relish at the detail it may reveal .
" I have heard it described as ' the book to end all books ' on the subject . "
Well , I wish it were .
Because the slew of such memoirs pumped out at the behest of supermarkets - which sell these books in the kind of quantities normally reserved for The Da Vinci Code - have crossed a line this year .
Rather than inspire , they risk titillating with the intimate detail they provide : members of religious cults rape young girls , fathers rape sons .
The descriptions are vivid and explicit as publishers fall over themselves to provide increasingly shocking accounts to take a chunk out of a market that is now worth £ 24 million .
In Please , Daddy , No : A Boy Betrayed , Stuart Howarth provides relentless detail about repeated rapes by his father .
He was even forced by the brute to have sex with pigs .
David Thomas in Tell Me Why , Mummy provides a lurid account of his drunken mother forcing him to " pleasure " her .
In Damaged : The Heartbreaking True Story Of A Forgotten Child , Cathy Glass not only tells us that Jodie , a seven - year - old placed in her care , had been abused , but that within days of moving into the Glass home , the little girl was masturbating on the sitting - room sofa and smearing her face with excrement .
In each book you will read how children are abused , tortured and coerced into keeping Daddy's , Uncle 's or Mummy 's " little secret " .
No wonder that some claim these uninhibited accounts offer paedophiles tips on how to groom children and ensure their foul activities remain closeted .
Not that the publishers and ghostwriters responsible see it that way .
" A lot of those readers are women with children , " insists Carol Tonkinson , non-fiction publisher at Harper - Collins , the market leader in misery lit - though the publisher prefers the name " inspirational literature " ( like fairy tales , a happy ending is compulsory ) .
" Eighty - five percent of these books sell in supermarkets , " she replies , when I tell her about the unsavoury men I have seen hanging round the " abuse / incest " section in the Borders bookshop chain .
So why do they sell so well ?
I suppose that in the same way a horror film gives us a vicarious thrill by allowing us to be terrified without any risk to ourselves , so reading stories of abuse from the comfort of our sofas means we can experience the chill of fear and disgust as voyeurs , without ever having to confront such nightmares in our own lives .
Apart from anything else , they inevitably make us feel better about ourselves even if we have only vaguely functional families .
Carol Tonkinson is adamant the books serve a worthy purpose : they show victims how to escape abuse and warn those in its proximity about the symptoms .
" The authors often say that writing the book has given them closure . "
Like many making money from this market , she is messianic in her zeal for misery lit and the importance of victims to put across their side of the story , although even she has qualms about what may be demanded of Dana Fowley .
" We felt it was just too extreme for us , " she admits .
The " King of Misery " is Andrew Crofts , one of the ghostwriters of Jane Elliott 's The Little Prisoner ( the story of a woman who was kept prisoner by her violent and sexually abusive stepfather ) ; Stuart Howarth 's horrifying tome ; and a book by Tom Wilson called Tears Before Bedtime , about the abuse he suffered in a children 's home , which is out this month .
" I feel strongly that these books need to be as open and frank as possible , " he insists .
" Only by shining a bright light into the very murkiest of corners do we stand any chance of robbing these abusers of at least some of their power over their victims . "
But Crofts ' claim of empowering victims is not the whole story .
The intimate exposure involved leaves every gruesome fact of a vulnerable person 's life in the public domain where they have no control over how it is used - or abused - by readers .
No wonder that therapist Barbara McKay , director of the Institute of Family Therapy , is sceptical about how helpful these books are to victims .
" In years and years of working in therapy with victims of abuse I have never come across one client who has chosen to write a book about their abusive experiences as a means of coping with them , " she says .
" Your future can define you as much as your past , but if you write about your suffering for public consumption , you are in danger of being defined only by your past , by the very thing you are trying to overcome . "
In other words , it makes it even harder to escape a terrible past when it is writ large in stacks in the aisles at a supermarket .
An argument repeated by publishers to me when justifying the harrowing detail is that " the readers of these books are less well educated and need graphic detail to make them understand the impact of abuse " .
Oh , please !
How stupid does a person have to be if they do n't understand the terrible impact of sexual abuse without having to read the horrific detail ?
The chief reason to include detail that borders on pornographic is to entertain a prurient readership which would otherwise be reading about Fred and Rose West in the kind of True Crime books upmarket publishers like to sneer at .
Publishers churn out these misery tales for one reason : they sell .
The phenomenon began when Dave Pelzer 's A Child Called
It raced up the charts in 2000 .
Publishers sat up .
When his follow - up books were equally successful - how many misery memoirs can one man write - selling 3.5 million copies in the UK alone , publishers did what they always do when they sniff a lucrative new market : they jumped right in .
And they have been rewarded .
Toni McGuire 's Do n't Tell Mummy : A True Story Of Ultimate Betrayal , about a sixyearold abused by her father with her mother 's complicity , has sold a whopping 235,669 copies in paperback since publication in March .
The paperback of Stuart Howarth 's book has sold 107,168 since May , having sold a similar number in hardback .
Judy Westwater , meanwhile , who was " discovered " by John Peel on Radio 4's Home Truths , has sold 204,743 copies of Street Kid : One Child 's Desperate Fight For Survival since it was published late last year .
One publishing editor confides with a grimace : " We had n't published misery memoirs because we felt they were distasteful - there are things you should tell your therapist , not the whole world .
" But these books dominate the bestseller lists , so we had to get our hands dirty .
So , " he takes a deep breath , " last year we bought a book that had been sent in for a low advance .
We stuck a picture on it of a little boy curled up crying in the corner of a white cover and gave it a one - word title . "
The book , published with none of the brouhaha usually associated with launches , was snapped up by the supermarkets , which have more power than anyone to make a book a bestseller .
" In the first week it reached the top ten , " the editor recalls , amazed .
" It was the most cynical piece of publishing we have ever done . "
For agents , finding an author with a juicy tale to tell is lucrative .
Advances for disturbing memoirs have passed into six figures .
Fowley 's £ 200,000 pales in comparison to the £ 500,000 paid for Mark Johnson 's Wasted , in which the former drug addict described how his father 's beatings drove him to a life of crime .
With money like that changing hands , the pressure is on to deliver not just the " great writing " publishers like to boast about , but a story that will shock enough to get the author on the This Morning sofa on TV .
The editorial director of one house admits : " When these books come in for consideration , whatever anyone says , you are looking at how shocking the story is , and the marketing team is asking : ' Is she promotable ?
Can she squeeze out tears on Richard and Judy ? ' "
As to the claims that authors and agents are performing a public service , he says : " If that 's true , why do the books always go to the publisher paying the most money ? "
Even celebrities are under pressure to dole out graphic abuse .
TV cleaner Kim Woodburn 's Unbeaten : The Story Of My Brutal Childhood rode high in the bestseller charts after her revelation that she secretly buried her stillborn baby .
Susan Lamb , of Orion , which published Dave Pelzer , says : " People want the author 's heart and guts hanging on the washing line . "
But just because readers want it does not mean the trade should supply it .
A line needs to be drawn .
Claiming that explicit stories of sexual abuse benefit abused people everywhere is wishful thinking .
Yes , there are victims who will recognise what they went through .
And yes , the victims of abuse who " write " the books may find catharsis ( it 's amazing how much a six - figure advance can help with that ) .
But presenting sordid detail after sordid detail so that it is imprinted in the mind of readers is not healthy for anyone .
It may plant a seed in the minds of some unsavoury readers over whom no publisher has control .
For victims exposed to the prying eye of the public , it may make them more vulnerable , not less , and on some deep emotional level , it risks making us all an accessory to their abuse .
For publishers to claim a moral high ground about books whose contents would be better off kept between client and therapist is disingenuous .
It is all about profits - especially when they come from supermarket - sized sales .
Q0 Why this FAQ ?
As a physics undergraduate I was struck by the misconceptions of my tutors about many - worlds , despite that it seemed to resolve all the paradoxes of quantum theory [ A ] .
The objections raised to many - worlds were either patently misguided [ B ] or beyond my ability to assess at the time [ C ] , which made me suspect ( confirmed during my graduate QFT studies ) that the more sophisticated rebuttals were also invalid .
I hope this FAQ will save other investigators from being lead astray by authoritative statements from mentors .
I have attempted , in the answers , to translate the precise mathematics of quantum theory into woolly and ambiguous English - I would appreciate any corrections .
In one or two instances I could n't avoid using some mathematical ( Dirac ) notation , in particular in describing the Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen ( EPR ) experiment and Bell 's Inequality and in showing how probabilities are derived , so I 've included an appendix on the Dirac notation .
[ A ] See " Does the EPR experiment prohibit locality ? " , " What about Bell 's Inequality ? " and " When does Schrodinger 's cat split ? " for how many - worlds handles the most quoted paradoxes .
[ B ] Sample objection : " Creation of parallel universes violates energy conservation / Ockham 's razor " .
( See " Does many - worlds violate conservation of energy ? " and " Does many - worlds violate Ockham 's Razor ? " )
[ C ] eg " In quantum field theory the wavefunction becomes an operator " .
Er , what does that mean ?
And is this relevant ?
( See " What about quantum field theory ? " )
Q1 Who believes in many - worlds ?
1 ) " Yes , I think MWI is true " 58 % 2 ) " No , I do n't accept MWI " 18 % 3 ) " Maybe it 's true but I 'm not yet convinced " 13 % 4 ) " I have no opinion one way or the other " 11 %
Amongst the " Yes , I think MWI is true " crowd listed are Stephen Hawking and Nobel Laureates Murray Gell - Mann and Richard Feynman .
Gell - Mann and Hawking recorded reservations with the name " many - worlds " , but not with the theory 's content .
Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg is also mentioned as a many - worlder , although the suggestion is not when the poll was conducted , presumably before 1988 ( when Feynman died ) .
The only " No , I do n't accept MWI " named is Penrose .
The findings of this poll are in accord with other polls , that many - worlds is most popular amongst scientists who may rather loosely be described as string theorists or quantum gravitists / cosmologists .
It is less popular amongst the wider scientific community who mostly remain in ignorance of it .
More detail on Weinberg 's views can be found in _Dreams of a Final Theory_ or _ Life in the Universe_ Scientific American ( October 1994 ) , the latter where Weinberg says about quantum theory :
" The final approach is to take the Schrodinger equation seriously [.. description of the measurement process ..]
In this way , a measurement causes the history of the universe for practical purposes to diverge into different non-interfering tracks , one for each possible value of the measured quantity . [...]
I prefer this last approach "
In the The Quark and the Jaguar and Quantum Mechanics in the Light of Quantum Cosmology [ 10 ]
Gell - Mann describes himself as an adherent to the ( post - ) Everett interpretation , although his exact meaning is sometimes left ambiguous .
Steven
Hawking is well known as a many - worlds fan and says , in an article on quantum gravity [ H ] , that measurement of the gravitational metric tells you which branch of the wavefunction you 're in and references Everett .
Feynman , apart from the evidence of the Raub poll , directly favouring the Everett interpretation , always emphasized to his lecture students [ F ] that the " collapse " process could only be modelled by the Schrodinger wave equation ( Everett 's approach ) .

Q2 What is many - worlds ?
Many - worlds comprises of two assumptions and some consequences .
The assumptions are quite modest :
1 ) The metaphysical assumption :
That the wavefunction does not merely encode the all the information about an object , but has an observer - independent objective existence and actually is the object .
For a non-relativistic N - particle system the wavefunction is a complex - valued field in a 3 - N dimensional space .
2 ) The physical assumption :
The wavefunction obeys the empirically derived standard linear deterministic wave equations at all times .
The observer plays no special role in the theory and , consequently , there is no collapse of the wavefunction .
For non-relativistic systems the Schrodinger wave equation is a good approximation to reality .
( See " Is many - worlds a relativistic theory ? " for how the more general case is handled with quantum field theory or third quantisation . )
The rest of the theory is just working out consequences of the above assumptions .
Measurements and observations by a subject on an object are modelled by applying the wave equation to the joint subject - object system .
Some consequences are :
1 ) That each measurement causes a decomposition or decoherence of the universal wavefunction into non-interacting and mostly non- interfering branches , histories or worlds .
( See " What is decoherence ? " )
The histories form a branching tree which encompasses all the possible outcomes of each interaction .
( See " Why do worlds split ? " and " When do worlds split ? " )
Every historical what - if compatible with the initial conditions and physical law is realised .
2 ) That the conventional statistical Born interpretation of the amplitudes in quantum theory is derived from within the theory rather than having to be assumed as an additional axiom .
( See " How do probabilities emerge within many - worlds ? " )
Many - worlds is a re-formulation of quantum theory [ 1 ] , published in 1957 by Dr Hugh Everett III [ 2 ] , which treats the process of observation or measurement entirely within the wave - mechanics of quantum theory , rather than an input as additional assumption , as in the Copenhagen interpretation .
Everett considered the wavefunction a real object .
Many - worlds is a return to the classical , pre-quantum view of the universe in which all the mathematical entities of a physical theory are real .
For example the electromagnetic fields of James Clark Maxwell or the atoms of Dalton were considered as real objects in classical physics .
Everett treats the wavefunction in a similar fashion .
Everett also assumed that the wavefunction obeyed the same wave equation during observation or measurement as at all other times .
This is the central assumption of many - worlds : that the wave equation is obeyed universally and at all times .
Everett discovered that the new , simpler theory - which he named the " relative state " formulation - predicts that interactions between two ( or more ) macrosystems typically split the joint system into a superposition of products of relative states .
The states of the macrosystems are , after the subsystems have jointly interacted , henceforth correlated with , or dependent upon , each other .
Each element of the superposition - each a product of subsystem states - evolves independently of the other elements in the superposition .
The states of the macrosystems are , by becoming correlated or entangled with each other , impossible to understand in isolation from each other and must be viewed as one composite system .
It is no longer possible to speak the state of one ( sub ) system in isolation from the other ( sub ) systems .
Instead we are forced to deal with the states of subsystems relative to each other .
Specifying the state of one subsystem leads to a unique specification of the state ( the " relative state " ) of the other subsystems .
( See " What is a relative state ? " )
If one of the systems is an observer and the interaction an observation then the effect of the observation is to split the observer into a number of copies , each copy observing just one of the possible results of a measurement and unaware of the other results and all its observer - copies .
Interactions between systems and their environments , including communication between different observers in the same world , transmits the correlations that induce local splitting or decoherence into non- interfering branches of the universal wavefunction .
Thus the entire world is split , quite rapidly , into a host of mutually unobservable but equally real worlds .
According to many - worlds all the possible outcomes of a quantum interaction are realised .
The wavefunction , instead of collapsing at the moment of observation , carries on evolving in a deterministic fashion , embracing all possibilities embedded within it .
All outcomes exist simultaneously but do not interfere further with each other , each single prior world having split into mutually unobservable but equally real worlds .
Q3 What are the alternatives to many - worlds ?
1 ) Copenhagen Interpretation .
Postulates that the observer obeys different physical laws than the non-observer , which is a return to vitalism .
The definition of an observer varies from one adherent to another , if present at all .
The status of the wavefunction is also ambiguous .
If the wavefunction is real the theory is non-local ( not fatal , but unpleasant ) .
If the wavefunction is not real then the theory supplies no model of reality .
( See " What are the problems with quantum theory ? " )
2) Hidden Variables [ B ] .
Explicitly non-local .
Bohm accepts that all the branches of the universal wavefunction exist .
Like Everett Bohm held that the wavefunction is real complex - valued field which never collapses .
In addition Bohm postulated that there were particles that move under the influence of a non-local " quantum - potential " derived from the wavefunction ( in addition to the classical potentials which are already incorporated into the structure of the wavefunction ) .
The action of the quantum - potential is such that the particles are affected by only one of the branches of the wavefunction .
( Bohm derives what is essentially a decoherence argument to show this , see section 7 , #I [ B ] ) .
The implicit , unstated assumption made by Bohm is that only the single branch of wavefunction associated with particles can contain self - aware observers , whereas Everett makes no such assumption .
Most of Bohm 's adherents do not seem to understand ( or even be aware of ) Everett 's criticism , section VI [ 1 ] , that the hidden - variable particles are not observable since the wavefunction alone is sufficient to account for all observations and hence a model of reality .
The hidden variable particles can be discarded , along with the guiding quantum - potential , yielding a theory isomorphic to many - worlds , without affecting any experimental results .
[ B ] David J Bohm A suggested interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of " hidden variables " I and II Physical Review Vol 85 # 2 166-193 ( 1952 )
3 ) Quantum Logic .
Undoubtedly the most extreme of all attempts to solve the QM measurement problem .
Apart from abandoning one or other of the classical tenets of logic these theories are all unfinished ( presumably because of internal inconsistencies ) .
Also it is unclear how and why different types of logic apply on different scales .
4) Extended Probability [ M ] .
A bold theory in which the concept of probability is " extended " to include complex values [ Y ] .
Whilst quite daring , I am not sure if this is logically permissable , being in conflict with the relative frequency notion of probability , in which case it suffers from the same criticism as quantum logic .
Also it is unclear , to me anyway , how the resultant notion of " complex probability " differs from the quantum " probability amplitude " and thus why we are justified in collapsing the complex - valued probability as if it were a classical , real - valued probability .

5 ) Transactional model [ C ] .
Explicitly non-local .
An imaginative theory , based on the Feynman - Wheeler absorber - emitter model of EM , in which advanced and retarded probability amplitudes combine into an atemporal " transaction " to form the Born probability density .
It requires that the input and output states , as defined by an observer , act as emitters and absorbers respectively , but not any internal states ( inside the " black box " ) , and , consequently , suffers from the familiar measurement problem of the Copenhagen interpretation .
If the internal states did act as emitters / absorbers then the wavefunction would collapse , for example , around one of the double slits ( an internal state ) in the double slit experiment , destroying the observed interference fringes .
In transaction terminology a transaction would form between the first single slit and one of the double slits and another transaction would form between the same double slit and the point on the screen where the photon lands .
This never observed .
[ C ] John G Cramer The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics Reviews of Modern Physics Vol 58 # 3 647-687 ( 1986 )
6 ) Many - minds .
Despite its superficial similarities with many - worlds this is actually a very unphysical , non-operational theory .
( See " What is many - minds ? " )
7 ) Non-linear theories in general .
So far no non-linear theory has any accepted experimental support , whereas many have failed experiment .
( See " Is physics linear ? " )
Many - worlds predicts that non-linear theories will always fail experiment .
( See " Is linearity exact ? " )
Q4 What is a " world " ?
Sometimes " worlds " are called " universes " , but more usually the latter is reserved the totality of worlds implied by the universal wavefunction .
Sometimes the term " history " is used instead of " world " .
( Gell - Mann / Hartle 's phrase , see " What is many - histories ? " ) .
Q5 What is a measurement ?
A measurement , by this definition , does not require the presence of an conscious observer , only of irreversible processes .
Q6
Why do worlds split ?
What is decoherence ?
For small microscopic systems it is quite possible for all their atomic components to overlap at some future point .
In the double slit experiment , for instance , it only requires that the divergent paths of the diffracted particle overlap again at some space - time point for an interference pattern to form , because only the single particle has been split .
Such future coincidence of positions in all the components is virtually impossible in more complex , macroscopic systems because all the constituent particles have to overlap with their counterparts simultaneously .
Any system complex enough to be described by thermodynamics and exhibit irreversible behaviour is a system complex enough to exclude , for all practical purposes , any possibility of future interference between its decoherent branches .
An irreversible process is one in , or linked to , a system with a large number of internal , unconstrained degrees of freedom .
Once the irreversible process has started then alterations of the values of the many degrees of freedom leaves an imprint which can't be removed .
If we try to intervene to restore the original status quo the intervention causes more disruption elsewhere .
In QM jargon we say that the components ( or vectors in the underlying Hilbert state space ) have become permanently orthogonal due to the complexity of the systems increasing the dimensionality of the vector space , where each unconstrained degree of freedom contributes a dimension to the state vector space .
In a high dimension space almost all vectors are orthogonal , without any significant degree of overlap .
Thus vectors for complex systems , with a large number of degrees of freedom , naturally decompose into mutually orthogonal components which , because they can never significantly interfere again , are unaware of each other .
The complex system , or world , has split into different , mutually unobservable worlds .
According to thermodynamics each activated degree of freedom acquires kT energy .
This works the other way around as well : the release of approximately kT of energy increases the state - space dimensionality .
Even the quite small amounts of energy released by an irreversible frictive process are quite large on this scale , increasing the size of the associated Hilbert space .
Contact between a system and a heat sink is equivalent to increasing the dimensionality of the state space , because the description of the system has to be extended to include all parts of the environment in causal contact with it .
Contact with the external environment is a very effective destroyer of coherency .
( See " What is the environment basis ? " )
Q7 When do worlds split ?
In the example of a Geiger counter and a charged particle after the particle has passed the counter one world contains the clicked counter and that portion of the particle 's wavefunction which passed though the detector .
The other world contains the unclicked counter with the particle 's wavefunction with a " shadow " cast by the counter taken out of the particle 's wavefunction .
The Geiger counter splits when the amplification process became irreversible , before the click is emitted .
( See " What is a measurement ? " )
The splitting is local ( originally in the region of the Geiger counter in our example ) and is transmitted causally to more distant systems .
( See " Is many - worlds a local theory ? " and " Does the EPR experiment prohibit locality ? " )
The precise moment / location of the split is not sharply defined due to the subjective nature of irreversibility , but can be considered complete when much more than kT of energy has been released in an uncontrolled fashion into the environment .
At this stage the event has become irreversible .
In the language of thermodynamics the amplification of the charged particle 's presence by the Geiger counter is an irreversible event .
These events have caused the decoherence of the different branches of the wavefunction .
( See " What is decoherence ? " and " Why do worlds split ? " )
Decoherence occurs when irreversible macro - level events take place and the macrostate description of an object admits no single description .
( A macrostate , in brief , is the description of an object in terms of accessible external characteristics . )
The advantage of linking the definition of worlds and the splitting process with thermodynamics is the splitting process becomes irreversible and only permits forward - time - branching , following the increase with entropy .
( See " Why do n't worlds fuse , as well as split ? " )
Like all irreversible processes , though , there are exceptions even at the coarse - grained level and worlds will occasionally fuse .
A necessary , although not sufficient , precondition for fusing is for all records , memories etc. that discriminate between the pre-fused worlds or histories be lost .
This is not a common occurrence .
Q8 When does Schrodinger 's cat split ?
The cat splits when the device is triggered , irreversibly .
The investigator splits when they open the box .
The alive cat has no idea that investigator has split , any more than it is aware that there is a dead cat in the neighbouring split - off world .
The investigator can deduce , after the event , by examining the cyanide mechanism , or the cat 's memory , that the cat split prior to opening the box .
Q9 What is sum -over - histories ?
In the path - integral picture the wavefunction of a single particle at ( x ' , t ' ) is built up of contributions of all possible paths from ( x ,t ) , where each path 's contribution is weighted by a ( phase ) factor of exp ( i*Action [ path ] / hbar ) * wavefunction at ( x ,t ) , summed , in turn , over all values of x .
The Action [ path ] is the time - integral of the lagrangian ( roughly : the lagrangian equals kinetic minus the potential energy ) along the path from ( x ,t ) to ( x ' , t ' ) .
The final expression is thus the sum or integral over all paths , irrespective of any classical dynamical constraints .
For N - particle systems the principle is the same , except that the paths run through a 3 - N space .
In the path - integral approach every possible path through configuration space makes a contribution to the transition amplitude .
From this point of view the particle explores every possible intermediate configuration between the specified start and end states .
For this reason the path - integral technique is often referred to as " sum-over - histories " .
Since we do not occupy a privileged moment in history it is natural to wonder if alternative histories are contributing equally to transition amplitudes in the future , and that each possible history has an equal reality .
Perhaps we should n't be surprised that Feynman is on record as believing in many - worlds .
( See " Who believes in many - worlds ? " )
What is surprising is that Everett developed his many - worlds theory entirely from the Schrodinger viewpoint without any detectable influence from Feynman 's work , despite Feynman and Everett sharing the same Princeton thesis supervisor , John A Wheeler .
Feynman developed his path - integral formalism further during his work on quantum electrodynamics , QED , in parallel with Schwinger and Tomonoga who had developed a less visualisable form of QED .
Dyson showed that these approaches were all equivalent .
Feynman , Schwinger and Tomonoga were awarded the 1965 Physics Nobel Prize for this work .
Feynman 's approach was to show how any process , with defined in ( initial ) and out ( final ) states , can be represented by a series of ( Feynman ) diagrams , which allow for the creation , exchange and annihilation of particles .
Each Feynman diagram represents a different contribution to the complete transition amplitude , provided that the external lines map onto the required boundary initial and final conditions ( the defined in and out states ) .
QED became the prototype for all the other , later , field theories like electro - weak and quantum chromodynamics .

Q10
What is many - histories ?
Gell - Mann and Hartle , in particular , have extended the role of decoherence in defining the Everett worlds , or " histories " in their nomenclature .
They call their approach the " many - histories " approach , where each " coarse - grained or classical history " is associated with a unique time - ordered sequence of sets of irreversible events , including measurements , records , observations and the like .
( See " What is a measurement ? " )
Fine - grained histories effectively relax the irreversible criterion .
Mathematically the many - histories approach is isomorphic to Everett 's many - worlds .
The worlds split or " decohere " from each other when irreversible events occur .
( See " Why do worlds split ? " and " When do worlds split ? " )
Correspondingly many - histories defines a multiply - connected hierarchy of classical histories where each classical history is a " child " of any parent history which has only a subset of the child defining irreversible events and a parent of any history which has a superset of such events .
Climbing up the tree from child to parent moves to progressively coarser grained consistent histories until eventually the top is reached where the history has no defining events ( and thus consistent with everything ! ) .
This is Everett 's universal wavefunction .
The bottom of the coarse - grained tree terminates with the maximally refined set of decohering histories .
The classical histories each have a probability assigned to them and probabilities are additive in the sense that the sum of the probabilities associated a set classical histories is equal to the probability associated with the unique parent history defined by the set .
( Below the maximally refined classical histories are the fine grained or quantum histories , where probabilities are no longer additive and different histories significantly interfere with each other .
The bottom level consists of complete microstates , which fully specified states . )
The decoherence approach is useful in considering the effect of the environment on a system .
In many ways the environment , acting as a heat sink , can be regarded as performing a succession of measurement - like interactions upon any system , inducing associated system splits .
All the environment basis is a basis chosen so as to minimise the cross- basis interference terms .
It makes any real - worlds calculation easy , since the cross terms are so small , but it does not uniquely select a basis , just eliminates a large number .
Q11 How many worlds are there ?
Q12 Is many - worlds a local theory ?
Another way of seeing this is examine how macrostates evolve .
Macrostates descriptions of objects evolve in a local fashion .
Worlds split as the macrostate description divides inside the light cone of the triggering event .
Thus the splitting is a local process , transmitted causally at light or sub - light speeds .
( See " Does the EPR experiment prohibit locality ? " and " When do worlds split ? " )
Q13 Is many - worlds a deterministic theory ?
Some people are under the impression that the only motivation for many - worlds is a desire to return to a deterministic theory of physics .
This is not true .
As Everett pointed out , the objection with the standard Copenhagen interpretation is not the indeterminism per se , but that indeterminism occurs only with the intervention of an observer , when the wavefunction collapses .
( See " What is the Copenhagen interpretation ? " )
Q14
Is many - worlds a relativistic theory ?
What about quantum field theory ?
What about quantum gravity ?
First quantisation : the wavefunction of an N particle system is a complex field which evolves in 3N dimensions as the solution to either the many - particle Schrodinger , Dirac or Klein - Gordon or some other wave equation .
External forces applied to the particles are represented or modelled via a potential , which appears in the wave equation as a classical , background field .
Second quantisation : AKA ( relativistic ) quantum field theory ( QFT ) handles the creation and destruction of particles by quantising the classical fields and potentials as well as the particles .
Each particle corresponds to a field , in QFT , and becomes an operator .
E.g. the electromagnetic field 's particle is the photon .
The wavefunction of a collection of particles / fields exists in a Fock space , where the number of dimensions varies from component to component , corresponding to the indeterminacy in the particle number .
Many - worlds has no problems incorporating QFT , since a theory ( QFT ) is not altered by a metatheory ( many - worlds ) , which makes statements about the theory .
Third quantisation : AKA quantum gravity .
The gravitational metric is quantised , along with ( perhaps ) the topology of the space - time manifold .
The role of time plays a less central role , as might be expected , but the first and second quantisation models are as applicable as ever for modelling low - energy events .
The physics of this is incomplete , including some thorny , unresolved conceptual issues , with a number of proposals ( strings , supersymmetry , supergravity ... ) for ways forward , but the extension required by many - worlds is quite trivial since the mathematics would be unchanged .
One of the original motivations of Everett 's scheme was to provide a system for quantising the gravitational field to yield a quantum cosmology , permitting a complete , self - contained description of the universe .
Indeed many - words actually requires that gravity be quantised , in contrast to other interpretations which are silent about the role of gravity .
( See " Why quantum gravity ? " )
Q15 Where are the other worlds ?
The implicit question is really , why are n't we aware of these other worlds , unless they exist " somewhere " else ?
To see why we are n't aware of the other worlds , despite occupying the same space - time , see " Why do I only ever experience one world ? "
Some popular accounts describe the other worlds as splitting off into other , orthogonal , dimensions .
These dimensions are the dimensions of Hilbert space , not the more familiar space - time dimensions .
Q16 Is many - worlds ( just ) an interpretation ?
First , many - worlds makes predictions that differ from the other so- called interpretations of quantum theory .
Interpretations do not make predictions that differ .
( See " What unique predictions does many - worlds make ? " )
In addition many - worlds retrodicts a lot of data that has no other easy interpretation .
( See " What retrodictions does many - worlds make ? " )
Second , the mathematical structure of many - worlds is not isomorphic to other formulations of quantum mechanics like the Copenhagen interpretation or Bohm 's hidden variables .
The Copenhagen interpretation does not contain those elements of the wavefunction that correspond to the other worlds .
Bohm 's hidden variables contain particles , in addition to the wavefunction .
Neither theory is isomorphic to each other or many - worlds and are not , therefore , merely rival " interpretations " .
Third , there is no scientific , reductionistic alternative to many - worlds .
All the other theories fail for logical reasons .
( See " Is there any alternative theory ? " )
Fourth , the interpretative side of many - worlds , like the subjective probabilistic elements , are derived from within the theory , rather than added to it by assumption , as in the conventional approach .
( See " How do probabilities emerge within many - worlds ? " )
Many - worlds should really be described as a theory or , more precisely , a metatheory , since it makes statements that are applicable about a range of theories .
Many - worlds is the unavoidable implication of any quantum theory which obeys some type of linear wave equation .
( See " Is physics linear ? " )
Q18 What retrodictions does many - worlds make ?
Many - worlds retrodicts all the peculiar properties of the ( apparent ) wavefunction collapse in terms of decoherence .
( See " What is decoherence ? " , " Can wavefunctions collapse ? " , " When do worlds split ? " and " Why do worlds split ? " )
No other quantum theory has yet accounted for this behaviour scientifically .
( See " What are the alternatives to many - worlds ? " )
Q19 Do worlds differentiate or split ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
--------------> time ( Worlds differentiate ) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCC occurs , rather than : BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB B AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
( Worlds split ) C CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC according to many - worlds .
This false differentiation model , at the mental level , seems favoured by adherents of many - minds .
( See " What is many - minds ? " )
Q20 What is many - minds ?
In many - minds the role of the conscious observer is accorded special status , with its fundamental axiom about infinities of pre-existing minds , and as such is philosophically opposed to many - worlds , which seeks to remove the observer from any privileged role in physics .
( Many - minds was co-invented by David Albert , who has , apparently , since abandoned it .
See Scientific American July 1992 page 80 and contrast with Albert 's April ' 94 Scientific American article . )
The two theories must not be confused .
Q21 Does many - worlds violate Ockham 's Razor ?
This is to mistake what is meant by " complex " .
Here 's an example .
Analysis of starlight reveals that starlight is very similar to faint sunlight , both with spectroscopic absorption and emission lines .
Assuming the universality of physical law we are led to conclude that other stars and worlds are scattered , in great numbers , across the cosmos .
The theory that " the stars are distant suns " is the simplest theory and so to be preferred by Ockham 's Razor to other geocentric theories .
Similarly many - worlds is the simplest and most economical quantum theory because it proposes that same laws of physics apply to animate observers as has been observed for inanimate objects .
The multiplicity of worlds predicted by the theory is not a weakness of many - worlds , any more than the multiplicity of stars are for astronomers , since the non-interacting worlds emerge from a simpler theory .
( As an historical aside it is worth noting that Ockham 's razor was also falsely used to argue in favour of the older heliocentric theories against Galileo 's notion of the vastness of the cosmos .
The notion of vast empty interstellar spaces was too uneconomical to be believable to the Medieval mind .
Again they were confusing the notion of vastness with complexity [ 15 ] . )
Q22 Does many - worlds violate conservation of energy ?
Second , and more precisely , conservation of energy , in QM , is formulated in terms of weighted averages or expectation values .
Conservation of energy is expressed by saying that the time derivative of the expected energy of a closed system vanishes .
This statement can be scaled up to include the whole universe .
Each world has an approximate energy , but the energy of the total wavefunction , or any subset of , involves summing over each world , weighted with its probability measure .
This weighted sum is a constant .
So energy is conserved within each world and also across the totality of worlds .
One way of viewing this result - that observed conserved quantities are conserved across the totality of worlds - is to note that new worlds are not created by the action of the wave equation , rather existing worlds are split into successively " thinner " and " thinner " slices , if we view the probability densities as " thickness " .
Q23 How do probabilities emerge within many - worlds ?
Strictly speaking Everett did not prove that the usual statistical laws of the Born interpretation would hold true for all observers in all worlds .
He merely showed that no other statistical laws could hold true and asserted the vanishing of the Hilbert space " volume " or norm of the set of " maverick " worlds .
DeWitt later published a longer derivation of Everett 's assertion [ 4a ] , [ 4b ] , closely based on an earlier , independent demonstration by Hartle [ H ] .
What Everett asserted , and DeWitt / Hartle derived , is that the collective norm of all the maverick worlds , as the number of trials goes to infinity , vanishes .
Since the only vector in a Hilbert space with vanishing norm is the null vector ( a defining axiom of Hilbert spaces ) this is equivalent to saying that non-randomness is never realised .
All the worlds obey the usual Born predictions of quantum theory .
That 's why we never observe the consistent violation of the usual quantum statistics , with , say , heat flowing from a colder to a hotter macroscopic object .
Zero-probability events never happen .
Of course we have to assume that the wavefunction is a Hilbert space vector in the first place but , since this assumption is also made in the standard formulation , this is not a weakness of many - worlds since we are not trying to justify all the axioms of the conventional formulation of QM , merely those that relate to probabilities and collapse of the wavefunction .
In more detail the steps are :
1 ) Construct the tensor product of N identical systems in state |psi > , according to the usual rules for Hilbert space composition ( repeated indices summed ) :
| PSI_N > = |psi_1>*|psi_2 >*...... | psi_N > where |psi_j > = jth system prepared in state |psi > = |i_j >< i_j|psi > ( ie the amplitude of the ith eigenstate is independent of which system it is in ) so that |PSI_N > = |i_1>|i_2 >... |i_N><i_1|psi><i_2|psi>...< i_ N|psi> 2 ) Quantify the deviation from the " expected " Born - mean for each component of | PSI_N > with respect to the above |i_1 > |i_2 >... |i_N > basis by counting the number of occurrences of the ith eigenstate / N. Call this number RF ( i ) .
Define the Born- deviation as D = sum( i ) ( ( RF ( i ) - | < i|psi > | ^2 ) ^2 ) .
Thus D , loosely speaking , for each N length sequence , quantifies by how much the particular sequence differs from the Born-expectation .
3 ) Sort out terms in the expansion of | PSI_N > according to whether D is less / equal to ( .LE . ) or greater than ( .GT . ) E , where E is a real , positive constant .
Collecting terms together we get :
| PSI_N > = | N , " D.GT.E " > + | N , " D.LE.E " > worlds worlds for which for which D > E D <= E 4 ) What DeWitt showed was that :
< N , " D.GT.E " |N , " D.GT.E " > < 1/( NE ) ( proof in appendix of [ 4 b ] )
Thus as N goes to infinity the right - hand side vanishes for all positive values of E . ( This mirrors the classical " frequentist " position on probability which states that if event i occurs with probability p(i ) then the proportion of N trials with outcome i approaches p( i ) / N as N goes to infinity [ H ] .
This has the immediate benefit that sum ( i ) p( i ) = 1 . ) The norm of | N , " D.LE.E " > , by contrast , approaches 1 as N goes to infinity .
Note : this property of D is not shared by other definitions , which is why we have n't investigated them .
If , say , we had defined , in step 2 ) , A = sum( i ) ( ( RF ( i ) - | < i|psi >| ) ^2 ) , so that A measures the deviation from |psi| , rather than |psi| ^2 , then we find that does not have the desired property of vanishing as N goes to infinity .
5 ) The norm of the collection of non-random worlds vanishes and therefore must be identified with some complex multiple of the null vector .
6 ) Since ( by assumption ) the state vector faithfully models reality then the null vector cannot represent any element of reality , since it can be added to ( or subtracted from ) any other state vector without altering the other state vector .
7 ) Ergo the non-random worlds are not realised , without making any additional physical assumptions , such the imposition of a measure .
Note : no finite sequence of outcomes is excluded from happening , since the concept of probability and randomness only becomes precise only as N goes to infinity [ H ] .
Thus , heat could be observed to flow from a cold to hotter object , but we might have to wait a very long time before observing it .
What is excluded is the possibility of this process going on forever .
[ H ] JB Hartle Quantum Mechanics of Individual Systems American Journal of Physics Vol 36 # 8 704-712 ( 1968 )
Hartle has investigated the N goes to infinity limit in more detail and more generally .
He shows that the relative frequency operator , RF , obeys RF( i ) |psi_1>|psi_2 >.... = |< i|psi>|^2 |psi_1>|psi_2 >.... , for a normed state .
Hartle regarded his derivation as essentially the same as Everett's , despite being derived independently .
Q24 Does many - worlds allow free - will ?
Nevertheless , some people find that with all possible decisions being realised in different worlds that the prima face situation for free - will looks quite difficult .
Does this multiplicity of outcomes destroy free - will ?
If both sides of a choice are selected in different worlds why bother to spend time weighing the evidence before selecting ?
The answer is that whilst all decisions are realised , some are realised more often than others - or to put to more precisely each branch of a decision has its own weighting or measure which enforces the usual laws of quantum statistics .
This measure is supplied by the mathematical structure of the Hilbert spaces .
Every Hilbert space has a norm , constructed from the inner product , - which we can think of as analogous to a volume - which weights each world or collection of worlds .
A world of zero volume is never realised .
Worlds in which the conventional statistical predictions consistently break down have zero volume and so are never realised .
( See " How do probabilities emerge within many - worlds ? " )
Thus our actions , as expressions of our will , correlate with the weights associated with worlds .
This , of course , matches our subjective experience of being able to exercise our will , form moral judgements and be held responsible for our actions .
Q25
Why am I in this world and not another ?
Why does the universe appear random ?
Suppose Fred has his brain divided in two and transplanted into two different cloned bodies ( this is a gedanken operation ! [ * ] ) .
Let 's further suppose that each half - brain regenerates to full functionality and call the resultant individuals Fred - Left and Fred - Right .
Fred - Left can ask , why did I end up as Fred - Left ?
Similarly Fred - Right can ask , why did I end up as Fred - Right ?
The only answer possible is that there was no reason .
From Fred 's point of view it is a subjectively random choice which individual " Fred " ends up as .
To the surgeon the whole process is deterministic .
To both the Freds it seems random .
Same with many - worlds .
There was no reason " why " you ended up in this world , rather than another - you end up in all the quantum worlds .
It is a subjectively random choice , an artefact of your brain and consciousness being split , along with the rest of the world , that makes our experiences seem random .
The universe is , in effect , performing umpteen split - brain operations on us all the time .
The randomness apparent in nature is a consequence of the continual splitting into mutually unobservable worlds .
( See " How do probabilities emerge within many - worlds ? " for how the subjective randomness is moderated by the usual probabilistic laws of QM . )
[ *]
Split brain experiments were performed on epileptic patients ( severing the corpus callosum , one of the pathways connecting the cerebral hemispheres , moderated epileptic attacks ) .
Complete hemispherical separation was discontinued when testing of the patients revealed the presence of two distinct consciousnesses in the same skull .
So this analogy is only partly imaginary .
Q26 Can wavefunctions collapse ?
The Copenhagen interpretation posits that observers collapse wavefunctions , but is unable to define " observer " .
( See " What is the Copenhagen interpretation ? " and " Is there any alternative theory ? " )
Without a definition of observer there can be no mechanism triggered by their presence .
Another popular view is that irreversible processes trigger collapse .
Certainly wavefunctions appear to collapse whenever irreversible processes are involved .
And most macroscopic , day - to - day events are irreversible .
The problem is , as with positing observers as a cause of collapse , that any irreversible process is composed of a large number of sub- processes that are each individually reversible .
To invoke irreversibility as a mechanism for collapse we would have to show that new fundamental physics comes into play for complex systems , which is quite absent at the reversible atom / molecular level .
Atoms and molecules are empirically observed to obey some type of wave equation .
We have no evidence for an extra mechanism operating on more complex systems .
As far as we can determine complex systems are described by the quantum - operation of their simpler components interacting together .
( Note : chaos , complexity theory , etc. , do not introduce new fundamental physics .
They still operate within the reductionistic paradigm - despite what many popularisers say . )
Other people have attempted to construct non-linear theories so that microscopic systems are approximately linear and obey the wave equation , whilst macroscopic systems are grossly non-linear and generates collapse .
Unfortunately all these efforts have made additional predictions which , when tested , have failed .
( See " Is physics linear ? " )
( Another reason for doubting that any collapse actually takes place is that the collapse would have to propagate instantaneously , or in some space - like fashion , otherwise the same particle could be observed more than once at different locations .
Not fatal , but unpleasant and difficult to reconcile with special relativity and some conservation laws . )
The simplest conclusion , which is to be preferred by Ockham 's razor , is that wavefunctions just do n't collapse and that all branches of the wavefunction exist .
Q27
Is physics linear ?
Could we ever communicate with the other worlds ?
Why do I only ever experience one world ?
Why am I not aware of the world ( and myself ) splitting ?
Specifically , the wave equation is linear , with respect to the wavefunction or state vector , which means that given any two solutions of the wavefunction , with identical boundary conditions , then any linear combination of the solutions is another solution .
Since each component of a linear solution evolves with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other terms / solutions then we can conclude that no experiment in one world can have any effect on another experiment in another world .
Hence no communication is possible between quantum worlds .
( This type of linearity must n't be confused with the evident non-linearity of the equations with respect to the fields . )
Non communication between the splitting Everett - worlds also explains why we are not aware of any splitting process , since such awareness needs communication between worlds .
To be aware of the world splitting you would have to be receiving sensory information from , and thereby effect by the reverse process , more than one world .
This would enable communication between worlds , which is forbidden by linearity .
Ergo , we are not aware of any splitting precisely because we are split into non-interfering copies along with the rest of the world .
See also " Is linearity exact ? "
Q28
Can we determine what other worlds there are ?
Is the form of the Universal Wavefunction knowable ?
This limits us to drawing conclusions about a restricted subset of the worlds - all the worlds which are consistent with our known history up to a some common moment , before we diverged .
The flow of historical events is , according to chaos / complexity theory / thermodynamics , very sensitive to amplification of quantum - scale uncertainty and this sensitivity is a future - directed one - way process .
We can make very reliable deductions about the past from the knowledge future / present but we can't predict the future from knowledge the past / present .
Thermodynamics implies that the future is harder to predict than the past is to retrodict .
Books get written about this " arrow of time " problem but , for the purposes of this discussion , we 'll accept the thermodynamic origin of time 's arrow is as given .
The fossil and historical records say that dinosaurs and Adolf Hitler once existed but have less to say about the future .
Consider the effects of that most quantum of activities , Brownian motion , on the conception of individuals and the knock - on effects on the course of history .
Mutation itself , one of the sources of evolutionary diversity , is a quantum event .
For an example of the biological / evolutionary implications see Stephen Jay Gould 's book Wonderful Life for an popular exploration of the thesis that the path of evolution is driven by chance .
According to Gould evolutionary history forms an enormously diverse tree of possible histories - all very improbable - with our path being selected by chance .
According to many - worlds all these other possibilities are realised .
Thus there are worlds in which Hitler won WW - II and other worlds in which the dinosaurs never died out .
We can be as certain of this as we are that Hitler and the dinosaurs once existed in our own past .
Whether or not we can ever determine the totality of the universal wavefunction is an open question .
If Steven Hawking 's work on the no- boundary - condition condition is ultimately successful , or it emerges from some theory of everything , and many think it will , then the actual form of the total wavefunction could , in principle , we determined from a complete knowledge of physical law itself .
Q29 Who was Everett ?
Everett was discouraged by the lack of response from others , particularly Bohr , whom he flew to Copenhagen to meet but got the complete brush - off from .
Leaving physics after completing his Ph.D. , Everett worked as a defense analyst at the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group , Pentagon and later became a private contractor , apparently quite successfully for he became a multimillionaire .
In 1968 Everett worked for the Lambda Corp .
His published papers during this period cover things like optimising resource allocation and , in particular , maximising kill rates during nuclear - weapon campaigns .
From 1968 onwards Bryce S DeWitt , one of the 1957 Chapel Hill conference organisers , but better known as one of the founders of quantum gravity , successfully popularised Everett 's relative state formulation as the " many - worlds interpretation " in a series of articles [ 4a ] , [ 4 b ] , [ 5 ] .
Sometime in 1976 - 9 Everett visited Austin , Texas , at Wheeler or DeWitt 's invitation , to give some lectures on QM .
The strict no -smoking rule in the auditorium was relaxed for Everett ( a chain smoker ) ; the only exception ever .
Everett , apparently , had a very intense manner , speaking acutely and anticipating questions after a few words .
Oh yes , a bit of trivia , he drove a Cadillac with horns .
With the steady growth of interest in many - worlds in the late 1970s Everett planned returning to physics to do more work on measurement in quantum theory , but died of a heart attack in 1982 .
Survived by his wife .
Q30 What are the problems with quantum theory ?
Q31 What is the Copenhagen interpretation ?
For these reasons the view has generally been adopted that the wavefunction associated with an object is not a real " thing " , but merely represents our knowledge of the object .
This approach was developed by Bohr and others , mainly at Copenhagen in the late 1920s .
When we perform an measurement or observation of an object we acquire new information and so adjust the wavefunction as we would boundary conditions in classical physics to reflect this new information .
This stance means that we can't answer questions about what 's actually happening , all we can answer is what will be the probability of a particular result if we perform a measurement .
This makes a lot of people very unhappy since it provides no model for the object .
It should be added that there are other , less popular , interpretations of quantum theory , but they all have their own drawbacks , which are widely reckoned more severe .
Generally speaking they try to find a mechanism that describes the collapse process or add extra physical objects to the theory , in addition to the wavefunction .
In this sense they are more complex .
( See " Is there any alternative theory ? " )
Q32
Does the EPR experiment prohibit locality ?
What about Bell 's Inequality ?
The EPR experiment was devised , in 1935 , by Einstein , Podolsky and Rosen to demonstrate that quantum mechanics was incomplete [ E ] .
Bell , in 1964 , demonstrated that any hidden variables theory , to replicate the predictions of QM , must be non-local [ B ] .
QM predicts strong correlations between separated systems , stronger than any local hidden variables theory can offer .
Bell encoded this statistical prediction in the form of some famous inequalities that apply to any type of EPR experiment .
Eberhard , in the late 1970s , extended Bell 's inequalities to cover any local theory , with or without hidden variables .
Thus the EPR experiment plays a central role in sorting and testing variants of QM .
All the experiments attempting to test EPR / Bell 's inequality to date ( including Aspect 's in the 1980s [ As ] ) are in line with the predictions of standard QM - hidden variables are ruled out .
Here is the paradox of the EPR experiment .
It seems to imply that any physical theory must involve faster - than - light " things " going on to maintain these " spooky " action - at - a - distance correlations and yet still be compatible with relativity , which seems to forbid FTL .
Let 's examine the EPR experiment in more detail .
So what did EPR propose ?
The original proposal was formulated in terms of correlations between the positions and momenta of two once - coupled particles .
Here I shall describe it in terms of the spin ( a type of angular momentum intrinsic to the particle ) of two electrons .
[ In this treatment I shall ignore the fact that electrons always form antisymmetric combinations .
This does not alter the results but does simplify the maths . ]
Two initially coupled electrons , with opposed spins that sum to zero , move apart from each other across a distance of perhaps many light years , before being separately detected , say , by me on Earth and you on Alpha Centauri with our respective measuring apparatuses .
The EPR paradox results from noting that if we choose the same ( parallel ) spin axes to measure along then we will observe the two electrons ' spins to be anti-parallel ( i.e. when we communicate we find that the spin on our electrons are correlated and opposed ) .
However if we choose measurement spin axes that are perpendicular to each other then there is no correlation between electron spins .
Last minute alterations in a detector 's alignment can create or destroy correlations across great distances .
This implies , according to some theorists , that faster - than - light influences maintain correlations between separated systems in some circumstances and not others .
Now let 's see how many - worlds escapes from this dilemma .
The initial state of the wavefunction of you , me and the electrons and the rest of the universe may be written :
|psi > = |me > |electrons > | you > |rest of universe > on in on Earth deep Alpha space Centauri or more compactly , ignoring the rest of the universe , as : |psi > = |me , electrons , you >
And |me > represents me on Earth with my detection apparatus .
|electrons > = ( |+ ,-> - |-,+>) / sqrt( 2 ) represents a pair electrons , with the first electron travelling towards Earth and the second electron travelling towards Alpha Centauri .
|+> represents an electron with spin in the +z direction |-> represents an electron with spin in the -z direction
|left > = ( |+> - |->)/ sqrt( 2 ) ( electron with spin in - x direction ) |right > = ( |+> + |->)/ sqrt(2 ) ( electron with spin in +x direction ) |up > = ( |+> + |->i)/sqrt( 2 ) ( electron with spin in +y direction ) | down > = ( |+> - |->i)/sqrt( 2 ) ( electron with spin in -y direction ) and inverting : |+> = ( |right > + | left > ) / sqrt ( 2 ) = ( |up > + | down > ) / sqrt(2 ) |-> = ( |right > - | left > ) / sqrt( 2 ) = ( |down > - |up >)i/sqrt(2 )
( In fancy jargon we say that the spin operators in different directions form non-commuting observables .
I shall eschew such obfuscations . )
Working through the algebra we find that for pairs of electrons :
|+,-> - |-,+> = | left , right > - |right , left > = |up , down >i - |down , up >
I shall assume that we are capable of either measuring spin in the x or y direction , which are both perpendicular the line of flight of the electrons .
After having measured the state of the electron my state is described as one of either :
|me[l ] > represents me + apparatus + records having measured and recorded the x -axis spin as " left " | me[r ] > ditto with the x -axis spin as " right " | me[u ] > ditto with the y - axis spin as " up " | me[ d ] > ditto with the y - axis spin as " down "
To establish familiarity with the notation let 's take the state of the initial wavefunction as :
|psi >_1 = |me , left , up , you > / \ / \ first electron in left second electron in up state state heading towards heading towards you on me on Earth Alpha Centauri
After the electrons arrive at their detectors , I measure the spin along the x-axis and you along the y - axis .
The wavefunction evolves into |psi>_2 :
local |psi>_1 ============ > |psi >_2 = | me[l ] , left , up , you[u ] > observation
which represents me having recorded my electron on Earth with spin left and you having recorded your electron on Alpha Centauri with spin up .
The index in [ ]s indicates the value of the record .
This may be held in the observer 's memory , notebooks or elsewhere in the local environment ( not necessarily in a readable form ) .
If we communicate our readings to each other the wavefunctions evolves into |psi>_3 :
remote |psi>_2 ============ > |psi>_3 = | me[l , u ] , left , up , you[u , l ] > communication
where the second index in [ ]s represents the remote reading communicated to the other observer and being recorded locally .
Notice that the results both agree with each other , in the sense that my record of your result agrees with your record of your result .
And vice versa .
Our records are consistent .
That 's the notation established .
Now let 's see what happens in the more general case where , again , :
|electrons > = ( |+ ,-> - |-,+>) / sqrt(2 ) .
First we 'll consider the case where you and I have previously arranged to measure the our respective electron spins along the same x-axis .
Initially the wavefunction of the system of electrons and two experimenters is :
|psi >_1 = |me , electrons , you > = |me >( |left , right > - |right , left > ) |you > / sqrt ( 2 ) = |me , left , right , you > / sqrt ( 2 ) - |me , right , left , you > /sqrt( 2 )
Neither you or I are yet unambiguously split .
Suppose I perform my measurement first ( in some time frame ) .
We get
|psi >_2 = ( |me[l ] , left , right > - | me[r ] , right , left > ) |you > / sqrt ( 2 ) = | me[l ] , left , right , you > / sqrt ( 2 ) - | me[r ] , right , left , you > /sqrt ( 2 )
My measurement has split me , although you , having made no measurement , remain unsplit .
In the full expansion the terms that correspond to you are identical .
After the we each have performed our measurements we get :
|psi>_3 = | me[l ] , left , right , you[r ] > / sqrt ( 2 ) - | me[r ] , right , left , you[l ] > / sqrt( 2 )
The observers ( you and me ) have been split ( on Earth and Alpha Centauri ) into relative states ( or local worlds ) which correlate with the state of the electron .
If we now communicate over interstellar modem ( this will take a few years since you and I are separated by light years , but no matter ) .
We get :
|psi >_4 = | me[l , r ] , left , right , you[r , l ] > / sqrt ( 2 ) - | me[r , l ] , right , left , you[l , r ] > / sqrt ( 2 )
The world corresponding to the 2nd term in the above expansion , for example , contains me having seen my electron with spin right and knowing that you have seen your electron with spin left .
So we jointly agree , in both worlds , that spin has been conserved .
Now suppose that we had prearranged to measure the spins along different axes .
Suppose I measure the x-direction spin and you the y - direction spin .
Things get a bit more complex .
To analyse what happens we need to decompose the two electrons along their respective spin axes .
|psi >_1 = |me , electrons , you > = |me >( |+ ,-> - |-,+>) |you >/ sqrt( 2 ) = |me > ( ( |right > + |left > ) i( |down > - |up > ) - ( |right > - |left > ) ( |down > +|up > ) ) | you > /2*sqrt ( 2 ) = |me > ( |right >( | down > - |up > ) i + | left > ( |down > - |up > ) i - |right >( | down > + |up > ) + | left > ( |down > +|up > ) ) | you > /2*sqrt ( 2 ) = |me > ( |right , down > ( i - 1 ) - |right , up > ( 1+i ) + | left , up > ( 1 - i ) + | left , down > ( 1+i ) ) | you > /2*sqrt ( 2 ) = ( + | me , right , down , you > ( i - 1 ) - |me , right , up , you > ( i+1 ) + | me , left , up , you > ( 1 - i ) + |me , left , down , you > ( 1+i ) ) /2*sqrt( 2 )
So after you and I make our local observations we get :
|psi >_2 = ( + | me[r ] , right , down , you[d ] > ( i - 1 ) - | me[r ] , right , up , you[u ] > ( i+1 ) + | me[l ] , left , up , you[u ] > ( 1 - i ) + | me[l ] , left , down , you[d ] >
( 1+i ) ) /2*sqrt(2 )
Each term realises a possible outcome of the joint measurements .
The interesting thing is that whilst we can decompose it into four terms there are only two states for each observer .
Looking at myself , for instance , we can rewrite this in terms of states relative to * my * records / memories .
|psi >_2 = ( | me[r ] , right > ( | down , you[d ] > ( i - 1 ) - |up , you[u ] > ( i+1 ) ) + | me[l ] , left > ( |up , you[u ] > ( 1 - i ) + | down , you[d ] >
( 1+i ) ) )
/2*sqrt(2 )
And we see that there are only two copies of me .
Equally we can rewrite the expression in terms of states relative to your records / memory .
|psi >_2 = ( ( | me[l ] , left > ( 1 - i ) - | me[r ] , right > ( i+1 ) ) |up , you[u ] > + ( | me[r ] , right > ( i - 1 ) + | me[l ] , left > ( 1+i ) ) | down , you[d ] > )
/2*sqrt(2 )
After you and I communicate our readings to each other , more than four years later , we get :
|psi>_3 = ( + | me[r , d ] , right , down , you[d , r ] > ( i - 1 ) - | me[r , u ] , right , up , you[u , r ] > ( i+1 ) + | me[l , u ] , left , up , you[u , l ] > ( 1 - i ) + | me[l , d ] , left , down , you[d , l ] > ( 1+i ) ) /2*sqrt ( 2 )
The decomposition into four worlds is forced and unambiguous after communication with the remote system .
Until the two observers communicated their results to each other they were each unsplit by each others ' measurements , although their own local measurements had split themselves .
The splitting is a local process that is causally transmitted from system to system at light or sub - light speeds .
( This is a point that Everett stressed about Einstein 's remark about the observations of a mouse , in the Copenhagen interpretation , collapsing the wavefunction of the universe .
Everett observed that it is the mouse that 's split by its observation of the rest of the universe .
The rest of the universe is unaffected and unsplit . )
When all communication is complete the worlds have finally decomposed or decohered from each other .
Each world contains a consistent set of observers , records and electrons , in perfect agreement with the predictions of standard QM .
Further observations of the electrons will agree with the earlier ones and so each observer , in each world , can henceforth regard the electron 's wavefunction as having collapsed to match the historically recorded , locally observed values .
This justifies our operational adoption of the collapse of the wavefunction upon measurement , without having to strain our credibility by believing that it actually happens .
To recap .
Many - worlds is local and deterministic .
Local measurements split local systems ( including observers ) in a subjectively random fashion ; distant systems are only split when the causally transmitted effects of the local interactions reach them .
We have not assumed any non-local FTL effects , yet we have reproduced the standard predictions of QM .
So where did Bell and Eberhard go wrong ?
They thought that all theories that reproduced the standard predictions must be non-local .
It has been pointed out by both Albert [ A ] and Cramer [ C ] ( who both support different interpretations of QM ) that Bell and Eberhard had implicity assumed that every possible measurement - even if not performed - would have yielded a single definite result .
This assumption is called contra-factual definiteness or CFD [ S ] .
What Bell and Eberhard really proved was that every quantum theory must either violate locality or CFD .
Many - worlds with its multiplicity of results in different worlds violates CFD , of course , and thus can be local .
Thus many - worlds is the only local quantum theory in accord with the standard predictions of QM and , so far , with experiment .

Q33 Is Everett 's relative state formulation the same as many - worlds ?
Yes , Everett 's formulation of the relative state metatheory is the same as many - worlds , but the language has evolved a lot from Everett 's original article [ 2 ] and some of his work has been extended , especially in the area of decoherence .
( See " What is decoherence ? " )
This has confused some people into thinking that Everett 's " relative state metatheory " and DeWitt 's " many - worlds interpretation " are different theories .
Everett [ 2 ] talked about the observer 's memory sequences splitting to form a " branching tree " structure or the state of the observer being split by a measurement .
( See " What is a measurement ? " )
DeWitt introduced the term " world " for describing the split states of an observer , so that we now speak of the observer 's world splitting during the measuring process .
The maths is the same , but the terminology is different .
( See " What is a world ? " )
Everett tended to speak in terms of the measuring apparatus being split by the measurement , into non-interfering states , without presenting a detailed analysis of * why * a measuring apparatus was so effective at destroying interference effects after a measurement , although the topics of orthogonality , amplification and irreversibility were covered .
( See " What is a measurement ? " , " Why do worlds split ? " and " When do worlds split ? " )
DeWitt [ 4b ] , Gell - Mann and Hartle [ 10 ] , Zurek [ 7a ] and others have introduced the terminology of " decoherence " ( See " What is decoherence ? " ) to describe the role of amplification and irreversibility within the framework of thermodynamics .
Q34 What is a relative state ?
Let 's take the example of Schrodinger 's cat and ask what is the relative state of the observer , after looking inside the box ?
The relative state of the observer ( either " saw cat dead " or " saw cat alive " ) is conditional upon the state of the cat ( either " dead " or " alive " ) .
Another example : the relative state of the last name of the President of the Unites States , in 1995 , is " Clinton " .
Relative to what ?
Relative to you and me , in this world .
In some other worlds it will be " Bush " , " Smith " , etc. .......
Each possibility is realised in some world and it is the relative state of the President 's name , relative to the occupants of that world .
According to Everett almost all states are relative states .
Only the state of the universal wavefunction is not relative but absolute .
Q35 Was Everett a " splitter " ?
[ #]
Note added in proof --
In reply to a preprint of this article some correspondents have raised the question of the " transition from possible to actual , " arguing that in " reality " there is - as our experience testifies - no such splitting of observers states , so that only one branch can ever actually exist .
Since this point may occur to other readers the following is offered in explanation .
The whole issue of the transition from " possible " to " actual " is taken care of in the theory in a very simple way - there is no such transition , nor is such a transition necessary for the theory to be in accord with our experience .
From the viewpoint of the theory all elements of a superposition ( all " branches " ) are " actual , " none are any more " real " than the rest .
It is unnecessary to suppose that all but one are somehow destroyed , since all separate elements of a superposition individually obey the wave equation with complete indifference to the presence or absence ( " actuality " or not ) of any other elements .
This total lack of effect of one branch on another also implies that no observer will ever be aware of any " splitting " process .
Arguments that the world picture presented by this theory is contradicted by experience , because we are unaware of any branching process , are like the criticism of the Copernican theory that the mobility of the earth as a real physical fact is incompatible with the common sense interpretation of nature because we feel no such motion .
In both case the arguments fails when it is shown that the theory itself predicts that our experience will be what it in fact is .
( In the Copernican case the addition of Newtonian physics was required to be able to show that the earth 's inhabitants would be unaware of any motion of the earth . )
Q36 What unique predictions does many - worlds make ?
Q37 Could we detect other Everett - worlds ?
According to many - worlds model worlds split with the operation of every thermodynamically irreversible process .
The operation of our minds are irreversible , carried along for the ride , so to speak , and divide with the division of worlds .
Normally this splitting is undetectable to us .
To detect the splitting we need to set an up experiment where a mind is split but the world is n't .
We need a reversible mind .
The general consensus in the literature [ 11 ] , [ 16 ] is that the experiment to detect other worlds , with reversible minds , will be doable by , perhaps , about mid-21st century .
That date is predicted from two trendlines , both of which are widely accepted in their own respective fields .
To detect the other worlds you need a reversible machine intelligence .
This requires two things : reversible nanotechnology and AI .
1 ) Reversible nanoelectronics .
This is an straight - line extrapolation based upon the log( energy ) / logic operation figures , which are projected to drop below kT in about 2020 .
This trend has held good for 50 years .
An operation that thermally dissipates much less than kT of energy is reversible .
( This implies that frictive or dissipative forces are insignificant by comparison with other processes . )
If more than kT of energy is released then , ultimately , new degrees of freedom are activated in the environment and the change becomes irreversible .
2 ) AI .
Complexity of human brain = approx 10 ^ 17 bits / sec , based on the number of neurons ( approx 10^10 ) per human brain , average number of synapses per neuron ( approx 10^4 ) and the average firing rate ( approx 10^3 Hz ) .
Straight line projection of log( cost ) / logic operation says that human level , self - aware machine intelligences will be commercially available by about 2030 - 2040 .
Uncertainty due to present human - level complexity , but the trend has held good for 40 years .
Assuming that we have a reversible machine intelligence to hand then the experiment consists of the machine making three reversible measurements of the spin of an electron ( or polarisation of a photon ) .
( 1 ) First it measures the spin along the z -axis .
It records either spin " up " or spin " down " and notes this in its memory .
This measurement acts just to prepare the electron in a definite state .
( 2 ) Second it measures the spin along the x-axis and records either spin " left " or spin " right " and notes this in its memory .
The machine now reverses the entire x- axis measurement - which must be possible , since physics is effectively reversible , if we can describe the measuring process physically - including reversibly erasing its memory of the second measurement .
( 3 ) Third the machine takes a spin measurement along the z -axis .
Again the machine makes a note of the result .
According to the Copenhagen interpretation the original ( 1 ) and final ( 3 ) z - axis spin measurements have only a 50 % chance of agreeing because the intervention of the x-axis measurement by the conscious observer ( the machine ) caused the collapse of the electron 's wavefunction .
According to many - worlds the first and third measurements willalways agree , because there was no intermediate wavefunction collapse .
The machine was split into two states or different worlds , by the second measurement ; one where it observed the electron with spin " left " ; one where it observed the electron with spin " right " .
Hence when the machine reversed the second measurement these two worlds merged back together , restoring the original state of the electron 100 % of the time .
Only by accepting the existence of the other Everett - worlds is this 100 % restoration explicable .
Q38 Why quantum gravity ?
To see why many - worlds predicts that gravity must be quantised , let 's suppose that gravity is not quantised , but remains a classical force .
If all the other worlds that many - worlds predicts exist then their gravitational presence should be detectable -- we would all share the same background gravitational metric with our co-existing quantum worlds .
Some of these effects might be undetectable .
For instance if all the parallel Earths shared the same gravitational field small perturbations in one Earth 's orbit from the averaged background orbit across all the Everett - worlds would damp down , eventually , and remain undetectable .
However theories of galactic evolution would need considerable revisiting if many - worlds was true and gravity was not quantised , since , according to the latest cosmological models , the original density fluctuations derive from quantum fluctuations in the early universe , during the inflationary era .
These quantum fluctuations lead to the formation of clusters and super - clusters of galaxies , along with variations in the cosmic microwave background ( detected by Smoots et al ) which vary in location from Everett - cosmos to cosmos .
Such fluctuations could not grow to match the observed pattern if all the density perturbations across all the parallel Everett - cosmoses were gravitationally interacting .
Stars would bind not only to the observed galaxies , but also to the host of unobserved galaxies .
A theory of classical gravity also breaks down at the scale of objects that are not bound together gravitationally .
Henry Cavendish , in 1798 , measured the torque produced by the gravitational force on two separated lead spheres suspended from a torsion fibre in his laboratory to determine the value of Newton 's gravitational constant .
Cavendish varied the positions of other , more massive lead spheres and noted how the torsion in the suspending fibre varied .
Had the suspended lead spheres been gravitationally influenced by their neighbours , placed in different positions by parallel Henry Cavendishs in the parallel Everett - worlds , then the torsion would have been the averaged sum of all these contributions , which was not observed .
In retrospect Cavendish established that the Everett - worlds are not detectable gravitationally .
More recent experiments where the location of attracting masses were varied by a quantum random ( radioactive ) source have confirmed these findings . [ W ]
A shared gravitational field would also screw up geo- gravimetric surveys , which have successfully detected the presence of mountains , ores and other density fluctuations at the Earth 's surface .
Such surveys are not sensitive to the presence of the parallel Everett - Earths with different geological structures .
Ergo the other worlds are not detectable gravitationally .
That gravity must be quantised emerges as a unique prediction of many - worlds .

Q39 Is linearity exact ?
The argument for exactness uses a version of the weak anthropic principle and proceeds thus : the exploitation of slight non-linear quantum effects could permit communication with and travel to the other Everett - worlds .
A sufficiently advanced " early " civilisation [ F ] might colonise uninhabited other worlds , presumably in an exponentially spreading fashion .
Since the course of evolution is dictated by random quantum events ( mutations , genetic recombination ) and environmental effects ( asteroidal induced mass extinctions , etc. ) it seems inevitable that in a minority , although still a great many , of these parallel worlds life on Earth has already evolved sapient - level intelligence and developed an advanced technology millions or even billions of years ago .
Such early arrivals , under the usual Darwinian pressure to expand , would spread across the parallel time tracks , if they had the ability , displacing their less - evolved quantum neighbours .
The fossil record indicates that evolution , in our ancestral lineage , has proceeded at varying rates at different times .
Periods of rapid development in complexity ( e.g. the Cambrian explosion of 530 millions years ago or the quadrupling of brain size during the recent Ice Ages ) are interspersed with long periods of much slower development .
This indicates that we are not in the fast lane of evolution , where all the lucky breaks turned out just right for the early development of intelligence and technology .
Ergo none of the more advanced civilisations that exist in other worlds have ever been able to cross from one quantum world to another and interrupt our long , slow biological evolution .
The simplest explanation is that physics is sufficiently linear to prevent travel between Everett worlds .
If technology is only bounded by physical law ( the Feinberg principle [ F ] ) then linearity would have to be exact .

Q40
Why can't the boundary conditions be updated to reflect my observations in this one world ?
For example consider a photon that hits a half - silvered mirror and turns into a superposition of a transmitted and a reflected photon .
If we time - evolve one of these later states backwards we get not the original photon , but the original photon plus a " mirror image " of the original photon .
( Try the calculation and see . )
Only if we retain both the reflected and transmitted photons , with the correct relative phase , do we recover the single incoming photon when we time - reverse everything .
( The mirror image contributions from both the final states have opposite signs and cancel out , when they are evolved backwards in time to before the reflection event . )
All the starting states have to have their relative phases co-ordinated or correlated just right ( i.e. coherently ) or else it does n't work out .
Needless to say the chances that the initial states should be arranged coherently just so that they yield the one final observed state are infinitesimal and in violation of observed thermodynamics , which states , in one form , that correlations only increase with time .

Quantum theory is the most successful theory of physics and chemistry ever .
It accounts for a wide range of phenomena from black body radiation , atomic structure and chemistry , which were very puzzling before quantum mechanics was first developed ( c1926 ) in its modern form .
All theories of physics are quantum physics , with whole new fields , like the semiconductor and microchip technology , based upon the quantum effects .
This FAQ assumes familiarity with the basics of quantum theory and with the associated " paradoxes " of wave - particle duality .
It will not explain the uncertainty principle or delve into the significance of non-commuting matrix operators .
Only those elements of quantum theory necessary for an understanding of many - worlds are covered here .
Quantum theory contains , as a central object , an abstract mathematical entity called the " wavefunction " or " state vector " .
Determining the equations that describe its form and evolution with time is an unfinished part of fundamental theoretical physics .
Presently we only have approximations to some " correct " set of equations , often referred to whimsically as the Theory of Everything .
The wavefunction , in bracket or Dirac notation , is written as | symbol > , where " symbol " labels the object .
A dog , for example , might be represented as |dog > .
A general object , labelled " psi " by convention , is represented as |psi > and called a " ket " .
Objects called " bra "s , written < psi| , may be formed from kets .
An arbitrary bra < psi '| and ket |psi > may be combined together to form the bracket , < psi'|psi > , or inner product , which is just a fancy way of constructing a complex number .
Amongst the properties of the inner product is :
< psi '| ( |psi1>*a_1 + |psi2>*a_2 ) = < psi'|psi1>*a_1 + < psi'|psi2>*a_2
< psi|psi '> = complex conjugate of < psi'|psi >
Any ket may be expanded as :
|psi > = sum |i>*< i|psi> i = |1>*< 1|psi > + |2>*< 2|psi > + ...
The probability amplitudes , < i|psi > , are complex numbers .
It is empirically observed , first noted by Max Born and afterwards called the Born interpretation , that their magnitudes squared represent the probability that , upon observation , that the value of the parameter , labelled by i , will be observed if the system is the state represented by |psi > .
It is also empirically observed that after observing the system in state |i > that we can henceforth replace the old value of the wavefunction , |psi > , with the observed value , |i > .
This replacement is known as the collapse of the wavefunction and is the source of much philosophical controversy .
Somehow the act of measurement has selected out one of the components .
This is known as the measurement problem and it was this phenomenon that Everett addressed .
When a bra , < psi| , is formed from a ket , |psi > , and both are inner productted together the result , < psi|psi > , is a non-negative real number , called the norm of the vector .
The norm of a vector provides a basis - independent way of measuring the " volume " of the vector .
The wavefunction for a joint system is built out of products of the components from the individual subsystems .
For example if the two systems composing the joint system are a cat and a dog , each of which may be in two states , alive or dead , and the state of the cat and the dog were independent of each other then we could write the total wavefunction as a product of terms .
If
|cat > = | cat alive > * c_a + | cat dead > * c_d and | dog > = | dog alive > * d_a + | dog dead > * d_d then | dog+cat > = | cat > x|dog > where x = tensor product = ( |cat alive > * c_a + | cat dead > * c_d ) x ( |dog alive > * d_a + | dog dead > * d_d ) = | cat alive > x |dog alive > * c_a * d_a + | cat alive > x |dog dead > * c_a * d_d + | cat dead > x |dog alive > * c_d * d_a + | cat dead > x |dog dead > * c_d * d_d = | cat alive , dog alive > * c_a * d_a + | cat alive , dog dead > * c_a * d_d + | cat dead , dog alive > * c_d * d_a + | cat dead , dog dead > * c_d * d_d
|dog+cat > = | cat alive , dog alive > * a_1 + | cat alive , dog dead > * a_2 + | cat dead , dog alive > * a_3 + | cat dead , dog dead > * a_4
|dog+cat > = | cat alive > x( |dog alive > * a_1 + | dog dead > * a _2 ) + | cat dead > x ( |dog alive > * a_3 + | dog dead > * a_4 )
( |dog alive > * a_1 + | dog dead > * a_2 ) / sqrt( |a_1|^2 + | a_2|^2 )
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS EXTEND OUTWARD UP TO 35 MILES ...55 KM ... FROM THE CENTER ... AND TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS EXTEND OUTWARD UP TO 140 MILES ... 220 KM .
ESTIMATED MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE IS 970 MB ...
Why this matters :
If there were Cat2 winds in that area , we could have been talking about around 2.5 million barrels per day of Mexico 's supply capacity being shut in for a while , and some of that shut in for an extended amount of time .
Around 1.5 mbpd of that capacity is exported to the US ( of the 20.5 mbpd the US uses , and the 85 mbpd the world uses , each day ) .
There are also some questions about the resilience of refineries and flow lines in the area of the second landfall .
Hurricane Dean became a Category 5 storm last night with winds reaching 165 mph and reaching a low pressure of 909 mb ( as of 2:15 a EDT ; Katrina was 920 mb and Camille 909 mb ) .
Landfall occurred early yesterday morning with a second landfall occurring some time today .
This is an historic hurricane by any standard .
UPDATE FROM CHUCK WATSON at 5 p EDT , 8/21
Chuck Watson of KAC / UCF has just released his damage estimates .
Here 's what he has to say :
NHC has dropped their intensity more in line with our estimates .
I 'm sticking with the earlier damage forecast - Southwestern about 10 days , Northwestern ( Cantarell etc ) 15 to 18 days , unless something unlucky happens like a critical component failure .
So our total shut in forecast from this event is around 30 million BBL , which was at the low end of my earlier model .
The storm decayed more than the NHC estimates .
Under the fold ( click " there 's more " below ) , we are going to try to bring together some of our information we have gleaned to this point .

What is the area we 're worrying about ?
Cantarell and KMZ , as said above , PEMEX is shutting down ~ 140 rigs and moving 13,000 + workers on land .
Cantarell + Ku-Maloob - Zaap account for 66 % of the total oil production of PEMEX in June 2007 .
Cantarell alone is 47 % of the total .... and here 's the best pic we have ( right click and view image to see full size ) :

Khebab posted " An Update on Mexico 's Oil Production -- The Rapid Collapse of Cantarell by the Numbers "
Last year , I expressed my concerns about the eventual impact of a rapid collapse of Cantarell on Mexico 's oil production ( story here ) .
The last production numbers from PEMEX seems to confirm the rapid decline of Cantarell as well as the inability of the Mexican to rapidly bring new production online .
The Wall Street Journal ( thanks to Jerôme ) published an article on Cantarell last week :
The virtual collapse at Cantarell -- the world 's second - biggest oilfield in terms of output at the start of last year -- is unfolding much faster than projections from Mexico 's state - run oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos , or Pemex .
Cantarell 's daily output fell to 1.5 million barrels in December compared to 1.99 million barrels in January , according to figures from the Mexican Energy Ministry .

Euan Mearns put some flesh on the bones of Mexican oil production here ( discusses the KMZ area very nicely and has a couple of nice maps too . )
Following on from Khebab 's posts ( Jan 2007 and July 2006 ) I wanted to put some production geology flesh on the bones of Mexican oil production .
The main points I want to make are : 1 . Forecast production decline of 14 % per annum in Cantarell sounds alarming but it is in fact the result of planned reservoir management .
2 . The forecast decline of Cantarell is due in part to the diversion of nitrogen injection from Cantarell to the neighbouring Ku-Maloob - Zaap ( KMZ ) complex of fields .
Production at KMZ is forecast to rise to around 800 MBD and this will partly offset production falls at Cantarell .
3. Cantarell / Mexican production is predominantly heavy crude , and it is postulated that any production declines in Mexico may be met by additoinal production of Saudi Arabian heavy crude forward to 2012 .
4. Notwithstanding point 3 , Mexican oil production decline means that 4 out of 5 major OECD producers are now in decline ( Norway , UK , USA and Mexico ) , leaving only Canada with growing production and this presents the OECD with a growing problem of energy security .
5 . The Hubbert Linearisation ( HL ) for Mexico reflects reservoir management ( gas lift and nitrogen injection ) and new field developments but the interpretation remains equivocal .
A brief description is given of why Pemex have used gas lift and nitrogen injection to boost production at Cantarell .
***
Luis de Souza put together this analysis of world oil exports for Mexico
Mexico is here assessed to be capable of producing a total of 50 Gb to 2075 , giving a midpoint of depletion in 1999 , some fourteen years after what appears to be a premature actual peak in 1985 .
Production now stands at about 3.2 Mb/d , being subject to a fairly high depletion rate of 5 % a year .
Mexico seems to have peaked only in 2004 , but the future decline rate is maintained .

Almost Total Cantarell Evacuation
Mexico clears oil rigs as hurricane nears
Might order total well closure Mexican state oil company Pemex on Sunday evacuated thousands of oil workers from the Gulf of Mexico and warned it might close up to 2.2 m barrels a day of crude oil production as the powerful hurricane approached .
Pemex said it was evacuating 13,360 workers – most of its workforce in the area - and that it might order the ” total closure of the oil wells ” in the Cantarell oil field and other fields .

The battle of titans between Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. over the future of the Internet is about to get even hotter .
Microsoft is in talks to buy a minority stake in the popular social - networking Web site Facebook Inc. , a sign of a new urgency by the software giant to jump - start its online business at a time when Google is widening its lead in the fast - growing Internet - advertising business .
As part of its catch - up program , Microsoft also has quietly granted broad powers to an executive recently hired from outside the company , who is expected to help shake up the software giant 's online business .
Microsoft in recent weeks approached Facebook with proposals to invest in the startup that could value the fast - growing site at $ 10 billion or higher , said people familiar with the matter .
If those talks bear fruit , Microsoft could purchase a stake of up to 5 % in the closely held startup , at a cost in the range of $ 300 million to $ 500 million , the people said .
But Microsoft must first outgun Google , which has also expressed strong interest in a Facebook stake , according to people familiar with the matter .
The Facebook talks come as Microsoft 's top management is making another significant move at its online - advertising business .
The company is expected to give increasing oversight of its Internet operations to Brian McAndrews , an advertising executive who joined Microsoft just last month through its $ 6 billion acquisition of aQuantive Inc. , an online - advertising specialist that is also part of Microsoft 's strategic push .
His broad mission will be to increase the number of advertisers that buy ads through Microsoft 's system and Web publishers that tap into it for ads to run on their sites .
FOR a month now , young Hollywood has been planning a retirement party .
The guest list spans the pop culture landscape -- studio executives , novelists , Academy Award winners , sitcom writers , musicians .
One proposal has Martin Scorsese jumping out of a cake .
The honoree will take the bus unless he can hitch a ride with someone .
A lively , bespectacled bachelor who lives alone in a rent - controlled apartment , he can’t drive .
Nor can he afford a limo , though some of the most successful people in show business attribute their very sensibility as artists to him .
“ Where do you begin ?
He shaped the way I think , ” said Ben Cosgrove , Paramount Pictures ’ senior vice president of production .
“ I would not be the person I am today without him , or make the films I make , ” said Brett Morgen , the Oscar - nominated co-director of “ On the Ropes ” and “ The Kid Stays in the Picture . ”

“ Single biggest influence of my life , ” said screenwriter Alex Kurtzman ( “ Mission : Impossible III , ” “ Transformers ” ) .
“ I actually have a theory , ” said actor Zooey Deschanel , “ that everything in Hollywood is directly or indirectly influenced by Jim Hosney .
And if it ’s not the case , it should be . ”
Jim Hosney does n’t work in show business .
He ’s not a critic or an emeritus studio head .
In one of the sharper ironies of a field often disparaged as mindless and superficial , the most influential Hollywood player you ’ve probably never heard of is a 63 - year - old English teacher .
This month , after a career that has spanned nearly four decades , he ’ll be taking early retirement from Santa Monica ’s Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences , where he has taught high school film studies and literature for 25 years .
Before Crossroads , he spent a decade at the Westlake School for Girls ( now Harvard - Westlake ) , and , since 1980 , he has taught graduate - level film history on the side at the American Film Institute .
Over time , he has become a minor cult figure on Los Angeles ’ show - business - heavy Westside , not only for his singular approach to great books and popular culture , but also for the legions of tastemakers who credit their understanding of L.A. 's signature art form -- storytelling -- to him .
Advertisement
Hosney ’s pop culture proteges number in the hundreds -- writers , performers , moviemakers , film scholars at USC and UCLA .
Jack Black and Maya Rudolph did some of their earliest work for him .
So did producers Bryan Burk ( “ Lost , ” “ Alias ” ) , Jason Blumenthal ( “ The Pursuit of Happyness ” ) , Danielle Renfrew ( “ Waitress ” ) and Matthew Greenfield ( “ Chuck & Buck , ” “ The Good Girl ” ) .
“ There was not a single course he taught that I did not take , ” said filmmaker Jonathan Kasdan ( “ In the Land of Women ” ) .
Melissa Clark , novelist and creator of the children ’s TV show “ Braceface , ” remembers being so inspired in his class that she ’d turn papers in late just for the excuse to drive by his apartment .
“ It was like I had a brain crush , ” she said .
The costume designer from “ Being John Malkovich ” is a former student .
So is the guitarist for the seminal ‘ 90s punk band Jawbreaker .
So is the founder and organizer of Cinespia , the Hollywood Forever Cemetery outdoor film fest .
Former Hosney students write for Vanity Fair , for this newspaper , for influential blogs such as the L.A. - based TruthDig .
That ’s not counting the AFI graduate students or Crossroads parents who have consulted him on projects , from Dustin Hoffman , who drew from Hosney for his portrayal of a professor in “ Stranger Than Fiction , ” to Michael Mann , who sought Hosney ’s opinion , among others , in putting together the Oscar montage he directed last year .
“ He ’s one of the most important figures in contemporary film who is largely unknown , ” said Ron Yerxa , a producer of “ Election ” and “ Little Children ” and a longtime friend .

HOSNEY ’S self - assessment is less dramatic .
“ I ’m a teacher , ” he said with a shrug .
“ I teach . ”
He was raised in Los Angeles , the younger son of Syrian immigrants , an apartment manager and a seamstress .
As a child , he lived for stories -- epic novels , double features .
“ I wanted life to be like a musical , ” he remembered , sitting in his office at Crossroads .
“ I was always disappointed that people did n’t burst out singing on the street . ”

In 1961 , he graduated from George Washington High School with a full scholarship to Occidental College , where he eventually entered a doctoral program in Anglo American literature .
“ I wanted to teach at the college level , ” Hosney recalled , “ but while I was at graduate school at Oxy , I took a job , like a long - term substitute teacher , at the Westridge School , a girls ’ school in Pasadena . ”
Experienced only as a university teaching assistant , Hosney treated the teenage girls as if they were college students .
It taught him a lesson .
“ Never underestimate your students , ” he says now .
“ Those kids were great . ”
Advertisement
By 1970 , he had taken that lesson to Westlake along with another he had learned at Occidental : that the study of literature need n’t be limited to books .
At the time , Hosney said , cinema was just beginning to be taken seriously by scholars .
At Occidental , his mentor -- Marsha Kinder , who is now a USC professor of critical studies -- had showed him “ that movies are just as complicated artistically as novels , that they can be treated as works of art . ”
“ He came in with his giant Afro and tie - dyed T - shirt , and he was about as passionate about literature and film as you could expect any human being to be , and still be coherent , ” recalled Nathan Reynolds , the now - retired headmaster who hired him at Westlake .
Hosney says he and the students learned together .
Advertisement
“ I showed movies I ’d always wanted to see but had never seen , ” he remembered .
“ We saw Vincente Minnelli , ‘ Some Came Running . ’
Douglas Sirk stuff --
I remember teaching a class in film melodrama and showing ‘ Imitation of Life , ’ and they were all in tears by the end of the movie .
But also Jean - Luc Godard , Francois Truffaut , Robert Bresson . ”
His courses focused on critical thinking and writing , he said , but grew to incorporate other disciplines .
“ You could teach a class where , say , you were looking at American horror films but at the same time also reading Poe , Hawthorne , other American authors who wrote horror .
You could show how the two mediums are connected , show the process of adaptation .
Show how film is a cultural construct , what it says about American society . ”
As Hosney spoke , he moved forward .
A compact man with cropped , dark hair and rectangular glasses , he is famously animated when he lectures .
He leans into his audience , almost as if he is about to climb it ; his long hands move as if painting a picture .
At his back was a framed poster , in French , for the film “ Taxi Driver . ”

“ Why , for example , is ‘ Psycho ’ made in 1960 ? ” he asked excitedly .
“ Why does ‘ Psycho ’ make more money than any other of Hitchcock ’s films ?
“ Well , it ’s the Kennedy election .
The country is changing .
And by now , the public is used to television .
Go back and look at ‘ Psycho . ’
There are incredible sequences in it , but there are also some very stagy , talky sequences that come right out of television .... ”
And with that , he was off -- the conventions of TV , the films of the ‘ 60s -- until finally , he circled back to his original question and the answer Truffaut once got from Hitchcock .
“ Hitchcock , ” he said , leaning in , “ wanted to see if he could shoot a movie the way he had shot shows on TV . ”
He smiled with such delight , it was almost as if he had n’t been teaching this insight for decades , almost as if you , the listener , had deduced it independently .

HOSNEY left the Westlake School in 1980 .
He had hoped to work in film with his friend Yerxa , but the position fell through .
He quickly returned to teaching , by night at AFI and by day at Los Angeles High School , where he might have stayed , he added , had the public school credentialing process been simpler .
But then he was offered the Crossroads job in 1982 .
Crossroads was 10 years old but still scarcely more than a funky start - up , and with little of its current cachet .
The students were less likely to be children of celebrities than of psychologists and dentists .
The campus was in a warehouse district ; a body shop had been cleared to make way for Hosney ’s classroom .
But what the school lacked in glamour , Hosney made up in intellectual passion .
“ He was a teacher who inspired us like no other , ” said Greenfield , now senior vice president of production at Fox Searchlight , who was a freshman when Hosney arrived .
Hosney lined his walls with posters of Freud and the Sex Pistols .
He adopted a series of stray dogs with glitzy names ( Rona , Madonna , Rocco ) and brought them to school .
Especially striking , students recall , was the way he found value even in their most off - base answers .

“ He ’d actually tremble when someone made an astute observation -- he ’d kind of lift his palm in the air with his forefinger extended and cry , ‘ Yes ! ’ ” recalled Blake Schwarzenbach , an ex-punk guitarist who now teaches English at New York ’s Hunter College .
“ He made you feel smart , and , as a result , you got smarter , ” said Matt Tyrnauer , who is now a filmmaker and a special correspondent for Vanity Fair .
Eagerly , they applied Susan Sontag ’s concept of fascist art to the work of Steven Spielberg .
“ We ’d watch ‘ La Chinoise ’ or ‘ Week - End ’ by Godard and then he ’d have us read Marx , ” recalled Tyrnauer .
“ We were in the ninth grade ! ”
When a Los Feliz art house screened Sergio Leone ’s classic “ Once Upon a Time in the West , ” he asked who wanted to see it with him and was swamped with takers ; it was the first time many of the sheltered students had been east of the 405 .

“ I had a mini existential crisis as a 10th - grader , ” said Charlie Dahlgren , the son of two scientists who says he has spent most of his adult life toiling to write screenplays that live up to what he learned from Hosney .
“ NYU paled in comparison . ”
“ I remember the first day I came to his class , we were watching ‘ The 400 Blows , ’ and Jim saying , ‘ What does this mean ? ’ ” said Kurtzman ’s screenwriting partner , Roberto Orci , the son of an advertising executive who moved to L.A. from Texas .
“ And the really smart kids going , ‘ It ’s the illusion of freedom , but the character is trapped by the ocean , so the illusion of freedom is actually enslavement . ’
I mean , we were , like , 16 or 17 years old . ”
Dustin Hoffman , who had four children in Hosney ’s classes , said his lectures “ were like great performances .
It was theater , and you were there to be part of it . ”
And to do your homework .

“ I had this big project in 1987 , my senior year , that I was flaking on , ” Jack Black remembered , half - joking .
“ And I thought from , like , buttering him up all year I ’d have an extension ?
But he turned out to be kind of a hard - ass .
And I think I cried . ”
Hosney ’s records indicate that Black ended that year with an overall C+.
Black said the blown final was such a source of discomfort that he initially avoided returning The Times ’ phone calls for this story .
“ All roads led to me flunking , ” he confessed .
“ But it ’s a testament to the power of Hosney that I do not hold it against him .
I really respect the man . ”
His most avid students dubbed themselves “ Hosneyites , ” sneaking into his evening AFI classes and competing for the privilege of driving him there after school .
( Traumatized by a high school accident in which he wrecked a friend ’s car , Hosney never earned a license . )
Rare , however , is the Crossroads student with a memory of him anywhere but a theater , passenger seat or classroom .
Advertisement
“ He was such an enigma , ” recalled actor Simon Helberg ( “ Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip ” ) , who as a teen studied Hosney so closely that he can still perfectly impersonate the teacher ’s big , wheezing laugh and signature exclamation -- “ amaaaaazing ! ”
“ We were always trying to figure him out . ”
“ I do n’t think they were missing anything , ” Hosney said , laughing .
“ I think when you become your job , then that , in a sense , becomes your life . ”
His brother , he says , lives nearby ; he has three nephews and a goddaughter .
( “ She has a beautiful voice , and I used to give her musicals , ” he said .
“ Vincente Minnelli musicals .
You know , he was called the Oscar Wilde of Hollywood . ” )
Advertisement
He teaches a monthly film seminar for Crossroads parents and alumni in his off - hours .
For several years he went regularly to the movies with a group of fellow educators .
( “ We called ourselves the Westside Film Critics Association , ” Crossroads headmaster Roger Weaver said with a laugh . )
And some students have become friends in adulthood .
Hosney moderates a book club for Eve Gerber , a former student who is married to a Brentwood producer .
He officiated in a civil capacity at the 2002 marriage of documentary filmmaker Samantha Counter to her former classmate Kurtzman .
With all his contacts , however , he says he has been tempted only once or twice by show business .
“ I wrote a screenplay once with a friend , and it was disastrous , ” he said .
“ I ’m a teacher , ” he reiterated .
The choice has had both rewards and drawbacks .
According to court records , Hosney has declared bankruptcy twice in the last decade , most recently this year .

“ It ’s my fault , ” he replied when questioned about it .
“ I wish it were n’t there , but I ’m just a bad person with credit cards -- clothes , travel , electronic equipment , the opera . ”
His court file shows his debt to be roughly equivalent to a year ’s tuition at Crossroads .
“ It ’s a real tragedy of our culture that teachers get paid so little , ” said the 34 - year - old Dahlgren , who , with several other Hosneyites , is exploring ways to help their mentor as part of the retirement party they ’re planning .
“ Because if this were a meritocracy , this guy would be a jillionaire . ”
ON a recent afternoon , Hosney sat in a darkened theater , long fingers rummaging through his buttered popcorn , waiting to see “ 28 Weeks Later , ” the zombie flick .
A string of action movie trailers blared from the screen , clip after clip of the human race being threatened with annihilation .
“ Do you notice , ” he whispered , “ that in almost all of these , a superhero is needed to save us ?
There is no idea that people en masse might do anything about it .
Is n’t that interesting ? ”
Advertisement
Hosney said he “ was never , never interested in Hollywood as a form of business . ”
As art , however , he can discuss it for hours .
He thinks the film “ Zodiac ” was underrated by critics and that “ Fight Club ” was a kind of practical joke “ in which a studio paid millions of dollars to make a film that attacks everything Hollywood stands for . ”
The Desert Storm movie “ Jarhead , ” he said , “ is ‘ Waiting for Godot ’ set in the desert . ”
The first of the final episodes of “ The Sopranos ” -- the one involving the drunken weekend in the Adirondacks -- he compares to Eugene O’Neill ’s “ Long Day ’s Journey Into Night . ”
Hosney ’s former students say they can no longer watch a movie without imagining what he ’d say about it .
( Let alone make one .
Kurtzman and Orci , for instance , swear they were channeling Hosney when they tried a European - style nonlinear narrative with “ Mission : Impossible III . ” )
“ He ’s like a little friend on your shoulder , ” said Amanda Micheli , who is now 35 and a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco .
“ It was like he opened up a way of seeing for me . ”
Advertisement
Now , she and others note , a generation of his students is coming of age throughout the entertainment world with Hosney figuratively on their shoulders .
“ You constantly run into Hosneyites , ” said Paramount ’s Cosgrove , whose last job was as co-president of Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney ’s production company , Section Eight , which produced “ Syriana , ” “ The Good German ” and “ Good Night , and Good Luck . ”
“ Brett Morgen was in a meeting across the hall from me last week .
I talk all the time to my classmate Jason Blumenthal , who ’s a producer .
My best friend , Brian Rousso , who was in his class , wrote the original screenplay for the movie ‘ The Reaping . ’ ”
“ He just infused every student he had with a great love of filmmakers , ” Rousso said .
“ You walked out of that class with such an enormous appreciation of cinema . ”

So it was on that afternoon as Hosney sat in the theater , the human race battling the zombies , the flickering light on his rectangular eyeglasses telling a tale from a land far away .
On one level , it was just a movie .
But on another , it was the most abiding of Hollywood stories : the story of the man who loved stories , and whom the storytellers came to love back , a story from the heart of L.A .

Some military officials involved in supplying the Iraqis describe the sense of urgency they felt and the need to cut through what they saw as a cumbersome military bureaucracy .
A few miles from Mr. Saffar ’s armory , Maj. John Isgrigg III and Maj. Timmy W. Cox were assigned to issue weapons to the Iraqi military and national guard from early 2004 to 2005 .
As soon as they heard that a new shipment was arriving , the officers said , they put together a convoy to be the first to claim it , barreling onto the tarmac at Baghdad International Airport and loading the crates of Glocks and AK - 47s .
In several telephone interviews and e-mail exchanges , Majors Cox and Isgrigg described a race between themselves and the system .
They acknowledged that they did not do everything by the book .
They did not always call ahead to the airport to say they were coming .
They signed receipts but did not always wait around to fill out inspection reports , known as DD - 250s .
And they told only certain superior officers about their plans for where the weapons would be delivered .
Major Isgrigg , 46 , described the chain of custody as a maze of red tape .
Once weapons went into it , it took days for them to be released , he said .
Sometimes , he said , a competing unit distributing weapons to the Iraqi police would get to a shipment first , so he and Major Cox would have to wait for the next one .
He said that warehouse crews had been infiltrated by Iraqis sympathetic to insurgents , and that sometimes weapons would disappear .
“ We had folks getting killed because equipment was n’t moving , ” said Col. Randy Hinton , the majors ’ superior officer .
“ Were there times when all the right forms were not signed ?
Probably .
But we had a mission to do , and we were going to do it the best way we could at that time . ”
In a phone interview from Bangkok , John Hess , who worked as the assistant director of operations for an American - owned company that helped manage supplies for Iraq , said payments to the companies that supplied arms to Iraq were often delayed because of missing DD - 250s .
He said he believed that the officers had the right motives but used dangerous methods .
“ Once those weapons left normal channels , ” Mr. Hess said , “ none of us were ever sure where they were really going . ”
Could my son be accused of sexual harassment ?
He 's a good boy .
He likes watching " Thomas the Tank Engine " on television and playing " Simon Says . "
Like many 3 - year - olds , he 's very affectionate .
Unfortunately , hugging his teacher may get him suspended from nursery school .
I doubt that it will happen to my son .
But the frightening fact is that it could .
I recently learned that children nationwide , some of preschool age , have been suspended from school or taken to jail after being accused of sexual harassment .
In their zeal to avoid lawsuits , educators seem to be ignoring important information , such as whether the accused child intended to commit a crime or even knows how to pronounce the word " harassment . "
Sex education tends to be controversial , partly because parents have such varying and often strongly held beliefs about how , when and even if the topic should be introduced to their children .
But if schools have the authority to brand a 3 - year - old a sex offender , they also have the responsibility to provide parents with clear guidelines about appropriate physical conduct .
It 's great that we are more aware than ever about sexual harassment in schools .
But it is a terrible mistake to permanently label children who are barely out of diapers .
Consider these egregious examples :
In December 2006 , a 4 - year - old boy in Waco , Tex. , was punished with an in - school suspension after a female aide accused him of sexual harassment .
According to a television station there , the child had hugged the woman while getting on the bus , and she later complained to administrators at La Vega Primary School that the child had put his face in her chest .
School officials later agreed to remove sexual references but refused to expunge the " inappropriate physical contact " charge from the boy 's school record .
In my home state of Maryland , state data show that during the 2005 - 06 school year , 28 kindergartners were suspended for sex offenses , including 15 for sexual harassment .
Last December , a kindergartner was accused of sexual harassment after he pinched a classmate 's bottom at Lincolnshire Elementary School in Hagerstown , according to the local paper , the Herald - Mail .
The charge will remain on his record until he enters middle school .
" It 's important to understand a child may not realize that what he or she is doing may be considered sexual harassment , but if it fits under the definition , then it is , under the state 's guidelines , " school spokeswoman Carol Mowen told the Herald - Mail .
" If someone has been told this person does not want this type of touching , it does n't matter if it's at work or at school , that 's sexual harassment . "
In fact , the Maryland Department of Education defines sexual harassment as " unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors and / or other inappropriate verbal , written or physical conduct of a sexual nature directed toward others . "
I am alarmed that Mowen 's statement appears to imply that schools will find a child guilty of sexual misconduct even if the child does n't understand the implications of his or her actions .
Money may be at the root of these school suspensions .
A 1992 Supreme Court ruling set the stage for school districts ' having to pay damages in sexual harassment cases .
In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools , a high school student , Christine Franklin , was sexually harassed by her male teacher .
The court held that sexual harassment was a form of discrimination prohibited under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 .
Since Franklin proved that the school failed to stop the harassment , she was able to sue the school district for monetary damages -- something previously impossible for victors in Title IX suits .
Seven years later , in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education , the high court extended the liability of Title IX to include " student - on - student " harassment .
In 1999 , LaShonda Davis , a fifth - grade student , complained to her mother and teacher that a male student had repeatedly made vulgar comments to her and tried to touch her private parts .
The school 's principal was also made aware of the alleged sexual harassment , but the boy was never disciplined and his behavior worsened .
The court ruled that the school 's " deliberate indifference " to " known acts of harassment " was itself misconduct under Title IX , and Davis was allowed to sue for monetary damages .
I doubt that the Supreme Court imagined that its decisions in Franklin and Davis would be used to criminalize the behavior of preschoolers .
In our legal system , children are not treated as miniature adults .
Juvenile courts were founded 100 years ago because children were considered less accountable for their actions than adults -- and therefore less culpable .
Schools , however , now appear to be holding even young children to adult standards of responsibility and liability .
To me , some cases seem clear - cut .
If an 11 - year - old boy touches a 4 - year - old girl 's genitals and asks her to perform a sex act , his intent is apparent .
But the motivations of two 4 - year - olds caught " playing doctor " are less clear ; it 's probably natural curiosity , not abuse .
The situation gets even more muddy when adolescents are involved and the alleged victim is part of the horseplay .
Last February , two 13 - year - old boys in McMinnville , Ore. , were arrested , put in handcuffs and placed in juvenile detention for five days for allegedly slapping several girls ' backsides , according to news reports .
The boys were charged with several counts of felony sexual abuse and faced up to 10 years in prison and the prospect of having to register as sex offenders upon release .
In August , several of the girls who initially filed the complaint asked a judge to dismiss the charges , which he did .
The boys said the butt - slapping was a game inspired by the movie " Jackass . "
Like so many activities that adolescents engage in , the slapping was idiotic but not criminal .
Sexual harassment is serious business , and educators should not shirk their duty to ensure that schools are safe environments .
But each school district should develop a clear , widely publicized policy that explains what sexual harassment is , gives examples of unacceptable conduct and clearly describes how discipline will be administered .
I have not received instructions of any kind -- not a manual , pamphlet or flier -- from my son's school regarding sexual harassment .
Neither have my friends with kids , except in the vaguest terms .
Given the long - term ramifications of accusing a child of a sex offense , schools have a duty to warn students and parents about the behavior that they deem inappropriate or unlawful , rather than simply placing a scarlet letter on a kid 's forehead after the action has occurred .
Like millions of other parents , my husband and I are doing our best to teach our preschooler to respect others .
But if holding a classmate 's hand is out of bounds , his school needs to let us know .

you went to , the frat / sorority you were in , the professional / interest
group you are in , the companies you interned or worked at .
Kickstart
makes it easy to create and browse that kind of network .
While we
started with a focus on college students , I ’ve already found it a
useful networking tool for me to catch up with old coworkers and fellow
alums .

But how is this new tool different from Facebook or LinkedIn , and can it really boost your career ?
A Closer Look
Based on several blog - writeups ( TechCrunch , CNET , LifeHacker ) about Kickstart , it ’s more like Linked In than Facebook : the focus is on careers and professional networking rather than your friends ’ latest photos or interests .
I use Facebook and LinkedIn , and I recognize the merits of both .
After signing up for a Kickstart account and exploring the service , I agree with other bloggers–it could prove useful to 20 - somethings just starting out and looking to build a professional network .
Kickstart tries to tap into Generation Y’s social - networking skills –acquired in college for fun–and use them for professional advancement .
Several of my sources have said Gen Yers tend to have sterling networking skills –if Kickstart can harness and exploit those skills for Millennials ’ career - gains , all the better .
But for those who have been working for a while –Generation X , for example – Kickstart is more likely a place to reconnect with old college chums .
Gen X is better off sticking with LinkedIn for professional networking .
What Other Bloggers Are Saying
A post on the TechCrunch blog by Michael Arrington says :
While immediate analogies will be drawn to Facebook , the service is actually much more like LinkedIn in that it connects students and alumni at specific colleges and universities and helps them connect on a professional level .
Alumni can help students get jobs ( or can find good students to fill spots at whatever company they work at ) , and students can reach out to others to help jumpstart their professional career .
… … this clearly is n’t a place for pictures of partying and drinking – the whole point is to build up a professional network to help you move your career along .
For young students just getting out of college this can be a very useful service .
And they can keep having fun on Facebook … while pointing potential professional contacts to their Kickstart profiles .
Yesterday we covered a number of startups that are trying to recreate the college - only magic of Facebook .
Kickstart is n’t one of those services , but college students may be flocking to it nonetheless .
According to a post on Wired :
Microsoft vs TestDriven .
Net Express Wednesday , May 30 , 2007
There are a few things I need to get off my chest .
When I started working on TestDriven .
Net I was a hobbyist .NET developer .
My day job was as a Java consultant .
TestDriven .
Net was something I did for fun between consultancy gigs .
Working on open source projects can be a great way to learn a new technology .
I enjoyed being part of the fledgling .NET community and positive reception TestDriven .
Net ( then NUnitAddIn ) was getting .
When TestDriven .
Net 1.0 was released I was still hobbyist .NET developer .
It was only natural that I use the Express SKU which was being targeted at other hobbyist developers .
In fact I developed the whole of TestDriven .
NET 1.0 using C# Express , MSBuild and WiX ( as described in this post ) .
A few months after TestDriven .
Net 1.0 was released I was given the MVP award by Microsoft .
According to Ben Miller ( my then MVP lead ) I was " very well known " for having created TestDriven .
Net .
As far as I 'm aware this was the primary reason I received the award .
On Dec 1 , 2005 I received an email from Jason Weber the lead for the Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio SDK .
Apparently Jason wanted to better understand my product and strategy .
It was clear from the email subject that Jason incorrectly assumed TestDriven .
Net was a VSIP Package .
The interesting thing about VSIP packages being that they require a special key from Microsoft in order to function .
This is where the story begins .
I 'm not going to summarize what happened .
I 'm going to give you all the information so you can make up your own mind .
The first set of emails are between Dec 1 , 2005 and Mar 30 , 2006 .
They culminate in a teleconference between Craig Symonds ( the General Manager for Visual Studio ) , Grant Drake , Jason Weber ( who does n't say a word ) and myself .
The second set of emails are between March 31 , 2006 and Apr 17 , 2007 .
They culminate with Jason finally letting me know which license I 'm supposedly in breach of ( the Express EULA ) .
I 'm still none the wiser about which clause .
Finally I receive two letters ( delivered by motorcycle courier ) from Microsoft 's UK lawyers .
For the first time ever I am told which exact clause I 'm supposedly in breach of .
The second letter lets me know that they are reading my weblog and the TestDrivenUsers group .
Less than a year ago I was still a hobbyist .NET developer .
I created TestDriven .
Net as a tool for myself and something that I hoped other .NET developers would find useful .
I have no intention of selling out and giving in to this kind of petty bullying without a fight .
Update : I received another letter on May 31 , 2007 .
Update : Fixed the email formatting when viewed in IE .

A plentiful ingredient found in human semen drastically enhances the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) to cause infection , according to a report in the December 14 , 2007 , issue of the journal Cell , a publication of Cell Press .
The findings help to understand the sexual transmission of HIV and suggest a potential new target for preventing the spread of AIDS , the researchers said .
Collaborating research groups in Hannover and Ulm , Germany , show that naturally occurring fragments of so - called prostatic acidic phosphatase ( PAP ) isolated from human semen form tiny fibers known as amyloid fibrils .
Those fibrils capture HIV particles and help them to penetrate target cells , thereby enhancing the infection rate by up to several orders of magnitude .
" We were not expecting to find an enhancer , and were even more surprised about the strength , " said Frank Kirchhoff of the University Clinic of Ulm , noting that they were initially looking for factors in semen that might help to block HIV infection .
" Most enhancers have maybe a two - or three - fold effect , but here the effect was amazing — more than 50 - fold and , under certain conditions , more than 100,000 - fold .
At first , I did n't believe it , but we ran the experiment over and over , always with the same result . "
" The fibrils act like a ferry , " said Wolf - Georg Forssmann of VIRO PharmaCeuticals GmbH & Co. KG and Hannover Medical School .
" They pick the viruses up and then bring them to the cell . "
HIV - 1 , the causative agent of AIDS , has infected about 60 million people and caused over 20 million deaths , the researchers said .
More than 90 percent of those HIV - 1 infections are acquired through sexual intercourse .
Globally , most infections result from genital exposure to the semen of HIV - positive men , earlier studies showed .
Women who acquired HIV - 1 through vaginal intercourse constitute almost 60 percent of new infections in Africa .
Yet the factors influencing the infectiousness of HIV in semen are poorly understood .
To identify natural agents that might play a role in sexual transmission of HIV / AIDS in the new study , the researchers sifted through a complex peptide / protein library derived from human seminal fluid in search of novel inhibitors and / or enhancers of HIV infection .
That comprehensive search turned up PAP fragments as a potent enhancer of HIV infection .
They then verified that synthetic PAP fragments also enhanced HIV , confirming it as the active ingredient .
Interestingly , they found that individual PAP fragments are inactive but efficiently form amyloid fibrils , which they call Semen - derived Enhancer of Virus Infection or SEVI , that enhance HIV - 1 infection by capturing virions and promoting their physical interaction and fusion with target cells .
The enhancing activity of SEVI is most pronounced when the levels of infectious virus are low , resembling the conditions of sexual HIV - 1 transmission , they reported .
Physiological concentrations of SEVI amplified HIV infection of immune cells known as T cells and macrophages , most likely the cell types first targeted by HIV - 1 .
SEVI lowered the amount of virus required to infect tissue taken from human tonsils and significantly enhanced the viral infection of transgenic rats with human receptors for HIV - 1 infection .
The researchers said they will continue to explore SEVI 's role in HIV transmission .
While the peptide that conglomerates into fibrils is always present in large quantities in semen , they do n't yet know if the absolute levels vary from man to man .
" We also plan to further explore how exactly the fibrils allow the virus to enter cells and to search for compounds , with our technology , that might block the process , " Forssmann said .
If such inhibitors can be found , they might be added to microbicide gels now under development for HIV prevention , added Kirchhoff .
There could also be other ways to take advantage of the fibrils .
" The high potency of SEVI in promoting viral infection together with its relatively low cytotoxicity suggests that it may not only play a relevant role in sexual HIV transmission , but could also help to improve vaccine approaches and gene delivery by lentiviral vectors , " the researchers said .

When Ashlee Simpson tops the charts while a critically acclaimed ex-Beatle 's album fails to crack the top 200 , eyebrows go up in the marketing world .
So what makes a hit ?
A new study reveals that we make our music purchases based partly on our perceived preferences of others .
Popularity contest
Researchers created an artificial " music market " of 14,341 participants drawn from a teen - interest Web site .
Upon entering the study 's Internet market , the participants were randomly , and unknowingly , assigned to either an " independent " group or a " social influence " group .
Participants could then browse through a collection of unknown songs by unknown bands .
In the independent condition , participants chose which songs to listen to based solely on the names of the bands and their songs .
While listening to the song , they were asked to rate it from one star ( " I hate it " ) to five stars ( " I love it " ) .
They were also given the option of downloading the song for keeps .
" This condition measured the quality of the songs and allowed us to see what outcome would result in the absence of social influence , " said study co-author Matthew Salganik , a sociologist at Columbia University .
In the social influence group , participants were provided with the same song list , but could also see how many times each song had been downloaded .
Researchers found that popular songs were popular and unpopular songs were unpopular , regardless of their quality established by the other group .
They also found that as a particular songs ' popularity increased , participants selected it more often .
The upshot for markerters : social influence affects decision - making in a market .
This research is detailed in the Feb. 10 issue of the journal Science .
The Britney effect
The social - influence group was further divided into eight separate , non-interactive " worlds . "
Members of each world could not see the decisions of the other seven .
The idea behind this was to observe multiple outcomes for the same songs and bands .
" If you look at Britney Spears , some people say she is really good .
Others say she is n't good , she 's just lucky , " Salganik told LiveScience .
" But by having just one argument , it 's impossible to distinguish .
However , if you have 10 worlds , and she 's popular in all 10 , then you can say she 's actually good .
But if she 's only good in one , then you could say it was due to luck . "
Although different songs were hits in each world , popularity was still the deciding factor , although the " best " songs never did very badly and the " worst " songs never did very well .
So what drives participants to choose low - quality songs over high - quality ones ?
" People are faced with too many options , in this case 48 songs .
Since you can't listen to all of them , a natural shortcut is to listen to what other people are listening to , " Salganik said .
" I think that 's what happens in the real world where there 's a tremendous overload of songs . "
Alternatively , Salganik said , a desire for compatibility with others could drive the choice , since much of the pleasure from listening to music and reading books stems from discussing them with friends .
" If everybody is talking about ' Harry Potter , ' you want to read it too , " Salganik said .

Union of North America ( UNA ) Amero Pattern Coins .
NOTE :
I have received numerous inquiries as to my personal stand on the North American Union ( NAU ) issue .
My goal with these coins is not to endorse a Union of North America or a common " Amero " currency .
I fully support the United States Constitution , and I would not welcome ( in any form ) a diminishment of its provisions .
I expect that these coins will help make more people aware of the issue and the possible ramifications .
I leave it up to others to decide if they are in favor of , or against a North American Union .
And I encourage citizens to voice their approval or disapproval of government plans that impact them .
A currency union , similar to the European Union " Euro " has been proposed for North America ( it is sometimes called the " North American Union " , or " NAU " ) .
The name of the new currency is the " Amero " .
The Wikipedia encyclopedia article has additional details about the " Amero " .
This has been the source for many conspiracy theories tied in with other proposals such as the " Canamex Corridor " .
These private - issue fantasy pattern coins will be struck as an annual series , starting in the latter part of 2007 .
Collectors can order them at www.dc-coin.com .
The 2007 designs feature various Seated Liberty obverses and a similar Eagle & Globe reverse .
2008 designs show a Winged Liberty Head obverse and a re-arranged Eagle & Globe reverse .
2009 Issues show a Riding Liberty , with or without wings on the horse .
The following issues with proof and / or satin finishes are are planned :

Brooklyn Superhero Supply Store / 826NYC
Everywhere you look , at every available desk , table , or couch , there are two people — one student and one adult tutor — hunched over one piece of paper , getting the words just right .
It 's just plain beautiful .
The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Store in Park Slope is a front , an elegant sham and a beautiful hoax .
If this store had been around when I was seven I might have moved in completely , coming home only to quickly inhale a meal and racing back with imagined super - speed .
I 'm 30 now and still considering it .
The store itself claims to sell all manner of super - equipment , including canned chaos , an apprehended mini- blob , various grappling hooks and secret identity products .
They offer capes in all colors and even have a cape - testing area where you can stand on a steel grate and flick a switch that powers several fans , causing said capes to furl and flutter .
The signage in there is omnipresent , dry , and freaking hysterical :
My favorite display , hands - down , was the Super - Skeleton :
This link will take you to a Flickr set of photos from the store .
The store itself is a cover for the 826NYC program , a nonprofit that offers free homework help to kids between the ages of 6 and 18 .
White - hot literary superstars Sarah Vowell and Dave Eggers are on 826's board .
The 826 program itself is an outgrowth of McSweeney 's , and their brand of bone - dry hipster comedy permeates the place .
Proceeds from the sale of superhero equipment and memorabilia fund the 826 program .
The store also sells a full complement of McSweeney 's - related releases including Eggers ' latest book , recent issues of The Believer , and pretty much anything the McSweeney 's press has cranked out .
But real magic at the Superhero Store is n't the grappling hooks , the capes , the Secret Identity Kits , all of which would blow a kid 's tiny mind .
It 's that there are NO kids in the store itself -- or there were n't when I was there .
You can hear the sounds of kids laughing and talking bubbling from behind the walls , off doing something better , even better than messing around with superhero gear .
I got a volunteer to let me past the store 's secret door and into the reading room itself .
The atmosphere was magical .
Kids were coloring , drawing , writing and LOVING it .
There were no toys , to GameBoys , no electronic devices , just kids flexing their imaginations in a way that will never die .
This quote from McSweeney 's Questions and Answers About 826NYC says it much better than I could :
It 's true , totally true , every word .
THE European Union wants to impose mandatory limits on greenhouse - gas emissions from cars .
To much opposition from carmakers the European Commission has even proposed that average emissions across each company 's range of vehicles is no more than 130g of carbon dioxide per km by 2012 .
A study by the European Federation of Transport and Environment , a campaign group , shows just how far short many carmakers are of this contentious target .
In 2006 average emissions by all makers selling over 200,000 cars in the EU exceeded the target .
Some are even pumping out more carbon dioxide than they did in 2005 .

<C - W>じゃないとそのままコピペで使えない。 あとmapなのに<ESC >を使ってる点。 挿入モー ド( imap ) じゃないんだからこれは不要。 それにargs , nとすることで : Nで戻れるようにしてるようだけど、 argsで指定してるファイルは2個しかないので結局1個しか戻れない。
だったら:bpで十分な気がする。いくらでも戻れるし。 以上の点を踏まえると map < C - W>w :n < cword >< CR > map < C - W>i :n index < CR > となる。set autowrite してないと一々 「 E37 : 最後の変更が保存されていません (! を追加で変更を破棄 ) 」
と文句を言われてしまうので:wもあったほうがいいかもしれない。
毎回書き込んでしまう難点があるが。:wnでもよさそうだがちょっと面倒なことになる。
さらに alias vimwiki= ' pushd ~ / personal / vimwiki ; vi index ' ; popd とすることで、専用のディレクトリへ移動してから使うようにしてるようだが、 それなら map < C - W>w :n ~/personal/vimwiki/<cword >< CR > map <C - W>i :n ~/personal/vimwiki/index <CR > でよさげ 。Wikiを始めたいときは<C-W>iを打つだけだし、これならWindowsでも使える。 よく見るとこのalias の''の位置はおかしい。これじゃpopdは蚊帳の外だ。
この人実際に試したんだろうか？少くともふだんは全然使っていそうもない。

<C-W>wは打ちにくいので単にReturnキーにしたいところだが、
さすがにそれをグローバルにマッピングするのもあれなので、 ~/wimwiki/以下のファイルに限りbuffer localでマッピングしてみる。 < buffer >を入れるだけ。 最終的には map < C - W>i :sn ~/vimwiki/index\|res <CR > autocmd BufRead , BufNewFile ~/ vimwiki /* \ map < buffer > < CR > :sn ~/vimwiki/<cword >\|res <CR >
てな感じで。それにしてもvimの継続行の\の位置は違和感ありまくり。
あ、3行になっちゃったよ。まいっか。 < cword>なので適当に記号で囲むなり空白を入れるだけでアンカーになる。

From WikiLeaks
Will the APA protest ?
STEPHEN SOLDZ with JULIAN ASSANGE
November 17 , 2007
On Wednesday November 7th of this year , the primary operations manual for running of the US detention facility in Guantanamo Bay was published by the government transparency group Wikileaks .
After a press release from the group , Wired magazine and the Miami Herald published stories on the following Wednesday -- a day which which also saw the Pentagon demanding , without success , for the document to be censored .
Reuters picked up on the leak Thursday , the New York Times and the Guardian on Friday .
The following week saw reportage snowballing into over 160 press articles listed on the Google news index alone .
{{#ev:youtube|ctufVmlCr60|400}}
The Miami Herald describes the manual and its importance and gives a flavor of its bureaucratic contents :
" A how - to manual , it draws back a curtain on the secretive , isolated base in 2003 , more than a year into operation of the Bush administration prison .
And it lays out -- with typical military attention to detail -- everything from when to use pepper spray to who should witness a cavity search to how to dig a proper Muslim grave .
It also offers the mundane details of what detainees were given at the open - air prison camp overlooking the Caribbean , where the Pentagon today holds about 300 war - on - terror captives at Guantanamo for possible interrogation and trial by Military Commission .
No hair dye , it says on one page .
But a double amputee got to keep a bucket in his cell , it says . "
The manual is classified ' For Official Use Only ' and access was " limited to those requiring operational and procedural knowledge in the direct performance of their duties as well as those directly associated with JTF - GTMO . "
The Department of Defense has attempted to avoid its release and has denied the American Civil Liberties Organization [ ACLU ] access under the Freedom of Information Act .
In addition to the mundane , but often chilling details - destruction of a Styrofoam cup was a punishable offense - of the running of this high security facility designed to facilitate interrogations and intelligence gathering , the manual contains two major revelations .
The first of these revelations , which is the focus of both the Reuters and the New York Times reports , is that , despite claims to the contrary , the US was hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross [ ICRC ] .
As Reuters puts it :
" The manual also indicates some prisoners were designated as off limits to visitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross , something the military has repeatedly denied . "
Each detainee is assigned to one of four ICRC visitation levels .
Level A is [ p. 17.1 ] :
" No Access : No contact of any kind with the ICRC .
This includes the delivery of ICRC mail . "
In fact , for only one of the four levels was the IRC allowed unrestricted access to ask the detainee whatever questions they deemed appropriate .
The other levels allowed only visual access or questions about " health and welfare only . "
The camp commander seemed determined to prevent the ICRC from being able to obtain accurate information about detainee treatment .
Given the repeated denials that detainees were withheld from the ICRC , we have here additional evidence that , when it comes to what occurs in US detention facilities , no claims of the government should be taken as true without independent confirmatory evidence .
The second major revelation from the SOP , mentioned in passing by Reuters , concerns the routine use of isolation and sensory deprivation on Guantanamo detainees in order to weaken them and make them ready for interrogations .
As Reuters reports :
" It says incoming prisoners are to be held in near - isolation for the first two weeks to foster dependence on interrogators and `enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process . '
Styrofoam cups must be confiscated if prisoners have written on them , apparently because prisoners have used cups to pass notes to other captives .
` If the cup is damaged or destroyed , the detainee will be disciplined for destruction of government property , ' the rules say . "
Here is the actual language from the SOP [ Section 4 - 20 , p. 4.3 ] demonstrating the precision with which abuse was administered .
In fact , it makes clear that Reuters got it partially wrong in that the " near - isolation " was to last at least four weeks , not two , and that it could be continued indefinitely , beyond the four - week ( 30 day ) :
a. Phase One Behavior Management Plan ( First thirty days or as directed by JIG [ Joint Intelligence Group ] ) .
The purpose of the Behavior Management Plan is to enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process .
It concentrates on isolating the detainee and fostering dependence of the detainee on his interrogator .
During the first two weeks at Camp Delta , classify the detainees as Level 5 and house in a Maximum Security Unit ( MSU ) Block .
During this time , the following conditions will apply : ( 1 ) Restricted contact : No ICRC or Chaplain contact ( 2 ) No books or mail privileges ( 3 ) MREs for all meals .
( 4 ) Basic comfort items only : ( a ) ISO Mat ( b ) One blanket ( c ) One towel ( d) Toothpaste / finger toothbrush ( e ) One Styrofoam cup ( f ) Bar of soap ( g ) Camp Rules ( h ) No Koran , prayer beads , prayer cap .
( 5 ) Mail writing and delivery will be at the direction of the J - 2. b. Phase Two Behavior Management Plan .
The two - week period following Phase 1 will continue the process of isolating the detainee and fostering dependence on the interrogator .
Until the JIG Commander changes his classification , the detainee will remain a Level 5 with the following : ( 1 ) Continued MSU ( 2 ) Koran , prayer beads and prayer cap distributed by interrogator ( 3 ) Contacts decided by interrogator ( 4 ) Interrogator decides when to move the detainee to general population .
Isolation has long been a preferred measure of abuse in US detentions .
As Mark Benjamin pointed out last July in Salon , isolation and the associated sensory deprivation , not waterboarding or other more commonly discussed techniques , is the CIA 's favorite form of torture .
It has been know for years that isolation was authorized for use at Guantanamo , even after some of the harshest techniques used in 2002 and known to have been deployed against Mohammed al - Qahtani were stopped from routine use and restricted in 2003 to the so - called " varsity program . "
Isolation was one of the interrogations techniques authorized by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in his April 16 , 2003 memo .
However , that memo gives a sense that isolation is a severe , possibly illegal , technique :
" Caution : the use of isolation as an interrogation technique requires detailed implementation instructions , including specific guidelines regarding the length of isolation , medical and psychological review , and approvals for extension of the length of by the appropriate level in the chain of command .
This technique is not know to have been generally used for interrogation purposes for longer than 30 days .
Those nations that believe that detainees are subject to POW protections may view use of this technique as inconsistent with the requirements of Geneva III , Article 13 which provides that POWs must be protected against acts of intimidation ; Article 14 which provides that POWs are entitled to respect for their person ; Article 34 which prohibits coercion and Article 126 which ensures access and basic standards of treatment .
Although the provisions of Geneva are not applicable to the interrogation of unlawful combatants , consideration should be given to these views prior to application of this technique . "
The Guantanmo SOP now provides official documentation that , at the time of the Rumsfeld memo and despite its warnings regarding the techniques ' potential illegality and physical and psychological dangers , isolation was routinely used by the Defense Department at Guantanamo on all new detainees .
The Rumsfeld memo complements the SOP in that it documents the central role of " medical and psychological review , " and , thus , medical and psychological personnel in the administration of this technique .
Isolation is as damaging as other , more prominent , abusive interrogation techniques .
The recent Physicians for Human Rights - Human Rights First report , Leave No Marks : Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the Risk of Criminality , details the negative effects of isolation and sensory deprivation :
" People who are exposed to isolation for the first time develop a group of symptoms that include `bewilderment , anxiety , frustration , dejection , boredom , obsessive thoughts or ruminations , depression , and , in some cases , hallucination ' ....
Prolonged isolation has been demonstrated to result in increased stress , abnormal neuroendocrine function , changes in blood pressure and inflammatory stress responses ....
Findings from clinical research performed by prominent psychologists such as Dr. Stuart Grassian and Dr. Craig Haney , highlight the destructive impact of solitary confinement .
Effects include depression , anxiety , difficulties with concentration and memory , hypersensitivity to external stimuli , hallucination and perceptual distortions , paranoia , suicidal thoughts and behavior , and problems with impulse control " [ p. 32 ] .
These findings regarding negative effects make clear that attempts to prevent torture and detainee abuse need to curtail the use of isolation to an absolute minimum , only potentially acceptable when needed for temporary management of unruly or dangerous detainees .
It should never be sanctioned as a routine tool for " fostering dependence on the interrogator . "
Such uses are immoral and are likely violations of the UN Convention Against Torture and the US Torture and War Crimes Acts .
As thee PHR - HRF report argues :
" The medical impact of sensory deprivation and prolonged isolation supports the conclusion that both techniques of interrogation may be considered prosecutable acts of " torture " or " cruel or inhuman treatment " under the WCA or Torture
Act because they cause " severe " and " serious " mental pain and suffering .
The lasting depression and posttraumatic stress disorder that victims of isolation suffer constitute the prolonged and / or non-transitory mental harm required for mental pain to be considered severe or serious .
Moreover , isolation and sensory deprivation in interrogations is likely calculated to " disrupt the senses or personality . " "
Of relevance to those of us struggling to change American Psychological Association policy on psychologist participation in interrogations , the APA included clauses in its 2007 resolution against torture that allows continued participation in the use of isolation [ and sensory deprivation ] in certain circumstances :
" This unequivocal condemnation includes , but is by no means limited to , an absolute prohibition for psychologists against ... the following used for the purposes of eliciting information in an interrogation process : ... isolation , sensory deprivation and over - stimulation and / or sleep deprivation used in a manner that represents significant pain or suffering or in a manner that a reasonable person would judge to cause lasting harm . "
The APA inclusion of this carefully - qualified language led many APA critics , as well as certain reporters to wonder will psychologists still abet torture ?
It is therefore essential that the APA clarify the meaning of these apparent " loopholes . "
Recent attempts by the APA to address the meaning of these " loopholes " raise the possibility that APA leaders , reeling under the impact of massive protests among members and criticism in the press , are looking to resolve any ambiguities in the 2007 Resolution .
But so far , the APA leadership have failed to make a clear , unequivocal statement that this use of isolation at Guantanamo is unethical .
In a recent widely circulated letter by the APA Director of Ethics , he stated :
The third and final category of techniques consists of techniques that may not be " used in a manner that represents significant pain or suffering or in a manner that a reasonable person would judge to cause lasting harm . "
In my opinion , the description of these behaviors - isolation , sensory deprivation and over - stimulation , and sleep deprivation - suffered from not having adequate time to find wording that conveyed the authors ' intention .
As I 'm sure you recall , the discussions focused on the definition of these words and precisely what the implications of an absolute prohibition would be .
As an example , an individual in detention may be separated and placed in a cell in isolation , in order to prevent that individual from colluding with another detainee in formulating a story that is consistent between them .
Likewise , the regimen of a camp may require that detainees begin their daily routines at a very early hour .
I believe that everyone will agree neither example would constitute impermissible isolation or sleep deprivation , but it is important to find language that clearly separates what is permissible from what is impermissible .
If the APA really intended that the " loophole " clauses allowing isolation in certain circumstances , was just to cover routine uses of the kind here mentioned , the APA should have no difficulty stating clearly and unequivocally that the use of isolation described in the Guantanamo SOP is unethical and that psychologists participating in that use are engaging in unethical behavior .
Further , the APA should have no trouble coming up with clear language making these crucial distinctions .
In considering the APA 's positions , we should remember that the Chief Psychologist of the Guantanamo Joint Intelligence Group [ JIG ] at Guantanamo at the time of this SOP , was none other than Colonel < http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2007/06/21/colonel-larry-james-obje cts-to-our-open-letter-with-our-reply/>
Larry James , who the APA chose to introduce their 2007 Resolution on the Council floor .
The SOP makes clear that the JIG was the military unit that decided how long isolation was used on each detainee to " enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process "
The Rumsfeld memo makes clear that " medical and psychological supervision " were essential elements of this decision - making process .
It is thus likely that the JIG 's psychological unit was involved in determining exactly how much of this abuse a given detainee could tolerate .
It hardly inspires confidence in the APA 's willingness to stand unequivocally against US torture and abuse that they selected this same Col .
James to make the case for their carefully parsed and nuanced resolution .
The APA has has ignored extensive evidence from official documents and press reports raising questions about the activities undertaken by the psychological component of the JIG command during the time [ from January 2003 for a an unknown number of months ] he was stationed there .
The SOP provides additional evidence that Col. James ' command was engaged in routine abuse of detainees .
Due to secrecy , we do not know exactly what activities Col. James was involved in .
But , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , should the APA have someone who was at Guantanamo during this time represent it 's anti-torture positions ?
[ For the record , Col .
James denies that isolation was used for interrogation purposes . ]
In any case , it is time for the APA to stop word parsing and make clear , unequivocal statements about what in their view is and is not ethical .
I , for one , feel that the use of isolation , as described in the Guantanamo SOP is well over the line into unethical territory .
Does APA agree ?
Beyond the APA and the role of psychologists , we need for Congress to take up the entire range of abusive interrogation techniques , especially including isolation and sensory deprivation .
By focusing upon waterboarding as the litmus test abusive technique , the Congress , the press , and some human rights activists are ignoring the extent to which abuse is endemic in the US ' national security detentions .
The CIA can continue its " enhanced techniques " without waterboarding ; in fact reports say that they are already doing so .
But to ban isolation and sensory deprivation would cut to the core of this country 's abusive treatment of detainees .
Until the United States government takes this step , the U.S. will remain a torturing society .

Barry Richard , the Greenberg Traurig lawyer who achieved fame for his successful representation of George Bush in the Bush v. Gore recount suits , is set to give a speech blasting the Bush administration Saturday night .
Richard will be the keynote speaker at the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys ’ ( NAFUSA ) annual conference starting Thursday and running through Saturday at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Miami Beach , Fla .
More than 100 former U.S. attorneys are expected to attend the conference , which will also feature a panel discussion on the controversial U.S. attorney firings by former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez .
That panel � scheduled for Saturday afternoon � will feature two of the eight former U.S. attorneys who were allegedly fired over politics last year : David Iglesias , former U.S. attorney in New Mexico , and John McCay , former U.S. attorney of the Western District of Washington .
Additionally , James Eisenstein , a law professor at Pennsylvania State University Dickinson School of Law , will serve on the panel .
The conference requires pre-registration .
But the session that is expected to ignite the most fireworks is the dinner speech by Richard .
Richard said in an interview he has never spoken out against the Bush administration before and that he did not reveal the topic of his speech when asked to speak by NAFUSA .
“ I ’m sure people will see my name on the program and expect I will be defending the administration , ” said Richard , a Tallahassee , Fla. , lawyer .
“ But I ’m a constitutional lawyer .
I am concerned with the Bush administration ’s assault on American liberties … how the administration deals with habeas corpus and the administration ’s posture on electronic surveillance .
This administration has gone farther than any other . ”
Richard , a longtime Democrat , said he doubts his public stance Saturday will cost him any jobs but hopes it will gain him some .
“ The Republicans did n’t hire me cause they liked my views , they hired me for my legal abilities , and I assume they would again , ” he said .
However , Richard acknowledged that he has had few jobs representing Democrats since the highly publicized 2000 case and he chafes at being viewed as “ a Republican mouthpiece . ”
“ What I was proud of was that before 2000 I represented both parties , ” he said .
“ I would like to get back to neutral . ”
Incarceration Rates
Via “ Chris Uggen ” : http://chrisuggen.blogspot.com/2006/05/us-incarceration-at-midyear-2005.html, some new “ Bureau of Justice Statistics ” : http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/pjim05pr.htm for incarceration in the United States as of mid-2005 .
Imprisonment rose by 1.6 percent on the pervious year , and jail populations rose by 4.7 percent , for a total of just over 2.1 million people behind bars .
The total population in prison has gone up by almost 600,000 since 1995 .
Women make up 12.7 percent of jail inmates .
Nearly 6 in 10 offenders in local jails are racial or ethnic minorities .
In mid-2005 , the BJS reports that “ nearly 4.7 percent of black males were in prison or jail , compared to 1.9 percent of Hispanic males , and 0.7 percent of white males .
Among males in their late 20s , nearly 12 percent of black males , compared to 3.9 percent of Hispanic males and 1.7 percent of white males , were incarcerated . ”
State by state , “ Louisiana and Georgia led the nation in percentage of their state residents incarcerated ( with more than 1 percent of their state residents in prison or jail at midyear 2005 ) .
Maine and Minnesota had the lowest rates of incarceration ( with 0.3 percent or less of their state residents incarcerated ) . ”
( You can get this figure as a PDF file if you like . )
Comparative context is provided by Roy Walmsley ’s “ World Prison Population List ” : http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/rel/icps/world-prison-population-list-2005.pdf.
The U.S. has an overall incarceration rate of 738 per 100,000 people , the highest in the world .
Belarus , Russia and Bermuda (! ) come next , distantly trailing with rates in the 530s .
Fifty eight percent of countries have incarceration rates below 150 per 100,000 .
There is a lot of heterogeneity within continents .
I left China out of the figure above — its incarceration rate is 118 , but this only includes 1.55 million sentenced prisoners , not trial detainees or those in “ administrative detention . ”

Building aircraft wings with a special aluminium fibre combination makes them nearly immune to metal fatigue .
The application of this technology , partly developed at Delft University of Technology , will lead to substantial savings .
The unusual qualities of this special material ( called CentrAl , an abbreviation of Central Reinforced Aluminium ) can make a significant contribution to the development of truly energy - efficient , ‘ green ’ aircraft .
Lower fuel consumption and reduction of maintenance costs could lead to worldwide savings as high as $ 100 billion .
Fatigue is a phenomenon that affects materials after long - term exposure to cyclic loading .
As a result of varying loads , fractures eventually occur .
The new , high - quality CentrAl aluminium constructions are stronger than the carbon fibre reinforced plastic ( CFRP ) constructions that have recently been used in aircraft wings such as the Boeing 787 .
By using CentrAl wing constructions , the weight can be reduced by another 20 per cent compared to CFRP constructions .
Furthermore , using CentrAl results in considerably lower manufacturing and maintenance costs .
The CentrAl concept comprises a central layer of fibre metal laminate ( FML ) , sandwiched between one or more thick layers of high - quality aluminium .
This creates a robust construction material which is not only exceptionally strong , but also insensitive to fatigue .
The CentrAl technique allows for simple repairs to be carried out immediately , as is the case in aluminium constructions , – but not the case when using CFRP constructions .
This patented new concept is one of the results of an intensive collaboration between the company GTM Advanced Structures , founded in The Hague in 2004 and specialising in new aircraft materials and constructions , the American aluminium company Alcoa , and the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of Delft University of Technology .
During a conference in Delft ( Conference on Damage Tolerance of Aircraft Structures : 25 - 28 September 2007 ) , GTM and Alcoa have presented the new concept to international experts in the field of metal fatigue and damage sensitivity of aircraft constructions .
The US Air Force , Alcoa and GTM will also shed new light on the fact that the new CentrAl materials create possibilities for so - called ‘ Carefree structures ’ .
These are aircraft constructions that are less sensitive to damage caused , for example , by fatigue , hail storms , other weather phenomena , trucks that collide with the aircraft and corrosion .
Carefree aircraft constructions will be characterised by significantly reduced maintenance costs .

The clocks detect brainwaves or body movements and are programmed to wake sleepers during light sleep , which occurs periodically through the night .
“ It felt like you ’d already been awake for some time , and the clock just let you know it , ” said Boris Abramov , 30 , of Long Beach , California who used the Sleeptracker , which is worn on the wrist .
He had mixed reactions about the device .
It worked well if he had a good night ’s sleep but if he was stressed and worked late hours he would sleep through the alarm .
Sleep cycles vary from 90 to 110 minutes , so the bio-alarm clocks have a roughly 30 - minute margin of error .
Other bio-alarms include SleepSmart , a headband with circuits that detect brainwaves during sleep , and the aXbo Sleep Phase Alarm Clock , which is a wristband that reads body movements .
Bio-alarms are n’t the only innovative wake - up devices to hit bedrooms .
The Clocky has wheels that drive it around , forcing the sleeper to get out of bed and chase it .
The Biobright alarm clock simulates a sunrise using a 60 - watt light bulb .
And the Wake n’ Bacon wakes a person to the smell of breakfast .
Frozen bacon is placed in the built - in oven the night before and starts sizzling 10 minutes before wake - up time .
But bio-alarm clocks are the only devices designed to detect sleep patterns .
The Sleeptracker , introduced in March 2005 , has an accelerometer that reads specific movements common during light sleep .
It was created by Lee Loree , an Atlanta - based financial analyst , after he observed his wife ’s movements as she slept .
The similar aXbo clock “ allows everyone to wake up like they wake up Saturday , ” said Axel Ferro , an owner of the Austria - based firm that started selling clocks in January 2006 .
Its alarm is a separate unit from the wristband and can be controlled wirelessly from bed .
The clock can also be programmed for more than one sleeper and has different wake - up sounds .
The SleepSmart has sensors that read electrical brain waves that vary in frequency during light and heavy sleep .
Four Brown University students designed it after one of them performed badly on an exam due to grogginess .
They formed a company called Axon Labs in Providence , Rhode Island in December 2004 and expect the device to become available “ in the not too distant future , ” according to Jason Donahue , its director of business development .
But despite the growing popularity of bio - alarm clocks at least one scientist is skeptical .
Dr. Gregory Belenky , a sleep expert at Washington State University Spokane , said light stage sleep is n’t the best time to be woken by an alarm .
“ After a night ’s sleep you are most likely to wake up out of a dream , ” he said .
“ Dreams are most likely to have a spontaneous awakening , while ( a light sleep stage ) is the hardest time to wake a person up unnaturally . ”
And without scientific testing , it ’s impossible to know whether these devices are proven to work , he said .
“ Maybe they ’re the greatest thing since sliced bread .
You just do n’t know . ”
BOOK I
By whom this doctrine came at first to be broached , and brought in fashion amongst us , and what sad effects it gave rise to , I leave to historians to relate , or to the memory of those , who were contemporaries with Sibthorp and Manwering , to recollect .
My business at present is only to consider what Sir Robert Filmer , who is allowed to have carried this argument farthest , and is supposed to have brought it to perfection , has said in it ; Edition : current ; Page : [ 5 ] for from him every one , who would be as fashionable as French was at court , has learned , and runs away with this short system of politics , viz .
Men are not born free , and therefore could never have the liberty to choose either governors , or forms of government .
Princes have their power absolute , and by divine right ; for slaves could never have a right to compact or consent .
Adam was an absolute monarch , and so are all princes ever since .
However we must believe them upon their own bare words , when they tell us , we Edition : current ; Page : [ 4 ] are all born slaves , and we must continue so , there is no remedy for it ; life and thraldom we enter ’d into together , and can never be quit of the one , till we part with the other .
Scripture or reason I am sure do not any where say so , notwithstanding the noise of divine right , as if divine authority hath subjected us to the unlimited will of another .
An admirable state of mankind , and that which they have not had wit enough to find out till this latter age .
For , however Sir Robert Filmer seems to condemn the novelty of the contrary opinion , Patr. p. 3 . yet I believe it will be hard for him to find any other age , or country of the world , but this , which has asserted monarchy to be jure divino .
And he confesses , Patr. p. 4 . That Heyward , Blackwood , Barclay , and others , that have bravely vindicated the right of kings in most points , never thought of this , but with one consent admitted the natural liberty and equality of mankind .
In this last age a generation of men has sprung up amongst us , that would flatter princes with an opinion , that they have a divine right to absolute power , let the laws by which they are constituted , and are to govern , and the conditions under which they enter upon their authority , be what they will , and their engagements to observe them never so well ratified by solemn oaths and promises .
To make way for this doctrine , they have denied mankind a right to natural freedom ; whereby they have not only , as much as in them lies , exposed all subjects to the utmost misery of tyranny and oppression , but have also unsettled the titles , and shaken the thrones of princes : ( for they too , by these mens system , except only one , are all born slaves , and by divine right are subjects to Adam ’s right heir ; ) as if they had designed to make war upon all government , and subvert the very foundations of human society , to serve their present turn .
If any one think I take too much liberty in speaking so freely of a man , who is the great champion of absolute power , and the idol of those who worship it ; I beseech him to make this small allowance for once , to one , who , even after the reading of Sir Robert ’s book , cannot but think himself , as the laws allow him , a freeman : and I know no fault it is to do so , unless any one better skilled in the fate of it , than I , should have it revealed to him , that this treatise , which has lain dormant so long , was , when it appeared in the world , to carry , by strength of its arguments , all liberty out of it ; and that Edition : current ; Page : [ 3 ] from thenceforth our author ’s short model was to be the pattern in the mount , and the perfect standard of politics for the future .
His system lies in a little compass , it is no more but this ,
Slavery is so vile and miserable an estate of man , and so directly opposite to the generous temper and courage of our nation ; that it is hardly to be conceived , that an Englishman , much less a gentleman , should plead for it .
And truly I should have taken Sir Robert Filmer ’s Patriarcha , as any other treatise , which would persuade all men , that they are slaves , and ought to be so , for such another exercise of wit , as was his who writ the encomium of Nero ; rather than for a serious discourse meant in earnest , had not the gravity of the title and epistle , the picture in the front of the book , and the applause that followed it , required me to believe , that the Edition : current ; Page : [ 2 ] author and publisher were both in earnest .
I therefore took it into my hands with all the expectation , and read it through with all the attention due to a treatise that made such a noise at its coming abroad , and cannot but confess my self mightily surprised , that in a book , which was to provide chains for all mankind , I should find nothing but a rope of sand , useful perhaps to such , whose skill and business it is to raise a dust , and would blind the people , the better to mislead them ; but in truth not of any force to draw those into bondage , who have their eyes open , and so much sense about them , as to consider , that chains are but an ill wearing , how much care soever hath been taken to file and polish them .
But that I might omit no care to inform myself in our author ’s full sense , I consulted his Observations on Aristotle , Hobbes , &c. to see whether in disputing with others he made use of any arguments for this his darling tenet of Adam ’s sovereignty ; since in his treatise of the Natural Power of Kings , he hath been so sparing of them .
In his Observations on Mr. Hobbes ’s Leviathan , I think he has put , in short , all those arguments for it together , which in his writings I find him any where to make use of : his words are these :
If God created only Adam , and of a piece of him made the woman , and if by generation Edition : current ; Page : [ 16 ] from them two , as parts of them , all mankind be propagated : if also God gave to Adam not only the dominion over the woman and the children that should issue from them , but also over all the earth to subdue it , and over all the creatures on it , so that as long as Adam lived , no man could claim or enjoy any thing but by donation , assignation or permission from him , I wonder , &c .
Observations , 165 .
Here we have the sum of all his arguments , for Adam ’s sovereignty and against natural freedom , which I find up and down in his other treatises : and they are these following ;
God ’s creation of Adam , the dominion he gave him over Eve , and the dominion he had as father over his children : all which I shall particularly consider .
If he has in that chapter , or any where in the whole treatise , given any other proofs of Adam ’s royal authority , other than by often repeating it , which , among some men , goes for argument , I desire any body for him to shew me the place and page , that I may be convinced of my mistake , and acknowledge my oversight .
If no such arguments Edition : current ; Page : [ 15 ] are to be found , I beseech those men , who have so much cried up this book , to consider , whether they do not give the world cause to suspect , that it is not the force of reason and argument , that makes them for absolute monarchy , but some other by interest , and therefore are resolved to applaud any author , that writes in favour of this doctrine , whether he support it with reason or no .
But I hope they do not expect , that rational and indifferent men should be brought over to their opinion , because this their great doctor of it , in a discourse made on purpose , to set up the absolute monarchical power of Adam , in opposition to the natural freedom of mankind , has said so little to prove it , from whence it is rather naturally to be concluded , that there is little to be said .
All that I take notice of here , is , that this is all our author says in this first , or any of the following chapters , to prove the absolute power of Adam , which is his great principle : and yet , as if he had there settled it upon sure demonstration , he begins his second chapter with these words ,
By conferring these proofs and reasons , drawn from the authority of the scripture .
Where those proofs and reasons for Adam ’s sovereignty are , bating that of Honour thy father , above mentioned , I confess , I cannot find ; unless what he says , p. 11 .
In these words we have an evident confession , viz . of Bellarmine , that creation made man prince of his posterity , must be taken for proofs and reasons drawn from scripture , or for any sort of proof at all : though from thence by a new way of inference , in the words immediately following , he concludes , the royal authority of Adam sufficiently settled in him .
The sovereignty of Adam , being that on which , as a sure basis , our author builds his mighty absolute monarchy , I expected , that in his Patriarcha , this his main supposition would have been proved , and established with all that evidence of arguments , that such a fundamental tenet required ; and that this , on which the great stress of the business depends , would have been made out with reasons sufficient to justify the confidence Edition : current ; Page : [ 13 ] with which it was assumed .
But in all that treatise , I could find very little tending that way ; the thing is there so taken for granted , without proof , that I could scarce believe myself , when , upon attentive reading that treatise , I found there so mighty a structure raised upon the bare supposition of this foundation : for it is scarce credible , that in a discourse , where he pretends to confute the erroneous principle of man ’s natural freedom , he should do it by a bare supposition of Adam ’s authority , without offering any proof for that authority .
Indeed he confidently says , that Adam had royal authority , p. 12 , and 13 .
Absolute lordship and dominion of life and death , p. 13 .
An universal monarchy , p. 33 .
Absolute power of life and death , p. 35 .
He is very frequent in such assertions ; but , what is strange , in all his whole Patriarcha I find not one pretence of a reason to establish this his great foundation of government ; not any thing that looks like an argument , but these words :
To confirm this natural right of regal power , we find in the Decalogue , that the law which enjoyns obedience to kings , is delivered in the terms , Honour thy father , as if all power were originally in the father .
And why may I not add as well , that in the Decalogue , the law that enjoyns obedience to queens , is delivered in the terms of Honour thy mother , as if all power were originally in the mother ?
The Edition : current ; Page : [ 14 ] argument , as Sir Robert puts it , will hold as well for one as the other : but of this , more in its due place .
Our author having placed such a mighty power in Adam , and upon that supposition sounded all government , and all power of princes , it is reasonable to expect , that he should have proved this with arguments clear and evident , suitable to the weightiness of Edition : current ; Page : [ 12 ] the cause ; that since men had nothing else left them , they might in slavery have such undeniable proofs of its necessity , that their consciences might be convinced , and oblige them to submit peaceably to that absolute dominion , which their governors had a right to exercise over them .
Without this , what good could our author do , or pretend to do , by erecting such an unlimited power , but flatter the natural vanity and ambition of men , too apt of itself to grow and encrease with the possession of any power ?
and by persuading those , who , by the consent of their fellowmen , are advanced to great , but limited , degrees of it , that by that part which is given them , they have a right to all , that was not so ; and therefore may do what they please , because they have authority to do more than others , and so tempt them to do what is neither for their own , nor the good of those under their care ; whereby great mischiefs cannot but follow .
I have been fain to trouble my reader with these several quotations in our author ’s own words , that in them might be seen his own description of his fatherly authority , as it lies scattered up and down in his writings , which he supposes was first vested in Adam , and by right belongs to all princes ever since .
This fatherly authority then , or right of fatherhood , in our author ’s sense , is a divine unalterable right of sovereignty , whereby a father or a prince hath an absolute , arbitrary , unlimited , and unlimitable power over the lives , liberties , and estates of his children and subjects ; so that he may take or alienate their estates , sell , castrate , or use their persons as he pleases , they being all his slaves , and he lord or proprietor of every thing , and his unbounded will their law .
Let us then endeavour to find what account he gives us of this fatherly authority , as it lies scattered in the several parts of his writings .
And first , as it was vested in Adam , he says , Not only Adam , but the succeeding patriarchs , had , by right of fatherhood , royal authority over their children , p. 12 .
This lordship which Adam by command had over the whole world , and by right descending from him the patriarchs did enjoy , was as large and ample as the absolute dominion of any monarch , which hath been since the creation , p. 13 .
Dominion of life and death , making war , and concluding peace , p. 13 .
Adam and the patriarchs had absolute power of life and death , p. 35 .
Kings , in the right of parents , succeed to the exercise of supreme jurisdiction , p. 19 .
As kingly power is by the law of God , so it hath no inferior law to limit it ; Adam was lord of all , p. 40 .
The father of a family governs by no other law , than by his own will , p. 78 .
The superiority of princes is above laws , p. 79 .
The unlimited jurisdiction of kings is so amply described by Samuel , p. 80 .
Kings are above the laws , p. 93 .
And to this purpose see a great deal more which our author delivers in Bodin ’s words :
It is certain , that all laws , privileges , and grants of princes , have no force , but during their life ; if they be not ratified by the express consent , or by sufferance of the prince following , especially privileges , Observations , p. 279 .
The reason why laws have Edition : current ; Page : [ 10 ] been also made by kings , was this ; when kings were either busied with wars , or distracted with public cares , so that every private man could not have access to their persons , to learn their wills and pleasure , then were laws of necessity invented , that so every particular subject might find his prince ’s pleasure decyphered unto him in the tables of his laws , p. 92 .
In a monarchy , the king must by necessity be above the laws , p. 100 .
A perfect kingdom is that , wherein the king rules all things according to his own will , p. 100 .
Neither common nor statute laws are , or can be , any diminution of that general power , which kings have over their people by right of fatherhood , p. 115 .
Adam was the father , king , and lord over his family ; a son , a subject , and a servant or slave , were one and the same thing at first .
The father had power to dispose or sell his children or servants ; whence we find , that the first reckoning up of goods in scripture , the man-servant and the maid - servant , are numbred among the possessions and substance of the owner , as other goods were , Observations , Pref .
God also hath given to the father a right or liberty , to alien his power over his children to any other ; whence we find the sale and gift of children to have much been in use in the beginning of the world , when men had their servants for a possession and an inheritance , as well as other goods ; whereupon we find the power of castrating and making eunuchs much in use in old times , Observations , Edition : current ; Page : [ 11 ] p. 155 .
Law is nothing else but the will of him that hath the power of the supreme father , Observations , p. 223 .
It was God ’s ordinance that the supremacy should be unlimited in Adam , and as large as all the acts of his will ; and as in him so in all others that have supreme power , Observations , p. 245 .
I do not think our author so little skilled in the way of writing discourses of this nature , nor so careless of the point in hand , that he by over - sight commits the fault , that he himself , in his Anarchy of a mixed Monarchy , p. 239 . objects to Mr. Hunton in these words :
Where first I charge the author , that he hath not given us any definition , or description of monarchy in general ; for by the rules of method he should have first defined .
And by the like rule of method Sir Robert should have told us , what his fatherhood or fatherly authority is , before he had told us , in whom it was to be found , and talked so much of it .
But perhaps Sir Robert found , that this fatherly authority , this power of fathers , and of kings , for he makes them both the same , p. 24 .
would make a very odd and frightful figure , and very disagreeing with what either children imagine of their parents , or subjects of their kings , if he should have given us the whole draught together in that gigantic form , he had painted it in his own fancy ; and therefore , like a wary physician , when he would have his patient swallow some harsh or corrosive liquor , he mingles it with a large quantity of that which may dilute it ; that the scattered parts may go down with less feeling , and cause less aversion .
SIR Robert Filmer ’s great position is , that men are not naturally free .
This is the foundation on which his absolute monarchy stands , and from which it erects itself to an height , that its power is above every power , caput inter nubila , so high above all earthly and human things , that thought can scarce reach it ; that promises and oaths , which tye the infinite Deity , cannot confine it .
But if this foundation fails , all his fabric falls with it , and governments must be left again to the old way of being made by contrivance , and the consent of men ( Άνϧϛωπίνη ϰτίσιϛ ) making use of their reason to unite together into society .
To prove this grand position of his , he tells us , p. 12 .
Men Edition : current ; Page : [ 6 ] are born in subjection to their parents , and therefore can not be free .
And this authority of parents , he calls royal authority , p. 12 , 14 .
Fatherly authority , right of fatherhood , p. 12 , 20 .
One would have thought he would , in the beginning of such a work as this , on which was to depend the authority of princes , and the obedience of subjects , have told us expresly , what that fatherly authority is , have defined it , though not limited it , because in some other treatises of his he tells us , it is unlimited , and unlimitable ; he should at least have given us such an account of it , that we might have had an entire notion of this fatherhood , or fatherly authority , whenever it came in our way in his writings : this I expected to have found in the first chapter of his Patriarcha .
But instead thereof , having , 1 . en passant , made his obeysance to the arcana imperii , p. 5 .

Bellarmine being routed by his own confession , p. 11 .
the day is clear got , and there is no more need of any forces : for having done that , I observe not that he states the question , or rallies up any arguments to make good his opinion , but rather tells us the story , as he thinks fit , of this strange kind of domineering phantom , called the fatherhood , which whoever could catch , presently got empire , and unlimited absolute power .
He assures us how this fatherhood began in Adam , continued its course , and kept the world in order all the time of the patriarchs till the flood , got out of the ark with Noah and his sons , made and supported all the kings of the earth till the captivity of the Israelites in Egypt , and then the poor fatherhood was under hatches , till God , by giving the Israelites kings , re-established the ancient and prime right of the lineal succession in paternal government .
This is his business from p. 12 . to 19 .
And then obviating an objection , and clearing a difficulty or two with one half reason , p. 23 .
to confirm the natural right of regal power , he ends the first chapter .
I hope it is no injury to call an half quotation an half reason ; for God says , Honour thy father and mother ; but our author contents himself with half , leaves out thy Edition : current ; Page : [ 8 ] mother quite , as little serviceable to his purpose .
But of that more in another place .
I fear I have tired my reader ’s patience , by dwelling longer on this passage , than the weightiness of any argument in it seems to require : but I have unavoidably been engaged in it by our author ’s way of writing , who , hudling several suppositions together , and that in doubtful and general terms , makes such a medly and confusion , that it is impossible to shew his mistakes , without examining the several senses wherein Edition : current ; Page : [ 23 ] his words may be taken , and without seeing how , in any of these various meanings , they will consist together , and have any truth in them : for in this present passage before us , how can any one argue against this position of his , that Adam was a king from his creation , unless one examine , whether the words , from his creation , be to be taken , as they may , for the time of the commencement of his government , as the foregoing words import , as soon as he was created he was monarch ; or , for the cause of it , as he says , p. 11 .
creation made man prince of his posterity ?
how farther can one judge of the truth of his being thus king , till one has examined whether king be to be taken , as the words in the beginning of this passage would persuade , on supposition of his private dominion , which was , by God ’s positive grant , monarch of the world by appointment ; or king on supposition of his fatherly power over his off - spring , which was by nature , due by the right of nature ; whether , I say , king be to be taken in both , or one only of these two senses , or in neither of them , but only this , that creation made him prince , in a way different from both the other ?
For though this assertion , that Adam was king from his creation , be true in no sense , yet it stands here as an evident conclusion drawn from the preceding words , though in truth it be but a bare assertion joined to other assertions of the same kind , which confidently put together Edition : current ; Page : [ 24 ] in words of undetermined and dubious meaning , look like a sort of arguing , when there is indeed neither proof nor connection : a way very familiar with our author : of which having given the reader a taste here , I shall , as much as the argument will permit me , avoid touching on hereafter ; and should not have done it here , were it not to let the world see , how incoherences in matter , and suppositions without proofs put handsomely together in good words and a plausible stile , are apt to pass for strong reason and good sense , till they come to be looked into with attention .
To speak less learnedly , and more intelligibly , one may say of Adam , he was in a possibility of being governor , since it was possible he might beget children , and thereby acquire that right of nature , be it what it will , to govern them , that accrues from Edition : current ; Page : [ 22 ] thence : but what connection has this with Adam ’s creation , to make him say , that as soon as he was created , he was monarch of the world ?
for it may be as well said of Noah , that as soon as he was born , he was monarch of the world , since he was in possibility ( which in our author ’s sense is enough to make a monarch , a monarch in habit , ) to outlive all mankind , but his own posterity .
What such necessary connection there is betwixt Adam ’s creation and his right to government , so that a natural freedom of mankind cannot be supposed without the denial of the creation of Adam , I confess for my part I do not see ; nor how those words , by the appointment , &c .
Observations , 254 .
how ever explained , can be put together , to make any tolerable sense , at least to establish this position , with which they end , viz .
Adam was a king from his creation ; a king , says our author , not in act , but in habit , i. e. actually no king at all .
To this foreseen objection , our author answers very logically , he was governor in habit , and not in act : a very pretty way of being a governor without government , a father without children , and a king without subjects .
And thus Sir Robert was an author before he writ his book ; not in act it is true , but in habit ; for when he had once published Edition : current ; Page : [ 21 ] it , it was due to him by the right of nature , to be an author , as much as it was to Adam to be governor of his children , when he had begot them : and if to be such a monarch of the world , an absolute monarch in habit , but not in act , will serve the turn , I should not much envy it to any of Sir Robert ’s friends , that he thought fit graciously to bestow it upon , though even this of act and habit , if it signified any thing but our author ’s skill in distinctions , be not to his purpose in this place .
For the question is not here about Adam ’s actual exercise of government , but actually having a title to be governor .
Government , says our author , was due to Adam by the right of nature : what is this right of nature ?
A right fathers have over their children by begetting them ; generatione jus acquiritur parentibus in liberos , says our author out of Grotius , Observations , 223 .
The right then follows the begetting as arising from it ; so that , according to this way of reasoning or distinguishing of our author , Adam , as soon as he was created , had a title only in habit , and not in act , which in plain English is , he had actually no title at all .
On the other side the matter will not be much mended , if we understand by God ’s appointment the law of nature , ( though it be a pretty harsh expression for it in this place ) and by monarch of the world , sovereign ruler of mankind : for then the sentence under consideration must run thus :
By the law of nature , as soon as Adam was created he was governor of mankind , for by right of nature it was due to Adam to be governor of his posterity ; which amounts to this , he was governor by right of nature , because he was governor by right of nature : but supposing we should grant , that a man is by nature governor of his children , Adam could not hereby be monarch as soon as created : for this right of nature being founded in his being their father , how Adam could have a natural right to be governor , before he was a father , when by being a father only he had that right , is , methinks , hard to conceive , unless he will have him to be a father before he was a father , and to have a title before he had it .
But let us see , how he puts his creation and this appointment together .
By the appointment of God , says Sir Robert , as soon as Adam was created , he was monarch of the world , though he had no subjects ; for though there could not be actual government till there were subjects , yet by the right of nature it was due to Adam to be governor of his posterity : Edition : current ; Page : [ 18 ] though not in act , yet at least in habit , Adam was a king from his creation .
I wish he had told us here , what he meant by God ’s appointment : for whatsoever providence orders , or the law of nature directs , or positive revelation declares , may be said to be by God ’s appointment : but I suppose it cannot be meant here in the first sense , i. e. by providence ; because that would be to say no more , but that as soon as Adam was created he was de facto monarch , because by right of nature it was due to Adam , to be governor of his posterity .
But he could not de facto be by providence constituted the governor of the world , at a time when there was actually no government , no subjects to be governed , which our author here confesses .
Monarch of the world is also differently used by our author ; for sometimes he means by it a proprietor of all the world exclusive of the rest of mankind , and thus he does in the same page of his preface before cited : Adam , says he , being commanded to multiply and people the earth , and to subdue it , and having dominion given him over all creatures , was thereby the monarch of the whole world ; none of his posterity had any right to possess any thing but by his grant or permission , or by succession from him .
2 . Let us understand then by monarch proprietor of the world , and by appointment God ’s actual donation , and revealed positive grant made to Adam , i. Gen. 28 . as we see Sir Edition : current ; Page : [ 19 ]
Robert himself does in this parallel place , and then his argument will stand thus , by the positive grant of God : as soon as Adam was created , he was proprietor of the world , because by the right of nature it was due to Adam to be governor of his posterity .
In which way of arguing there are two manifest falsehoods .
First ,
It is false , that God made that grant to Adam , as soon as he was created , since , tho ’ it stands in the text immediately after his creation , yet it is plain it could not be spoken to Adam , till after Eve was made and brought to him : and how then could he be monarch by appointment as soon as created , especially since he calls , if I mistake not , that which God says to Eve , iii .
Gen. 16 , the original grant of government , which not being till after the fall , when Adam was somewhat , at least in time , and very much distant in condition , from his creation , I cannot see , how our author can say in this sense , that by God ’s appointment , as soon as Adam was created , he was monarch of the world .
Secondly , were it true that God ’s actual donation appointed Adam monarch of the world as soon as he was created , yet the reason here given for it would not prove it ; but it would always be a false inference , that God , by a positive donation , appointed Adam monarch of the world , because by right of nature it was due to Adam to be governor of his posterity : for having given him the right of government by nature , there was no need of a positive Edition : current ; Page : [ 20 ] donation ; at least it will never be a proof of such a donation .
SIR Robert , in his preface to his Observations on Aristotle ’s politics , tells us , A natural freedom of mankind cannot be supposed without the denial of the creation of Adam : but how Adam ’s being created , which was nothing but his receiving a being immediately from omnipotence and the hand of God , gave Adam a sovereignty over any thing , I cannot see , nor consequently understand , how a supposition of natural freedom is Edition : current ; Page : [ 17 ] a denial of Adam ’s creation , and would be glad any body else ( since our author did not vouchsafe us the favour ) would make it out for him : for I find no difficulty to suppose the freedom of mankind , though I have always believed the creation of Adam .
He was created , or began to exist , by God ’s immediate power , without the intervention of parents or the pre-existence of any of the same species to beget him , when it pleased God he should ; and so did the lion , the king of beasts , before him , by the same creating power of God : and if bare existence by that power , and in that way , will give dominion , without any more ado , our author , by this argument , will make the lion have as good a title to it , as he , and certainly the antienter .
No ! for Adam had his title by the appointment of God , says our author in another place .
Then bare creation gave him not dominion , and one might have supposed mankind free without the denying the creation of Adam , since it was God ’s appointment made him monarch .
Should any one make so perverse an use of God ’s blessings poured on him with a liberal hand ; should any one be cruel and uncharitable to that extremity , yet all this would not prove that propriety in land , even in this case , gave any authority over the persons of men , but only that compact might ; since the authority of the rich proprietor , and the subjection of the needy beggar , began not from the possession of the Lord , but the confent of the poor man , who preferred being his subject to starving .
And the man he thus submits to , can pretend to no more power over him , than he has consented to , upon compact .
Upon this ground a man ’s having his stores filled in a time of scarcity , having money in his pocket , being in a vessel at sea , being able to swim , &c. may as well be Edition : current ; Page : [ 49 ] the foundation of rule and dominion , as being possessor of all the land in the world ; any of these being sufficient to enable me to save a man ’s life , who would perish if such assistance were denied him ; and any thing , by this rule , that may be an oocasion of working upon another ’s necessity , to save his life , or any thing dear to him , at the rate of his freedom , may be made a foundation of sovereignty , as well as property .
From all which it is clear , that though God should have given Adam private dominion , yet that private dominion could give him no sovereignty ; but we have already sufficiently proved , that God gave him no private dominion .
But we know God hath not left one man so to the mercy of another , that he may starve him if he please :
God the Lord and Father of all has given no one of his children such a property in his peculiar portion of the things of this world , but that he has given his needy brother a right to the surplusage of his goods ; so that it cannot justly be denied him , when his pressing wants call for it : and therefore no man could ever have a just power over the life of another by right of property in land or possessions ; since it would always be a sin , in any man of estate , to let his brother perish for want of affording him relief out of his plenty .
As Edition : current ; Page : [ 48 ] justice gives every man a title to the product of his honest industry , and the fair acquisitions of his ancestors descended to him ; so charity gives every man a title to so much out of another ’s plenty , as will keep him from extreme want , where he has no means to subsist otherwise : and a man can no more justly make use of another ’s necessity , to force him to become his vassal , by with - holding that relief , God requires him to afford to the wants of his brother , than he that has more strength can seize upon a weaker , master him to his obedience , and with a dagger at his throat offer him death or slavery .
But yet , if after all , any one will needs have it so , that by this donation of God , Adam was made sole proprietor of the whole earth , what will this be to his sovereignty ?
and how will it appear , that propriety in land gives a man power over the life of another ?
or how will the possession even of the whole earth , give any one a sovereign arbitrary authority over the persons of men ?
The most specious thing to be said , is , that he that is proprietor of the whole world , may deny all the rest of mankind food , and so at his pleasure starve them , if they will not acknowledge his sovereignty , and obey his will .
If this were true , it would be a good argument to prove , that there never was any such property , that God never gave any such private dominion ; since it is more reasonable to think , that God , who bid mankind Edition : current ; Page : [ 47 ] increase and multiply , should rather himself give them all a right to make use of the food and raiment , and other conveniences of life , the materials whereof he had so plentifully provided for them ; than to make them depend upon the will of a man for their subsistence , who should have power to destroy them all when he pleased , and who , being no better than other men , was in succession likelier , by want and the dependence of a scanty fortune , to tie them to hard service , than by liberal allowance of the conveniences of life to promote the great design of God , increase and multiply : he that doubts this , let him look into the absolute monarchies of the world , and see what becomes of the conveniences of life , and the multitudes of people .
Thus we have examined our author ’s argument for Adam ’s monarchy , founded on the blessing pronounced , i. Gen. 28 .
Wherein I think it is impossible for any sober reader , to find any other but the setting of mankind above the other kinds of creatures , in this habitable earth of ours .
It is nothing but the giving to man , the whole species of man , as the chief inhabitant , who is the image of his Maker , the dominion over the other creatures .
This lies so obvious in the plain words , that any one , but our author , would have thought it necessary to have shewn , how these words , that seemed to say the quite contrary , gave Adam monarchical absolute power over other men , or the sole property in all the creatures ; and methinks in a business of this moment , and that whereon he builds all that follows , he should have done something more than barely cite words , which apparently make against him ; for I confess , I can not see any thing in them , tending to Adam ’s monarchy , or private dominion , but quite the contrary .
And I the less deplore the dulness of my apprehension herein , since I find the apostle seems to have as little notion of any such private dominion of Adam Edition : current ; Page : [ 46 ] as I , when he says , God gives us all things richly to enjoy , which he could not do , if it were all given away already , to Monarch Adam , and the monarchs his heirs and successors .
To conclude , this text is so far from proving Adam sole proprietor , that , on the contrary , it is a confirmation of the original community of all things amongst the sons of men , which appearing from this donation of God , as well as other places of scripture , the sovereignty of Adam , built upon his private dominion , must fall , not having any foundation to support it .
Any one but our author would be mightily suspected to be blinded with prejudice , that in all this blessing to Noah and his sons , could see nothing but only an enlargement of commons : for as to dominion , which our author thinks omitted , the fear of you , and the dread of you , says God , shall be upon every beast , which I suppose expresses the dominion , or superiority was designed man over the living creatures , as fully as may be ; for in that fear and dread seems chiefly to consist what was given to Adam over the inferior animals ; who , as absolute a monarch as he was , could not make bold with a lark or rabbet to satisfy his hunger , and had the herbs but in common with the beasts , as is plain from i Gen. 2 , 9 , and 30 .
In the Edition : current ; Page : [ 43 ] next place , it is manifest that in this blessing to Noah and his sons , property is not only given in clear words , but in a larger extent than it was to Adam .
Into your hands they are given , says God to Noah and his sons ; which words , if they give not property , nay , property in possession , it will be hard to find words that can ; since there is not a way to express a man ’s being possessed of any thing more natural , nor more certain , than to say , it is delivered into his hands .
And ver .
3 . to shew , that they had then given them the utmost property man is capable of , which is to have a right to destroy any thing by using it ;
Every moving thing that liveth , saith God , shall be meat for you ; which was not allowed to Adam in his charter .
This our author calls , a liberty of using them for food , and only an enlargement of commons , but no alteration of property , Observations , 211 .
What other property man can have in the creatures , but the liberty of using them , is hard to be understood : so that if the first blessing , as our author says , gave Adam dominion over the creatures , and the blessing to Noah and his sons , gave them such a liberty to use them , as Adam had not ; it must needs give them something that Adam with all his sovereignty wanted , something that one would be apt to take for a greater property ; for certainly he has no absolute dominion over even the brutal part of the creatures ; and the property he has in Edition : current ; Page : [ 44 ] them is very narrow and scanty , who cannot make that use of them , which is permitted to another .
Should any one who is absolute lord of a country , have bidden our author subdue the earth , and given him dominion over the creatures in it , but not have permitted him to have taken a kid or a lamb out of the flock , to satisfy his hunger , I guess , he would scarce have thought himself lord or proprietor of that land , or the cattle on it ; but would have found the difference between having dominion , which a shepherd may have , and having full property as an owner .
So that , had it been his own case , Sir Robert , I believe , would have thought here was an alteration , nay , an enlarging of property ; and that Noah and his children had by this grant , not only property given them , but such a property given them in the creatures , as Adam had not :
For however , in respect of one another , men may be allowed to have propriety in their distinct portions of the creatures ; yet in respect of God the maker of heaven and earth , who is sole lord and proprietor of the whole world , man ’s propriety in the creatures is nothing but that liberty to use them , which God has permitted ; and so man ’s property may be altered and enlarged , as we see it was here , after the flood , when other uses of them are allowed , which before were not .
From all which I suppose it is clear , that neither Adam , nor Edition : current ; Page : [ 45 ]
Noah , had any private dominion , any property in the creatures , exclusive of his posterity , as they should successively grow up into need of them , and come to be able to make use of them .
Our author probably foreseeing he might not be very successful in persuading people out of their senses , and , say what he could , men would be apt to believe the plain words of scripture , and think , as they saw , that the grant was spoken to Noah and his sons jointly ; he endeavours to insinuate , as if this grant to Noah conveyed no property , no dominion ; because , subduing the earth and dominion over the creatures are therein omitted , nor the earth once named .
And therefore , says he , there is a considerable Edition : current ; Page : [ 42 ] difference between these two texts ; the first blessing gave Adam a dominion over the earth and all creatures ; the latter allows Noah liberty to use the living creatures for food : here is no alteration or diminishing of his title to a property of all things , but an enlargement only of his commons , Observations , 211 .
So that in our author ’s sense , all that was said here to Noah and his sons , gave them no dominion , no property , but only enlarged the commons ; their commons , I should say , since God says , to you are they given , though our author says his ; for as for Noah ’s sons , they , it seems , by Sir Robert ’s appointment , during their father ’s life - time , were to keep fasting days .
But our author says , Noah was the sole heir of the world ; why should it be thought that God would disinherit him of his birth - right ?
Heir , indeed , in England , signifies the eldest son , who is by the law of England to have all his father ’s land ; but where God ever appointed any such heir of the world , our author would have done well to have shewed us ; and how God disinherited him of his birth - right , or what harm was done him if God gave his sons a right to make use of a part of the earth for the support of themselves and families , when the whole was not only more than Noah himself , but infinitely more than they all could make use of , and the possessions of one could not at all prejudice , or , as to any use , streighten that of the other .
The prejudices of our own ill - grounded opinions , however by us called probable , cannot authorise us to understand scripture contrary to the direct and plain meaning of the words .
I grant , it is not probable , that Adam ’s private dominion was here abrogated : because it is more than improbable , ( for it will never be proved ) that ever Adam had any such private dominion : and since parallel places of scripture are most probable to make us know how they may be best understood , there needs but the comparing this blessing here to Noah and his sons after the flood , with that to Adam after the creation , i. Gen. 28 . to assure any one that God gave Adam no such private dominion .
It is probable , I confess , that Noah should have the same title , the same property and dominion after the flood , that Adam had before it : but since private dominion cannot consist with the blessing and grant God gave to him and his sons in common , it is a sufficient reason to conclude , that Adam had none , especially since in the donation made to him , there are no words that express it , or do in the least favour it ; and then let my reader judge whether it may best be understood , when in the one place there is not one word for it , not to say what has been above proved , that Edition : current ; Page : [ 41 ] the text itself proves the contrary ; and in the other , the words and sense are directly against it .
But our author goes on to prove , that it may best be understood with a subordination , or a benediction in succession ; for , says he , it is not probable that the private dominion which God gave to Adam , and by his donation , assignation , or cession to his children , was abrogated , and a community of all things instituted between Noah and his sons —
—
Noah was left the sole heir of the world ; why should it be thought Edition : current ; Page : [ 40 ] that God would disinberit him of his birth - right , and make him of all men in the world the only tenant in common with his children ?
Observations , 211 .
The other parts of this benediction , or grant , are so expressed , that they must needs be understood to belong equally to them all ; as much to Noah ’s sons as to Noah himself , and not to his sons with a subordination , or in succession .
The fear of you , and the dread of you , says God , shall be upon every beast , &c .
Will any body but our author say , that the creatures feared and stood in awe of Noah only , and not of his sons without his leave , or till after his death ?
And the following words , into your hands they are delivered , are they to be understood as our author says , if your father please , or they shall be delivered into your hands hereafter ?
If this be to argue from scripture , I know not what may not be proved by it ; and I can scarce see how much this differs from that fiction and fansie , or how much a surer foundation it will prove , than the opinions of philosophers and poets , which our author so much condemns in his preface .
For it is plain , however he would exclude them , that part of this benediction , as he would have it in succession , must needs be meant to the sons , and not to Noah himself at all :
Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , says God , in this blessing .
This part of the benediction , as appears by the sequel , concerned Edition : current ; Page : [ 38 ] not Noah himself at all ; for we read not of any children he had after the flood ; and in the following chapter , where his posterity is reckoned up , there is no mention of any ; and so this benediction in succession was not to take place till 350 years after : and to save our author ’s imaginary monarchy , the peopling of the world must be deferred 350 years ; for this part of the benediction cannot be understood with subordination , unless our author will say , that they must ask leave of their father Noah to lie with their wives .
But in this one point our author is constant to himself in all his discourses , he takes great care there should be monarchs in the world , but very little that there should be people ; and indeed his way of government is not the way to people the world : for how much absolute monarchy helps to fulfil this great and primary blessing of God Almighty , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , which contains in it the improvement too of arts and sciences , and the conveniences of life , may be seen in those large and rich countries which are happy under the Turkish government , where are not now to be found one third , nay in many , if not most parts of them one thirtieth , perhaps I might say not one hundredth of the people , that were formerly , as will easily appear to any one , who will compare the accounts we have of it at Edition : current ; Page : [ 39 ] this time , with antient history .
But this by the by .
1. Sir Robert would persuade us against the express words of the scripture , that what Edition : current ; Page : [ 36 ] was here granted to Noah , was not granted to his sons in common with him .
His words are , As for the general community between Noah and his sons , which Mr. Selden will have to be granted to them , ix .
Gen. 2 . the text doth not warrant it .
What warrant our author would have , when the plain express words of scripture , not capable of another meaning , will not satisfy him , who pretends to build wholly on scripture , is not easy to imagine .
The text says , God blessed Noah and his sons , and said unto them , i. e. as our author would have it , unto him : for , faith he , although the sons are there mentioned with Noah in the blessing , yet it may best be understood , with a subordination or benediction in succession , Observations , 211 .
That indeed is best , for our author to be understood , which best serves to his purpose ; but that truly may best be understood by any body else , which best agrees with the plain construction of the words , and arises from the obvious meaning of the place ; and then with subordination and in succession , will not be best understood , in a grant of God , where he himself put them not , nor mentions any such limitation .
But yet , our author has reasons , why it may best be understood so .
The blessing , says he in the following words , might truly be fulfilled , if the sons , either under or after their father , enjoyed a private dominion , Observations , 211 .
which is to say , that a grant , whose express words give a joint title Edition : current ; Page : [ 37 ] in present ( for the text says , into your hands they are delivered ) may best be understood with a subordination or in succession ; because it is possible , that in subordination , or in succession , it may be enjoyed .
Which is all one as to say , that a grant of any thing in present possession may best be understood of reversion ; because it is possible one may live to enjoy it in reversion .
If the grant be indeed to a father and to his sons after him , who is so kind as to let his children enjoy it presently in common with him , one may truly say , as to the event one will be as good as the other ; but it can never be true , that what the express words grant in possession , and in common , may best be understood , to be in reversion .
The sum of all his reasoning amounts to this :
God did not give to the sons of Noah the world in common with their father , because it was possible they might enjoy it under , or after him .
A very good sort of argument against an express text of scripture : but God must not be believed , though he speaks it himself , when he says he does any thing , which will not consist with Sir Robert ’s hypothesis .
And that this grant spoken to Adam was made to him , and the whole species of man , is clear from our author ’s own proof out of the Psalmist .
The earth , faith the Psalmist , hath he given to the children of men ; which shews the title comes from fatherhood .
These are Sir Robert ’s words in the preface before cited , and a strange inference it is he makes ;
God hath given the earth to the children of men , ergo the title comes from fatherhood .
It is Edition : current ; Page : [ 35 ] pity the propriety of the Hebrew tongue had not used fathers of men , instead of children of men , to express mankind : then indeed our author might have had the countenance of the sound of the words , to have placed the title in the fatherhood .
But to conclude , that the fatherhood had the right to the earth , because God gave it to the children of men , is a way of arguing peculiar to our author : and a man must have a great mind to go contrary to the sound as well as sense of the words , before he could light on it .
But the sense is yet harder , and more remote from our author ’s purpose : for as it stands in his preface , it is to prove Adam ’s being monarch , and his reasoning is thus , God gave the earth to the children of men , ergo Adam was monarch of the world .
I defy any man to make a more pleasant conclusion than this , which cannot be excused from the most obvious absurdity , till it can be shewn , that by children of men , he who had no father , Adam alone is signified ; but whatever our author does , the scripture speaks not nonsense .
But perhaps it will be said , Eve was not made till afterward : grant it so , what advantage will our author get by it ?
The text will be only the more directly against him , and shew that God , in this donation , gave the world to mankind in common , and not to Adam in particular .
The word them in the text must include the species of man , for it is certain them can by no means signify Adam alone .
In the 26th verse , where God declares his intention to give this dominion , it is plain he meant , that he would make a species of creatures , that should have dominion over the other species of this terrestrial globe : the words are , And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness , and let them have dominion over the fish , &c .
They then were to have dominion .
Who ?
even those who were to have the image of God , the individuals of that species of man , that he was going to make ; for that them should signify Adam Edition : current ; Page : [ 34 ] singly , exclusive of the rest that should be in the world with him , is against both scripture and all reason : and it cannot possibly be made sense , if man in the former part of the verse do not signify the same with them in the latter ; only man there , as is usual , is taken for the species , and them the individuals of that species : and we have a reason in the very text .
God makes him in his own image , after his own likeness ; makes him an intellectual creature , and so capable of dominion : for wherein soever else the image of God consisted , the intellectual nature was certainly a part of it , and belonged to the whole species , and enabled them to have dominion over the inferior creatures ; and therefore David says in the 8th Psalm above cited ,
Thou hast made him little lower than the angels , thou hast made him to have dominion .
It is not of Adam king David speaks here , for verse 4 . it is plain , it is of man , and the son of man , of the species of mankind .
2. Whatever God gave by the words of this grant , i. Gen. 28 .
it was not to Adam in particular , exclusive of all other men : whatever dominion he had thereby , it was not a private dominion , but a dominion in common with the rest of mankind .
That this donation was not made in particular to Adam , appears evidently from the words of the text , it being made to more than one ; for it was spoken in the plural number , God blessed them , and said unto them , Have dominion .
God says unto Adam and Eve , Have dominion ; thereby , says our author , Adam was monarch of the world : but the grant being to them , i. e. spoke to Eve also , as many Edition : current ; Page : [ 33 ] interpreters think with reason , that these words were not spoken till Adam had his wife , must not she thereby be lady , as well as he lord of the world ?
If it be said , that Eve was subjected to Adam , it seems she was not so subjected to him , as to hinder her dominion over the creatures , or property in them : for shall we say that God ever made a joint grant to two , and one only was to have the benefit of it ?
David , who might be supposed to understand the donation of God in this text , and the right of kings too , as well as our author in his comment on this place , as the learned and judicious Ainsworth calls it , in the 8th Psalm , finds here no such charter of monarchical power , his words are , Thou hast made him , i. e. man , the Son of man , a little lower than the angels ; thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands ; thou hast put all Edition : current ; Page : [ 32 ] things under his feet , all sheep and oxen , and the beasts of the field , and the fowls of the air , and fish of the sea , and whatsover passeth thro ’ the paths of the sea .
In which words , if any one can find out , that there is meant any monarchical power of one man over another , but only the dominion of the whole species of mankind , over the inferior species of creatures , he may , for aught I know , deserve to be one of Sir Robert ’s monarchs in habit , for the rareness of the discovery .
And by this time , I hope it is evident , that he that gave dominion over every living thing that moveth on the earth , gave Adam no monarchical power over those of his own species , which will yet appear more fully in the next thing I am to shew .
And this further appears from Gen. ix .
2 . where God renewing this charter to Noah and his sons , he gives them dominion over the fowls of the air , and the fishes of the sea , and the terrestrial creatures , expressed by Edition : current ; Page : [ 30 ] היח and שמרר wild beasts and reptils , the same words that in the text before us , i. Gen. 28 . are translated every moving thing , that moveth on the earth , which by no means can comprehend man , the grant being made to Noah and his sons , all the men then living , and not to one part of men over another : which is yet more evident from the very next words , ver .
3 . where God gives every שמר every moving thing , the very words used , ch. i. 28 . to them for food .
By all which it is plain that God ’s donation to Adam , ch. i. 28 . and his designation , ver. 26 . and his grant again to Noah and his sons , refer to and contain in them neither more nor less than the works of the creation the 5th day , and the beginning of the 6th , as they are set down from the 20th to 26th ver .
inclusively of the 1st ch. and so comprehend all the species of irrational animals of the terraqueous globe , tho ’ all the words , whereby they are expressed in the history of their creation , are no where used in any of the following grants , but some of them omitted in one , and some in another .
From whence I think it is past all doubt , that man cannot be comprehended in this grant , nor any dominion over those of his own species be conveyed to Adam .
All the terrestrial irrational creatures are enumerated at their creation , ver. 25 .
under the names beasts of the earth , cattle and creeping things ; but man , Edition : current ; Page : [ 31 ] being not then created , was not contained under any of those names ; and therefore , whether we understand the Hebrew words right or no , they can not be supposed to comprehend man , in the very same history , and the very next verses following , especially since that Hebrew word שמר which , if any in this donation to Adam , ch. i. 28 .
must comprehend man , is so plainly used in contradistinction to him , as Gen. vi. 20 . vii. 14 , 21 , 23 . Gen. viii .
17 , 19 .
And if God made all mankind slaves to Adam and his heirs by giving Adam dominion over every living thing that moveth on the earth , ch. i. 28 .
as our author would have it , methinks Sir Robert should have carried his monarchical power one step higher , and satisfied the world , that princes might eat their subjects too , since God gave as full power to Noah and his heirs , ch. ix .
2 . to eat every living thing that moveth , as he did to Adam to have dominion over them , the Hebrew words in both places being the same .
When God had made the irrational animals of the world , divided into three kinds , from the places of their habitation , viz .
fishes of the sea , fowls of the air , and living creatures of the earth , and these again into cattle , wild beasts , and reptils , he considers of making man , and the dominion he should have over the terrestrial world , ver. 26 . and Edition : current ; Page : [ 29 ] then he reckons up the inhabitants of these three kingdoms , but in the terrestrial leaves out the second rank היח or wild beasts : but here , ver. 28 .
where he actually exercises this design , and gives him this dominion , the text mentions the fishes of the sea , and fowls of the air , and the terrestrial creatures in the words that signify the wild beasts and reptils , though translated living thing that moveth , leaving out cattle .
In both which places , though the word that signifies wild beasts be omitted in one , and that which signifies cattle in the other , yet , since God certainly executed in one place , what he declares he designed in the other , we cannot but understand the same in both places , and have here only an account , how the terrestrial irrational animals , which were already created and reckoned up at their creation , in three distinct ranks of cattle , wild beasts , and reptils , were here , ver. 28 .
actually put under the dominion of man , as they were designed , ver. 26 .
nor do these words contain in them the least appearance of any thing that can be wrested to signify God ’s giving to one man dominion over another , to Adam over his posterity .
1 . That this donation , i. Gen. 28 . gave Adam no power over men , will appear if we consider the words of it : for since all positive grants convey no more than the express words they are made in will carry , let us see which of them here will comprehend mankind , or Adam ’s posterity ; and those , I imagine , if any , must be these , every living thing that moveth : the words in Hebrew are , השמרה היה i. e. Bestiam Reptantem , of which words the scripture itself is the best interpreter :
God having created the fishes and fowls the 5th day , the beginning of the 6th , he creates the irrational inhabitants of the dry land , which , v. 24 .
are described in these words , let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind ; cattle and creeping things , and beasts of the earth , after his kind , and , v. 2 . and God made the beasts of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth on the earth after his kind : here , in the creation of the brute inhabitants of the earth , he first speaks of them all under one general name , of living creatures , Edition : current ; Page : [ 28 ] and then afterwards divides them into three ranks , 1 . Cattle , or such creatures as were or might be tame , and so be the private possession of particular men ; 2 . היח which , ver. 24 , and 25 .
in our Bible , is translated beasts , and by the Septuagint θηϛία , wild beasts , and is the same word , that here in our text , ver. 28 .
where we have this great charter to Adam , is translated living thing , and is also the same word used , Gen. ix .
2 . where this grant is renewed to Noah , and there likewise translated beast .
3 . The third rank were the creeping animals , which ver. 24 , and 25 .
are comprised under the word , השמרח , the same that is used here , ver. 28 . and is translated moving , but in the former verses creeping , and by the Septuagint in all these places , ἑρπετἀ , or reptils ; from whence it appears , that the words which we translate here in God ’s donation , ver.28 .
living creatures moving , are the same , which in the history of the creation , ver. 24 , 25 .
signify two ranks of terrestrial creatures , viz . wild beasts and reptils , and are so understood by the Septuagint .
But let us see the argument .
The words of the text are these ; and God blessed them , and God said unto them , be fruitful and multiply , and replenish the earth and subdue it , and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth , i. Gen. 28 . from whence our author concludes , that Adam , having here dominion given him over all creatures , was thereby the monarch of the Edition : current ; Page : [ 26 ] whole world : whereby must be meant , that either this grant of God gave Adam property , or as our author calls it , private dominion over the earth , and all inferior or irrational creatures , and so consequently that he was thereby monarch ; or 2dly , that it gave him rule and dominion over all earthly creatures whatsoever , and thereby over his children ; and so he was monarch : for , as Mr. Selden has properly worded it , Adam was made general lord of all things , one may very clearly understand him , that he means nothing to be granted to Adam here but property , and therefore he says not one word of Adam ’s monarchy .
But our author says , Adam was hereby monarch of the world , which , properly speaking , signifies sovereign ruler of all the men in the world ; and so Adam , by this grant , must be constituted such a ruler .
If our author means otherwise , he might with much clearness have said , that Adam was hereby proprietor of the whole world .
But he begs your pardon in that point : clear distinct speaking not serving every where to his purpose , you must not expect it in him , as in Mr. Selden , or other such writers .
HAVING at last got through the foregoing passage , where we have been so long detained , not by the force of arguments and opposition , but the intricacy of the words , and the doubtfulness of the meaning ; let us go on to his next argument , for Adam ’s sovereignty .
Our author tells us in the words of Mr. Selden , that Adam by donation from God , Gen. i. 28 . was made the general lord of all things , not without such a private dominion to himself , as without his grant did exclude his children .
This determination of Mr. Selden , says our author , is Edition : current ; Page : [ 25 ] consonant to the history of the Bible , and natural reason , Observations , 210 .
And in his Pref. to his Observations on Aristotle , he says thus ,
The first government in the world was monarchical in the father of all flesh , Adam being commanded to multiply and people the earth , and to subdue it , and having dominion given him over all creatures , was thereby the monarch of the whole world : none of his posterity had any right to possess any thing , but by his grant or permission , or by succession from him :
The earth , saith the Psalmist , hath he given to the children of men , which shew the title comes from fatherhood .
This I am sure : if our author will have this text to be a grant , the original grant Edition : current ; Page : [ 55 ] of government , political government , he ought to have proved it by some better arguments than by barely saying , that thy desire shall be unto thy husband , was a law whereby Eve , and all that should come of her , were subjected to the absolute monarchical power of Adam and his heirs .
Thy desire shall be to thy husband , is too doubtful an expression , of whose signification interpreters are not agreed , to build so confidently on , and in a matter of such moment , and so great and general concernment : but our author , according to his way of writing , having once named the text , concludes presently without any more ado , that the meaning is as he would have it .
Let the words rule and subject be but found in the text or margent , and it immediately signifies the duty of a subject to his prince ; the relation is changed , and though God says husband , Sir Robert will have it king ; Adam has presently absolute monarchical power over Eve , and not only over Eve , but all that should come of her , though the scripture says not a word of it , nor our author a word to prove it .
But Adam must for all that be an absolute monarch , and so down to the end of the chapter .
And here I leave my reader to consider , whether my bare saying , without offering any reasons to evince it , that this text gave not Adam that absolute monarchical power , our author supposes , be not as sufficient to destroy that power , as his bare assertion Edition : current ; Page : [ 56 ] is to establish it , since the text mentions neither prince nor people , speaks nothing of absolute or monarchical power , but the subjection of Eve to Adam , a wife to her husband .
And he that would trace our author so all through , would make a short and sufficient answer to the greatest part of the grounds he proceeds on , and abundantly consute them by barely denying ; it being a sufficient answer to assertions without proof , to deny them without giving a reason .
And therefore should I have said nothing but barely denied , that by this text the supreme power was settled and founded by God himself , in the fatherhood , limited to monarchy , and that to Adam ’s person and heirs , all which our author notably concludes from these words , as may be seen in the same page , Observations , 244 .
it had been a sufficient answer : should I have desired any sober man only to have read the text , and considered to whom , and on what occasion it was spoken , he would no doubt have wondered how our author found out monarchical absolute power in it , had he not had an exceeding good faculty to find it himself , where he could not shew it others .
And thus we have examined the two places of scripture , all that I remember our author brings to prove Adam ’s sovereignty , that supremacy , which he says , it was God ’s ordinance should be unlimited in Adam , and as large as all the acts of his will , Observations , Edition : current ; Page : [ 57 ] 254 . viz. i. Gen. 28 . and iii.
Gen. 16 . one whereof signifies only the subjection of the inferior ranks of creatures to mankind , and the other the subjection that is due from a wife to her husband , both far enough from that which subjects owe the governors of political societies .
But if these words here spoke to Eve must needs be understood as a law to bind her and all other women to subjection , it can be no other subjection than what every wife owes her husband ; and then if this be the original grant of government and the foundation of monarchical power , there will be as many monarchs as there are husbands : if therefore these words give any power to Adam , it can be only a conjugal power , not political ; the power that every husband hath to order the things of private concernment in his family , as proprietor of the goods and land there , and to have his will take place before that of his wife in all things of their common concernment ; but not a political power of life and death over her , much less over any body else .
Farther it is to be noted , that these words here of iii .
Gen. 16 . which our author calls the original grant of government , were not spoken to Adam , neither indeed was there any grant in them made to Adam , but a punishment laid upon Eve : and if we will take them as they were directed in particular to her , or in her , as their representative , to all other women , they will at most concern the female sex only , and import no more , but that subjection they should ordinarily be Edition : current ; Page : [ 53 ] in to their husbands : but there is here no more law to oblige a woman to such a subjection , if the circumstances either of her condition , or contract with her husband , should exempt her from it , than there is , that she should bring forth her children in sorrow and pain , if there could be found a remedy for it , which is also a part of the same curse upon her : for the whole verse runs thus , Unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children , and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
It would , I think , have been a hard matter for any body , but our author , to have found out a grant of monarchical government to Adam in these words , which were neither spoke to , nor of him : neither will any one , I suppose , by these words , think the weaker sex , as by a law , so subjected to the curse contained in them , that it is their duty not to endeavour to avoid it .
And will any one say , that Eve , or any other woman , sinned , if she were brought to bed without those multiplied pains
God threatens her here with ?
or that either of our queens , Mary or Elizabeth , had they married any of their subjects , had been by this text put into a political subjection to him ?
or that he thereby should have had monarchical rule over her ?
God , in this text , gives not , that I see , any authority to Adam over Eve , or to men over their wives , but Edition : current ; Page : [ 54 ] only foretels what should be the woman ’s lot , how by his providence he would order it so , that she should be subject to her husband , as we see that generally the laws of mankind and customs of nations have ordered it so ; and there is , I grant , a foundation in nature for it .
God , I believe , speaks differently from men , because he speaks with more truth , Edition : current ; Page : [ 52 ] more certainty : but when he vouchsafes to speak to men , I do not think he speaks differently from them , in crossing the rules of language in use amongst them : this would not be to condescend to their capacities , when he humbles himself to speak to them , but to lose his design in speaking what , thus spoken , they could not understand .
And yet thus must we think of God , if the interpretations of scripture , necessary to maintain our author ’s doctrine , must be received for good : for by the ordinary rules of language , it will be very hard to understand what God says , if what he speaks here , in the singular number , to Adam , must be understood to be spoken to all mankind , and what he says in the plural number , i. Gen. 26 , and 28 .
must be understood of Adam alone , exclusive of all others , and what he says to Noah and his sons jointly , must be understood to be meant to Noah alone , Gen. ix .
This was not a time , when Adam could expect any favours , any grant of privileges , from his offended Maker .
If this be the original grant of government , as our author tells us , and Adam was now made monarch , whatever Sir Robert would have him , it is plain , God made him but a very poor monarch , such an one , as our author himself would have counted it no great privilege to be .
God sets him to work for his living , and seems rather to give him a spade into his hand , to subdue the earth , than a sceptre to rule over its inhabitants .
In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread , says God to him , ver. 19 .
This was unavoidable , may it perhaps be answered , because he was yet without subjects , and had nobody to work for him ; but afterwards , living as he did above 900 years , he might have people enough , whom he might command , to work for him ; no , says God , not only whilst thou art without other help , save thy wife , but as long as thou livest , shalt thou live by thy labour ,
In the sweat of thy face , shalt thou eat thy bread , till thou return unto the ground , for out of it wast thou taken , for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return , v. 19 .
It will perhaps be answered again in favour of our author , that these words are not spoken personally to Adam , but in him , as their representative , to all mankind , this being a curse upon mankind , because of the fall .
THE next place of scripture we find our author builds his monarchy of Adam on , is iii .
Gen. 26 .
And thy defire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
Here we have ( says he ) the original grant of government , from whence he concludes , in the following part of the page , Observations , 244 .
That the supreme power is settled in the fatherhood , and limited to one kind of government , that is , to monarchy .
For let his premises be what they will , this is always the conclusion ; let rule , in any text , be but once named , and presently absolute monarchy Edition : current ; Page : [ 50 ] is by divine right established .
If any one will but carefully read our author ’s own reasoning from these words , Observations , 244 .
and consider , among other things , the line and posterity of Adam , as he there brings them in , he will find some difficulty to make sense of what he says ; but we will allow this at present to his peculiar way of writing , and consider the force of the text in hand .
The words are the curse of God upon the woman , for having been the first and forwardest in the disobedience ; and if we will consider the occasion of what God says here to our first parents , that he was denouncing judgment , and declaring his wrath against them both , for their disobedience , we cannot suppose that this was the time , wherein God was granting Adam prerogatives and privileges , investing him with dignity and authority , elevating him to dominion and monarchy : for though , as a helper in the temptation , Eve was laid below him , and so he had accidentally a superiority over her , for her greater punishment ; yet he too had his share in the fall , as well as the sin , and was laid lower , as may be seen in the following verses ; and it would be hard to imagine , that God , in the same breath , should make him universal monarch over all mankind , and a day - labourer for his life ; turn him out of paradise to till the ground , ver. 23 .
and at the same time advance him to a throne , and all the privileges and ease of absolute power .
Thus this new nothing , that is to carry with it all power , authority , and government ; this fatherhood , which is to design the person , and establish the throne of monarchs , whom the people are to obey , may , according to Sir Robert , come into any hands , any how , and so by his politics give to democracy royal authority , and make an usurper a lawful prince .
And if it will do all these fine feats , much good do our author and all his followers with their omnipotent fatherhood , which can serve for nothing but to unsettle and destroy all the lawful governments in the world , and to establish in their room disorder , tyranny , and usurpation .
And thus what a monarchy he hath set up , let him and his disciples consider .
Princes certainly will have great reason to thank him for these new politics , which set up as many absolute kings in every country as there are fathers of children .
And yet who can blame our author for it , it lying unavoidably in the way of one discoursing upon our author ’s principles ?
For having placed an absolute power in fathers by right of begetting , he could not easily resolve how much of this power belonged to a son over the children he had begotten ; and so it fell out to be a very hard matter to give all the power , Edition : current ; Page : [ 84 ] as he does , to Adam , and yet allow a part in his life - time to his children , when they were parents , and which he knew not well how to deny them .
This makes him so doubtful in his expressions , and so uncertain where to place this absolute natural power , which he calls fatherhood .
Sometimes Adam alone has it all , as p. 13 .
Observations , 244 , 245 . & Pref .
If any one will suppose , in favour of our author , that he here meant , that parents , who are in subjection themselves to the absolute authority of their father , have yet some power over their children ; I confess he is something nearer the truth : but he will not at all hereby help our author : for he no where speaking of the paternal power , but as an absolute unlimited authority , cannot be supposed to understand any thing else here , unless he himself had limited it , and shewed how far it reached .
And that he means here paternal authority in that large extent , is plain from the immediate following words ;
This subjection of children being , says he , the foundation of all regal authority , p. 12 .
the subjection then that in the former line , he says , every man is in to his parents , and consequently what Adam ’s grand - children were in to their parents , was that which was the fountain of all regal authority , i. e. according to our author , absolute unlimitable authority .
And thus Adam ’s children had regal authority over their children , whilst they themselves were subjects to their father , and fellow - subjects with their children .
But let him mean as he pleases , it is plain he allows Adam ’s children to have paternal power , p. 12 .
as also all other fathers to have paternal power Edition : current ; Page : [ 83 ] over their children , Observations , 156 .
From whence one of these two things will necessarily follow , that either Adam ’s children , even in his life - time , had , and so all other fathers have , as he phrases it , p. 12 .
by right of fatherhood , royal authority over their children , or else , that Adam , by right of fatherhood , had not royal authority .
For it can not be but that paternal power does , or does not , give royal authority to them that have it : if it does not , then Adam could not be sovereign by this title , nor any body else ; and then there is an end of all our author ’s politics at once : if it does give royal authority , then every one that has paternal power has royal authority ; and then , by our author ’s patriarchal government , there will be as many kings as there are fathers .
But that he means here paternal power , and no other , is past doubt , from the inference he makes in these words immediately following , I see not then how the children of Adam , or of any man else , can be free from subjection to their parents .
Whereby it appears that the power on one side , and the subjection on the other , our author here speaks of , is that natural power and subjection between Edition : current ; Page : [ 81 ] parents and children : for that which every man ’s children owed , could be no other ; and that our author always affirms to be absolute and unlimited .
This natural power of parents over their children , Adam had over his posterity , says our author ; and this power of parents over their children , his children had over theirs in his life - time , says our author also ; so that Adam , by a natural right of father , had an absolute unlimited power over all his posterity , and at the same time his children had by the same right absolute unlimited power over theirs .
Here then are two absolute unlimited powers existing together , which I would have any body reconcile one to another , or to common sense .
For the salvo he has put in of subordination , makes it more absurd : to have one absolute , unlimited , nay unlimitable power in subordination to another , is so manifest a contradiction , that nothing can be more .
Adam is absolute prince with the unlimited authority of fatherhood over all his posterity ; all his posterity are then absolutely his subjects ; and , as our author says , his slaves , children , and grand - children , are equally in this state of subjection and slavery ; and yet , says our author , the children of Adam have paternal , i. e. absolute unlimited power over their own children :
Which in plain English is , they are slaves and absolute princes at the same time , and in the same government ; and one Edition : current ; Page : [ 82 ] part of the subjects have an absolute unlimited power over the other by the natural right of parentage .
But to save others the pains , were there any need , he is not sparing himself to shew , by his own contradictions , the weakness of his own doctrine .
Adam ’s absolute Edition : current ; Page : [ 79 ] and sole dominion is that , which he is every where full of , and all along builds on , and yet he tells us , p. 12 .
that as Adam was lard of his children , so his children under him had a command and power over their own children .
The unlimited and undivided sovereignty of Adam ’s fatherhood , by our author ’s computation , stood but a little while , only during the first generation , but as soon as he had grand - children , Sir Robert could give but a very ill account of it .
Adam , as father of his children , faith he , hath an absolute , unlimited royal power over them , and by virtue thereof over those that they begot , and so to all generations ; and yet his children , viz .
Cain and Seth , have a paternal power over their children at the same time ; so that they are at the same time absolute lords , and yet vassals and slaves ; Adam has all the authority , as grand - father of the people , and they have a part of it as fathers of a part of them : he is absolute over them and their posterity , by having begotten them , and yet they are absolute over their children by the same title .
No , says our author , Adam ’s children under him had power over their own children , but still with subordination to the first parent .
A good distinction that sounds well , and it is pity it signifies nothing , nor can be reconciled with our author ’s words .
I readily grant , that supposing Adam ’s absolute power over his posterity , any of his children might have Edition : current ; Page : [ 80 ] from him a delegated , and so a subordinate power over a part , or all the rest : but that cannot be the power our author speaks of here ; it is not a power by grant and commission , but the natural paternal power he supposes a father to have over his children .
For 1 . he says , As Adam was lord of his children , so his children under him had a power over their own children : they were then lords over their own children after the same manner , and by the same title , that Adam was , i. e. by right of generation , by right of fatherhood .
2 . It is plain he means the natural power of fathers , because he limits it to be only over their own children ; a delegated power has no such limitation , as only over their own children , it might be over others , as well as their own children .
3 . If it were a delegated power , it must appear in scripture ; but there is no ground in scripture to affirm , that Adam ’s children had any other power over theirs , than what they naturally had as fathers .
And thus we have at last got thro ’ all , that in our author looks like an argument for that absolute unlimited sovereignty described , sect .
8 . which he supposes in Adam ; so that mankind ever since have been all born slaves , without any title to freedom .
But if creation , which gave nothing but a being , made not Adam prince of his posterity : if Adam , Gen. i. 28 . was not constituted lord of mankind , nor had a private dominion given him exclusive of his children , but only a right and power over the earth , and inferiour creatures in common with the children of men ; if also Gen. iii.
16 .
God gave not any political power to Adam over his wife and children , but only subjected Eve to Adam , as a punishment , or foretold the subjection of the weaker sex , in the ordering the common concernments of their families , but gave not thereby to Adam , as to the husband , power of life and death , which necessarily belongs to the magistrate : if fathers by begetting their children acquire no such power ove them ; and if the command , Honour thy father and mother , give it not , but only enjoins a duty owing to parents equally , whether subjects or not , and to the mother as well as the father ; if all this be so , as I Edition : current ; Page : [ 78 ] think , by what has been said , is very evident ; then man has a natural freedom , notwithstanding all our author confidently says to the contrary ; since all that share in the same common nature , faculties and powers , are in nature equal , and ought to partake in the same common rights and privileges , till the manifest appointment of God , who is Lord over all , blessed for ever , can be produced to shew any particular person ’s supremacy ; or a man ’s own consent subjects him to a superiour .
This is so plain , that our author confesses , that Sir John Hayward , Blackwood and Barclay , the great vindicators of the right of kings , could not deny it , but admit with one consent the natural liberty and equality of mankind , for a truth unquestionable .
And our author hath been so far from producing any thing , that may make good his great position , that Adam was absolute monarch , and so men are not naturally free , that even his own proofs make against him ; so that to use his own way of arguing , the first erroneous principle failing , the whole fabric of this vast engine of absolute power and tyranny drops down of itself , and there needs no more to be said in answer to all that he builds upon so false and frail a foundation .
The law that enjoins obedience to kings is delivered , says our author , in the terms , Honour thy father , as if all power were originally in the father , Observations , 254 : and that law is also delivered , say I , in the terms , Honour thy mother , as if all power were originally in the mother .
I appeal whether Edition : current ; Page : [ 76 ] the argument be not as good on one side as the other , father and mother being joined all along in the Old and New Testament where - ever honour or obedience is injoined children .
Again our author tells us , Observations , 254 .
that this command , Honour thy father , gives the right to govern , and makes the form of government monarchical .
To which I answer , that if by Honour thy father be meant obedience to the political power of the magistrate , it concerns not any duty we owe to our natural fathers , who are subjects ; because they , by our author ’s doctrine , are divested of all that power , it being placed wholly in the prince , and so being equally subjects and slaves with their children , can have no right , by that title , to any such honour or obedience , as contains in it political subjection : if Honour thy father and mother signifies the duty we owe our natural parents , as by our Saviour ’s interpretation , Matth .
xv. 4 . and all the other mentioned places , it is plain it does , then it cannot concern political obedience , but a duty that is owing to persons , who have no title to sovereignty , nor any political authority as magistrates over subjects .
For the person of a private father , and a title to obedience , due to the supreme magistrate , are things inconsistent ; and therefore this command , which must necessarily comprehend the persons of our natural fathers , must mean a duty we owe Edition : current ; Page : [ 77 ] them distinct from our obedience to the magistrate , and from which the most absolute power of princes cannot absolve us .
What this duty is , we shall in its due place examine .
Our author says , God hath given to a father a right or liberty to alien his power over his children to any other , Observations , 155 .
I doubt whether he can alien wholly the right of honour that is due from them : but be that as it will , this I am sure , he cannot alien , and retain the same power .
If therefore the magistrate ’s sovereignty be , as our author would have it , nothing but the authority of a supreme father , p. 23 .
it is unavoidable , that if the magistrate hath all this paternal right , as he must have if fatherhood be the fountain of all authority ; then the subjects , though fathers , can have no power over their children , no right to honour from them : for it can not be all in another ’s hands , and a part remain with the parents .
So that , according to our author ’s own doctrine , Honour thy father and mother cannot possibly be understood of political subjection and obedience ; since the laws both in the Old and New Testament , that commanded Edition : current ; Page : [ 75 ] children to honour and obey their parents , were given to such , whose fathers were under civil government , and fellow subjects with them in political societies ; and to have bid them honour and obey their parents , in our author ’s sense , had been to bid them be subjects to those who had no title to it ; the right to obedience from subjects , being all vested in another ; and instead of teaching obedience , this had been to foment sedition , by setting up powers that were not .
If therefore this command , Honour thy father and mother , concern political dominion , it directly overthrows our author ’s monarchy ; since it being to be paid by every child to his father , even in society , every father must necessarily have political dominion , and there will be as many sovereigns as there are fathers : besides that the mother too hath her title , which destroys the sovereignty of one supreme monarch .
But if Honour thy father and mother mean something distinct from political power , as necessarily it must , it is besides our author ’s business , and serves nothing to his purpose .
By our author ’s doctrine , the father having absolute jurisdiction over his children , has also the same over their issue ; and the consequence is good , were it true , that the father had such a power : and yet I ask our author whether the grandfather , by his sovereignty , could discharge the grandchild from paying to his father the honour due to him by the 5th commandment .
If the grandfather hath , by right of fatherhood , sole sovereign power in him , and that obedience which is due to the supreme magistrate , be commanded in these words , Honour thy father , it is certain the grandfather might dispense with the grandson ’s honouring his father , which since it is evident in common sense he cannot , it follows from hence , that Honour thy father and mother , cannot mean an absolute subjection to a sovereign power , but something else .
The right therefore which parents have by nature , and which is confirmed to them by the 5th commandment , cannot be that political dominion , which our Edition : current ; Page : [ 74 ] author would derive from it : for that being in every civil society supreme somewhere , can discharge any subject from any political obedience to any one of his fellow subjects .
But what law of the magistrate can give a child liberty , not to honour his father and mother ?
It is an eternal law , annexed purely to the relation of parents and children , and so contains nothing of the magistrate ’s power in it , nor is subjected to it .
I agree with our author that the title to this honour is vested in the parents by nature , and is a right which accrues to them by their having begotten their children , and God by many positive declarations has confirmed it to them : I also allow our author ’s rule , that in grants and gifts , that have their original from God and nature , as the power of the father , ( let me add and mother , for whom God hath joined together , let no man put asunder ) no inferior power of men can limit , nor make any law of prescription against them , Observations , 158 .
so that the mother having , by this law of God , a right to honour from her children , which is not subject to the will of her husband , we see this absolute monarchical power of the father can neither be founded on it , nor consist with it ; and he has a power very far from monarchical , very far from that absoluteness our author contends for , when another has over his subjects the same power he hath , and by the Edition : current ; Page : [ 73 ] same title : and therefore he cannot forbear saying himself that he cannot see how any man ’s children can be free from subjection to their parents , p. 12 .
which , in common speech , I think , signifies mother as well as father , or if parents here signifies only father , it is the first time I ever yet knew it to do so , and by such an use of words one may say any thing .
One would wonder then how our author infers from the 5th commandment , that all power was originally in the father ; how he finds monarchical power of government settled and fixed by the commandment , Honour thy father and thy mother .
If all the honour due by the commandment , be it what it will , be the only right of the father , because he , as our author says , has the sovereignty over the woman , as being the nobler and principler agent in generation , why did God afterwards all along join the mother with him , to share in his honour ?
can the father , by this sovereignty of his , discharge the child from paying this honour to his mother ?
The scripture gave no such licence to the Jews , and yet there were often breaches wide enough Edition : current ; Page : [ 72 ] betwixt husband and wife , even to divorce and separation : and , I think , no body will say a child may with - hold honour from his mother , or , as the scripture terms it , set light by her , though his father should command him to do so ; no more than the mother could dispense with him for neglecting to honour his father : whereby it is plain , that this command of God gives the father no sovereignty , no supremacy .
For had our author set down this command without garbling , as God gave it , and joined mother to father , every reader would have seen , that it had made directly against him ; and that it was so far from establishing the monarchical power of the father , that it set up the mother equal with him , and enjoined nothing but what was due in common , to both father and mother : for that is the constant tenor of the scripture , Honour thy father and thy mother , Exod .

3 . Here not the father only , but the father and mother jointly , had power in this case of life and death .
Thus ran the law of the Old Testament , and in the New they are likewise joined , in the obedience of their children , Eph. vi .
1 . The rule is , Children , obey your parents ; and I do not remember , that I any where read , Children , obey your father , and no more : the scripture joins mother too in that homage , which is due from children ; and had there been any text , where the honour or obedience of children had been directed to the father alone , Edition : current ; Page : [ 71 ] it is not likely that our author , who pretends to build all upon scripture , would have omitted it : nay , the scripture makes the authority of father and mother , in respect of those they have begot , so equal , that in some places it neglects even the priority of order , which is thought due to the father , and the mother is put first , as Lev. xix .
3 . from which so constantly joining father and mother together , as is found quite through the scripture , we may conclude that the honour they have a title to from their children , is one common right belonging so equally to them both , that neither can claim it wholly , neither can be excluded .
In confirmation of this natural authority of the father , our author brings a lame proof from the positive command of God in scripture : his words are , To confirm the natural right of regal power , we find in the Decalogue , that the law which enjoins obedience to kings , is delivered in the terms , Honour thy father , p. 23 .
Whereas many confess , that government only in the abstract , is the ordinance of God , they are not able to prove any such ordinance in the scripture , but only in the fatherly power ; and therefore we find the commandment , that enjoins obedience to superiors , given in the terms , Honour thy father ; so that not only the power and right of government , but the form of the power governing , and the person having the power , are all the ordinances of God .
The first father had not only simply power , but power monarchical , as he was father immediately from God , Observations , 254 .
To the same purpose , the same law is cited by our author in several other places , and just after the same fashion ; that is , and mother , as apochryphal words , are always left out ; a great argument of our author ’s ingenuity , and the goodness of his cause , which required in its defender zeal to a degree of warmth , able to warp the sacred rule of the word of God , to make it comply with his present occasion ; a way of proceeding not unusual Edition : current ; Page : [ 69 ] to those , who embrace not truths because reason and revelation offer them , but espouse tenets and parties for ends different from truth , and then resolve at any rate to defend them ; and so do with the words and sense of authors , they would fit to their purpose , just as Procrustes did with his guests , lop or stretch them , as may best fit them to the size of their notions : and they always prove like those so served , deformed , lame , and useless .
Be it then , as Sir Robert says

It has become synonymous with the terrorist attacks of September 11 - but what is the origin of the name al - Qaida ?
Giles Foden on how Bin Laden may have been inspired by Isaac Asimov 's Foundation
In October last year , an item appeared on an authoritative Russian studies website that soon had the science - fiction community buzzing with speculative excitement .
It asserted that Isaac Asimov 's 1951 classic Foundation was translated into Arabic under the title " al - Qaida " .
And it seemed to have the evidence to back up its claims .
" This peculiar coincidence would be of little interest if not for abundant parallels between the plot of Asimov 's book and the events unfolding now , " wrote Dmitri Gusev , the scientist who posted the article .
He was referring to apparent similarities between the plot of Foundation and the pursuit of the organisation we have come to know , perhaps erroneously , as al - Qaida .
The Arabic word qaida - ordinarily meaning " base " or " foundation " - is also used for " groundwork " and " basis " .
It is employed in the sense of a military or naval base , and for chemical formulae and geometry : the base of a pyramid , for example .
Lane , the best Arab - English lexicon , gives these senses : foundation , basis of a house ; the supporting columns or poles of a structure ; the lower parts of clouds extending across a horizon ; a universal or general rule or canon .
With the coming of the computer age , it has gained the further meaning of " database " : qaida ma'lumat ( information base ) .
Qaida itself comes from the root verb q - '-d : to sit down , remain , stay , abide .
Many people appear to think al - Qaida 's name emerged from some idea of a physical base - a command centre from where Bin Laden and other leaders could direct operations .
" We 've got to get back to al - Qaida on that one , " it 's possible to imagine a footsoldier saying .
Bin Laden himself has spoken , post - September 11 , of being in " a very safe place " .
There have also been stories that his father had a vernal estate called al - Qaida in Yemen or Saudi Arabia .
Could there be a sense in which the name of the organisation represents a notion of the eternal home in the consciousness of its fugitive leader ?
On the surface , the most improbable explanation of the name is that Bin Laden was somehow inspired by a Russian - born writer who lived most of his life in the US and was once the world 's most prolific sci- fi novelist ( born in 1920 in Smolensk , Asimov died in New York in 1992 ) .
But the deeper you dig , the more plausible it seems that al - Qaida 's founders may have borrowed some rhetoric from Foundation and its successors ( it became a series ) and possibly from other science fiction material .
As Nick Mamatas argued in an article on sci-fi fans in Gadfly magazine , " even the terror of September 11th had science fictional overtones : it was both an attack on New York from a tin-plated overlord with delusions of grandeur and a single cataclysmic event that seemingly changed everything , for ever " .
Science fiction has often featured " evil empires " against which are set utopian ideas whose survival must be fought for against the odds by a small but resourceful band of men .
Such empires often turn out to be amazingly fragile when faced by intelligent idealists .
Intelligent idealists who are also psychopaths might find comfort in a fictional role model - especially one created by a novelist famous for castigating that " amiable dunce " Ronald Reagan : the president who prosecuted the CIA 's secret war in Afghanistan .
The Empire portrayed in Asimov 's novels is in turmoil - he cited Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as an influence .
Beset by overconsumption , corruption and inefficiency , " it had been falling for centuries before one man really became aware of that fall .
That man was Hari Seldon , the man who represented the one spark of creative effort left among the gathering decay .
He developed and brought to its highest pitch the science of psycho-history . "
Seldon is a scientist and prophet who predicts the Empire 's fall .
He sets up his Foundation in a remote corner of the galaxy , hoping to build a new civilisation from the ruins of the old .
The Empire attacks the Foundation with all its military arsenal and tries to crush it .
Seldon uses a religion ( based on scientific illusionism ) to further his aims .
These are tracked by the novel and its sequels across a vast tract of time .
For the most part , his predictions come true .
Seldon , like Bin Laden , transmits videotaped messages for his followers , recorded in advance .
There is also some similarity in geopolitical strategy .
Seldon 's vision seems oddly like the way Bin Laden has conceived his campaign .
" Psycho - history " is the statistical treatment of the actions of large populations across epochal periods - the science of mobs as Asimov calls it .
" Hari Seldon plotted the social and economic trends of the time , sighted along curves and foresaw the continuing and accelerating fall of civilisation . "
So did Bin Laden use Foundation as a kind of imaginative sounding - board for the creation of al - Qaida ?
Perhaps reading the book in his pampered youth , and later on seeing his destiny in terms of the ruthless manipulation of historical forces ?
Did he realise much earlier than anyone else that the march of globalisation would provide opportunities for those who wanted to rouse and exploit the dispossessed ?
In the Arab newspaper al - Hayat , the Muslim intellectual Yussuf Samahah put it like this : " Anyone who believes that his [ Bin Laden 's ] ' ideas ' and the new phenomenon [ globalisation ] are contradictory would be mistaken , because while globalisation is gradually uniting the planet , it is causing many introverted and revivalist reactions which use the tools that globalisation provides to give the impression that they are not only fighting it but will ultimately defeat it . "
Using something like game - theory , Asimov's Hari Seldon worked on exactly such principles , taking into account , across time , the dynamic between intergalactic megatrends and local reactions to them .
If Bin Laden did read Asimov , when was it ?
It is clear that from an early age he consumed western products and media , until a fundamentalist reversion occurred when he met the Palestinian preacher Abdullah Azzam , who was to be a crucial influence .
As Bin Laden 's best biographer , Yossef Bodansky , puts it , he " started the 1970s as did many other sons of the affluent and well - connected - breaking the strict Muslim lifestyle in Saudi Arabia with sojourns in cosmopolitan Beirut .
While in high school and college , Osama visited Beirut often , frequenting flashy nightclubs , casinos , and bars .
He was a drinker and womaniser , which often got him into bar brawls . "
If Bin Laden did read Foundation , it most likely would have been in these wild years , when he was aping western habits .
Maybe he read an English version , bought in one of Beirut 's English - language bookshops , or during a trip to the US or London ( where he bought property in Wembley ) .
Was there any science fiction for him to read in Arabic ?
A search dating from 1972 to the present of the Index Translationem , Unesco 's register of translated books , reveals a reasonable amount of classic fantastic fiction in Arabic : The Time Machine , The Invisible Man , Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea .
But so far as 20th - century science fiction is concerned , a search found only two clear - cut examples : a 1985 Kuwait book which collected Ray Bradbury 's Pillar of Fire and The Fog Horn and a 1988 Iraqi edition of Colin Wilson 's The Mind Parasites .
Maybe , says Dennis Lien from the University of Minnesota , who made the search , the fabled Arabic edition of Foundation was published prior to 1972 and has not been reprinted since , but passed from hand to hand .
" I suppose one could argue that since Asimov was Jewish it may have become politically incorrect in the Islamic world to reprint his books , but the same argument would apply against their being printed to any great degree in the first place . "
In the wake of September 11 , the spectre of another science - fiction novel , Frank Herbert 's Dune , was also raised as a possible influence on Bin Laden 's self - mythology .
It features a mysterious man whose followers , Arabic - speaking sons of the desert , live in caves and tunnels .
They engage in a religious jihad against a corrupt imperialist civilisation .
The case that science fiction , and in particular Asimov , could have had an effect on Bin Laden is strengthened by their better documented effects on other psychopathic personalities .
Japan 's Aum Shinrikyo sect - which released 11 packets of deadly sarin gas into the Tokyo subway in 1995 - was also apparently trying to build a community of scientists modelled on the members of Asimov 's Foundation .
" Aum 's bible was , believe it or not , the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov , " says David Kaplan , author of The Cult at the End of the World , a book on the sect , or " guild " as it styled itself .
This is backed up by others .
According to Yoichi Clark Shimatsu , former editor of the Japan Times Weekly , " The ultimate purpose of the guild , said the sect 's science minister Hideo Murai , before he was murdered by a Korean gangster , is to rebuild civilisation after a cataclysm and to combat the powerful globalist institutions that are bringing on an apocalypse . "
In 1995 , after the subway attacks , a coded letter arrived at the magazine Takarajima 30 .
Believed to have been from Aum sympathisers , it gives a sense of how seriously the sect 's members took Asimov and science fiction more generally .
The letter , which promised an attack on the Tokaimura nuclear reprocessing plant , embedded its threat in a passage of literary criticism .
Shimatsu explains : " The letter was a rebuttal to an essay by Susan Sontag in which she claims the sci - fi film genre is based on a fascination with catastrophe in the age of the bomb .
Instead , this critic asserted , science fiction is really about surviving catastrophe , and is therefore optimistic - and the key to the genre is the longing for a sense of scientific community resembling the craft guilds of the past .
" A professor of American literature at one of Tokyo's top universities , a specialist in science fiction , immediately recognised the passage as the work of literary critic Frederic Jameson .
It was obviously selected as a defense of the Aum sect 's effort to build a community of scientists modelled after Isaac Asimov 's Foundation series . "
A small , unplanned nuclear reaction took place at the Tokaimura plant in 1999 , the same year the Japanese government cracked down on the sect .
There had been other , more minor incidents .
All are generally attributed to human error , but Shimatsu believes they may be connected to a second , resurgent wing of Aum working in the nuclear industry on Asimovian lines .
" Aum enjoys a huge following within Japan 's nuclear establishment , which is riddled with believers from millennialist sects .
Another clue is contained in Asimov 's masterpiece .
After the visible First Foundation was crushed by the Galactic Empire , the invisible Second Foundation persisted to eventually win the universal struggle . "
One can't blame Asimov for fuelling the swollen fantasies of the murderous .
It is the last thing this committed pacifist ( " violence is the last refuge of the incompetent " ) would have wanted .
He may not be the only famous sci - fi author to have been taken up by lunatics , anyway .
Killer cultist Charles Manson 's favourite book is said to have been Stranger in a Strange Land , written by Asimov 's rival for the imaginative future Robert Heinlein .
More generally , the space opera sub - genre of science fiction offers the possibility of a massive expansion of self - mythologising will - to - power .
In a 1999 New Yorker article on galactic empires , Oliver Morton beamed up French philosopher Gaston Bachelard , author of The Poetics of Space , to explain all this : " Immensity is a philosophical category of daydream .
Daydream undoubtedly feeds on all kinds of sights , but through a sort of natural inclination , it contemplates grandeur .
And this contemplation produces an attitude that is so special , an inner state that is so unlike any other , that the daydream transports the dreamer outside the immediate world to a world that bears the mark of infinity . "
A world , one might add , in which knocking down the twin towers with passenger jets seems a possibility that can be realised .
As a genre , science fiction can't claim exclusive villainous effect .
Other figures of extreme public animus have been influenced by different types of novels .
Ted Kaczynski , the Unabomber , who held science in contempt , told his family that he'd read Conrad 's The Secret Agent " about a dozen times " in his Montana hut , and is thought to have modelled himself on Conrad 's anarchist .
He also registered under the name " Conrad " in the Sacramento hotel from which he 's believed to have sent his bombs .
Earth First ! , the militant US environmental gang , claim inspiration from Edward Abbey 's 1975 novel , The Monkey - Wrench Gang , in which eco-guerrillas sabotage dams and bridges .
Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh was a fan of neo -Nazi William Pierce 's The Turner Diaries , which tells of a group that blows up the FBI headquarters in Washington .
As , in that very same biscuit - brown building in Federal Plaza , more " Most Wanted " pictures of Bin Laden were being pinned up in the wake of September 11 , the Asimov / al - Qaida story was spreading .
There was a piece in the Ottawa Citizen .
On Ansible , one of the most popular science - fiction websites , hip sci- fi novelist China Miéville was quoted : " An expert on the Middle East told me about a rumour circulating about the name of Bin Laden 's network .
The term al - Qaida seems to have no political precedent in Arabic , and has therefore been something of a conundrum to the experts ...
Unlikely as it sounds , this is the only theory anyone can come up with . "
The expert Miéville was referring to is Fred Halliday , who teaches international relations at the LSE .
Trying to define al - Qaida , Halliday included the Asimov connection as a glancing aside in the " keywords " section of Two Hours that Shook the World , a book about September 11 : " The term has no apparent antecedents in Islamic or Arabic political history : explanations range from a protected region during the communist era in Afghanistan , to it being an allusion to the Bin Laden family 's construction company , to the title of a 1951 Isaac Asimov novel which was translated into Arabic as al - Qaida . "
Many readers of Gusev 's original website posting disagreed with its thesis entirely .
" Asimov 's story hinges on a secular extrapolation of human history based on mathematics , " says John Jenkins , an expert on the author .
" It 's an idea which would make a Muslim extremist cringe . "
A letter to the most important British science - fiction magazine , Interzone , pointed out that the German title of Karl Marx 's preparatory musings on capital , Grundrisse , can also be translated as " base " or " foundation " .
Fantasy has certainly been an element in other terror campaigns , as in the influence of Celtic myths of nationhood on Irish Republicanism .
Fergal Keane brought a quotation from Yeats into his contribution to the BBC's 9/11 book The Day that Shook the World : " The heart fed on fantasy , grown brutal from the fare . "
What Yeats was indicating , says Keane , " was the power of mythology in the shaping of the terrorist 's consciousness " .
To be capable of sustaining a savage war , he went on , " it is necessary to narrow the mind , make it subject to a very limited range of ideas and influences " .
That would seem to cut out Asimov .
But other reasons why al - Qaida might be so called are no less mysterious .
After all , communiques issued by Bin Laden and his associates never use the name .
Instead they refer to themselves as the " World Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and the Crusaders " , the " Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Places " and so on .
The first use of al - Qaida in western media was in 1996 in an American newspaper report which identified it as another name of the Islamic Salvation Foundation , one of Bin Laden 's jihadi charities .
The term only came into general usage after the group 's bombing of the US embassies in East Africa in 1998 , when the FBI and CIA fingered it as an umbrella organisation for various projects of Bin Laden and his associates - many of which grew out of ideas originally hatched by Abdullah Azzam , who 'd been killed by a car - bomb in Peshawar in 1989 .
The network grew exponentially .
By the time Bin Laden was expelled from Sudan in 1996 , his roster of jihadis had been computerised .
Flying back to Afghanistan on a C - 130 transport plane , he is said to have had with him , along with his wives and 150 supporters , a laptop computer containing the names of the thousands of fighters and activists who would help him further expand his struggle against the west .
This qaida ma'lumat , this " information base " , seems a very plausible source of the name .
Dr Saad al - Fagih , a Saudi dissident and former Afghan mujahideen , thinks the term is over - used : " Well I really laugh when I hear the FBI talking about al - Qaida as an organisation of Bin Laden . "
Al - Qaida was just a service for relatives of jihadis , he said , speaking to the American PBS show Frontline .
" In 1988 he [ Bin Laden ] noticed that he was backward in his documentation and was not able to give answers to some families asking about their loved ones gone missing in Afghanistan .
He decided to make the matter much more organised and arranged for proper documentation . "
Fascinatingly , the acclaimed biography of Bin Laden by Yossef Bodansky , director of the US Congressional Task Force on Terrorism , hardly mentions the name al - Qaida .
Written before September 11 , it does so only to emphasise that al - Qaida is the wrong name altogether : " A lot of money is being spent on a rapidly expanding web of Islamist charities and social services , including the recently maligned al - Qaida .
Bin Laden 's first charity , al - Qaida , never amounted to more than a loose umbrella framework for supporting like - minded individuals and their causes .
In the aftermath of the 1998 bombings in Nairobi and Dar - es - Salaam , al - Qaida has been portrayed in the west as a cohesive terrorist organisation , but it is not . "
There 's no doubt that the name came to prominence in part because America needed to conceptualise its enemy .
This is certainly what Bodansky thinks now .
" In the aftermath of September 11 , " he says , " both governments and the media in the west had to identify an entity we should hate and fight against . "
Rohan Gunaratna , research fellow at the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence at the University of St Andrews , takes a different view .
In an important recent book on al - Qaida , he argues that the name came from political theory , citing the concept of al - Qaida al - Sulbah ( the solid base ) formulated in an essay by Abdullah Azzam , Bin Laden 's intellectual mentor .
The solid base provided a platform , Gunaratna writes , for the " sole purpose of creating societies founded on the strictest Islamic principles " .
Al - Qaida al - Sulbah mixes a type of revolutionary vanguardism , borrowed from European political philosophy , with Islamic martyrdom : it 's the pioneering vanguard that must , in Azzam 's phrase , after " a long period of training and hatching " , be prepared to " jump into the fire " .
And there may be another borrowing : the essay reads like nothing so much as Hari Seldon 's plans for his foundation .
Perhaps it was Azzam , after all , who read Asimov .

How do People Feel About Sprint's Phone Customer Service ?
Sprint customers express a range of opinions about the company 's phone - based customer service .
Some praise Sprint 's customer service representatives for providing polite , friendly and effective support .
Others are not so pleased with the help that they have received .
Notable Cases
In one case that was documented online , a man contacted Sprint about getting a reduction in his monthly bill .
The customer service representative presented him with an option that offered a significant discount from what he was currently paying .
A few days after the man entered a new agreement , his wife visited a Sprint store for a device upgrade .
She was told that she could get a better plan that offered even more savings than the husband had negotiated over the phone .
Unfortunately , store staff could not make the change .
Calling Sprint did n't help , and the couple ended up being put back on their original , much more expensive plan .
Because the original request had been made over the phone , the couple was unable to easily prove what had happened .
While the phone rep promised that a manager would call the couple to resolve the issue , this never happened , leaving these Sprint customers very frustrated .
Eventually , the situation was resolved , but it required email contact instead of handling the situation over the phone .
What Can Be Accomplished with Sprint Phone Customer Service ?
Many of common customer questions and issues can be addressed through Sprint 's automated voicemail menu or a conversation with a customer service representative .
These issues include basic phone setup questions , ordering a new device , updating billing information and learning about new plans .
However , there are some issues that might require a different approach :
Device repairs , for example , will need to be handled through a Phone Repair Center .
While a customer service representative may be able to help you determine whether a service problem originates with your device , an accessory or your phone service , a device malfunction will require you to ship or bring your phone to a Sprint Phone Repair Center .
In addition , phone reps do not sell accessories over the phone and can't move your phonebook from one device to another .
If you prefer to pay your phone bill in cash , you will need to visit a Sprint store to do so .
Finally , individuals who wish to order a new service plan may find phone - based customer service confusing .
If you prefer to see service plan options and contracts in hard - copy before making an agreement , consider seeking help at a Sprint store .
What Can Be Done if Sprint Can't Resolve Your Problem by Phone ?
Consumer questions , problems and concerns can often be addressed by Sprint 's phone - based customer service team .
However , there are situations in which customers have not been satisfied by resolutions offered by Sprint .
There are many reasons for unresolved issues , including :
Sometimes callers and customer service representatives do n't communicate well with each other .
The customer 's needs can't be met over the phone :
For example , the caller needs phone accessories or the device needs physical repairs .
Sprint 's policies do n't suit a customer 's needs or wishes .
When Sprint can't resolve an issue over the phone its customers might opt for the following :

Originally set to expire this week , the One Laptop per Child program has extended the deadline on their compelling two - for - one gift - and - get charitable public sale of laptops until December 31st .
This change will allow people more time to make a decision or organize larger group purchases and will also tap into the busy holiday gift - buying market .
Larger group purchases of laptops result in a reduced price per laptop , making this a viable option for community and religious organizations as well as schools and other institutions .
The One Laptop per Child association ( OLPC ) is a Delaware , USA based , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-profit organization , created by faculty members of the MIT Media Lab , set up to oversee The Children ’s Machine project and the construction of the XO - 1 “ $ 100 laptop ” .
In reality , however , higher costs of production have driven the actual costs up to $ 188 per laptop , and increasing competition from mainstream manufacturers may cause future tensions .
However , given the mission of OLPC , such competition – if it successfully provides inexpensive laptops to the developing world – would still fulfill their goals :
“ The mission of One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) is to empower the children of developing countries to learn by providing one connected laptop to every school - age child .
In order to accomplish our goal , we need people who believe in what we ’re doing and want to help make education for the world ’s children a priority , not a privilege . ”
Weighing just 3.2 pounds , this robust and durable laptop includes a camera , microphone and even game controllers , as well as a swivel - screen and other features one would normally not expect for under 500 - 800 dollars per unit .
The laptop can run up to 24 hours on battery power for low - intensity applications and can be charged via hand - crank .
The product may or may not reach its original target group of 150 million users worldwide , though its creators hope that competing models will fill gaps in the progress toward this goal .

In the spring of 1977 , Rick Hoyt told his father , Dick Hoyt , that he wanted to participate in a 5 - mile benefit run for a lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident .
Far from being a long - distance runner , Dick agreed to push Rick in his wheelchair and they finished all 5 miles , coming in next to last .
That night , Rick told his father , “ Dad , when I ’m running , it feels like I ’m not disabled . ”
This realization was just the beginning of what would become over 1,000 races completed , including marathons , duathlons and triathlons .
Also adding to their list of achievements , Dick and Rick biked and ran across the U.S. in 1992 , completing a full 3,735 miles in 45 days .
In a triathlon , Dick will pull Rick in a boat with a bungee cord attached to a vest around his waist and to the front of the boat for the swimming stage .
For the biking stage , Rick will ride a special two - seater bicycle , and then Dick will push Rick in his custom made running chair ( for the running stage ) .
Rick was once asked , if he could give his father one thing , what would it be ?
Rick responded , “ The thing I ’d most like is for my dad to sit in the chair and I would push him for once . ”

​ Four Multi-sport Legends Inducted into USA Triathlon Hall of Fame
TEMPE , Ariz . — USA Triathlon and the multi-sport community celebrated the achievements of four triathlon legends Friday night , as Cherie Gruenfeld , Richard Eugene “ Dick ” Hoyt and Richard Eugene “ Rick ” Hoyt , Jr. , and Mike Plant ( posthumous ) were inducted into the USA Triathlon Hall of Fame .
The gala and ceremony , benefiting the USA Triathlon Foundation , were held in Tempe in conjunction with the inaugural Endurance Exchange conference hosted by USA Triathlon and Triathlon Business International this week .
USA Triathlon Hall of Fame member and longtime Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillvray introduced the Hoyts , telling the story of how he met the famous push - assist team at the Boston Marathon — the iconic race the duo would go on to run 37 times .
“ I looked upon them with bewilderment .
What is this ?
Someone is actually pushing another person in a wheelchair ?
I ’d never seen that before .
I waited for them at the finish line as I just had to find out who they were and what this was all about .
That began a 40 - year relationship and friendship between us , ” McGillivray said .
“ I asked Dick if he wanted to do my Bay State Triathlon .
He said , ‘ Not without Rick . ’
I thought , ‘ how is he going to do this ? ’
As we all know , the rest is history .
They did it and never looked back . ”
“ Team Hoyt ” became the first duo ever to complete the IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua - Kona , Hawaii , in 1989 , and repeated the feat in 1999 .
Over three decades , they have paved the way for the countless push - assist teams around the world who participate in endurance sports today .
“ This is what we did together , as a father and son .
Rick is such a great kid .
He ’s just like you and me , he lives on his own .
He ’s just a great kid and now we ’ve got all these Team Hoyt organizations in different states .
That is something I ’m very proud of , ” said Dick Hoyt , who spoke on behalf of himself and his son , Rick .
Unable to attend , Rick Hoyt addressed the crowd in a recorded video message .
“ Thanks for the honor .
Wish I could be there .
Dad , I love you , ” he said .

My happiest memory of those days is a simple and beautiful song .
“ They 'll Know We Are Christians By Our Love . ”
Though it 's been 30 years since I 've sung it in church , I still think of it often , as a check on my attitudes and behavior , as a reminder of how a Christian is supposed to treat others .
I 'd recommend it to Mike Huckabee .
I think his Christianity needs a little more Love Thy Neighbor and a little less Screw Your Buddy .
And I feel fine about criticizing his Christian walk because he apparently feels fine about criticizing the beliefs of the church I believe in .
In the Sermon on the Mount it says that the way we judge others is the way we will be judged .
So that makes Pastor Huckabee fair game .
And the fact is that he is getting closer to the presidency because he is reaping the benefit of – if not directly fanning – a firestorm of religious bigotry .
Mike Huckabee has catapulted into second place nationally among Republicans because he has surged dramatically in the polls in Iowa .
And he has surged dramatically in the polls in Iowa because evangelical Christians in that state have lurched heavily away from Mitt Romney .
And why have evangelical Christians in Iowa lurched heavily away from Mitt Romney ?
Because of a concerted effort on the phone and over the pulpit to attack Mitt Romney 's religion .
A series of phone solicitations to Republicans in Iowa was constructed in such a way as to bring into question and ridicule various beliefs of – and stereotypes about – the Mormon Church .
At the same time , the head of the Southern Baptist Convention said that every time Mitt Romney said he was a Christian , he was going to direct Southern Baptist ministers to preach a sermon saying that Mormons were n't Christians .
Mike Huckabee , of course , is an ordained Southern Baptist minister .
Before he went into politics , he was a Baptist clergyman by profession .
And it is an interesting coincidence that that statement by the head of Huckabee 's denomination and the telephone push - polling happened at the same time .
It is not surprising at the outcome – Iowa evangelicals dropped Romney like a hot potato and Pastor Huckabee surged to the lead .
There had been no new revelation of policy .
No change in experience .
No significant endorsements one way or the other .
All that changed is that somebody – including a close professional associate of Mike Huckabee – decided to attack Mitt Romney 's religion .
Judas got 33 pieces of silver , Huckabee got 22 points in the polls .
Yes , that is a harsh thing to say .
Yes , I have been a Huckabee supporter and contributor .
No , I 'm not coming to Romney 's aid because I believe in the Mormon Church .
But sometimes you 've got to call a spade a spade .
And yesterday news broke that indicated that one of those times had arrived .
It has been reported that in this Sunday 's “ New York Times Magazine ” -- one of the more widely read publications in the country – Mike Huckabee is going to be quoted as saying , “ Do n't Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers ? ”
That may not be a particular head - turner to many people , but the question and topic are chapter and verse out of anti-Mormon sermons and pamphlets preached and prepared by Southern Baptist ministers and others .
It is not a question , it is a hand grenade , a purposeful distortion used for decades to foster revulsion and hard feeling toward Mormons .
For a Baptist minister , it 's an old and dirty trick .
And it says as much about Mike Huckabee as I need to know .
It 's a pretty poor thing when , if you can't beat a man on the issues , you try to beat him with his religion .
It is ungentlemanly , it is un-American and , if that old song was right , it 's un-Christian .
It looks like Mike Huckabee is willing to mock a man 's faith and ridicule a church of some 12 million people in order to satisfy his own bigotry and ambition .
And it seems to be working .
The falling dominoes of political success were all started by ridiculing religion .
But that should n't surprise anyone .
In 1998 , at the national convention of Southern Baptist ministers , Mike Huckabee was a featured speaker .
He said some good things – that the family was the basic unit of society – and he said some inspired things – that it is time to “ take America back for Christ . ”
And he pushed a book .
It was titled “ Kids Who Kill : Confronting Our Culture of Violence . ”
Huckabee wrote it with another man and it was published by a company owned by the Baptist Sunday School Board .
A copy was given to all the reporters at the convention .
So was another book .
It was titled “ Mormonism Unmasked : Confronting the Contradictions Between Mormonism and True Christianity . ”
That book was published by the same company that published Mike Huckabee 's book – owned by the same Baptist Sunday School Board .
It was written by a man named R. Philip Roberts who is currently the president of the Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary .
He was recently quoted as saying that evangelicals should oppose Mitt Romney because his election would “ give every ( Mormon ) missionary the calling card of legitimacy . ”
The relevance of Mr. Roberts and his book is that it and its co-authors raise the very question Mike Huckabee is going to pose in this Sunday 's “ New York Times . ”
“ Do n't Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers ? ” Pastor Huckabee claims to ask the question in innocence , but he is n't being honest .
As a Baptist minister , he has been steeped in anti-Mormon rhetoric all of his adult life .
At a convention of fellow ministers at which he spoke , his church - published book was distributed with another church - published book that sought to ridicule Mormons .
When he now essentially quotes from that same book , can he be seen as doing anything other than ridiculing Mormons ?
No , he can't .
So he 's got to decide .
Is he running for evangelist in chief , or commander in chief ?
If he cannot suppress his hostility toward Mormons as a candidate , what makes anyone think he will be able to do so as president .
If he is willing to foment bigotry and hard feeling against a group of people to gain political advantage now , what would he do in the White House ?
And do we really want a president who would bash someone else 's religion for personal gain ?
“ They 'll know we are Christians by our love . ”
Right now , Pastor Huckabee does n't seem to pass that test .
YANGON , Myanmar ( AP ) -- United Nations envoy Ibrahim Gambari left Myanmar Tuesday after talks with the country 's junta chief and pro-democracy leader aimed at ending a brutal crackdown on widespread protests .
Protesters take to the streets on Tuesday despite a military crackdown in Myanmar .

Gambari met Tuesday with Myanmar 's leader Senior General Than Shwe in the country 's isolated capital Naypyidaw before returning to main city Yangon for a second visit with detained democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi , the U.N. said .
The talks with Gen .
Shwe lasted for over an hour and included other junta leaders , the U.N. said .
Gambari is now headed for New York where he will brief U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon on his mission .
Myanmar 's military rulers launched a massive crackdown in Yangon , the former capital , after last week 's pro-democracy demonstrations began to attract tens of thousands of protesters .
Unconfirmed reports say hundreds have been killed as troops broke up them demonstrations led by Myanmar 's Buddhist monks .
Sources inside Myanmar have told CNN that many of Yangon 's monasteries are now deserted .
Gambari has been in Myanmar since Saturday in search of a peaceful resolution to the situation .
His visits to Suu Kyi were a rarity for the Nobel laureate who has been isolated under house arrest for the last four years .
Suu Kyi has been held in varying degrees of detention for 12 of the past 18 years .
Her National League for Democracy won the country 's first free elections in 30 years in 1989 but the military junta refused to hand over power .
Over the weekend , as many as 1,000 people were arrested in Yangon .
The streets are now controlled by police and soldiers who are checking people for cameras and cell phones , witnesses told CNN .
Myanmar soldiers Tuesday continued to surround the campus of AGTI -- a technology school in Yangon -- where about 2,000 people are staging a hunger strike to protest the crackdown , a pro-democracy source told CNN .
The campus strike , which began Friday , includes students , nuns and monks , the source said .
The United States repeatedly has urged China to pressure Myanmar 's military leaders to stop the crackdown on protesters and start talking to pro-democracy leaders , including Suu Kyi .
Myanmar 's foreign minister addressed the U.N. General Assembly Monday , blaming the demonstrations on " political opportunists " and declared that " normalcy has now returned to Myanmar . "
U Nyan Win defended what he called the government 's " seven - step road map " to draft a new constitution and hold elections .
Buddhist monks initiated the demonstrations in August to protest a rise in gasoline prices .
He also said Myanmar 's security personnel have " exercised utmost restraint " and " did not intervene for nearly a month . "
" The situation would not have deteriorated had the initial protest of a small group of activists against the rise in fuel prices not been exploited by political opportunists , " Win said .
" They sought to turn the situation in a political showdown aided and abetted by some powerful countries . "
China , which considers itself the major power in the region , addressed the situation in Myanmar on Monday .
Wang Baodong , a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington , said that his government is concerned -- but he added that the Chinese do not feel the situation rose to the level of international concern .
" China has been working on the various parties in the country , focusing its effort on the prevention of the occurrence of large scale bloody events , " Baodong said .
" We believe this is a domestic issue that does not constitute a threat to the international community . "

Nintendo president Satoru Iwata has expressed in detail the company 's evolving approach to creating new hardware formats , ruling out any early successor to the DS - and suggesting that the traditional five year cycle of new console generations may no longer be relevant .
Following the company 's record half year sales results , an extensive interview with Iwata has been translated into English on the company 's website .
With input from other Nintendo executives , including Shigeru Miyamoto and Shinji Hatano , the questions range over a wide number of topics .
These include maintaining the quality and quantity of software products , the possibility of Nintendo software appearing on mobile phones and a definition for the term " Nintendo - esque " .
Perhaps the most interesting question relates to a potential new generation of portable console after the Nintendo DS .
Although Iwata refused to answer the question directly he did discuss the topic in some detail , starting by saying : " Whenever we have developed one hardware system , we start to discuss what we should do with our next hardware .
In the past , we had a kind of common sense understanding of the video game industry 's platform cycles , like , say , 5 years for home consoles and a little less time for portable devices . "
" I 'm quite doubtful that such a notion of platform cycles can be applied in the future .
As I said at the end of my presentation today , what was believed in this industry to be common sense is not actually an unchangeable truth , " he added .
" So , as we continue our research and study for new hardware , when we will be able to launch a new kind of hardware will actually depend on when we can change entertainment completely , and so have a strong impact on people around the world .
Or , there will certainly be a time when we have to say that we have done everything possible with the current machine , that we can never propose anything new . "
" Lately , I cannot say I 'm making video games on the frontline of development , but as a person who used to develop software , the availability of new hardware means that we possess a new weapon , " said Iwata - who worked as a developer on Nintendo franchises such asandbefore becoming president .
"
We long for a new weapon whenever we cry that we cannot fight anymore with the current weapons .
But today 's situation is such that we are not desperate for any new weapons at all .
Whenever we are working on so - called next generation hardware , we are always thinking in terms of the future , " continued Iwata .
" We need to forecast what the future will be like with the expected evolution of new technologies which are available at any given time , and try to identify the so - called ' sweet spot ' of technology over the next few years . "
" We are always preparing for new hardware so that we can launch whenever we determine we should do so .
However , scheduling for a rather fixed launch date four years from today , regardless of future changes in the industry and the market , appears to be too inflexible an approach to us , " said Iwata .
"
We are always studying and working on what the new hardware must become in the future , but we are also monitoring changes in circumstances in order to act flexibly .
Also , since Nintendo's hardware engineers and software creators are always communicating closely , only when both teams agree that it is time to challenge the market with new hardware that we will launch it . "
Apple Needs a Nikon
Stephen
Fry , whose nascent weblog I linked to just over a month ago , is now writing a weekly technology column for The Guardian .
In his splendid introductory column , “ Welcome to Dork Talk ” , Fry declares his “ preferences and predispositions ” so as to inform readers of his prejudices .
It begins with this regarding Apple , and the importance of design :
So you can guess that I certainly do think design is important .
But it does n’t have to come from Apple .
In fact , I wish to goodness it came from everywhere .
I hope you ’ll believe I ’m not an unthinking slave to Cupertino .
Apple gets plenty of small things wrong , but one big thing it gets right : when you use a device every day , you cannot help , as a human being , but have an emotional relationship with it .
It ’s true of cars and cookers , and it ’s true of computers .
It ’s true of office blocks and houses , and it ’s true of mobiles and satnavs .
A grey box is not good enough , clunky and ugly is not good enough .
Sick building syndrome exists , and so does sick hand - held device syndrome .
Fiddly buttons , blocky icons , sickeningly stupid nested menus — these are the enemy .
The point being that much of what gets chalked up as devotion to / obsession with Apple is , in fact , devotion to / obsession with great design , and there ’s an utter dearth of rival PC or handheld gadget makers that value design as Apple does .
The last time I was truly interested in an operating system that was n’t from Apple was BeOS , and that was over 10 years ago .
Canon ’s cameras are better because there ’s Nikon — and vice - versa .
Canon-vs . - Nikon arguments can get ugly , but in the end , they ’re arguments about two companies that make great cameras and great lenses .
Apple has no such rival .
With cars , design - focused brands like Acura , Audi , BMW , Lexus , Mercedes , and Volvo push each other , and consumers get to choose from well - designed cars with different areas of emphasis .
If Apple is BMW , who is the Audi pushing them to be more elegant , or the Acura or Lexus pushing them to be more reliable ?
The only technology company I can think of that shares Apple ’s emphasis on the emotional design of its hardware and software is Nintendo .
It ’s not that Apple and Nintendo share the same taste ( they do n’t ) , but that they have taste , and express that taste boldly and confidently in nearly everything they produce .
Too bad Nintendo and Apple do n’t compete against each other .
1
The Zune is interesting in that Microsoft seems to be trying to learn from the iPod — which is in stark contrast to other iPod competitors , most of which seem to be designed in some alternate universe where the iPod never existed and the consumer electronics industry remains unchanged from the 1990s , an era when “ fiddly buttons , blocky icons , sickeningly stupid nested menus ” ( as Fry has it ) were the best one could do .
But the Zune is disappointing , because Microsoft simply copied Apple ’s products rather than doing what they should have done — and what all companies hoping to compete against Apple should do — which is copy Apple ’s culture and passion for original design .
I get the sense that many of these companies see Apple ’s success this decade as an aberration — that the Apple bubble will soon pop and mediocre jumbles will return to the top of the technology heap .
But what if it ’s the other way around , and the aberration was Apple ’s tepid success in the 1990s ?
It ’s not just us — technology - design obsessed consumers — who would benefit from at least one company stepping up and competing against Apple on Apple ’s own ground .
Apple would too , in that competition would push them to do even better , and act as a preventative against hubris .
( CNN ) --
When China 's lunar orbiter blasted off last month , there was not a cheer or smile or a " whoo - haaa " to be had in mission control .
Taikonaut Fei Junlong exits the re-entry capsule of China 's second manned spacecraft on October 17 , 2005 .
Perhaps because for the government scientists , it was just another small step in an ambitious space program which could ultimately see a Chinese space station orbiting the Earth , a Chinese moon colony and a joint China - Russia explorer on Mars .
If all goes well , and so far it has , the Chang'e 1 will spend the next year orbiting the moon , mapping the surface and looking for resources .
Next , the Chinese hope to send an unmanned rover to the moon by 2012 , with a robotic mission to bring back samples by 2017 .
Officials have recently backpedaled from goals of putting a taikonaut ( the Chinese version of an astronaut or cosmonaut ) on the moon by 2020 , but analysts believe that is still a pressing ambition .
" If China can go to the moon , eventually with a manned program , it will represent the ultimate achievement for China in making itself essentially the second most important space power , accomplishing what even the Soviets had not , " says Dean Cheng , a China military analyst for CNA , a private research corporation .
Watch China 's lunar rocket blast off »
According to Cheng , the Chinese are now embarking on a systematic space program the world has not seen since the 1960's and for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union , the United States is facing real competition .
That may explain why the head of NASA , Michael Griffin , recently warned that " China will be back on the moon before we are . . .
I think when that happens Americans will not like it . "
China 's space milestones »
But there could be a lot more at stake than just lunar boasting rights .
It 's unlikely the Chinese will land at Tranquility Base and pull down the Stars and Stripes .
But the goal could be mining resources .
One powerful , potential fuel source is helium - 3 .
Helium - 3 originated from the sun and was deposited in the moon 's soil by the solar wind .
It is estimated there are up to two million tons on the moon , and virtually none on Earth .
" If we can ever get helium - 3 and helium - 3 to fuse together it is what we call nuclear power without nuclear waste -- there is no radioactivity associated with that reactor , " says Professor Gerald Kulcinski , an expert in helium from the University of Wisconsin .
The key though , says Kulcinski , will be developing a fusion reactor , which he says could be done within 15 to 20 years , in tandem with a program to establish a permanent human presence on the moon .
Just four tons of helium - 3 would be enough to supply all the power needs for the United States for a year , two shuttle payloads according to Kulcinski .
Analysts believe the lure of such potent resources is one of the reasons behind China 's exploration of space .
State media reported last month details of a new rocket with enough thrust to put a space station into orbit .
When it 's developed , the Long March 5 will have almost three times the power of existing rockets .
China has long wanted to be part of the international space station , but has always been denied , partly it 's believed because of U.S. concerns .
But that may not be a problem for the Chinese if they can send their own space station into orbit , reportedly by 2020 .
But again the Chinese are sending mixed messages , saying no firm date has been decided .
More immediately , there are plans a for televised space walk by three taikonauts next year , according to the Shanghai Daily .
At a recent news conference Pei Zhaoyu from China 's space administration repeated at least three times that " China has always adhered to the principle of peaceful use of outer space . "
But he made no mention of China 's satellite killer missile which was tested earlier this year , destroying an aging Chinese weather satellite in low Earth orbit .
That and the fact that China 's space administration is controlled by the military has many in Washington worried about where the Chinese are heading .
Technologically , the Chinese are still behind the United States , but analysts warn that might not be the case for much longer .
" The Chinese have the advantage of a centralized decision - making authority where they can say we will do that and we will apply those funds , " says Cheng , while pointing out that NASA is at the mercy of Congress , politics and a new president in 2009 who may have new goals and ambitions .
China has always insisted that it's not in a space race with any country , especially the United States -- but it is on a slow , relentless march to the moon , and beyond .

To put those numbers in perspective a little , the NYT had an article in January on power costs around the nation , noting that costs in Chicago in 2006 varied from $ 0.01 to $ 0.365 per kWh with an average around $ 0.0825 , and in New York from down around $ 0.01 , to up around $ 0.50 , with an average of around $ 0.14 ( estimating from the graph ) .
( The cost varies with season and time of day ) .
( Oh and , for Gail , it takes around 12 kWh per ton to mine coal , if you want a baseline average number ) .
Solar costs about 25 cents a kilowatt hour .
That 's compared to about 9 cents a kilowatt hour for natural gas and 5 cents a kilowatt hour for modern coal - burning plants , as well as 6 cents a kilowatt hour for wind energy if tax considerations are included .
The good news is that the cost of solar power is falling all the time .
It once stood at $ 1 a kilowatt hour and advocates say that it could soon cost 12 - 16 cents a kilowatt hour .
Over this past week the editorial has continued to ferment in the back of my mind .
I very much agree with the opening comments about the invisibility that is usually the miners ’ lot , and the neglect that mining issues usually get in the Congress .
But from that point on it takes an unmistakable tack against the industry .
Why should this be of concern ?
Well consider , for a second , these costs , which I got from the Energy Insider this week .
When I started posting to this site , one of the last things that I intended was to become an apologist for either the mining or petroleum industries .
I worry however , sometimes , that if there is only one side of a debate being given visibility , then , by default , a public picture is painted that may not reflect reality , and which may in the future have unfortunate consequences .
The immediate cause of the comment was the Jeff Goodell ’s editorial in the Post last weekend .
And while I recognize that editorials have different rules , nevertheless the choice of adjectives in describing the various participants and activities leaves little doubt as to which side of the line the story falls .
In the WaPo article , Jeff comments that
Politically , the war in Iraq has been a boon for coal , allowing coal - friendly politicians to tout America 's 250 - year supply as a substitute for our addiction to Middle Eastern oil -- even though , in the real world , there is no overlap between coal ( used to generate electricity ) and oil ( used for transportation fuels , among other things ) .
And while this is superficially true ( less than 2 % of oil goes toward major power generation in the United States – more perhaps in other countries ) , it perhaps skips a fuel of concern – natural gas .
There has been a considerable discussion in these pages about the coming problems in the supply of natural gas , and since it has been used increasingly in electricity generation in recent years , while concurrently it plays a significant role in oil production – whether in the Canadian oil sands or the production of oil in Iran .
And as natural gas becomes in increasingly short supply on this continent , the impact that this has on both industries is likely to make that evident .
And , with his indulgence , it is appropriate to include a comment from Westexas near the bottom of Euan 's post last week .
I just got off the phone with an acquaintance of mine , in a diplomatic service , who has considerable knowledge of Saudi Arabia .
He actually leans toward the mostly voluntary decline scenario , but in any case , he said that because of severe shortfalls in natural gas production , about 500,000 bpd of liquids production over the next two years will be diverted to power plants and desalination plants .
This is why the Saudis are talking about importing coal .
In electricity generation coal , like nuclear power , is more commonly used for baseload generation , while natural gas is more for times of high demand , since it can be more easily brought on line and , later , turned off .
However , as natural gas supply becomes more in question , then something will have to replace those generators .
It is a debate that is facing an increasing number of communities around the country as increasing electricity demand begins to strain existing resources .
( Anecdotal story - in discussing load shedding with a group of students this week , suggesting that it would be a future concern as they graduated and moved to manage industries that would see this in years ahead , several commented that they had seen it required by the utility several times , in the places that they worked this summer – suggesting that we are closer to a power generation problem than I thought , given that this is a form of demand destruction ) .
The cheapest alternative would appear to be coal .
The price differential between it and competing sources would still appear to be sufficiently large as to accommodate the cost increases that would be required for flue gas treatment and carbon sequestration ( which as I noted in the past , could likely double the energy cost per kWh ) .
Yet , while there is a lot of talk about doing something , there has been little action .
This is , perhaps understandable .
Politicians are not going to be wildly enthusiastic about imposing laws that their opponents can then wave on TV as being responsible for a doubling of power costs .
You have only to see the current waves of outrage from existing increases in power costs to understand that .
Unfortunately this is not the only consequence .
The cost of new mines , power stations and transmission lines continues to increase significantly .
If there is a question as to whether the major investments that companies are going to have to make to create those facilities will not be rewarded , then the investments will not be made .
The energy industry has been burned before ( remember the investments made in oil shale as an example ) .
Thus they seek some guarantee that the investments that they make will at least have some return .
It is a matter of perception as to whether this is just prudent management or , as Jeff puts it :
This is not to say that the coal industry would not dearly love to get into America 's gas tank .
In recent months , it has pushed hard for subsidies and tax breaks that would accelerate the construction of coal - to - liquid plants , a technology developed by the Nazis during the 1930s that can transform coal into liquid fuels such as diesel
As the NRC study noted , for an industry that is fundamental to the current life - style of the country , the research investment whether for mine safety , better mining technologies , or better use technologies is sadly lacking .
This is in part , because the industry itself is quite small ( in physical numbers of people ) and for the past couple of decades has been more concerned with keeping costs down so that it can compete with other fuels , than it has been on focusing on better technologies , which usually have a longer - time payback .
And sadly comments such as
But we 've been mining coal in this country for 150 years -- all the simple , high - quality , easy - to - get stuff is gone .
What 's left is buried beneath towns and national parks , or places that are difficult , expensive and dangerous to mine .
get accepted , even when they are obviously untrue ( Wyoming coal as a simple example ) .
They set a tone for public perception , and when the light switch no longer works , somehow it wo n’t be their fault .
I had just put this post aside as being done , when the Washington Post ran another story on Tuesday about the impacts that the debate is having on plans for coal plants .
In early August , Mayor John Engen ( D ) won city council support to buy electricity from a new coal - fired plant scheduled to begin operation in 2011 .
He said the city government would save money on its electric bills .
But three weeks later , Engen pulled out of the deal after receiving hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from constituents upset that Missoula would contribute to the creation of a coal plant and concerned about what the town would do if the plant never got built .
The debate is , therefore already having consequences .
And while I am sure that there are a fair number of folk that are glad to see this , one of the issues that concerns us here is the rate at which the energy supply to the world is going to change .
The relative size of the problem and the large gap between the reality of what solar and wind power can currently achieve , and that needed ( look for example at the numbers at the top of this post ) gets neglected in a rosy view of the future that might be better reviewed by going back and looking at what happened the last time we had a problem with fuel in the winter , in the North - East .
I will however , apologize to Senator Reid , since I did comment just up - page that no politician would force a rise in utility prices , giving his opponent ammunition for a debate .
The Senator has just done that
Last month , after a speech in Reno , Reid said he was opposed to new coal - fired plants anywhere .
" There 's not a coal - fired plant in America that 's clean .
They 're all dirty , " Reid told reporters after speaking at a conference on renewable energy .
He said that the United States should turn to wind , solar and geothermal power in an effort to slow climate change .
" Unless we do something quickly about global warming , we 're in trouble , " he said .
Reid 's opposition to coal plants is the latest in a series of new obstacles for power companies seeking to use the fuel to generate electricity .
A combination of rising construction costs , state mandates for the use of renewable energy and lawsuits by environmental organizations have forced many utilities to drop or postpone coal projects this summer .
We are thus not going to get as well prepared as we perhaps need to be , and since there is a foreseeable consequence if natural gas supplies fade as they seem fated to , it may press the reality of the debate a little earlier than might otherwise be the case .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate Judiciary Committee may seek testimony from controversial prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald about the obstruction of justice case against vice presidential aide Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , two senators said on Sunday .
Sen .
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican member of the committee , said he wanted to hear from Fitzgerald because , “ I still have n’t figured out what that case is all about . ”
Libby , the one - time top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney , was found guilty in March of obstructing an investigation into who blew the cover of a CIA analyst whose husband had criticized the Iraq war .
Libby was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison , but President George W. Bush commuted the sentence , angering many Democrats and some Republicans .
Sen . Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , has called for the Judiciary Committee to seek Fitzgerald ’s testimony on the matter .
“ Reluctant as I am to agree with Senator Schumer , I think he ’s right , ” Specter said on CNN ’s “ Late Edition ” .
“ Why were they pursuing the matter long after there was no underlying crime on the outing of the CIA agent ?
Why were they pursuing it after we knew who the leaker was ? ”
Specter said .
Sen . Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee , said that with Specter ’s blessing , Fitzgerald would likely be called .
“ If he has no objection to Mr. Fitzgerald coming forward , I think you may very well see Mr. Fitzgerald before the Senate Judiciary Committee , ” Leahy said on the same CNN program .
Fitzgerald ’s critics point out no one was ever charged with leaking the CIA agent ’s name and the prosecutor pursued Libby long after he knew who had provided her name to the press .
But others said obstruction of justice was a serious crime and Fitzgerald was right to continue the case .
Leahy said he saw no point in summoning Libby himself because “ his silence has been bought and paid for . ”
The popular DVD ripper aXXo is a BitTorrent cult figure , despised by some , worshiped by others .
An estimated one million people download aXXo 's rips every month and his name is among the most searched keywords on all BitTorrent sites .
Not surprisingly , rumors start to spread when there is no official aXXo release for a while .
The last official aXXo torrent was uploaded November 11 , after that is has been awfully quiet .
So what happened , did he get caught , is he tired of releasing DVDrips , did he have an accident ?
It turns out that aXXo is not gone for good , he just decided to take a break .
ADL 242 , an administrator on Darkside RG , the official home of aXXo explains : “ aXXo told us that he has decided to take a break , so you will not see new aXXo torrents anywhere for a while .
Please show your support by keeping his torrents alive until he comes back , as always , he will post here first when he does . ”
This is not the first time that aXXo has taken some time off .
Last year aXXo temporarily stopped uploading movies because a website named axxotorrents.com was trying to profit from his name .
A few weeks after that the site went down and aXXo continued releasing DVDrips .
Earlier this month aXXo caused a stir when he deleted all his torrents from The Pirate Bay website .
Apparently aXXo was n’t very happy with the way The Pirate Bay handled his complaints , and decided to not release his torrents there anymore .
Unfortunately , aXXo ’s popularity has downsides too .
We ’ve seen that anti-piracy organizations use his name to trap people into downloading fake files , and malware peddlers use the aXXo brand to spread their infested software .
At this point is is not clear how long aXXo will be inactive , his fans can only pray , and hope the he will return soon .
KDE 4.0 is very exciting , though not yet production ready , and that shows with this weeks ' release of the first beta .
It 's a beta release for a major software project ( using the traditional definition of beta , and not Google 's it 's - production - ready - but - we - don't - want - to - support - it - officially - yet definition of beta ) and thus , it comes complete with bugs , crashes , missing artwork , and other goodies one would expect such as new code , new technologies and fun toys .
For those of you who are unaware , KDE is one of the largest open source projects ever conceived .
A major milestone release such as 4.0 is a long time in the making .
Here follows a number of things to look forward to for those of you brave enough to try this early beta :
Qt 4.3 : The entire KDE project has been ported to use Trolltech 's Qt 4.3 , which in itself is a major undertaking .
Qt has always been the foundation of the KDE project , and KDE 4.0 takes advantage of many of the new technologies that this powerful C++ toolkit brings .
One more notable improvement to Qt is the widget painting system which is now fully anti-aliased , with support for SVG graphics , and a new canvas to provide nearly unlimited power to those doing layouts .
The improvements that happened in Qt 4.x are numerous to the point where they would warrant a journal article of their own just to describe them , but one of the most important is that Qt is now modular , meaning you can now write terminal based Qt applications without having to link to all of the higher level graphics code to write a simple utility .
This separation of the backend classes from the graphical components has spilled over into KDE as well , with kdelibs being heavily reworked to allow the use of things such as KIO Slaves ( KDE 's flexible , network transparent protocol handling ) at the command line , if so desired .
KSysGuard with SVG graphics KSysGuard with SVG graphics
Portability improvements : the KDE 4 libraries and applications are no longer tied to a specific platform .
KDE has always had the goal of maintaining portability across UNIX and UNIX - like environment , but even there it has had a dependency on X .
The main cause for this dependency was that Qt was only available under the GPL for the X platform .
Since Qt 4.0 was released some time ago , Qt is now available under the GPL for all four major platforms ( X , OS X , Windows , and embedded framebuffers ) .
This releases most of the KDE code from its requirement on X , except for those components that are inseparably linked to that windowing system .
KWin , the screensavers , KDM , and a few other KDE components including the new Plasma workspace environment will remain X only ; applications like Konqueror , Amarok , Kstars and more will all be portable to a large degree .
Ross McKillop has created a visual tour of how to get KDE up and running under OS X , and a similar effort is underway for Windows .
A new build system : since KDE was founded in 1996 , it has used the autotools build system to construct the whole project .
However , the project had to make a number of extensions to the system in order to allow KDE to compile many of the autogenerated files , and it got to the point where a simple KDE " Hello , World ! " application would ship 200 kb of build system .
This complexity made entry into the KDE programming world somewhat daunting for new programmers , and the build system for the core components of KDE was only really understood by a select handful of individuals .
For 4.0 , KDE has totally dumped autotools in favour of the CMake build system , which is easier to use and understand , but also introduces a number of portability benefits .
For example , CMake is able to automatically use KDE 's build system to generate project files for a number of IDEs , including KDE 's own KDevelop , commercial IDEs such as Visual Studio , and many others ..
New multimedia framework : Since KDE 2.0 , KDE has relied on the aRts multimedia system for decoding audio files and related activities .
However , aRts was not an ideal solution , being somewhat unmaintained as well as making the coding of multimedia applications more complex than need be .
By the end of the 3.x development cycle , most of the more powerful multimedia applications were circumventing aRts and using audio libraries such as Xine , Mplayer , or Gstreamer directly .
This meant that each KDE application was independently reimplementing their multimedia functions on top of a lower level library , which is not ideal when it comes to code reuse .
For KDE 4.0 , the developers have introduced a new multimedia API called Phonon that simply acts as a layer that sits on top of the lower level libraries such as Xine or Gstreamer .
This API makes it trivial to use audio or video from any application you can think of , and future proofs KDE against changes in the underlying multimedia libraries .
An application can now simply tell the API that it wants to play a sound and Phonon will make the appropriate calls to whatever backend is available on the system , be it Xine or Gstreamer or similar on UNIX , to Quicktime on OS X , or DirectX Audio under Windows .
The Xine backend works on the UNIX systems including OS X , and is likely to be the best supported backend for KDE 4.0 , although others will likely be available .
There are rumours within the community that the Phonon API is so desired that a version of it will be making its way into Qt in future releases .
Oxygen artwork and theming : KDE 4.0 is getting a complete facelift , and much of that work is visible in the beta , albeit in a somewhat unpolished state .
The artwork is now fully vector based wherever possible , including a new set of icons from the Oxygen team , new graphics for the KDE Games and KDE Education application sets , new cursors , and more .
Also included in this beta is early code for the new window decorations and widget styles , which are still being heavily revised to give KDE a professional yet visually appealing default appearance .
One of the benefits of Qt 4 is that widgets can now be themed using a CSS - derived stylesheet .
KDE is adopting a theme creation program which should allow the KDE artwork community to create a wide array of new and exciting appearances with ease .
A new workspace : one of the most anticipated projects within KDE is the Plasma workspace , which replaces the existing desktop metaphor that has long existed within KDE .
This new project is included in the beta , but would be considered one of the more unstable portions at this point as it is still under extremely active development .
When complete , it will replace the existing KDE desktop and panel with a totally new system that is scriptable , extensible , and should run a wide array of applets ( called plasmoids ) from task managers to desktop widgets .
There is even an OS X Dashboard widget compatibility layer that is rumoured to be in the works for a future KDE version .
In this early beta , Plasma is usable , but barely .
The full functionality of the existing panel has not yet been fully replaced , so there is a notable gap there .
However , it already replaces most of the desktop functions , including things like the run dialog , task manager , screensaver activation , and more .
Plasma Plasma
Composite effects : KWin , the window manager , has seen work to bring it up to par with the effects that people have come to expect from compositing window managers such as Compiz Fusion .
The infrastructure and some effects are now in place , assuming your video card drivers support OpenGL and X.org 's Composite extension .
One of the main advantages to doing these effects in KWin versus using another window manager is that they are all well integrated into KDE , and the window manager has a sane fail - over mode , whereupon it will deactivate effects on video cards that do not support them , leaving you with a perfectly usable and well - tested window manager .
KWin has now seen testing for nearly a decade and pretty much every corner case has been solved .
In this beta , many effects are already available , although some may be disabled for KDE 4.0 as the artwork needs to be polished .
For example , for the ' burn down ' windows effect , the window collapses , but the artwork for the flame itself is still missing .
A new file manager : Konqueror will be back to its previous tricks , being KDE 's integrated viewer for the Web and other Documents , as well as maintaining its existing functionality as a file manager for those who cannot part with it .
However , KDE has also introduced a new default file manager called Dolphin .
It has been designed from the ground up to be a powerful program that offers all of the advanced features that are needed from a dedicated file manager , while presenting a better organized user interface .
The work that has gone into Dolphin is quite visible in the beta , including the new file view components that are shared between Dolphin , Konqueror and the File -> Open / Save dialogs .
Dolphin Dolphin
This release is an early beta , but the level of stability ( or lack thereof ) is an indication of the development cycle .
The KDE core APIs were only frozen a week before the beta source code was tagged , and as a result , some of the coders were rushing to get their API changes in before the freeze lest they be stuck maintaining a bad function or two throughout the entire KDE 4.x life cycle .
Also , keep in mind that KDE 4.0 is not the end of the 4.x series .
Most of the work has gone into the foundation libraries , with a little visible work happening with artwork , effects , and a few programs .
Much of KDE , however , has simply been ported from KDE 3.5 and it will take some time before all applications are truly taking advantage of the new architecture .
This beta is unstable but clearly shows the progress happening for 4.0 .
The beta contains many more new and exciting things , and for those who
are willing to bleed a little ( or a lot ) , there are a number of ways to
get a copy of this release .
Distributions such as Gentoo , Kubuntu , OpenSuse
and Mandriva have all produced packages for this release ( along with a
decent set of caveats ) .
OpenSuse also produces a KDE 4 live CD
for those who are little more trepidatious about installing beta
software on their systems .
Details on obtaining this beta for testing are
included in the full announcement , found at KDE.org .
Author : Bush nominee helped mask FBI 's pre-9/11 failures and kept al Qaeda 's infiltration of US intelligence from view Peter Lance
Published : Tuesday September 25 , 2007
Print This Email This
This is the first of two op / ed exposes by Peter Lance , the best - selling author of Triple Cross , which will be released by HarperCollins in a new edition next month .
In the coverage of Michael B. Mukasey , President Bush 's nominee to replace Alberto Gonzales , the line in his resume that has resonated the most with the media is his experience presiding over the 1995 terrorism trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman .
The blind Sheikh , a top al Qaeda confederate who was cited in the infamous Crawford Texas PDB just weeks before 9/11 , was convicted with nine others in the so - called " Day of Terror Plot " to blow up New York 's bridges and tunnels , the U.N. and the FBI 's New York office .
Citing the trial in a Sept. 20 New York Times piece that lionized the ex-judge , reporter Adam Liptak described how Mukasey , with " a few terse , stern and prescient remarks , " sentenced the blind sheik to life in prison : " Judge Mukasey said he feared the plot could have produced devastation on ' a scale unknown in this country since the Civil War ' that would make the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , which had left six people dead , ' almost insignificant by comparison . ' "
Liptak was correct in citing the 1993 Twin Towers bombing in his story , but he failed to mention that the " Day of Terror " trial was really a desperate attempt by the FBI 's New York office and prosecutors for the Southern District of New York ( Mukasey 's old office ) to mop up after their failure to stop the blind Sheikh 's " jihad army " prior to its first two attacks on U.S. soil : the murder of Rabbi Meier Kahane in 1990 and the Trade Center bombing on Feb. 26 , 1993 .
Worse , during the 1995 trial , Judge Mukasey helped bury the significance of Ali A , Mohamed , a shadowy figure who was working at the time for both Osama bin Laden and the FBI .
If Mohamed had been called to the stand and cross -examined in open court , defense lawyers could have ripped open the scandal of how the FBI failed to stop the first Trade Center attack .
More important , they could have exposed the depth and breadth of al Qaeda 's shocking plan to attack America , six years before 9/11 .
Al Qaeda 's master spy An ex-Egyptian Army intelligence officer , Mohamed succeeded in infiltrating the CIA in 1984 , the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg from 1987 - 89 and the FBI itself -- where he served as an informant on the West Coast from 1992 .
Known to his jihadi brothers as " Ali Amiriki , " aka " Ali the American , " Mohamed not only moved bin Laden and his entourage from Afghanistan to the Sudan in 1991 but he set up most of al Qaeda 's training camps in Khartoum , trained Osama 's personal bodyguard , and literally wrote the " manual on terror . "
Mohamed actually slipped Dr. Ayman al - Zawahiri -- bin Laden 's number two -- into the US on a fund raising tour of US mosques in the early 1990s .
This feat of deception was roughly the equivalent of a German spy smuggling Heinrich Himmler , the head of Hitler 's dreaded S.S. , into America at the dawn of World War II to raise deutschmarks on a tour of German - American churches .
All of this is chronicled in my book Triple Cross , due out in an updated edition from HarperCollins next month .
The book flings the door open on a closet in Judge Mukasey 's past -- a dark little room where one enormous skeleton lives .
It 's the story of how New York prosecutors Andrew McCarthy and Patrick Fitzgerald ( later CIA leak Special Prosecutor ) went out of their way to keep Ali Mohamed out of the " Day of Terror " trial .
Why would they do that ?
Because Mohamed had penetrated three of the Big Five intelligence agencies , and defense attorneys like Roger L. Stavis believe that once he was on the stand , under oath , the truth would have come out .
" In Ali Mohamed , " says Stavis , " You have a man that 's working for us and being paid by us at the same time as he 's working for Osama bin Laden who is the greatest enemy that this country has had since 1941 .
We had him , and he played us ...
The last thing federal prosecutors wanted back in 1995 was to have that story exposed . "
Training the " jihad army "
At the time , the Feds were in possession of shocking evidence that Mohamed had trained two of the very members of the " jihad army " sitting in front of Judge Mukasey 's bench : El Sayyid Nosair , the pill - popping Egyptian emigre who 'd murdered Kahane four years earlier , and Clement Rodney Hampton - El , a U.S. Muslim and Afghan war veteran known as " Dr. Rashid . "
Worse , as we 'll see , the FBI had those two terrorists under surveillance from as early as 1989 , when they 'd also begun tracking additional Ali Mohamed trainees : Mahmoud Abouhalima , a six foot two inch red-headed Egyptian cab driver , Mohammed Salameh , a diminutive Palestinian , and Nidal Ayyad , a Kuwaiti Rutgers grad , all three of them later convicted in the WTC bombing .
So the potential for " blowback " and embarrassment to the Feds was enormous -- holding open the potential of derailing the " Day of Terror " prosecution itself .
And if those revelations were n't enough to inspire federal prosecutors to hide their " informant , " Mohamed -- who 'd been captured in 1993 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police trying to smuggle an al Qaeda terrorist into the US -- was later released on the word of an FBI agent .
Once set loose , he began to plan the devastating East African Embassy bombings executed in 1998 .
After getting sprung from the Mounties on the word of Special Agent John Zent , Mohamed traveled to Kenya where he took the surveillance pictures of the US Embassy that Osama bin Laden personally approved in 1994 , pinpointing the precise spot where a truck bomb would detonate four years later , killing 212 .
Mohamed himself would later run the Kenyan bombing cell while he commuted back and forth to the US , all the while keeping in touch with New York prosecutors and FBI agents on both coasts .
Ali 's first sit down with the Feds In December , 1994 , as he was setting up the Embassy bombing cell , Mohamed was summoned back to his home in Santa Clara , California for a meeting with Andy McCarthy and FBI agent Harlan Bell .
The Feds had deemed him so important to the upcoming trial that he'd been named as an un-indicted co-conspirator along with bin Laden himself .
At the time , Roger L. Stavis , Nosair 's attorney , was prepping a subpoena to compel Ali 's testimony .
" I wanted him , " Stavis told me for Triple Cross , " and I tried everything to find him . "
Jack Cloonan , the ex-FBI agent who later debriefed Mohamed after his 1998 arrest , noted that " If Ali would have been put on [ the stand ] at that point in time , [ he ] would have been viewed as an agent provocateur ...
Maybe there would have been an issue of entrapment raised .
It would n't have helped the Government 's case ...
That subpoena became " a huge , huge issue for Ali " as well .
Stavis was prepared to argue that the Feds had been winking at Mohamed for years as he trained the Sheikh 's " army " to wreak havoc for the Jihad in New York City .
But after McCarthy 's Santa Clara sit down with him , Ali mysteriously went missing .
Later , Ibrahim El - Gabrowny , Nosair 's cousin and a " Day of Terror " co-defendant , argued in an appeal that Ali had told him to his face that the Feds had urged him to duck the subpoena .
McCarthy denies this , but he stayed in touch with Mohamed after their Santa Clara meeting and Ali never showed up at trial .
Mukasey jokes about " the missing witness "
In the course of the proceedings , unable to produce the phantom spy , Stavis had shown a videotape of Ali shot at Fort Bragg , in which he was literally training top Green Beret officers .
While an active duty U.S. Army sergeant , Mohamed had been commuting on weekends up from North Carolina to New York , where he schooled Nosair , Hampton - El , Abouhalima , Salameh and Ayyad in small arms and automatic weapons training .
Before leaving Fort Bragg , Ali would rifle the files at the JFK Special Warfare Center , stealing intelligence to pass on to his al Qaeda " brothers " in New York , including top secret memos from the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
He would stay at Nosair 's house in Cliffside Park , N.J. , where FBI agents later recovered the highly secure documents the night of the Kahane murder .
One memo , which can be downloaded from my website , even contained the positions of all Special Forces and Navy SEAL units worldwide on Dec. 5 , 1988 -- a nugget of intel that the Soviets would have paid a fortune for at the height of the Cold War .
As I noted in Triple Cross : El Sayyid Nosair 's attorney Roger Stavis was doing his best to keep Mohamed 's presence alive in the " Day of Terror " case .
On Sept. 1 , 1995 , an exasperated Stavis requested a " missing witness instruction [ to the jury ] with regard to Ali Mohamed . "
He reminded Judge Michael B. Mukasey that " Mohamed , was the person who came from Fort Bragg , North Carolina , who was assigned to the United States Army Special Forces . "
At that point the judge quipped , " Yes , we saw him on that splendid videotape . "
But Stavis countered , " When we attempted to find Ali Mohamed , we could not bring him in . "
Yet Mohamed was in the country during much of the eight - month trial .
According to an affidavit filed by the FBI after his 1998 arrest , Mohamed had two meetings with DIS investigators in August 1995 and one on November 8th .
In each instance he was home in Santa Clara .
Under federal law , a trial judge has the discretion to give a missing witness instruction " if a party has it peculiarly within his power to produce witnesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction . "
If such a person does not appear and one of the parties -- the Feds in this case -- has some special ability to produce him , the law permits the jury to draw an inference , namely that the missing witness would have given testimony damaging to that party .
Ali Mohamed was an un-indicted co-conspirator .
Judge Mukasey was aware of his infiltration of the US Army at Fort Bragg .
Andy McCarthy had visited him in the presence of an FBI agent within months of the trial .
So Stavis had every right to expect that jury charge .
Mukasey 's response ?
" I do n't think a missing witness charge on that gentleman is warranted and I am not going to give one . "
By Oct. 1 , 1995 , the issue of Mohamed 's absence in the trial was rendered moot .
Characterized by the New York Times as " the biggest terrorism trial in US history , " it ended with guilty verdicts for Sheikh Rahman and the nine remaining co-defendants .
AUSAs McCarthy , Fitzgerald , and Robert Khuzami even succeeded in convicting El Sayyid Nosair for the murder of Meier Kahane .
The skeleton in Mukasey 's closet
Why does it matter now that Judge Mukasey , touted by the New York Times for his prowess as an anti-terror judge , made light of Ali Mohamed 's failure to show at the " Day of Terror " trial ?
Because if Ali had testified , lawyers like Stavis would have ripped the lid off the years of failure by the FBI to stop bin Laden 's juggernaut .
Al Qaeda 's capabilities , their bench strength and sheer resolve to strike again at New York might have been exposed years before 9/11 , giving other agencies like CIA and DIA a chance to examine the intel being gathered by Bureau agents in this country .
At a minimum , Mohamed 's exposure at trial would have blown his cover as a double agent and interdicted his supervision of the Embassy bombing cell .
But Judge Mukasey , the man President Bush wants to run the Justice Department , did n't want to tip the jury to the significance of his absence .
Tomorrow in part two of Peter Lance 's RAW STORY exclusive , he 'll describe how Judge Mukasey 's decision not to call Ali Mohamed at the " Day of Terror " trial kept the media and the public in the dark on why the FBI failed to stop the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 .

The first thing I noticed about boot camp was the sterility .
No garbage anywhere on the grounds ; grass neatly cut , sidewalks trimmed ; barracks painted bright white with no visible blemishes .
Stepford clean , as were the drill sergeants in their pressed fatigues and mirror - shined boots , displaying erect postures and crisp gaits .
The moment we trainees got off the bus , we were sucked directly into this sterile world , not making a single move without permission .
At first , I was startled and a little afraid .
I was 19 , and had never experienced such stark , aggressive conditions .
And the drill sergeants were very aggressive from the start , in our faces , practically daring us to change our blank expressions .
Eventually , they would let up , each establishing his own barking rhythm and pace .
But for that first week , they were a solid wall of sound , breaking down our civilian minds and attitudes in preparation for years of receiving and executing orders .
Once I got past the initial shock of wondering why in hell I enlisted , I began to really enjoy Army life .
Even the 4:30 AM two - mile run before chow did n't faze me .
I loved feeling my body gaining strength and stamina ; and I repeated with gusto the various cadences our drill sergeants yelled out to keep us all in sync , whether we were running or marching :
Those last two lines perplexed me ( " commie scum " was sometimes " Charlie scum " ) , since the Vietnam war had ended a few years before .
But ' Nam was still very much in the air , since many of our drill sergeants were combat vets of that imperial assault .
Still , I shouted that I , too , wanted to go to Vietnam and kill commie scum .
The whole thing electrified me .
I was definitely into being a soldier .
As basic training went on , I sank deeper into my new persona .
I became proficient with the M - 16 and M - 60 machine guns .
I loved firing LAWs and throwing live grenades .
Even when we were exposed to tear gas without masks , I enjoyed the burning in my eyes , nostrils , and mouth , and there was a contest between a handful of us to see who could hold out longest before throwing up , which many of us did .
All the while , our drill sergeants pushed us , encouraged us , made us feel like warriors .
It was a real high .
I can see why taking this and more specialized training into an actual war zone would bond you with your fellow soldiers .
I would n't call it brainwashing , but it 's awfully close .
For us , however , there was no war waiting on the other end of basic .
Yet , we trained for one anyway , complete with bivouac and night maneuvers .
During one night patrol , which came around 2 AM , our unit crept outside of a mock Vietnamese village leftover from the war period , looking for enemy movement .
We were in a dense wood , slowly advancing , when I hit a trip wire .
" Private Perrin , " my drill sergeant said , " you are now a casualty of war . " " What happened , drill sergeant ? " " That trip wire is connected to a claymore mine , which has just blown your chest open .
You are dead .
" My afterlife was a waiting area near our camp , standing around with other dead soldiers from different patrols .
I was pissed off and embarrassed to have died .
I did n't even get a chance to fire my weapon !
It was all very frustrating .
The remainder of boot camp was a downhill run .
( It was funny to see new recruits come into camp , their nervous postures and expressions a reminder of our first days . )
As we neared graduation and our individual paths to active duty , we were Total Army all the way .
I got to know one of my drill sergeants a bit more personally , a guy who trained with 101st Rangers and could climb a rope faster than any human I 've ever seen .
He was a recovering alcoholic and bar room brawler who found solace and direction in the Army , his one regret being that he enlisted too late to fight in Vietnam , and he clearly desired a war of his own .
He predicted ( hoped ) that Cuba would be the next front , and mentioned a few countries in Central America that I had never heard of , one of which , Nicaragua , had just experienced a leftist revolution .
He was direct , to the point , honest .
He suggested that I become an officer , that I would do much better there than as a mere enlisted non-com .
I was flattered , but did n't see myself wearing bars .
Still , I liked him , and it was he who taught me how to shoot .
I 'm still a pretty good shot , which I say not to brag , but to show how those lessons remain over a quarter century later .
He was perhaps my first real mentor .
I never saw him again after graduation .
The fist - pumping , chest - thumping pride I felt as an active duty soldier dissipated over time .
Thanks to the direct exposure I had to officers from various U.S. client states at a training school where I worked , my young mind was slowly opened to what was really going on in Central America .
There were Honduran officers who casually joked about killing insurgents and the peasants who housed them .
The same was true of Salvadoran officers .
Since we were all on the " same side , " they felt no reason to candy - coat the mass killing and repression that was then underway in that region , and their desire to murder anyone they deemed communist had a delayed but very serious effect on me .
That 's when I began reading about Central America .
And the more I read ( from sources across the political divide ) , the more I lost that militarist feeling .
When my enlistment ended , I left the Army , moved to New York , and dove deeper into leftwing politics .
Somewhere , that young , gung - ho soldier remained in me .
I would see him from time to time , in my dreams , in random thoughts , standing at attention on a busy Manhattan street corner , looking directly at me before vanishing into the crowd .
He 's in me today .
But his most dramatic appearance came a few months after 9/11 , when my beloved New York was attacked .
I was living in Michigan by then , yet geographical distance did n't matter .
I knew too much about the city for that terror attack to be an abstraction , plus , I had a few friends who were directly affected by the Towers ' collapse .
So it was extremely personal , and before long , that young soldier fully re-emerged .
He not only wanted war , he wanted it to be punishing , cruel , merciless .
He wanted it for his adopted home town , where he became an adult .
He wanted it for his old drill sergeant , who missed out on Vietnam .
His outer - body was too old to personally fight , but inside , he was picking off jihadists and laughing at their demise .
It all came back , like it was yesterday .
The insanity began .
Afghanistan , my lefty friends , Hitchens , and near - support for the Iraq invasion .
Is FreeRice.com making $ 150 k each day in profits ?
FreeRice.com is a site that tries to educate and feed the world at the same time , but just taking a quick look at their figures shows there is a massive potential of earning money from this " philanthropic " gesture .
Just how much is the owner keeping ?
I ’m going edge around this one carefully because what FreeRice is indeed a noble idea .
Ending poverty and needless starvation around the world is something that should happen .
The maths ( and some conclusions ) in this post are from the school of napkin - mathematics and should be treated as such .
If you see any massive errors , wang me an email or pop in a comment and I ’ll correct it right away .
Disclaimers aside , FreeRice.com is a site that promises to educate and feed at the same time .
It ’s a vocabulary test and every time you get a word correct , FreeRice donates 10 grains of rice to the United Nations World Food Program , paying for it from funds it receives from sponsors at the bottom of the page .
However , FreeRice is not a registered charity .
As far as I can see , this all boils down to the work of one man : John Breen , who started poverty.com in January 2007 .
This is significant , I believe , because there is no accounting and no legislation regarding funds ( other than tax ) .
So how much rice is being given away ?
Thankfully FreeRice publishes its daily totals .
As you can see , November the 11th saw 136,236,930 grains of rice donated .
Going on the figure I ’ve seen in a few places ( 1 , 2 & 3 ) , there are approximately 50,000 grains of rice to a kilo .
So on a busy day like yesterday FreeRice donates 2724.7 kg of rice .
An admirable amount .
Next question : how much does rice cost ?
This is a much tougher question .
Depending on the quantities used , the prices of rice , change dramatically .
I did find a Thai site selling it for $ 309 / ton .
Given that a [ short ] ton is 907 kilos , the price for 2724.7 kg of rice is a mere $ 928 .
How much could the site be earning ?
This is an iffy bit .
We know from the totals that that at least 13,623,693 correct words were submitted .
I ’m estimating a 10 % failure rate .
So we ’re looking at upwards of 14,986,062 pageviews .
There is no way of knowing ( from the outside ) how many people visit the site and do n’t play , so I ’m just leaving that off but remember that this pageview figure is guaranteed to be lower ( probably much lower ) than the real value .
If we went on average AdSense advertising rates , we ’re looking at 50 clicks every 1000 pageviews and each click being worth $ 0.20 .
So based on the ~ 15 million pageviews figure , revenue could be upward of : $ 149,860 .
$ 149 k of profit *
So taking off the cost of rice , there ’s just under $ 149 k of profit , every day at the current traffic level .
There ’s actually more because my pageview value is deliberately low , missing off people who do n’t play .
Points that need mentioning in conclusion :
While there is the potential for $ 150,000 a day ( if not more ) , only John Breen knows the real revenue .
.
Following on from that , there is a severe issue with the system .
Breen should register a charity and funds ( both in and out ) should be publicly visible and accountable .
Sponsors should demand this .
The revenue model is probably not a CTR model , rather a flat fee or CPM .
model , rather a flat fee or .
There are other costs involved too that I have n’t worked out .
Hosting will be petty but things like ordering and delivering the rice may be significant .
However , in bulk the UN World Food Program may pick up this side of things .
It all boils down to accountability and the people giving him this money should be the ones asking these questions .
Breen may or may not be getting a ton of revenue off this .
He may just be covering his costs but what is clear is there is either scope for improvement and donating more to charity , or Breen is getting rich from faux - charity .
Update : I called it faux - charity , my reasoning being that not all charity is equal and pouring hours into a system like this , although fun does n’t actually accomplish as much as , say , giving your loose change to charity collectors .
I ’ve formed this sode of things into it ’s own argument :
Is all charity good ?
Mr. Williams was in Seattle for a series of charity events he did at the Showbox benefiting West Seattle Food bank , The Humane Society and the Seattle Repertory Theatre .
A true humanitarian , gone too soon , he will be missed .

On April 19 , 2000 , seventeen year - old Afaq Ahmed Shah got into a car filled with explosives and drove it to the Indian Army headquarters in Srinagar , Jammu and Kashmir .
Stopped by guards at the entrance , the teenager detonated a bomb inside the vehicle , triggering a massive explosion that injured four people .
In the months leading up to the bombing , Shah , along with other youngsters in the contested region of Kashmir , spent a great deal of his time in the local mosque , falling under the influence of local terrorist groups .
Thus motivated , he became the first suicide bomber1 of the Kashmiri conflict .
2
In June of 2002 , a 16 year - old Palestinian boy by the name Issa Bdir was dispatched by the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades to carry out a terror attack in Rishon Letzion , a suburb of Tel Aviv .
After dying his hair blond so as to appear European , he entered a crowded pedestrian mall packed with elderly people and foreign workers and blew himself up , killing two Israelis ( including one teenager ) , and wounding over 30 others .
At that point Bdir became the youngest person ever to successfully complete a suicide mission in Israel .3
On November 1 , 2004 , Amar al - Faar , another 16 year - old Palestinian boy , entered Israel through a gap in the security fence .
He carried out a suicide bombing in the densely populated Carmel outdoor market in Tel Aviv .
The boys attack killed four Israelis and wounded thirty - two , six of them seriously .
Al - Faar was recruited by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) , a neo-Marxist faction of Yasser Arafats Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .
In interviews following the attack , Al - Faars  mother condemned the terrorists who recruited her son , claiming , " It 's immoral to send someone so young .
They should have sent an adult who understands the meaning of his deeds . "
4
In August of 2003 , two Kashmiri Muslim boys , aged 13 and 17 , were kidnapped at gunpoint by the Lashkar - e - Toiba ( LeT , Army of the Pure ) terrorist organization .
The boys were among hundreds of Muslim youth who have been forcibly recruited and trained to commit acts of terror against the Indian military and civilian populations .
5
The kidnappers were most likely responding to the dictates of the LeT ordering local villages " to contribute one recruit each to the organization , or face reprisals . "
6
Recently , the involvement of minors in Palestinian terror touched a new low , as an 11 year - old boy was caught while unwittingly trying to transport a bag holding a 7 - to - 10 kilogram bomb past an Israeli military roadblock .
The young porter had been hired by the Fatah Tanzim terrorist organization , affiliated with Yasser Arafat .
The terrorists had two equally appalling scenarios in mind .
If the bomb was successfully smuggled past the roadblock , it would have been given to a suicide bomber and used to launch a deadly attack somewhere in Israel .
Alternately , if the boy were caught , his dispatchers had intended to blow him up along with the soldiers at the roadblock by detonating the explosive charge via a cell phone detonator .
Fortunately , due to a technical glitch , the bomb failed to go off and the terrorist plot was foiled .
7
Unfortunately , the episodes described above are not isolated .
This disturbing practice of deadly child abuse is on the rise in Muslim societies all over the world , most notably in the Palestinian areas and in Pakistan as also in Jammu & Kashmir ( J&K ) .
While the average Israeli or Indian citizen does not usually make the connection , there are striking similarities between the threats that face their two countries .
Muslim terrorist organizations that recruit  sometimes forcibly  these teenagers , justify this illegal and immoral practice by noting that children , much like females , are less likely to be intercepted by security forces before they carry out their missions of death .
In both conflicts , the value of a childs life ( not to mention the lives of those unfortunates who find themselves within the radius of death and destruction when the bomb is detonated ) has become subordinate to the aspirations of militant Islam and militant nationalism .
And while the recruitment and indoctrination of Muslim children to engage in terrorism and armed conflict in Indian Kashmir has not reached the unprecedented levels of the current Intifada that targets Israel ; concerned Indian citizens ( indeed persons living in any region where militant Islam has declared a Jihad ) should be aware of the threat that the cult of martyrdom directs at democracies worldwide .8
Many of this Journals readers live in India and the surrounding region .
While generally familiar with the problems emanating from Jammu and Kashmir , they remain largely unaware of the highly troubling direction taken by wide - scale Palestinian recruitment and training of children to engage in terrorist violence .
This paper attempts to address the following vexing questions , in the hope that the lessons learned will be relevant to those facing similar threats in South Asia and elsewhere :
How pervasive is this form of child abuse in the present Israeli Palestinian conflict ?
How is it inspired ?
Can it be justified within the context of current international law ?
What will be the consequences of education for hate on the upcoming generation , and for the possibility of peace in the region ?
Child Martyrs : Welcoming Death From the outset of the current Intifada , Palestinian children and teenagers have assumed an integral role .
In the early months , children acted as decoys , burning tires and shooting slingshots to attract the television cameras , often making it harder for the world to identify the gunmen lying in ambush .
Knowing that the soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) are ordered not to shoot live ammunition at children , Palestinian snipers hid among and behind groups of youngsters , on rooftops , in alleys or orchards , often using kids as shields when aiming at exposed IDF soldiers .
On some occasions , Palestinian gunmen may have inadvertently shot these children from behind .
As the intensity of the Intifada increased , Palestinian children and teenagers became more directly involved in terror attacks , especially suicide bombings .
On March 30 , 2002 , a 16 year - old Palestinian girl named Ayat Akhras walked into a Jerusalem supermarket and detonated a bomb hidden under her clothing , killing two Israelis and wounding 22 others .
Andaleeb Taqataqah was only 17 years - old when she was recruited by a terror squad and dispatched to blow herself up in a crowded Jerusalem open - air market on April 12 , 2002 .
One week later , three teenagers from Gaza  Anwar Hamduna , Yusef Zakut , and Abu Nada  attempted to crawl under a perimeter fence and attack the residents of the Jewish community of Netzarim , only to be shot dead by guards .
In May 2002 , a 16 year - old Palestinian boy with a suicide bomb on his body was arrested at an IDF roadblock near Jenin .
On June 13 , 2002 , a 15 year - old Palestinian girl , arrested for throwing a firebomb at IDF soldiers , admitted during interrogation that she had previously been recruited as a suicide terrorist .
Finally , on March 24 , 2004 , 14 year - old Hussam Abdu was caught at an IDF roadblock with an explosive belt wrapped around his chest .
He told investigators that he had been paid 100 shekels ( approximately $ 22 US ) to carry out a suicide bombing .
9
With the IDFs successful Operation Defensive Shield ,10 the number of suicide attacks has dramatically decreased as the security forces have interrupted the planning and execution of most of these deadly bombing missions .
But , children are still being employed in other types of terrorist activities ; they are recruited to carry ammunition and explosives or are left behind to trigger booby - traps that terrorists set for troops .
11 On January 1 , 2003 , three young teenagers were sent by the self - styled terrorist faction  Popular Resistance Committees  ( PRC ) to infiltrate and attack the Jewish community of Elei Sinai .
They were killed by the IDF personnel .
A similar incident occurred one week later when two Palestinian teenagers , brothers , 14 and 17 years of age , infiltrated the community of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip , armed with knives .
They attacked a Jewish boy , entered a house , and were shot .
The brothers were apprehended by the IDF and hospitalized with light injuries .
Brigadier General Yisrael Ziv , the IDF Commander in Gaza , commented , " It s clear that the terrorists did not think that by sending these children they would succeed in killing anyone ; instead , their criminal thoughts were that the very [ likely ] deaths [ of these children ] would give Israel a bad name .
" 12 On March 24 , 2003 , two 13 year - olds were shot and killed , one as he climbed on top of an IDF personnel carrier to steal a machine gun , and another as he threw a Molotov cocktail .
Another youth was burnt by his own firebomb.13
Although some elements in Palestinian society oppose using children , or at least their own children , in what they euphemistically call martyrdom operations , these voices remain isolated .
In June 2002 , Mahmud Abbas , also known as Abu Mazen , a senior Arafat aide who later served a brief term as Prime Minister in Yasser Arafats Government , criticized the tactics of Palestinian organizations in Gaza .
Abbas told a Kuwaiti newspaper , " I am against little children going out to die .
It is a terrible thing .
At least 40 children in Rafah [ in the Gaza Strip ] lost an arm from the throwing of Bangalore torpedoes [ a form of pipe bomb ] .
They received five shekels [ approximately $ 1 US ] in order to throw them .
" 14 Why are these young people willing to throw away their lives ?
Who led them to believe that assuming dangerous roles in the violence would result in improving their personal , family , or political situation ?
How did the celebration of violence against Israelis become so deeply ingrained in Palestinian culture ?
What cause , no matter how deeply held , can motivate a society to sacrifice its children , its future ?
To find the answers to these questions it is necessary to examine the influences at work in Palestinian society that incite children to violence , with the approval and encouragement of their political and religious leadership , parents , and peers .
The use of child martyrs and terrorists is also a major problem in Pakistan , where easily manipulated children are being programmed to undertake the objectives of their fundamentalist  controllers .
These children are being coerced into carrying out jihad missions through various means including kidnapping , threats to their lives and the lives of their family members , and most commonly , being brainwashed into believing that jihad is a spiritual fulfilment to God.15
In most cases these children are unaware of the meaning or consequences of their actions and equally unaware of any alternatives .
In one example , Mohammad Abdulla , a 17 year - old boy along with an accomplice  both members of the notorious terrorist group , the Lashkar - e - Toiba carried out a terrorist attack on a crowded residential housing development in Jammu ( part of Indian controlled J&K ) .
Within minutes , the two emptied four AK - 47 assault rifle magazines  containing 32 rounds each  and detonated five hand grenades , killing 28 people , including eight women and ten children .
16
When apprehended and questioned by the Indian police , Abdulla replied , " I was not happy about it but my controllers in Pakistan said it was necessary to establish terror I had my orders and had to follow them .
It was not a question of liking the job but simply executing it .
" 17 Abdullas story is one of many in Kashmir , in which Pakistani children have been used as instruments of terror against Indian civilians in the conflict over Kashmir .18 Indian sources estimate between 2,000 and 4,000 Mujahideen19 ( militants ) to be in J&K ; of this figure they believe 40 percent to be from Pakistan / Afghanistan and 80 percent to be in their teens .
20
In recent years , the tactics used by these groups in terrorist attacks have intensified , switching from bullets and guns to explosives and advanced communications .
21 Similar to the situation in Israel , this has escalated the conflict , increasing the number and severity of civilian casualties ; as well as , making it more difficult for security forces to prevent terrorist activity .
Inciting Children to Violence
The close connection between incitement and violence is implicit in all the signed interim peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians .
For example , the Cairo Agreement , signed by Arafat in 1994 , obligates the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) to " foster mutual understanding and tolerance " and " abstain from incitement , including hostile propaganda , [ and ] take legal measures to prevent such incitement by any organizations , groups , or individuals . "
Yet , various measures adopted by the Palestinian leadership and media are clearly aimed at provoking children to violence , inciting them in direct contravention of the interim agreements .
While the phenomenon of suicide bombing in Israel is usually associated with radical militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad , it is the PA  the very Palestinian entity established , empowered , funded and armed to carry out the Oslo peace process  that is the primary force promoting Shahada , literally " testimony of faith , " or martyrdom .
Incitement in Palestinian society is both authoritative and nearly omnipresent , and emanates straight from the top of the PA , including the late Arafat himself .
Television and radio stations , religious sermons , school textbooks , newspapers and magazines , and even summer camp curricula are all directly or indirectly controlled by the PA , which uses them to glorify martyrdom and to convince Palestinian children to engage in life - threatening behaviour .
PA - controlled television , with its powerful visual and visceral images , is one medium employed to manipulate childrens minds and emotions .
Images of blood and dead children are frequently broadcast , followed by scenes of children playing , captioned with the slogan , " Seek Death  The Life Will Be Given To You . "
This slogan is also the title of a report published by the Palestine Media Watch , which extensively documents the multi-layered pressures exerted on children to give up life and seek martyrdom .
22
The report features video clips of footage from PA - controlled television that have been specifically produced for children .
It also includes passages from school textbooks , and quotes from statements made by Palestinian politicians , clerics and educators .
One powerful video clip , shown regularly on PA - controlled TV over the past three years , shows a schoolboy writing a farewell letter to his parents .
" Do not be sad , my dear , and do not cry over my parting , my dear father .
For my country , I shall sacrifice myself . "
The child leaves home and joins his friends in a riot .
He places himself in front of the soldiers , is shot in the chest and collapses .
His words are sung : " How sweet is martyrdom when I embrace you , my land , " as he falls to the ground , embracing  the land .
As the boys mother is seen crying , the letter continues : " My beloved , my mother , my most dear , be joyous over my blood and do not cry for me . "
The message is clear : it should be the goal of every Palestinian child to die confronting Israel .23
In another clip , a child actor playing the role of Mohammed Dura , the most widely recognized child victim of the fighting , is shown waving to his young viewers , calling on them to follow him to paradise .
We then see snippets of his joyous life in heaven with a backdrop of beaches and waterfalls .
The actor walks through an amusement park and flies a kite .
He says , " I am not waving goodbye , I am waving to tell you to follow in my footsteps . "
On the accompanying soundtrack a song plays , " How pleasant is the smell of martyrs , how pleasant the smell of land , the land enriched by the blood , the blood pouring out of a fresh body .
" 24 Many popular cultural programmes encourage martyrdom and show approval for those who are killed .
Cultural events broadcast on Palestinian television often include elements glorifying violence .
According to an article in the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz , " television broadcasts include songs and dances accompanied by photographs of violence , all emphasizing how noble it is to die for the sake of Allah .
" 25 A Palestinian TV childrens show called " The Childrens Club , " which is modelled on the American programme " Sesame Street , " aired an episode in which young boys with raised arms chanted " we are ready with our guns ; revolution until victory ; victory .
"
26 On the same show , an 8 year - old boy announced to an audience of children : " I come here to say that we will throw them to the quiet sea .
Occupiers , your day is near , then we will settle our account .
We will settle our claims with stones and bullets .
" 27 In a current television series , one young interviewee screams , " They should just give us guns , we ourselves , the children , the young boys and girls , will fight , just give us guns ; guns they should give us , we wont leave even one Jew , wont leave even one Jew here . "
Even commercials on Palestinian TV have urged children to leave their toys , pick up rocks , and join the battle against Israel .
28
In a PA - run summer camp , a New York Times reporter observed campers staging the kidnapping of Israeli leaders , stripping and assembling Kalashnikov assault rifles , and learning how to stage an ambush .
The campers were given camouflage uniforms and imitation guns .29
They paraded in military formation and practiced infiltration , crawling on their stomachs through obstacles .
Intoxicated by the challenge of being recognized as heroes , tempted by martyrdom , and lacking the emotional maturity to calculate the dangers they are taking on , these young people are easily motivated to place themselves in harms way .
Arafat himself frequently referred to Palestinian children as " the generals of the stones , " 30 playing to their pride and young egos .
Speaking to an audience of children on Palestinian TV , Arafat commonly referred to Faris Ouda , a 14 year - old who planned his own death , as a Shahid , extolling him as an icon for children to emulate .
In another television appearance , before a cheering and chanting auditorium full of children , Arafat exhorted them : " You are the peers of Faris Ouda !
One of you , a boy or a girl , shall raise the [ Palestinian ] flag over the walls of Jerusalem , its mosques and its churches ...
Onwards together to Jerusalem ! "
The children call out in response : " Millions of Shahids marching to Jerusalem !
"
31
In Arafats words , " The Shahid constitutes the fundamental and victorious force of our people . "
In an interview in a PA - controlled newspaper , Youssef Jamah , the Palestinian Minister of Holy Sites , states , " The suicide bombings are a legitimate means through which the Palestinians fight the enemy The attacks are the command of Allah . "
Although some Islamic authorities oppose suicide bombing , Sheik  Ikrimi Sabri , the PA - appointed Mufti of Jerusalem , believes , " There is no doubt that a child [ Shahid ] suggests that the new generation will carry on the mission with determination .
The younger the Shahid  the greater and the more I respect him .
" 32 Sermons delivered in mosques frequently include unequivocal calls to violence .
The official media broadcasts the sermons of the PA - appointed cleric at the Al - Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem , who has called for his followers to " eradicate the Jews from Palestine .
"
33
Also heard live on Palestinian television was a sermon by Dr. Ahmad Abu Halabiya , a member of the PA - appointed Fatwa Council and former acting Rector of the Islamic University in Gaza , who called for Israelis to be humiliated , tortured , and butchered .
34
He continued , " Have no mercy on the Jews , no matter where they are , in any country .
Fight them , wherever you are .
Wherever you meet them , kill them .
Wherever you are , kill those Americans who are like them  and those that stand by them .
" 35 Another cleric , Dr. Muhammed Ibrahim Madi , declared on PA - controlled television , " Shame upon he who does not educate his children in the education of jihad .
Blessings upon he who dons a vest of explosives on himself or on his children and goes into the midst of the Jews . "
Sheikh Abd al - Razak , also on PA Television asserted , " Allah has planted within our youth the love of jihad , the love of martyrdom .
Our youth have turned into bombs , they blow themselves up among them [ Israelis ] day and night .
" 36 While the sermons are broadcast live from mosques on television and radio , it should be noted that they are also heard directly by those praying in the mosques , an audience that often includes children .
Similar to the case of the Palestinians , child incitement is being propagated in Pakistan by its governing authorities .
While the Pakistani Government arguably denies assistance through the provision of arms , training and monetary aid to militant organizations , top Government officials admit to assisting these militants across the Pakistani border into Indian controlled Kashmir  in many cases killing any Indian Army personnel who stand in the way .
37
The aftermath of September 11 , 2001 , created a wave of international pressure calling on the Pakistani Government to eliminate the growth of religious extremism within its borders .
This includes the indoctrination of children for the purpose of jihad .
Similar to the Palestinian Authority , the Pakistani Government has perfunctorily humoured the international community , but taken no concrete action in inhibiting terrorist activity and complying with this international goal .
38
In one case , the then Pakistani Interior Minister , Moinuddin Haider , had stated that " the brand of Islam that they are teaching is not good for Pakistan , some in the garb of religious training , are busy poisoning peoples [ including childrens ] minds .
" 39 Ironically , Pakistans failure to act has created a situation in which Islamic fundamentalism has begun to threaten even President Musharraf .
In June of 2000 , Haider " announced a reform plan that would require all Madrassas " 40  schools run by religious organisations  " to register with the government , expand their curricula , disclose their financial resources , seek permission for admitting foreign students and stop sending students to militant training camps .
" 41 According to Harvard Professor Jessica Stern , an expert in the study of religious extremism , the Pakistani Government has taken little or no proactive steps to eliminate this problem .
42 Stern reported that " only 4,350 of the estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Madrassas have registered with the Government . "
43
The majority of Madrassas have made it clear that they are unwilling to revise their curricula , and consistently ignore the rights of their students by sending them to training camps " despite parents  instructions not to do so .
" 44 Madrassas are the primary source of child incitement within Pakistan .45 According to World Bank estimates , only 40 percent of Pakistanis are literate due to a lack of public schools in rural areas .
46
The combination of poverty and lack of schools has enabled the Madrassas to become a powerful tool of incitement .
In addition to providing a free education , these institutions gain support by feeding , clothing , and housing their students .
In some cases , they have reportedly paid parents to enrol their children .
According to Stern , 7,500 Madrassas in Pakistan preach jihad .47
In another study by Stern , principals of Madrassas were interviewed .
At one school , the Jamia Manzoor ul Islamyia  with an enrolment of about 550 students  the principal was asked if he had a favourite book .
His response was the " Koran . "
When asked about a popular Sufi singer  Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan  his response was " I dont need music .
Music is for those who have an addiction within them . "
Questioned about Albert Einstein , the principal remarked " that he saw no need for science .
" 48 Stern met two children who wanted to become doctors .
Embarrassed , the principal remarked " by the time Ive worked on them for a year , they will want to be Mujahideen too .
" 49 After being indoctrinated at a Madrassa , many students go on to further their fundamentalist education at militant training camps .
A typical day at these camps begins at 4:00 am , with prayers and a small breakfast consisting of bread and tea .
This is followed by a full day of rigorous drills teaching the manufacturing of bombs , and the use of sniper rifles , rocket launchers , and communications equipment .
This daily process is interrupted for only a single meal  consisting of rice  and daily prayers .
Sports , music , and literature are forbidden , and only pre-screened newspapers are allowed to be read .
The final exam for this programme consists of a three - day hike through rugged mountainous terrain with no food or sleep .
The best of these graduates are selected for martyrdom .
50
The implications of this systematic indoctrination are vast and dangerous .
As stated by one Mujahid , " A person addicted to heroin can get off it if he really tries , but a Mujahid cannot leave the jihad .
I am spiritually addicted to the jihad .
" 51 Another Mujahid stated that " we wont stop  even if India gave us Kashmir well also bring jihad here .
There is already a movement here to make Pakistan a pure Islamic state .
Many preach Islam , but most of them dont know what it means .
We want to see a Taliban - style regime here .
" 52 Educating the  Martyrs of Tomorrow  Even in the PAs public schools , whose textbooks are financed by the European Union , incitement against Israel and the glorification of martyrdom are prominent themes , embedded in nationalistic aspirations .
Needless to say , interest in reconciliation with Israel is notably absent .
Elementary school teachers and principals commend their young students for wanting to " tear their [ Zionists  ] bodies into little pieces and cause them more pain than they will ever know . "
Posters in university classrooms proudly remind the world that the Palestinian cause is armed with human bombs .
Sheik Hassan Yosef , a leading Hamas member , summarized this process of incitement in his own words : " We like to grow them from kindergarten through college . "
Palestinian Brigadier General , Mahmoud Abu Marzoug , reminded a group of tenth grade girls in Gaza City , " as a Shahid , you will be alive in Heaven . "
After the address , a group of these girls lined up to assure a Washington Post reporter that they would be happy to carry out suicide bombings or other actions ending in their deaths .
53
When the PA assumed responsibility for education in the West Bank and Gaza in 1994 , it adopted textbooks from Jordan and Egypt .
These schoolbooks contained egregious anti-Semitic and anti-Israel rhetoric , including overt calls for Israels destruction .
After much international criticism , a curriculum review project was initiated by the PA , which resulted in the publishing of new textbooks for grades one and six , for the school year 2000 2001 .
While much of the explicit incitement against Israel and Jews that existed in the old schoolbooks is gone , there is still considerable de-legitimization of Israel and denial of any Jewish historical connection to the land .
Israel is omitted on all maps of the area , and all cities and natural and historic landmarks in Israel are taught as being  Palestinian . 
In the new sixth grade textbook entitled " Reading the Koran " , Palestinian children read about Allahs warning to the Jews that Allah will kill them because of their evil .
Elsewhere , they are taught that Jews are like donkeys and that they will be expelled from their homes by Allah .
In the assessment of the Palestinian Media Watch , this religion - based anti-Semitism is the most dangerous , as children are taught that hating Jews is Gods choice and command .
Moreover , although Islam also has positive traditions regarding Jews , the PA educators chose to incorporate only hateful religious traditions .
Israel is portrayed as foreign to the Middle East and is described as a colonialist conqueror .
There is a strongly implied message that all such conquered Arab land must be " liberated . "
54 This message is pervasive in all subjects , sometimes subtly , almost subliminally , as in the first grade science book in a chapter on sight .
The young student is instructed to look at little things using a magnifying glass .
An illustration demonstrates what would be seen when looking through a magnifying glass at a piece of paper with writing that is barely visible without the magnifier .
The part under the magnifying glass can be read clearly : " Palestine is Arab . "
In all contexts of the education system , " Palestine " includes all of Israel .55
Note that these are the new and improved textbooks .
Other grades are still using the Jordanian and Egyptian imports , which glorify hatred of Israel and Jews , and glorify death in jihad .
For example , in an eighth grade book for " Islamic Education " we find , " The Muslim sacrifices himself for his belief , and wages jihad for Allah .
He is not swayed , for he knows that the date of his death as a Shahid on the field of battle is preferable to death in his bed . "
A tenth grade reading text claims , " Martyred jihad fighters are the most honoured people , after the Prophet .
" 56 Violent death is sanctified throughout the Palestinian areas .
The streets are plastered with posters glorifying the exploits of individual suicide bombers .
Children trade martyr cards , purchased at their local shops , instead of cricket cards .
Necklaces with pictures of martyrs are also very popular .
57
One favourite wall slogan reads : " beware of death by natural causes .
" 58 Suicide bombing is considered a source of neighbourhood pride , as streets are named after the perpetrators of these atrocities .
There is even a musical group named  The Martyrs , whose lyrics espouse the virtues of " sacrificing yourself for Allah . "
Under these cultural influences , many children readily admit that they want to become suicide bombers .
Some draw pictures and fantasize about the day when they will achieve their goal .
Boys are taught that , as suicide bombers , they will ascend to a paradise of luxury staffed by 72 virgins waiting to gratify the martyrs as they arrive .
An American psychiatrist with 22 years of experience studying and treating suicidal patients stresses that suicide bombers  both children and adults  are " tools used by terrorist leaders " with " a whole culture encouraging [ them ] to die .
" 59 Pakistani Government - controlled schools and private schools teaching the Government - prescribed curriculum may teach conventional disciplines , but hardly provide a more rational education than provided at Madrassas and training camps .
The educational agenda of these schools is to instil the " ideology of Pakistan " into the minds of students , and / or the belief that Islam is superior to all other religions and that Pakistan is the Muslim homeland .
Dr. Yvette Clair Rossers study for the Observer Research Foundation revealed the prejudices found in Pakistani textbooks .
In one seventh grade textbook , the section explaining different political systems on democracy , theocracy , and military rule was replaced with chapters titled " What it Means to be a Good Pakistani " and " Standing in Queue .
"
60
As stated by one student : " we have covered the same material year after year we dont have to study for the tests , because the ideology of Pakistan has been instilled into us .
" 61 On an ethnic level , textbooks embody supremacist phrases condemning outside religions .
In Pakistani textbooks , Hindus are referred to as " diabolical and conspiring against Pakistan .
" 62 Further , Hindus are described as " backward , superstitious , wife burners , and that they are inherently cruel and if given the chance would assert their power over the weak , especially Muslims , by depriving them of education and pouring molten lead into their ears .
"
63 This supremacist rhetoric continues on a global level and other countries are vilified in a similarly negative light .
Textbooks portray Pakistans existence as being threatened by a " Machiavellian conspiracy . "
64 As stated in Mohammed Sarwers  Pakistan Studies65 book , " at present particular segments in the guise of modernisation and progressive activities have taken the unholy task of damaging our cultures heritage and thereby damaging our nations integration .
" 66 Pakistani state - run education is not substantially different from what is preached by Islamist fundamentalists at Madrassas .
The latter proclaim the need to perform jihad against India and on the West , which they believe is run by Jews .
They also proclaim the goal of " planting Islamic flags in Delhi , Tel Aviv and Washington .
"
67 One of the Lashkar - e - Toibas Websites had a list of Jews that it claimed were working for the  Clinton Administration .
Included in this list were presidential officials Robert Nash ( an African American from the United States ) and CIA director George Tenet ( a Greek American ) .
68
The group went so far as to accuse Israel of assisting India in Kashmir , making the claim that " Hitler was right in that he understood that the Jews and peace are incompatible .
" 69 A Familys Badge of Pride For many Palestinian children , incitement begins at home .
The parents  role in encouraging their own offspring to become Shahids is difficult to understand .
They believe that the death of their child for the sake of holy jihad and Islam will guarantee him or her everlasting life and bliss in the hereafter .
This type of sacrifice is held in such high esteem in certain segments of Palestinian society that it has become a badge of pride .
Parents of toddlers proudly recount their little children saying they want to become martyrs .
The father of a 13 year - old says , " I pray that God will choose him " to become a Shahid.70
One mother of a 13 year - old who perished as a result of his participation in the Intifada , told a journalist from the Times ( London ) : " I am happy that he has been martyred .
I will sacrifice all my sons and daughters ( 12 in all ) to Al - Aqsa and Jerusalem .
" 71
Another mother boasted that she bore her son precisely for the purpose of participating in such a Jihad , while the childs father proudly claimed to have provided his son with the training .
72 After 15 year - old Ahmat Omar Abu Selmia was killed on his way to attack the Israeli community of Dugit , his father celebrated his martyrdom at a street festival attended by about 200 men .
A photograph in the Jerusalem Post on February 26 , 2002 , showed Palestinian fathers teaching a group of toddlers and young children to properly hold assault rifles while trampling on American and Israeli flags .
The most shocking evidence of the extent of such brainwashing was found in the family photo album of a wanted Hamas militant .
This album contained a photograph of a baby dressed as a suicide bomber , complete with a harness of mock explosives and the traditional Shahids red headband .73
Another reason that Palestinian parents allow and even encourage their children to get involved is the financial incentive offered to families of martyrs .
Thus , the PA furnishes a cash payment of $ 2,000 ( USD ) per child killed and $ 300 per child wounded .
Saudi Arabia announced that it had pledged $ 250 million as its first contribution to a billion - dollar fund aimed at supporting the families of Palestinian martyrs .
In addition , from the beginning to the current Intifada until the capture of Baghdad by allied forces in April 2003 , the Arab Liberation Front , a Palestinian group loyal to former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , paid generous bounties to the injured , and the families of the Palestinian dead , according to the following sliding scale : $ 500 for a wound ; $ 1,000 for disability ; $ 10,000 to the family of each martyr ; and $ 25,000 to the family of every suicide bomber .
These are lavish sums , particularly given the chronic unemployment and poverty of the Palestinians who reside in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
74
It is important to note , however , that many Palestinian parents have attempted to restrain their children , and have resisted those who would place them in harms way .
One public opinion poll of Palestinians living in the West Bank revealed that 74.1 per cent oppose the participation of children under the age of eighteen in the Intifada .75 Unfortunately this still leaves a substantial percentage that supports the participation of children , corresponding to hundreds of thousands of parents .
Could their reluctance to exercise routine parental authority , by discouraging their children from participating in the violence , be attributable to the threats by armed PA officials ?
Some in the PA leadership are apparently uncomfortable with the international and local criticism their use of children has engendered and are beginning to acknowledge the inherent risks of mixing child protesters with Palestinian gunmen .
However , their reactions to the use of children in the Intifada are far from uniform or consistent .
Mixed signals still emanate from various factions of the PA leadership .
For example , in January , 2003 , marches and rallies were being planned by Fatah , the largest faction of the PLO , to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the founding of the movement .
The then PA Minister of Interior , Hani al - Hassan , warned the Fatah activists against any display of weapons or the wearing of masks ( to hide their faces ) during the demonstrations .
Hassans directive was completely ignored , however , and witnesses said that the marchers " carried almost every kind of weapon , turning the celebration into a military parade . "
Shots were fired into the air from rifles and pistols .
" The shooting continued all day , " said one Palestinian .
" It was like being in a battlefront .
People were terrified , and its only a miracle that no one was killed or injured . "
Many Palestinian bystanders were especially disturbed by the participation of several hundred children brandishing Kalashnikov rifles during the demonstrations .
Some of the children were dressed in white uniforms , and wrapped in explosive belts to emulate Palestinian suicide bombers .
76 Pictures of the children appeared in both local and foreign newspapers , much to the annoyance of the Palestinian Journalists  Association .
The Association has banned journalists from taking pictures of armed children and threatened sanctions against any journalist , local or foreign , who disregards the ban .
Association members are concerned that such pictures will further damage the image of the Palestinians in the eyes of the world .
77
The same ideology of martyrdom of their children is shared by many Pakistani parents .
Stern found that " mothers claimed that they would donate sons , because it will help them in the next life  the real life .
" 78 One father stated " whoever gives his life to Allah lives forever and earns a spot in heaven for 70 members of the family chosen by him . "
Whenever there is a martyr in the village it encourages more children to join Jihad .
79
As in the Palestinian jihad , organizations have been set up in Pakistan to help the families of martyrs .
These organizations help to pay debts , improve the families  living conditions and help start businesses .
80
One such organisation , the Shuhda-e - Islam Foundation , founded in 1995 by the Jamaat - e - Islami ( JeI ) , claims to provide financial support to over 364 families and to have paid out over three million Pakistani rupees .
81
When interviewed , one mother whose son lost his life to jihad claimed , " God is helping us a lot , " pointing to the new additions to her house .
She stated that she wanted to martyr her youngest son , who was ten years of age .
When questioned what he wanted after he grew up , he claimed " respect and jihad . "
The Relevance of International Law
We live in an era in which the rights of children are widely considered paramount , as superseding other considerations , particularly political causes .
" The best interest of the child " is the standard that is routinely used in controversies concerning parental custody , child labour , child abuse , and juvenile criminal procedures .
82
The international community has increasingly condemned the utilization of children in armed conflicts .
Many non-governmental organizations have been trying to combat this form of child abuse .
A coalition of American paediatricians ,  Doctors Opposed to Child Sacrifice , has called on the PA to stop broadcasting advertisements and all other programmes that call on children to participate in violent acts , glorifying martyrdom .83 Amnesty International condemned the recent use of children in suicide attacks , calling it " an abomination " and urging the Palestinian leadership " to publicly denounce these practices .
" 84 International law broadly attempts to protect children from the horrors of armed conflict .
For example , the use of children as human shields to impede the adversarys military operations is prohibited by Article 28 of the Fourth Geneva Convention , which strictly forbids the use of civilians ( of any age ) as shields .
The cynical use of groups of children as human shields by Palestinian gunmen in confrontations with Israeli soldiers during the early months of the present Intifada was described earlier in this article .
To further encourage youth to participate in such confrontations , the PA declared school holidays for that purpose and drove busloads of children to hot spots .
85 Such activity is in clear violation of Article 28 .
More generally , with intent to protect civilians , the Geneva Convention proscribes the placing of fighting forces in the midst of civilian populations .
The Palestinian practice of setting up bomb and missile factories and centres of operational planning for armed conflict in the middle of densely populated civilian areas , including refugee camps , puts all non-combatants in the vicinity , including children , at great risk .
86 This , again , is a clear violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention .
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ( 1989 ) condemns the recruitment and involvement of children less than fifteen years of age in hostilities and armed conflicts .
This standard appears to conform to Islamic law , which prohibits children under fifteen from participating in jihad .
Current treaty law not only forbids children from participating in combat , but also proscribes a wide range of other indirect activities .
Furthermore , a number of states have raised the minimum age for children to participate in armed conflicts from fifteen to eighteen .
87 However , neither international law nor Islamic law has curtailed the exploitation of children in the current Intifada .
The Cult of Martyrdom : Consequences for the Next Generation and the Possibility of Peace What is the relevance of the widespread concern for  the best interest of the child ,  to the Palestinian leadership and parents ?
Do parents who encourage their children to become martyrs for Jerusalem and Islam have the best interests of their children in mind ?
The eager participation of Palestinian youth in acts of violence against Israelis is certainly fuelled , to some extent , by feelings of anger and frustration at seeing enemy soldiers in their neighbourhoods , by a desire for revenge for the killing of a family member or friend , or even by a desire to demonstrate their courage and audacity .
A passionate desire for martyrdom and death does not come about as a natural consequence of anger or frustration .
Children and their parents are indoctrinated through PA - controlled television , religious sermons , school textbooks , and other media sources , to believe that martyrdom is a religious and patriotic obligation , and is rewarded by an afterlife of eternal bliss .
They live surrounded in an environment that glorifies the shahid .
Martyrs  pictures hang on walls in homes , mosques and schools , and appear , like those of celebrities , on television .
The generation of Palestinian children that has been raised in a popular culture that celebrates hate , killing and death will have a difficult time accepting any plan for peace with Israel .
Even more troubling is the spread of the cult of martyrdom , and with it , the export of highly developed Palestinian techniques of suicide bombing to other countries in the Middle East and to other parts of the world .
88 Pakistani and Kashmiri Madrassas continually preach jihad against India and the West , nurturing legions of future Al Qaeda and LeT and other Islamist extremist terrorists .
Despite assurances by Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf that he is working to reform these Madrassas and the public school curriculum , indoctrination of Muslim children , as well as the forced recruitment of children into armed conflict , is on the rise .
89
If this problem is not addressed urgently and effectively , perhaps assisted by Israeli intelligence and security services ( beneficiaries of ample experience in these unfortunate matters ) , India may very well find itself in a situation similar to Israels .
Suicide attacks like those of 17 year - old Ahmed Shahs , cited at the outset of this article , will become all too common .
Over the course of the current Intifada , the Israeli public has come to realize that , ironically , the generation that was to have matured under the influence of the anti-incitement provisions of the Oslo peace agreements will have to be re-educated to value life more than death .
The culture of martyrdom and its pervasiveness in the lives of Palestinian children must be understood and urgently addressed .
Islamic leaders should emphasize those Islamic values that respect other religions , historical accounts , and traditions .
Only then can the true best interests of the Palestinian children , and Muslim children everywhere , including those in the subcontinent , be advanced .

The infamous Dutch anti-piracy organization BREIN has infringed Torrent Freak 's copyright and blatantly copied a quote from one of our articles without attributing the source .
TorrentFreak is thus considering legal action against these copy / paste pirates , where they may face a fine of up to $ 975,000 and several years in prison .
Today , BREIN published a press release ( translated ) full of half - truths in which they pride themselves over the recent move of SumoTorrent to Canada .
In the press release they refer to TorrentFeak as a “ pirate weblog ” , and use a quote from an interview we did with the SumoTorrent administrator a little over a week ago .
However , they do not link back to the original article , they do n’t even mention Torrent Freak at all , thereby infringing on our copyright license .
Shocking indeed , who could have ever thought that these noble copyright protectors would be capable of such barbaric practices ?
Maybe they ’ll start stealing children next ?
The reason why BREIN did n’t link back to us is obvious , they do n’t want the public to read a “ pirate weblog ” so they would find out what they ’re really like .
BREIN is known to threaten , intimidate and scare P2P webmasters , and they are pretty successful at it .
Like most other anti-piracy organizations , BREIN is above all a propaganda machine that effectively twists the truth to educate Internet users .
They are a puppet of the MPAA and large media corporations and were recently awarded by Hollywood with an anti-piracy Oscar ( translated ) for its effectiveness .
They even have a trophy cabinet in their offices to show off to their visitors .
Unfortunately , BREIN is not the only anti-piracy organization that infringes copyright .
In February we reported that the MPAA used “ Forest Blog ” software without authorization .
The software had been completely stripped of his name , and links back to his site , thereby violating the linkware license .
The MPAA later said that they were only testing the software .
Not that it makes any difference , but why should one ( willingly ) remove all credits to the developer if it ’s only a test ?
But the MPAA does n’t only steal software , they also pirate films .
For those who have n’t seen the great documentary “ This Film Is Not Yet Rated “ , the MPAA openly admitted that they made unauthorized copies themselves .
Kirby Dick , the producer of the documentary found out that the film that he submitted for screening purposes was copied without his permission .
Say what ?
So who ’s calling who a pirate here ?

The London 2012 Olympic games are finally upon us and Thailand will be well represented by 37 athletes in over 20 different sporting events .
While Thailand wo n’t be in the medal hunt against countries such as China , Russia and America who typically bring home the largest amount of medals , Thailand has respectfully brought home at least one gold in each of the Olympic games held since 1996 .
You can convert different documents into pdf or word formar with pdftoword .
You can even find a scratch out map dedicated to the Olympics and you can mark on that scratch map in which place your country took medals .
Thailand has a very good record in the sports of boxing and weight lifting and although those particular teams are in transition this year there are definitely opportunities to bring home some medals .
Other sports to watch the Thai team shine in will be Badminton , Volleyball and Eventing .
Eventing you say ?
Eventing is a horse riding competition and this year Thailand has high hopes with Nina Lamsam Ligon who holds dual citizenship in Thailand and the United States .
Online essay in her honor will be created shortly .
She has been in the U.K. since April practicing and competing in events and her outlook is good for an Olympic medal .
For better veiw use binoculars or rifle scope .
She will represent Thailand against 9 other countries in this individual event with special things you should keep in mind .
While all the Thai athletes have been blessed by monks : ( http://paydayloans.epigenome-noe.net/GA/savannah/index.html) and have special charms and amulets for power and protection it would still be a good idea to tune in and cheer for the Thai team and give them that little extra push .
The 2012 Olympic Games start on Friday July 27th with the opening ceremony and will finish on August 12th .

“ We have spent a lot of money and gotten some very good patches , but we ’re putting them on this decayed old quilt , ” said Robert G. Bea , a professor of engineering at the University of California , Berkeley , who is an author of an independent report on the levee failures .
“ We ’re still with this damned patchwork quilt . ”

As a result , the city still lacks a system that can stand up to that 1 - in - 100 storm , let alone one like Hurricane Katrina , which the corps calls a 1 - in - 396 storm .
The work that could build the more robust system — originally estimated at $ 7 billion , and now at least twice that — will not be completed until 2011 at the earliest , and experts agree that even that level of protection will be less than the city needs .
The corps is working on a two - year , $ 20 million study to find ways of providing even more protection , but it will not even be released until December .
Without a strong rampart of protection against storms , New Orleans will have a hard time persuading its far - flung residents and businesses to return and rebuild .
Matt McBride , an engineer who became an anti-corps gadfly on flood - protection issues , left the city along with his wife after deciding he simply did not trust the new system .
“ There ’s too many things that can go wrong , ” Mr. McBride said .
Maggie Carver , a Gentilly resident now living in Woodstock , N.Y. , but hoping to get back , said she thought that all the time and work would have resulted in more progress and a clearer sense of safety than she had seen .
“ If I sell my house and put everything into rebuilding and living in New Orleans and it happens again , then where am I ? ” Ms. Carver asked .
“ I ’m in a boat somewhere with four Jack Russell terriers and my grandson .
I wo n’t have anything . ”
Patching the System
The corps has hardly been idle in the two years since the flooding .
It quickly mobilized a force that grew to as many as 3,300 workers in the New Orleans area , and its cranes and bulldozers belch exhaust at waterways all over town , installing walls of concrete , massive pumps and mounds of earthwork .

CIA , Navy Seals and Military Intelligence Personnel Implicated
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union today made public an analysis of new and previously released autopsy and death reports of detainees held in U.S. facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan , many of whom died while being interrogated .
The documents show that detainees were hooded , gagged , strangled , beaten with blunt objects , subjected to sleep deprivation and to hot and cold environmental conditions .
" " There is no question that U.S. interrogations have resulted in deaths , " " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" " High - ranking officials who knew about the torture and sat on their hands and those who created and endorsed these policies must be held accountable .
America must stop putting its head in the sand and deal with the torture scandal that has rocked our military . " "
The documents released today include 44 autopsies and death reports as well as a summary of autopsy reports of individuals apprehended in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The documents show that detainees died during or after interrogations by Navy Seals , Military Intelligence and " " OGA " " ( Other Governmental Agency ) -- a term , according to the ACLU , that is commonly used to refer to the CIA .
According to the documents , 21 of the 44 deaths were homicides .
Eight of the homicides appear to have resulted from abusive techniques used on detainees , in some instances , by the CIA , Navy Seals and Military Intelligence personnel .
The autopsy reports list deaths by " " strangulation , " " " " asphyxiation " " and " " blunt force injuries . " "
An overwhelming majority of the so - called " " natural deaths " " were attributed to " " Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease . " "
While newspapers have recently reported deaths of detainees in CIA custody , today 's documents show that the problem is pervasive , involving Navy Seals and Military Intelligence too .
The records reveal the following facts :
A 27 - year - old Iraqi male died while being interrogated by Navy Seals on April 5 , 2004 , in Mosul , Iraq .
During his confinement he was hooded , flex - cuffed , sleep deprived and subjected to hot and cold environmental conditions , including the use of cold water on his body and hood .
The exact cause of death was " " undetermined " " although the autopsy stated that hypothermia may have contributed to his death .
Notes say he " " struggled / interrogated / died sleeping . " "
Some facts relating to this case have been previously reported .
( In April 2003 , Secretary Rumsfeld authorized the use of " " environmental manipulation " " as an interrogation technique in Guantánamo Bay .
In September 2003 , Lt. Gen. Sanchez also authorized this technique for use in Iraq .
Although Lt. Gen. Sanchez later rescinded the September 2003 techniques , he authorized " " changes in environmental quality " " in October 2003 . )
An Iraqi detainee ( also described as a white male ) died on January 9 , 2004 , in Al Asad , Iraq , while being interrogated by " " OGA . " "
He was standing , shackled to the top of a door frame with a gag in his mouth at the time he died .
The cause of death was asphyxia and blunt force injuries .
Notes summarizing the autopsies record the circumstances of death as " " Q by OGA , gagged in standing restraint . " "
( Facts in the autopsy report appear to match the previously reported case of Abdul Jaleel . )
A detainee was smothered to death during an interrogation by Military Intelligence on November 26 , 2003 , in Al Qaim , Iraq .
A previously released autopsy report , that appears to be of General Mowhoush , lists " " asphyxia due to smothering and chest compression " " as the cause of death and cites bruises from the impact with a blunt object .
New documents specifically record the circumstances of death as " " Q by MI , died during interrogation . " "
A detainee at Abu Ghraib Prison , captured by Navy Seal Team number seven , died on November 4 , 2003 , during an interrogation by Navy Seals and " " OGA . " "
A previously released autopsy report , that appears to be of Manadel Al Jamadi , shows that the cause of his death was " " blunt force injury complicated by compromised respiration . " "
New documents specifically record the circumstances of death as " " Q by OGA and NSWT died during interrogation . " "
An Afghan civilian died from " " multiple blunt force injuries to head , torso and extremities " " on November 6 , 2003 , at a Forward Operating Base in Helmand Province , Afghanistan .
( Facts in the autopsy report appear to match the previously reported case of Abdul Wahid . )
A 52 - year - old male Iraqi was strangled to death at the Whitehorse detainment facility on June 6 , 2003 , in Nasiriyah , Iraq .
His autopsy also revealed bone and rib fractures , and multiple bruises on his body .
( Facts in the autopsy report appear to match the previously reported case of Nagm Sadoon Hatab . )
The ACLU has previously released autopsy reports for two detainees who were tortured by U.S. forces in Bagram , Afghanistan , believed to be Mullah Habibullah and an Afghan man known as Dilawar .
" " These documents present irrefutable evidence that U.S. operatives tortured detainees to death during interrogations , " " said Amrit Singh , an attorney with the ACLU .
" " The public has a right to know who authorized the use of torture techniques and why these deaths have been covered up . " "
The documents were released by the Department of Defense in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU , the Center for Constitutional Rights , Physicians for Human Rights , Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans for Peace .
The New York Civil Liberties Union is co-counsel in the case .
As part of the FOIA lawsuit brought by the ACLU , a federal judge recently ordered the Defense Department to turn over photographs and videotapes depicting the abuse of prisoners held by the United States at Abu Ghraib .
That decision has been stayed until October 26 .
The government has not yet indicated whether it is going to appeal the court 's decision .
The FOIA lawsuit is being handled by Lawrence Lustberg and Megan Lewis of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons , Del Deo , Dolan , Griffinger & Vecchione , P.C. Other attorneys in the case are Singh , Jameel Jaffer , and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the NYCLU ; and Barbara Olshansky of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
To date , more than 77,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
The ACLU has been posting these documents online at www.aclu.org/torturefoia.
The documents released today are available online at http://action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush defended on Thursday his attorney general nominee Michael Mukasey , who has come under fire from Senate Democrats for refusing to say whether an interrogation technique that simulates drowning is illegal torture .
Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey litsens to a question on his second day of Senate confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington October 18 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
“ I believe the questions he ’s been asked are unfair , ” Bush said in an Oval Office session with reporters .
“ He ’s been asked to give opinions of a program -- or techniques of a program -- on which he has not been briefed . ”
Bush ’s effort to win Senate confirmation for Mukasey has run into trouble as Democrats have criticized his refusal to reject the widely denounced interrogation technique known as waterboarding , or simulated drowning , as unlawful torture .
Bush later linked the debate to his declared war on terrorism and suggested that senators were hampering his administration ’s ability to pursue suspected terrorists by failing to swiftly approve Mukasey , a retired judge and former prosecutor .
“ This is no time for Congress to weaken the Department of Justice by denying it a strong and effective leader , ” Bush said in a speech to the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank .
Critics have accused the United States of torturing suspects in the war on terrorism , with the CIA reportedly using waterboarding after the September 11 attacks .
Despite Bush ’s assurances that he prohibits torture , it is unclear how detainees are treated since he refuses to disclose interrogation techniques .
“ There ’s an enemy out there .
I do n’t want them to understand , to be able to adjust one way or the other , ” Bush told reporters .
“ The American people have got to understand the program is important and the techniques used are within the law . ”
Bush said of Mukasey , “ He does n’t know whether we use that technique or not . ”
‘ REPUGNANT TO ME ’
Mukasey wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s 10 Democrats on Tuesday that waterboarding , as they described it to him , is “ repugnant to me . ”
But he said he did not know if U.S. interrogation methods violate laws against torture .
Democrats initially praised Mukasey after Bush nominated him last month to succeed Alberto Gonzales , who resigned under pressure .
But Mukasey ’s statements about waterboarding have raised some doubts about his prospects for confirmation .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to vote on Tuesday whether to send Mukasey ’s nomination to the full Senate for confirmation .
Some Democrats have already said they plan to oppose Mukasey , including Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts .
“ Waterboarding is torture .
Period .
Yet Judge Mukasey refuses to say so , ” said Kennedy , a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
He said a failure to denounce the “ barbaric ” practice would put U.S. troops at risk because it would undermine the Geneva Conventions ban on torture .
But Mukasey got some support from two influential Republicans , Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , who said they were satisfied with his statement that waterboarding was repugnant .
“ We share Judge Mukasey ’s revulsion at the use of waterboarding , ” the senators said in a joint statement .
They urged Mukasey , after he is confirmed , to make clear publicly that he believes waterboarding is illegal .
McCain , a presidential candidate and former prisoner of war , has been an outspoken critic of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques .
Mukasey ’s views on waterboarding are of interest to the lawmakers because as attorney general he would advise the White House and intelligence agencies on what techniques are permissible .
If he declares now that waterboarding is illegal , that could put pressure on him to investigate and prosecute past cases where it was used by the CIA in a secret program of interrogating foreign terrorism suspects , said legislative counsel Christopher Anderson of the American Civil Liberties Union .
After reading the full investigative piece in the NYT today on how this administration decided on breaking America 's historic ban on torture and then pursued a long , corrupting policy of ensuring that the interpretation of the law was politicized to keep torture alive , it is hard to disagree with Marty Lederman :
Between this and Jane Mayer 's explosive article in August about the CIA black sites , I am increasingly confident that when the history of the Bush Administration is written , this systematic violation of statutory and treaty - based law concerning fundamental war crimes and other horrific offenses will be seen as the blackest mark in our nation 's recent history -- not only because of what was done , but because the programs were routinely sanctioned , on an ongoing basis , by numerous esteemed professionals -- lawyers , doctors , psychologists and government officers -- without whose approval such a systematized torture regime could not be sustained .
The way in which conservative lawyers , and conservative intellectuals , and conservative journalists aided and abetted these war crimes ; the way in which the president of the United States revealed so much contempt for the law that he put a candidate to run the Office of Legal Counsel on probation before he appointed him in order to keep the torture regime in place , the way in which Republicans and Democrats in the Congress pathetically refused to stand up to these violations of American honor and decency in any serious way ( and , I 'm sorry , Senator McCain , but in the end , you caved , as you always do lately ) : these will go down in history as some of the most shameful decisions these people ever made .
Perhaps a sudden , panicked decision by the president to use torture after 9/11 is understandable if unforgivable .
But the relentless , sustained attempt to make torture permanent part of the war - powers of the president , even to the point of abusing the law beyond recognition , removes any benefit of the doubt from these people .
And they did it all in secret - and lied about it when Abu Ghraib emerged .
They upended two centuries of American humane detention and interrogation practices without even letting us know .
And the decision to allow one man - the decider - to pre-empt and knowingly distort the rule of law in order to detain and torture anyone he wants - is a function not of conservatism , but of fascism .
James Comey - one of the principled conservatives , like Jack Goldsmith , who actually supported the rule of law and American decency - put it succinctly enough :
" We are likely to hear the words : ' If we do n’t do this , people will die , ' " Mr. Comey said .
But he argued that government lawyers must uphold the principles of their great institutions .
" It takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say no ’ when it matters most , " he said .
" It takes moral character .
It takes an understanding that in the long run , intelligence under law is the only sustainable intelligence in this country . "
A couple of things need to be stressed , because I 've learned the hard way that intelligent people simply refuse to absorb what is staring them in the face , when what is staring them in the face is so staggering :
Never in history had the United States authorized such tactics .
There is no doubt - no doubt at all - that these tactics are torture and subject to prosecution as war crimes .
We know this because the law is very clear when you do n't have war criminals like AEI 's John
Yoo rewriting it to give one man unchecked power .
We know this because the very same techniques - hypothermia , long - time standing , beating - and even the very same term " enhanced interrogation techniques " - " verschaerfte Vernehmung " in the original German - were once prosecuted by American forces as war crimes .
The perpetrators were the Gestapo .
The penalty was death .
You can verify the history here .
We have war criminals in the White House .
What are we going to do about it ?

Random Walks , Markov Chains and the Monte Carlo Method
Dr. Everett F. Carter Jr .
Taygeta Scientific Inc .
A look at some of the practical considerations when making calculations based upon Monte Carlo type methods .
The kind of Monte Carlo calculation we will consider .
Random number generation Pseudo - random numbers Quasi- random numbers Nonuniform distributions
Monte Carlo integration with quasi-random numbers
Solution to large linear algebra problems using Markov chains
Generalization to solution of integral equations solving Fredholm integral equations of the second kind
The only good Monte Carlo is a dead Monte Carlo Trotter & Tukey , 1954
The class of algorithms that solve problems probabilistically are known by the ( purposely ) colorful name of Monte Carlo methods .
There are two types of Monte Carlo methods :
Simple Monte Carlo --
The direct modeling of a random process .
( e.g. queueing problems ) .
--
The direct modeling of a random process .
( e.g. queueing problems ) .
Sophisticated Monte Carlo methods recast deterministic problems in probabilistic terms .
Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is , of course , in a state of sin .
John Von Neumann ( 1951 )
There are many subtle problems that can occur and various compromises have to be made in order to even pretend to generate random numbers with a computer .
A good random number generator must reasonably represent a known probability distribution function ( usually uniform over some finite domain ) .
We do not want any built in trends , biases , or periodicities .
We usually do not the value generated at a given time to be correlated in any way with previous values .
Use a trustworthy , long period random number generator .
The generator built in to your compiler is not trustworthy .

50 Frugal Christmas Ideas
Christmas is quickly approaching , and it ’s time to start planning .
I ’ve found that if I take the time to PLAN a frugal holiday season , I get less caught up in the urge to spend once December is here .
With that in mind , here are 50 frugal things you can do to celebrate the holiday season .
1. Read a book a day .
Buy 24 children ’s Christmas books ( I bought them used to save money ) , wrap them up , then have your children unwrap one book a day starting December first .
We re-wrap the same books year after year , and my family looks forward to reading our Christmas favorites .
Apparently Mary Hunt devotes a section of Debt - Proof the Holidays to this tradition , so head to the library and check it out !
2. Celebrate Advent with an Advent Wreath .
You can even make the wreath yourself .
That ’s more frugal than buying one .
There ’s even a “ no - flame ” version for families who have young children .
3. Pray for people send you Christmas Cards .
A good time to do this is after dinner .
Or pray for them during your advent time , if you ’re using the advent wreath .
4. Attend a Christmas pageant in your community .
Many churches and schools put them on .
Check your paper or call your local churches to find one .
This year one of our local churches is putting on a production of Narnia .
I ca n’t wait !
5 . Have a family slumber party in the living room .
Pull out the sleeping bags and turn on the Christmas lights .
Just enjoy being together as a family .
6. Go Christmas caroling .
Grab some friends or just go as a family .
Get to know your neighbors as you bless them with Christmas carols .
7 . See the Christmas lights .
Drive around your town and look at the decked out houses .
Vote on which neighborhood has the best display .
8. Look at pictures from Christmas past .
I do n’t know about your family , but mine likes to look back in time .
Pull out the photo albums .
Tell your children about your Christmas celebrations as a child .
9 . Do a puzzle together .
10 . Bake Christmas cookies .
My daughter and I have been making sugar cookies together every year for a long time .
11 . String popcorn .
12 . Read the Christmas story .
Read it straight out of the Bible , or use a bible storybook if you have young children .
13 . Pick up some library books and study Christmas Traditions in other countries .
This year I ’d like to learn about Sinterklaas with my children , since I am Dutch , and my ancestors celebrated Sinterklaas .
14 . Host a White Elephant gift exchange .
These are so fun .
With the right group of people , you ’ll be rolling in laughter .
If you ’ve never hosted a white elephant gift exchange before , the instructions can be found here .
Now where did I put that rubber chicken ?
15 . Make your own gifts .
My personal favorites are gifts in a jar and homemade calendars .
Gift baskets are also fun .
There are a ton of gift mixes at Food Gifts From Your Kitchen .
16 . Participate in Charitable Activities .
We like to fill shoe boxes for children the same ages as our children .
Our children help us shop and at the same time learn that Christmas is about giving , not getting .
17 . Make paper snowflakes with your kids .
If you want a real challenge , make a 3 - D paper snowflake .
18 . Make a paper chain to count down the days until Christmas .
Alternate green and red construction paper .
You can attach the chain to a paper cross or Christmas tree and hang it up on your child ’s wall .
Each night before bed take off a link .
On Christmas Eve , the child takes off the last link , and then gets so excited that she ca n’t sleep .
Oh wait …that happened to me .
Hopefully it wo n’t happen to you . :)
19 . Have a Christmas movie marathon .
Get the movies from the library if you want to be really frugal .
Some of our favorites are The Polar Express , Miracle on 34th Street , and A Christmas Story .
20 . Invite some friends or family over for dinner .
It does n’t have to be formal .
Just enjoy the company .
Make it a potluck .
Or have a soup night .
Have everyone bring their favorite soup in a crock - pot .
21 . Make a gingerbread house .
You can try the ambitious way , or you can make one the easy way .
22 . Visit a nursing home or an elderly shut in .
The holidays can be a difficult time for those who have lost loved ones .
Visit an elderly person with no family nearby .
Bring some flowers , food , or a homemade Christmas card .
It will brighten their day …and yours .
23 . Attend your community tree - lighting ceremony .
Many communities have them , and they are festive occasions .
If you do n’t mind the crowds , tree - lighting ceremonies can be a lot of fun .
24 . Put on some Christmas music and dance with your spouse and children .
25 . Learn the history of Santa .
I think it ’s pretty fascinating .
26 . Track Santa on NORAD .
27 . Make candy .
Our favorites are fudge and peanut brittle .
28 . Make a Paper Mache snowman .
29 .
Play in the snow .
30 . Simmer some hot cider .
There are many good recipes out there .
Or if you ’re lazy , just heat up some bottled cider .
31 . Go ice skating .
Ice skating rinks frequently have special rates when kids are out of school for the holiday break .
Call your local rink to find out about specials .
32 . Have a birthday party for Jesus .
Make a cake , invite the neighborhood kids over , and have a party .
For gifts , you could give time or make a commitment to read your Bible , pray … whatever you can think of !
33 . Watch the Christmas specials on TV .
My personal favorites are Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer , How the Grinch Stole Christmas , and A Charlie Brown Christmas .
34 . Send a card with a Christmas postmark to someone special .
You can have letters postmarked at the North Pole , Bethlehem , Noel , and many more interesting places .
35 . Read The Best Christmas Pageant Ever with your family .
If you ’ve never read it , you should .
It ’s really funny !
36 . Hang mistletoe .
Then kiss your sweetie .
37 .
Make your own Christmas cards .
Have everyone pitch in .
Family Fun has some good ideas .
38 . Write a Christmas letter , with everyone in the family telling their own story of the past year .
Our friends do this .
They start the letter with “ Dad ’s Turn ” and work their way down to the youngest child ’s turn .
It ’s fun to read everyone ’s differing perspective on the past year .
39 .
Make a video and send it to far away relatives for Christmas .
We did this for years .
We ’d sing songs , tell stories , and just have a good time .
Our relatives appreciated seeing how the kids had grown over the year .
40 . Make Christmas ornaments .
41 . Cut your own Christmas tree .
In Oregon you can buy a permit to go to a designated place in the forest to cut a tree .
The permits are $ 5.00 .
You ca n’t beat that .
If you do n’t have a forest , try a Christmas tree farm .
It ’s more expensive , but still often cheaper than buying from a lot .
Of course the most frugal option would be to buy a fake tree to use year after year .
But if you like live trees , cutting your own is the way to go .
42 . Take a walk and collect pine - cones , acorns and the like for decorations .
43 . Make an Advent Calendar .
You could make a simple paper calendar .
Or if you ’re more crafty , you could make something more complicated .
There are many options .
44 . Make a Jesse Tree .
45 . Fix a special Christmas breakfast .
I usually make the Land of Nod Cinnamon Buns and Christmas Breakfast Sausage Casserole .
I like these recipes , because the bulk of the preparation is done the day before .
46 . Hold an open house .
Send invites to all your friends , telling them to stop by your house between the hours of two and five .
Set out simple finger foods , and enjoy socializing .
47 .
Take your family ’s picture in front of the Christmas tree .
Make it a yearly tradition .
48 . Send a card to a U.S. soldier that you know .
If you do n’t know a U.S. soldier , consider making a donation to an organization that supports the troops .
Or contact your local National Guard to see how you can help .
Thanks , boomeyers , for correcting me .
49 . Record your children singing their favorite Christmas carols .
Children ’s voices change so much over the years .
Twenty years from now , you ’ll be glad to have the recording .
50 . Go to a Christmas Eve Service .
It ’s completely free , and it will put you in the right frame of mind to celebrate the true meaning of Christmas .
Whatever you do , slow down and enjoy the season .
Do n’t get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of Christmas that you forget to take time to enjoy your loved ones .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday April 26 2007
The article below about abstinence programmes in the US was accompanied by a photograph of teenage girls holding silver rings .
The caption to the photograph suggested that the Silver Ring Thing was one of the programmes included in the research mentioned in the article , but this was not the case .
This photograph has now been deleted .
It 's been a central plank of George Bush 's social policy : to stop teenagers having sex .
More than $ 1bn of federal money has been spent on promoting abstinence since 1998 - posters printed , television adverts broadcast and entire education programmes devised for hundreds of thousands of girls and boys .
The trouble is , new research suggests that it has n't worked .
At all .
A survey of more than 2,000 teenagers carried out by a research company on behalf of Congress found that the half of the sample given abstinence - only education displayed exactly the same predilection for sex as those who had received conventional sex education in which contraception was discussed .
Mathematica Policy
Research sampled teenagers with an average age of 16 from a cross-section of communities in Florida , Wisconsin , Mississippi and Virginia .
Both control groups had the same breakdown of behaviour : 23 % in both sets had had sex in the previous year and always used a condom , 17 % had sex only sometimes using a condom ; and 4 % had sex never using one .
About a quarter of each group had had sex with three or more partners .
Since his days as governor of Texas , George Bush has been a firm advocate of abstinence education programmes , which teach that keeping zipped up is the only certain way to avoid unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , and that to deviate from the norms of human sexual activity is to risk harmful psychological and physical effects .
" Abstinence has n't been given a very good chance , but it 's worked when it 's tried .
That 's for certain , " he said .
But even in 1990s Texas , where Mr Bush spent $ 10 m a year on abstinence education , the state had the fifth highest teen pregnancy rate in the US .
Over the past six years he has stepped up the programme to more than $ 100 m a year .
He recently braved ridicule by extending it to adults aged 20 - 29 , an age range in which 90 % of people are sexually active .
In the Mathematica survey , which was released by sex education activists after the health department sat on it , the mean age at which the control group , that had been taught about contraception , lost their virginity was 14.9 years .
That seems strikingly low , until you look at the mean age of first sexual experience for the abstinence control group - 14.9 years .
In the context of findings like this , health workers and statisticians conclude that it is far better that children have safe sex , with knowledge of and access to contraception , than that they are preached a message of abstinence only to ignore it .
Federal funding for abstinence education began as a small part of Mr Clinton 's welfare reforms but was stepped up substantially by the Bush administration .
Its supporters claim that the fact that though teenaged pregnancies have fallen in the US from a high of 62.1 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 in 1991 to 41.1 births per 1,000 in 2004 shows the campaign is working .
But the Mathematica findings , building on earlier research , cast that optimism in doubt .
Anti-abstinence activists have long argued that the movement is dangerous because it leaves young people exposed to the risk of teen pregnancy and infection because the teaching shuns any mention of condoms or contraception .
Of about 19 m new STD infections in the US each year , almost half are recorded among people aged 15 to 24 .

Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards talked with Keith Olbermann on Countdown about his take on the campaign so far , President Clinton 's statement that he was against the war , how out of touch the Republicans are with mainstream Americans and of course , the cavalcade of gifts they handed the Democrats in last night 's debate .
Edwards and Olbermann made light of way the right ( I 'm looking at you , Michelle Malkin , although it made Joe Scarborough an angry little Republican this morning as well ) is going nutty over the fact that a Hillary Clinton volunteer -- who , by the way , was a registered Republican and a member of the Log Cabin Republicans and has contributed no money to the Clinton campaign - - was allowed to ask a question during the debate last night .
As Keith put it , if the Republicans can't handle the Democrats , how can they handle Al Qaeda ?

Of late , many of the nation 's literati have preoccupied themselves with a mendacious New York Times op - ed column by a couple of think tank hacks named Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack , the burden of which is that , by golly , the glorious Surge really is working .
Of course , the whole thing was a put - up job , sold on the man - bites - dog pretence that the two authors were longtime critics of the Bush administration who had gone to Iraq and seen the light .
Their performance is deftly skewered here .
But as edifying as it might be for us to wallow in the discrediting of Messrs .
O'Hanlon and Pollack , the piece is rather unimportant in itself — merely one of a thousand bits of semi-official war propaganda , essentially backward - looking as it attempts to vindicate the disastrous decision to invade and occupy Iraq .
Our eyes alighted upon a more fruitful field for analysis in the form of a column by two other think tank hacks , Ivo Daalder of the Brookings Institution ( not coincidentally , the place of employment for Mr. O'Hanlon as well ) , and Robert Kagan of the catastrophically misnamed Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
The piece is ominously titled " The Next Intervention . "
Just when we thought two cloddishly mismanaged wars at the same time in Iraq and Afghanistan might chill the American appetite for military intervention , the authors rush to assure us that the dreadful prospect of a few years of peace can be safely ruled out .
Why ?
" Despite the problems and setbacks in Iraq and Afghanistan , America remains the world ’s dominant military power , spends half a trillion dollars a year on defense and faces no peer strong enough to deter it if it chooses to act . "
Might makes right apparently .
Rather than fighting on behalf of some morally unimpeachable cause , the principal reason the authors advance for going to war is because we can do it .
This is , in fact , the opposite of " peace through strength , " and suggests that critics of Pentagon spending were right all along in their assertion that more spending equals more war .
Mindful of the idiotic way in which the Bush administration handled diplomacy in the run-up to their Mesopotamian Blitzkrieg , the authors concede that getting other countries to sign off on our wars is a good thing .
For one thing , it sells war to the Better Sort of People in America ( the ones who shop at Whole Foods , watch PBS , can find foreign countries on a map , and are likely to be reading one 's op - ed in the Washington Post ) : " It matters to Americans , who want to believe they are acting justly and are troubled if others accuse them of selfish , immoral or otherwise illegitimate behavior . "
Horrors , the mortification of being accused , as a right - thinking American , of such low - class behavior !
As well to receive a nasty letter from one ’s homeowner ’s association berating one for not cutting the lawn .
After all , if the Frogs are on board as well as the Brits , it makes the war more Atlanticist and gives everyone a dose of righteous nostalgia for the Euro - American solidarity of the cold war .
But the problem , as Messrs .
Daalder and Kagan see it , is that damned United Nations .
We are n't ever likely again to be in a situation like 1950 , when the Russians boycotted the Security Council , so there will always be a permanent member able and willing to veto a U.S. military intervention .
We need to overcome this problem because , as the authors pompously remind us , " Toppling Saddam Hussein was a just act and therefore was inherently legitimate . "
That is no doubt a great comfort to the next of kin of the 600,000 or so " excess mortalities " that the British medical journal Lancet estimates have occurred pursuant to the U.S. invasion .
The solution ? — a " Concert of the Democracies " to replace the United Nations .
One can almost hear the director cuing the inspirational music , à la the " Why We Fight " series .
Nowhere , of course , do the authors define what a democracy is .
If it means majoritarianism via one - man - one - vote , then the U.S. Senate and the Electoral College would have difficulty passing muster .
If it means the rule of law maintained by such bedrock principles as habeas corpus , there will be a lot of embarrassed coughing behind the hand in Washington 's think tanks .
Even on more practical grounds , one can find insuperable problems with this scheme .
One could point to any number of indubitable democracies in Latin America that , from bitter experience , would hesitate a long time before giving a blank check to Washington to intervene wherever it liked .
In all likelihood , the authors ' vision , were it ever realized , would amount to no more that the same " coalition of the willing " we have in Iraq , i.e. , a smallish group of subservient and / or well - bribed countries .
It has , in fact , always been the administration 's preference to act as the capo among a group of clients , rather than as one sovereign country dealing with others of the same status .
The op - ed piece so neatly fits the administration 's line , in fact , that it might as well have been drafted in the White House basement .
Much has been written about the military industrial complex : its obscene cost overruns ; the corrupt relations between the uniformed military , the contractors , and Congress ; the wild threat inflation .
Too little studied has been the role of ostensibly non-partisan think tanks as the semi-official propaganda arm of the complex , and as the transmission belt of propaganda themes between the government and the prestige press .
While the activity of the American Enterprise Institute as a propaganda organ is widely known because of its tub - thumping for the Iraq war and its championing of Iranian spy Achmed Chalibi , the same charge applies , to a greater or lesser degree , to most of the " prestige " think tanks : Brookings , Carnegie , CSIS , the Hudson Institute , etc .
They are an integral part of the government 's two - track propaganda machine for selling war .
For the downscale end of the market , Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , or Michael Savage will do nicely .
Their braying voices and crude arguments are finely calibrated to reach every low - status white male out in satellite dish country .
The notion that it 's even theoretically a good idea to have world opinion on America 's side before it embarks on war would be derided as sissy stuff in such precincts .
One recalls the eve of the Iraq war , when the visceral hatred of the French in the Murdoch gutter press actually exceeded the vituperation against Saddam Hussein .
But to convince the professionals , the academics , the people who show up at the various world affairs councils which dot the provinces , it is critically useful to have mediators like Messrs .
Daalder and Kagan .
The Better Sort roughly corresponds to the National Bourgeoisie in Wilhelmine Germany or the outer Nomenklatura in the Soviet Union .
They may not send their kids to war in any appreciable numbers , but their support for war is crucial to any administration .
The more tender - minded of the Better Sort , in particular , lust in a most alarming way for some sort of “ humanitarian ” intervention they could support .
It is the task of the Daalders and Kagans to toss around terms like “ genocide ” to provide a humanitarian gloss to whichever invasion advocacy project they are promoting at the moment .
1
Note as well , that in the division of propaganda labor between the roughneck demagogues and the think tank chin-scratchers , the propaganda themes to promote a given policy are disparate or even contradictory .
The Limbaughs and the O’Reillys sell a frank brand of gutter patriotism emphasizing the joys of killing foreigners .
If there is any policy reason that appeals to the target audience , it is likely to be something direct and tangible , like the acquisition of valuable resources such as oil .
On the flip side , the fear used to motivate Limbaugh Nation is some comic book level bugaboo , such as the notion that an Islamic army will physically invade and conquer America .
2
That sort of thing wo n’t sell with the Better Sort .
Ideally , we are fighting , after a vigorous and probing national debate , and much searching of souls , for a better world , to prevent genocide , to stop female circumcision , or for credibility with our allies .
If there is an overriding fear that motivates the Better Sort , it is that old nemesis of the MacNeil - Lehrer set , “ regional instability . ”
While the lumpenproles seethe with apocalyptic visions of hand - to - hand combat with the minions of the Caliphate in downtown Paducah , the Better Sort ’s fantasies parse like a graduate seminar from hell .
Mr. Daalder and Mr. Kagan are only too happy to feed the conceits of the class that nurtured them on behalf of the government that employs them at one remove .
The day before yesterday it was Vietnam ; yesterday it was Kosovo ; today it is Iraq .
Tomorrow it could be Iran , or Belarus , or Venezuela , or any one of a dozen prospects .
The duty of the think tank hacks is to make war seem not only inevitable , but respectable in the eyes of the Better Sort .
One rather doubts a bunch of fuzzy - minded do - gooders was able to finance the recent campaign to intervene in Darfur that included full - page advertisements in the prestige papers and 60 - second spots on television ; there must have been more substantial interests involved .
Although the “ invade Sudan ” lobby has thus far failed in its aim , it must be admitted that the target country of Sudan was a poor prospect : with a head of government not one person in ten thousand could name , it lacked an identifiable Hitler ; and with a technology base more suited to the stone age than the space age , the fearmongers and threat inflators could hardly suggest WMD without eliciting laughter .
When President Clinton dispatched cruise missiles against a Khartoum aspirin factory , the operation was not wildly popular , even among normally bellicose Republicans .
One suspects the latter regarded it as an unwelcome distraction from their relentless drive to impeach him .
If so , it was a rare case of domestic concerns trumping national security issues .
Lest the reader think we exaggerate here , internet columnist Glenn Greenwald has written about exactly how prevalent this fantasy is among the Right Wing .

The Best of Werther
E for All was all about offering the public a taste of the gaming convention action previously reserved for industry professionals ( and peeps with the temerity to sneak in ) .
While Nintendo was able to draw a crowd without really trying thanks to playable demos of Smash Bros and Galaxy , not to mention its short skirted hosts , those who ventured away from the big N's space could also get their hands on some hot new hardware .
Most interesting among the various demonstrations was the premier of TN Games ' 3rd Space Gaming Vest .
The device , which bears a degree of resemblance to the flack jackets that contractors wear in Iraq , is buckled relatively tightly to the wearer and connected to the PC via USB .
Another cord leads to an external controller box and air compressor .
We 've seen various attempts at body - force feedback before but all were based on sound , generally big bass drivers to punch players with omni-directional oomph .
The 3rd Space Vest , on the other hand , uses an air compressor to intelligently inflate eight air bags inlaid into the vest .
When triggered , the air bags inflate rapidly enough to feel like rather noticeable taps .
The purpose of the whole operation at this point is to give FPS gamers the advantage of being able to feel where their character is being damaged .
Taps across the back rather pointedly alert the wearer that he is being shot , bit , or mauled from behind .
As opposed to the screen suddenly flashing red when damage is taken , you actually feel incoming fire and react more hastily to avoid it .
We can speak from experience when we say it 's a pretty good effect .
The 3rd Space Vest was actually invented by a medical surgeon who repurposed some older medical technology to create the vests .
Rather happily , Dr. Ombrellaro has succeeded in getting TN Games off the ground rather efficiently , and will be releasing the 3rd Space Vest to the general public in November .
Retail will be $ 189 , and the vest will be packed with two games : a homegrown title known as 3rd Space Incursion and a special edition of Call of Duty II .
Patechs will be offered for Quake 3 and 4 as well as Doom 3 at launch .
TN Games will also make an SDK kit available for developers , and potentially dedicated consumers , to build support for other FPS titles .
TN Games will launch a number of models and colors .
Both large and small sizes will be available , and colors will include black , camo , desert camo , and pink .
We 're told various upgrades , like higher PSI air compressors , will also be offered to make the sensation even more striking .
MOGADISHU ( Reuters ) - Fighting raged for a second day in the Somali capital on Sunday as Ethiopian troops clashed with Islamist - led rebels in the heaviest battles for weeks .

Fearful residents cowered behind closed doors as mostly Ethiopian forces supporting the interim government sought again to crush heavily armed insurgents .
Marking a major offensive , gun and artillery duels that began in Mogadishu before dawn on Saturday resumed in force .
In one part of the coastal city , local media said insurgents had seized a police station after the officers guarding it fled .
Elsewhere , scores of angry residents took to the streets to vent their fury at the latest violence , burning piles of tires that sent plumes of thick black smoke into the sky .
“ They have started firing again and I have no way to move my family , ” said Sahra Osman , a widow with five children .
“ I have been fleeing my home and returning since the Ethiopian troops arrived here , but now I ca n’t even hire a wheelbarrow . ”
She lambasted both sides for fighting in the city centre among thousands of women and children , instead of picking a remote rural location .
At least 15 people have been killed so far , local media says , including as many as seven Ethiopian soldiers .
Dozens of civilians have been wounded by stray bullets and shrapnel .
HOSPITALS CUT OFF
Elmi Hussein , a Mogadishu man whose cousin died in Saturday ’s battles , said it was better to be killed outright than to suffer the fate of the injured in the Somali capital .
“ The wounded die painfully here , ” he told Reuters .
“ The roads to the hospitals are always blocked whenever war starts and people die from loss of blood . ”
The fragile Somali government , which has U.N. backing , has been shaken by an insurgency of Iraq - style roadside bombings , assassinations and suicide attacks since it routed a hard - line Islamist movement in January with the help of Ethiopian tanks and warplanes .
On Saturday , Ethiopia ’s arch - foe Eritrea suggested Addis Ababa might soon withdraw some of its troops from Somalia as part of a plot to invade Eritrea ahead of a late - November deadline for the two nations to agree on their disputed border .
Ethiopia has denied all such Eritrean allegations in the past , but the new fighting in Mogadishu looked to mark a renewed effort by Ethiopian forces to crush the insurgents .
The latest battles with the rebels , which Somalia ’s government says include foreign fighters linked to al Qaeda , come as tensions at the top of the fledgling Somali administration threaten to split it wide open .
Analysts say President Abdullahi Yusuf and Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi have feuded almost from the moment they came to power in late 2004 following two years of peace talks in Kenya .
But their rift widened this year after they backed rival concerns hoping to exploit the nation ’s potential oil resources .
Draft Snake Tip
1. Seal Those Drafts
Worried about high heating oil prices this winter ?
Stop letting heated air seep out of your dwelling by finding and plugging up leaks with caulking or weather - stripping .
Try the incense test : carefully hold a lit stick up to joints .
Where smoke wavers , you have a leak .
Work those windows , curtains and blinds : when you need extra warmth , open them up to let the sun 's rays in .
Close them at night to give more insulation against cold .
Place a rolled bath towel or custom - made ' draft snake ' across the bottom of leaky doors and windows .
Simply reducing drafts can cut heating energy use 5 to 30 % , according to the U.S. Department of Energy , which can add up to hundreds of dollars .
Press Freedom Under Attack Big Brother Eyes German Journalists
In the wake of 9/11 , European countries have been busy enacting controversial mandatory data retention laws .
Now draft legislation by the German government would make it easier to monitor virtually all communications by journalists -- effectively ending source confidentiality and press freedom .
On Tuesday , BetaNews reported on the acceptance by the US Copyright Royalty Board ( CRB ) of a proposal put forth by a consortium of recording industry representatives , whereby Internet streaming radio sites would be responsible for royalties for the music they play , the total of which would substantially exceed their annual revenue , probably forcing many to shut down .
Our story generated a lot of buzz in the streaming radio community , which prompted prominent members of that industry to share with us some more up - to - date statistics .
With these facts in hand , BetaNews is able to make more accurate projections about what major and minor streaming radio providers - including terrestrial radio stations with Internet services - are likely to pay in royalty fees .
Using new facts presented to us by several sources , especially Eric Ronning , managing partner of online radio advertising firm Ronning Lipset Radio , BetaNews can project with some confidence that the SoundExchange group would become a $ 2.3 billion dollar per year business should the rates the CRB accepted last week finally become ratified .

What radio stations pay today
For our research , we wanted to compare what streaming radio providers would be charged by SoundExchange against the fees that broadcast radio stations today pay to the three major performance royalty organizations ( PRO ) - ASCAP , BMI , and SESAC .
While indeed , some radio stations do pay as little as $ 972 per year in total royalty fees to PROs , as BetaNews reported Tuesday , in practice , we 've since learned this is n't an average that applies to all stations , and major metropolitan radio stations do pay significantly more .
Nonetheless , there 's still a considerable gap between PRO fees and SoundExchange 's proposed " per-performance " fees , as our updated statistics demonstrates .
Radio stations collectively bargain for the royalty fees they pay to PROs ; and as Keith Meehan , the executive director of the Radio Music License Committee , kindly explained to us today , the compromises these bargaining parties make effectively set a cap on how much PROs can collect from all stations combined .
As Meehan explained , in 2002 for ASCAP and 2003 for BMI , the two organizations calculated the amount of maximum royalty collections they could each live with , based on a percentage of radio stations ' estimated revenue retroactive to 2001 .
Then they agreed to stop using stations ' revenue as a benchmark for determining royalty rates from that time forward , switching instead to a formula that takes the maximum collectable amount for each year , and works it backwards to determine a fair rate that each station can contribute to it .
As a result , we absolutely know the amount of royalties that these two firms are expected to receive for 2006 .
For ASCAP , the agreed upon amount is $ 208,650,000 .
That 's as much as it can collect from radio broadcasters in the US , no more .
For BMI , the figure is $ 208,000,000 even .
No such agreement exists with SESAC .
However , this # 3 firm represents a small percentage of music rights holders , mostly in the religious music category .
An estimate presented to Congress a few years ago stated SESAC collects about 5 % of what the other two PROs take in , combined .
Based on that figure , we can estimate that SESAC is owed about $ 20.8 million in royalties for last year .
Totaling up these figures , the three PROs receive about $ 437.5 million in combined revenue from terrestrial broadcasters ' royalties for 2006 .
BMI is near to settling a continuation of its current agreement with RMLC into successive years , Meehan told us , with ASCAP 's current agreement already extending into 2009 .
By 2010 , BetaNews estimates , these PROs will be slated to receive about $ 550 million in royalties , regardless of the growth rate ( or decline ) of the radio industry .

Darfur ’s hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) will only return to their home villages and areas once security conditions improve and basic services are operating , the top United Nations humanitarian official said today after visiting one of the war - wracked Sudanese region ’s biggest IDP camps .
Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes met with IDP representatives at South Darfur state ’s Ed Daein camp , which is currently home to an estimated 50,000 people .
“ Clearly , after living in camps – in some cases for over three years – they are frustrated , ” he said .
“ While they expressed a strong desire to return to their home areas , all the people I spoke with were unequivocal that they would only be able to do so when security conditions were right and services were in place . ”
In total , at least 2.2 million Darfurians are either internally displaced or live as refugees in neighbouring countries because of fighting between rebels , Government forces , allied militia and tribal groups since 2003 .
More than 200,000 others have been killed .
Mr. Holmes also met today with aid workers to discuss the continuing challenges they face in trying to bring relief in Darfur , where car hijackings , assaults and harassment have become increasingly common .
“ Many organizations also expressed their frustration at bureaucratic impediments which continue to hamper an effective and efficient response , ” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) said in a media statement .
A combination of poor rainfall , infestations and birds mean there could be a poor harvest this season , and UN agencies and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) are warning about a serious food gap emerging , possibly as early as January next year .
While in Nyala , the capital of South Darfur , the Emergency Relief Coordinator held a short meeting with the Wali , or provincial governor , to discuss mutual concerns about the situation .
Tomorrow Mr. Holmes is scheduled to travel to El Fasher , the capital of North Darfur and the home of the planned hybrid UN - African Union peacekeeping mission ( UNAMID ) , for talks with UN staff , partner organizations and local authorities .

One of the methods used by the religious to marginalize atheists and our increasing visibility is to accuse us of becoming that which we originally opposed , or in other words , just like them .
It ’s even better if they have the convenience of one experience with these so - called “ secular fundamentalists ” from which they can draw unfounded conclusions as to the validity of this argument and , ultimately , the character of all those who have no belief in gods , goddesses , or other mythical creatures .
This is the route taken by Michael Brendan Dougherty in the November issue of The American Conservative .
His article , entitled “ Secular Fundamentalists : Can atheists form a movement around shared disbelief ” , uses this year ’s Atheist Alliance International convention as fodder for his clumsy attempt to represent atheism as a new phenomenon comprised of the dogmatically anti-religious .
The title alone is an oxymoron — would Mr. Dougherty mind explaining the fundamentals of secularism before he starts labeling us as adherents to them ?
He tries to use Sam Harris ’ speech about the word “ atheist ” and the subsequent reaction as proof of this claim , pointing out the discomfort of the audience during his speech .
He goes on to assume that Sam Harris would prefer that there be no AAI conference next year , which is only true in one scenario — that in which religion is no longer a menace to society and has been effectively stripped of its power .
Of course , according to Mr. Dougherty , the only reason we get together is to tell jokes about pedophile priests and fight the morality imposed upon us by the “ prudes and prigs ” who surround us , it is really unnecessary since all of this can be done online anyway .
As a matter of fact , most of the conference attendees or those with whom I have spoken regarding Harris ’ speech , which was reprinted in The Washington Post , were pleased to see a dissenting position presented , even if some may have disagreed with that position .
This is an example of the very thing that makes atheism different from religion ; we ’re allowed to ask questions and present our differences of opinion .
There ’s no excommunication from atheism .
Apparently , he hung around for the Q&A , but failed to mention that in my question to Sam , I stated that I agreed conceptually but see no other way to gain any influence as a group by avoiding the one word under which we can unite .
Harris agrees with that , and furthermore , I think that as atheists , we all agree that we would prefer to live in a world in which the word was not even necessary .
Dougherty goes on to the addition of Harris ’ somewhat controversial affinity for meditation .
He adds the jab frequently used against us , that we hate all religions , rather than just not believing in them , and goes on to misrepresent Daniel Dennett ’s comment that he himself had been practicing meditation .
Of course , in his mind , the audience was deeply troubled by this , despite the fact that meditation does not necessarily have a religious connotation and does have scientific evidence to show that similar contemplative practices have health benefits .
Meditation may not be everybody ’s cup of tea , but there were certainly some in the audience who understand this point , but mentioning that would undermine his initial claim that we are “ fundamentalists . ”
So he chooses to be dishonest instead , proclaiming that “ the leaders of unbelief are exposed as potential monks and mystics . ”
At least we still have Hitchens , whom he briefly addresses by using the well - worn “ he ’s just angry at God ” argument .
He then finds it humorous that conference attendees are excited by the opportunity to meet these distinguished individuals , and points out a person that had a conversation with Hitchens and was ecstatic , claiming that this is a form of “ idol worship ” and a religion of its own .
If that is true , then Christians are assuredly in violation of their precious commandments by idolizing their own batch of celebrities such as Rick Warren , Dinesh D’Souza , or Lee Strobel .
Being happy to meet a person that you admire and respect , who has potentially influenced your life through their work , is now a religion , folks .
Again , nothing other than juvenile and amateur attempts to disparage atheists and a simple restatement of that childish taunt , “ I know you are but what am I ? ”
In an egregious violation of journalistic objectivity , he goes on to personally insult Margaret Downey , referring to her as a “ dippy hostess . ”
Margaret has fought for the rights of atheists and gays to join the Boy Scouts , has given a presentation to the United Nations on the discrimination of atheists , and is still the UN expert on atheist discrimination in the US .
She has worked tirelessly for years on end and put her own life at risk to make separation of church and state a reality , not just some words on an aged document .
The fact that he would have the audacity to refer to one of the most influential women in the world of atheism as he did displays the utter lack of respect and contempt that he holds for those who do not worship his imaginary friend , yet he wonders why we feel the need to rally together , speak up , and rattle cages .
The fact that , in his opinion , holding a conference qualifies your group as a “ movement ” is mildly amusing .
I guess that makes attendees of “ Star Trek ” conventions members of a pro-Star Trek movement .
In much the same way that the aforementioned “ Trekkies ” are chided for having their apparel , costumes , and merchandise , Dougherty goes on to more trivial evidences of this subversive “ atheist movement . ”
Apparently , Dougherty finds “ young men with haircuts fit for their mother ’s basement ” a valid point upon which to base an argument that we are nothing more than a “ cranky subculture ” that wants to ridicule religion much as a teenager wants to rebel against his / her parents .
He interestingly notes that we did not view “ The Passion of the Christ ” and instead chose “ Life of Brian ” .
I take it he did n’t consider that we atheists have no desire to watch a man brutally tortured and ultimately murdered for two and a half hours .
I consider that to be a good thing , and would certainly allow my children to watch “ Life of Brian ” before that snuff film of which he apparently approves .
He comes back to the worst insult Christians have to offer , which is the conflation of atheism to a religion itself .
It is about time that atheists come together at conferences and stand up for ourselves in a country dominated by irrationality .
How ironic that the best argument he can muster is that we ’re just like them .
He claims that the conference “ provides plenty of evidence ” by “ [ resembling ] an evangelical retreat weekend . ”
Would n’t any conference probably have similarities ; such as there were speakers , there were meetings , and an amalgamation of people hanging out conversing ?
Again , if the Church of Star Trek has n’t been founded already , it is now , whether the fans agree or not .
He completely ignores the valid criticisms of religious belief and insists on using ridicule and insults to make the entire concept seem silly , much like Christianity .
Is he projecting his own feelings regarding the absurdity of his own religion , maybe ?
He attacks Julia Sweeney as a “ D - list celebrity ” eager for a second career as an atheist spokesperson .
The fact that she does a monologue based on her personal experience with religion escapes him , and once again , he sardonically quips that she must be fun on dates after she recounts a story about debating evolution while out with a former romantic interest .
Watch out ladies and gentlemen — we ’ve entered the “ no - humor ” zone .
The ad hominems do n’t stop there , either .
His next target is Greydon Square , and Dougherty can’t stop himself from painting him as a thug with a rap sheet .
We all know that getting arrested completely discredits a person despite the validity of their beliefs or lack thereof in this case .
Any journalist with credibility would at least have done his research and known that Greydon was released that day — his only charge being an unpaid ticket .
We can add this to the list of half - truths purposely written by Dougherty and designed to deceive the readers .
Coming full circle back to Sam Harris , he quotes Sam from The End of Faith as saying , “ Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them . ”
Not only is this completely skewed and out of context , he presumes that nobody would contemplate this statement .
If you had the ability to stop the 9/11 hijackers before they boarded the planes that eventually slammed into buildings , killing thousands , would you have ?
What if lethal force was the only means by which it was possible ?
It is certainly a delicate subject , but it is not presented accurately in Dougherty ’s piece .
Dougherty ’s defense then consists of the absurd claim that , “ The Inquisition at least allowed defendants the chance to recant — often many times . ”
Yes , they did , offer a choice between keeping one ’s integrity and dying or lying about one ’s lack of belief and remaining alive .
What a stunning example of Christian generosity and kindness .
Maybe we should watch two and a half hours of that at next year ’s AAI conference .
Finally , we have Richard Dawkins .
Even this criticism is n’t bereft of superficial personal attacks , as he refers to Prof .
Dawkins as “ owl - faced ” and “ ignorant of religious people as a species . ”
Apparently , a speciation event occurred that officially separates the logical from the illogical ; the reason - based from the faith - based .
Unfortunately , it ’s not true ( sorry if he got anybody ’s hopes up ) .
He argues that Dawkins ’ proposition that religious indoctrination is tantamount to child abuse and that we should refrain from labeling our children as a particular religion is reductive and tendentious .
Dougherty claims that religion is not a “ mere set of mental propositions ” and is , in fact , a way of life started at birth .
I do n’t imagine that Dawkins would disagree with the latter , but the issue is one of choice and the autonomy of children .
It concerns the routine obfuscation that occurs when parents lie to their children with regards to evolution , history and the value of faith as a reasonable methodology .
Many who have suffered from this treatment do not possess the ability to deprogram themselves as adults , and thus logic and rationality have been suppressed for yet another generation .
If he has no problem with that concept , why is it that he aims to make Julia Sweeney look like a child abuser for telling her daughter that they do n’t believe in God ?
If the general consensus is that pushing religion on your children is not an issue , then why is the advocacy of non-religion ?
Why was there such a backlash to our own Blasphemy Challenge , largely because teens were being “ targeted ” by the evil atheists ?
It is the obvious hypocrisy that is most problematic here — indoctrination from Christian parents is fine , but atheist parents need to keep their lack of belief to themselves .
The hazard represented by this mode of thought is actualized in the many cases of discrimination against atheist parents in child custody cases .
This article was nothing short of a long list of intellectually inept claims peppered with personal attacks which do more to reveal the character of the author than his intended targets .
Michael Brendan Dougherty should be ashamed of himself for exploiting the kindness of the atheists at the conference who spoke with him in order to purposely malign and misrepresent us .
His penchant for focusing on irrelevant , superficial details , such as age , clothing or hair - style , was deftly demonstrated in this piece , which I can only describe as being a supremely dishonest polemic aimed at the continued marginalization of atheists .
Hopefully , his lack of journalistic integrity will prevent him from getting a press pass at any future events .
Here is the original article .

BBC News , Rome
The Pope was on holiday at Castelgandolfo near Rome
The Pope refused a request for an audience during the August holidays .
Senior Vatican sources told the BBC the Pope does not normally receive politicians on his annual holiday at the Castelgandolfo residence near Rome .
But one leading Italian newspaper said it was an evident snub by the Vatican towards the Bush administration .
Christian rights
There are at least two reasons why Pope Benedict may have decided peremptorily against a private meeting with Ms Rice .
First , it was Ms Rice who just before the outbreak of the Iraq war in March 2003 made it clear to a special papal envoy sent from Rome , Cardinal Pio Laghi , that the Bush administration was not interested in the views of the late Pope on the immorality of launching its planned military offensive .
Secondly , the US has responded in a manner considered unacceptable at the Vatican to the protection of the rights of Iraqi Christians under the new Iraqi constitution .
The Bush administration has told the Vatican that as coalition forces have not succeeded in securing the whole territory of Iraq , they are unable to protect non-Muslims .
Instead of meeting the Pope , Ms Rice had to make do with a telephone conversation with the Vatican 's number two , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , who was visiting the US during August on other business .

How much children focus on having the latest gadgets and designer gear may have more to do with their self - esteem than peer pressure , targeted marketing or bad parenting , researchers said .
Japanese girls display kids ' mobile phones jointly developed by Japanese mobile operator Willcom and toy maker Bandai during an unveiling in Tokyo March 16 , 2006 .
How much children focus on having the latest gadgets and designer gear may have more to do with their self - esteem than peer pressure , targeted marketing or bad parenting , researchers said .
REUTERS / Yuriko Nakao
In two studies reported in the Journal of Consumer Research , they found that materialism spikes in early adolescence and declines by the end of high school , mirroring the years children are most prone to teen angst .
Between the ages of 12 and 13 children try to compensate for low self - esteem through material goods that they think will make themselves feel better , or that they think will raise their status among their peers .
“ While peers and marketing can certainly influence teens , materialism is directly connected to self - esteem , ” said Professor Deborah Roedder John of the University of Minnesota ,
“ As parents , if we understand that , it helps us cope with the frustrating experience of having a 12 , 13 or 14 year - old who is always asking us to buy them expensive clothes , and expensive computer equipment , ” she added in a media interview .
John and co-researcher Lan Nguyen Chaplin also showed that giving children positive signals from their peers can boost their self - esteem and lower levels of materialism .
They brought the children together in a summer camp setting and asked them to write down positive adjectives about their peers , such as “ smart ” or “ fun ” .
When the 12 and 13 year - olds read the pleasing descriptions of themselves , it drastically reduced the high levels of materialism .
John and Chaplin measured self - esteem by asking the children to rank to what extent they felt phrases such as “ I feel good about myself ” , or “ I ’m just as good as anyone else ” applied to them .
To find out how materialistic a child was , the researchers asked them to make up a collage to answer the question “ What makes me happy . ”
The children that chose more material goods such as money or brand names over sentiments such as being with friends or no homework were seen as having higher levels of materialism .
All these years of internet use later , HTML mail still sucks .
You may think I mean “ HTML mail does n’t work properly in some e-mail clients . ”
And that statement is certainly true .
Companies spend hours crafting layouts that may not work in Eudora or Gmail , or may no longer work in Outlook .
Even in programs that support the crap code used to create these layouts , all that hard visual work will go unseen if the user has unchecked “ View HTML Mail ” in their preferences .
As for CSS , it is partially supported in some e-mail applications and in web apps like Gmail , but only if you author in nonsemantic table layouts and bandwidth - wasting inline CSS .
Which is like using a broken refrigerator to store food at room temperature .
But when I say HTML mail still sucks , I do n’t mean it sucks because support for design in e-mail today is like support for standards in web browsers in 1998 .
I mean it sucks because nobody needs it .
It impedes rather than aids communication .
E-mail was invented so people could quickly exchange text messages over fast or slow or really slow connections , using simple , non-processor - intensive applications on any computing platform , or using phones , or hand - held devices , or almost anything else that can display text and permits typing .
That ’s what e-mail is for .
That ’s why it ’s great .
E-mail is not a platform for design .
Unlike the web , which also started as an exchange medium for text messages but which benefited from the inclusion of images and other media , e-mail works best when used for its original purpose , as the most basic of content exchange systems .
“ Designed ” e-mail is just a slightly more polished version of those messages your uncle sends you .
Your uncle thinks 18pt bright red Comic Sans looks great , so he sends e-mail messages formatted that way .
You cluck your tongue , or sigh , or run de-formatting scripts on every message you receive from him .
When your uncle is the “ designer , ” you “ get ” why styled mail sucks .
It sucks just as much when you design it , even if it looks better than your uncle ’s work in the two e-mail programs that support it correctly .
Even though it does n’t work right in many e-mail applications , and even though many users dislike it , HTML appeals to clients because it ’s another place to stick their logo .
And it appeals to the kind of designer who thinks everything , even a bullet hurtling toward his own skull , would improve if decorated .
I hate that kind of designer almost as much as I hate people who hate design .
That kind of designer gives all designers a bad name , and is chiefly responsible for the slightly amused contempt with which many business people view designers , art directors , and “ creative ” people generally .
Say it with me : HTML is for websites .
CSS is for websites .
GIFs and JPEGs are for websites .
ASCII means never having to say you ’re sorry .

Better sleep does n’t have to come in a pill .
For people with chronic insomnia , studies show that simple behavioral and psychological treatments work just as well , and sometimes better , than popular medications , according to a report in The Journal of Family Practice .
The medical journal Sleep last year reported on five high - quality trials that showed cognitive behavioral therapy helped people suffering from insomnia fall asleep sooner and stay asleep longer .
Another American Journal of Psychiatry analysis of 21 studies showed that behavioral treatment helped people fall asleep nearly nine minutes sooner than sleep drugs .
In other measures , sleep therapy worked just as well as drugs , but without any side effects .
The behavioral strategies for better sleep are deceptively simple , and that ’s one reason why many people do n’t believe they can make a difference .
One of the most effective methods is stimulus control .
This means not watching television , eating or reading in bed .
Do n’t go to bed until you are sleepy .
Get up at the same time every day , and do n’t nap during the day .
If you are unable to sleep , get out of bed after 15 minutes and do something relaxing , but avoid stimulating activity and thoughts .
So - called sleep hygiene is also part of sleep therapy .
This includes regular exercise , adding light - proof blinds to your bedroom to keep it dark and making sure the bed and room temperatures are comfortable .
Eat regular meals , do n’t go to bed hungry and limit beverages , particularly alcohol and caffeinated drinks , around bedtime .
Finally , do n’t try too hard to fall asleep , and turn the clock around so you ca n’t see it .
Watching time pass is one of the worst things to do when you ’re trying to fall asleep .
It may be hard to believe , but studies show these simple steps really do make a meaningful difference for people with sleep problems .
These interventions are based on the notion that thoughts and behaviors can “ hyper- arouse ” the central nervous system and deregulate sleep cycles , resulting in chronic insomnia , reports Family Practice .
If these steps do n’t work , talk to your doctor about a referral to a sleep therapist , who can also teach you additional relaxation techniques to help bring on sleep .
Sometimes , a therapist might work with you to reset your sleep - wake schedule , a more involved process whereby patients adjust their bedtime each night over the course of a few weeks .

The Terrapin Logo Language
In the summer of 1988 , my mom decided that I could n't spend the entire summer playing Transformers and Nintendo over at my neighbor 's house .
In order to crush my dreams of nonstop Mario and Optimus Prime , she signed me up for the Wakefield Elementary Summer School Enrichment Program where for 4 hours a day I sat in unair - conditioned classrooms in what was basically glorified daycare .
There were five exciting classes offered that year : Art , Computer , French , Creative Writing , and Health .
And so , over the next five summers , I spent eight weeks of my summer learning stuff for fun .
To be fair though , it was sort of fun .
Health was basically just dodgeball and Red Light , Green Light with the food pyramid mixed in and Creative Writing eventually evolved into Writing / Drama .
They also rotated the foreign language class between French , Spanish , and Italian each year to keep things interesting .
But the real star of the Summer Enrichment Program was computer class .
In 1988 , no one I was friends with had a computer .
Hell , why would you have wanted one ?
Computers were these crappy little things like the Apple II that cost way more than Nintendo and ran shitty games in green monochrome .
Now , I realize an Apple II was n't a game machine , but even as a word processor it was still fairly useless .
Instead of using a typewriter or writing a paper out by hand , you could print out your book report in a RIDICULOUSLY huge font on a fabulous dot matrix printer .
But as a kid , getting a chance to play with computers was still pretty alluring .
First of all , I knew they were expensive .
Secondly , they were in movies and stuff .
But most importantly , Mr. Wizard had one .
Being fresh out of the first grade , I did n't really know what computers could do or what I was going to learn to do with them ; most of my knowledge of their inner workings came from the movie Tron .
It was n't until third grade that the school put an Apple II in our classroom and it was n't until fourth grade that we used computers in school with any sort of frequency .
And so , with absolutely no computer experience whatsoever , I was introduced to the Logo programming language .
Logo is a programming language that was created in 1967 that was a fairly popular teaching tool in the 80s .
It has taken on many forms , appearing on platforms such as the IBM , Commodore 64 , MSX , Atari , and Apple II computers .
Variants of Logo have been used to guide robots and build shit with Legos .
It is still around today , but it is largely defunct .
Although it bills itself as a programming language , Logo is really more of a CAD .
By inputting text commands into a prompt , the user moves a triangular cursor known as a turtle around the screen to create squares , circles , and other shapes that can be made in Microsoft Paint in much less time .
There have been dozens of version of Logo , each with slightly different commands and interfaces .
This was even true on a single platform .
The Apple II offered versions such as Apple Logo II , Terrapin Logo , and LogoWriter .
The version that I learned was Terrapin Logo , so that 's what I will be covering .
Let 's begin ...
Basic Commands
Below you will find some basic Logo commands .
They will give you a better idea of how the language works and they will come in useful if you should ever find yourself so bored that you want to play around with Logo .
If that happens , do n't .
If you want to invest your time into learning a programming language , learn something that will actually be of benefit to you , like PHP , Java , or Flash .
Please note these commands are only guaranteed to work in Terrapin Logo .
Some of them are slightly different in other versions .
For example , Apple Logo II uses SETPC instead of PENCOLOR .
COMMAND SHORT WHAT IT DOES FORWARD FD Moves the turtle forward .
Requires a numerical input .
BACK BK
Moves the turtle backward .
Requires a numerical input .
RIGHT RT
Turns the turtle right .
You must define the number of degrees .
LEFT LT
Turns the turtle left .
You must define the number of degrees .
PENUP PU
When this command is activated , the turtle will not draw as it moves .
PENDOWN PD Negates PENUP .
DRAW
Clears all lines and returns the turtle to the center of the screen .
CLEARSCREEN CS Clears the screen .
Duh .
HOME
Returns the turtle to the center of the screen .
It will draw a line unless PENUP is on .
PRINT [ TEXT ]
Prints whatever text you put in the brackets .
Oooh fun .
HIDETURTLE HT
Hides the turtle .
SHOWTURTLE ST
Come on , take a fucking guess .
PENCOLOR PC
Change the color of the lines you draw .
Totally useless on a monochrome monitor .
BACKGROUND BG
Change the background color .
Just as useless as PENCOLOR .
FULLSCREEN CTRL-F
Hides the text prompt .
SPLITSCREEN CTRL-S
Splits the screen between the drawing space and the text prompt .
TEXTSCREEN CTRL -T
Hides the drawing space .
EDIT ED
Enter editor mode and define procedures .
OTHER USEFUL COMMANDS
CTRL-C : Exits editor mode and defines any procedures you have input .
CTRL-G : Aborts editor mode , procedures , or any command string .
CTRL-P : Recalls the last command you typed into prompt .
CTRL-D : Deletes characters .
The first thing that I learned to do in Logo was how to make a square .
I imagine that this was a pretty standard opening lesson because a square is really fucking easy to make .
The command string to make this rudimentary polygon is as follows :
FD 100 RT 90 FD 100 RT 90 FD 100 RT 90 FD 100
Now , obviously you do n't have to use 100 as your unit length , but it 's a nice round number .
I suppose 50 or 80 could also be considered to be nice round numbers , but fuck you .
It 's my site and I want to use 100 .
The entire command string could be entered on one line , but no teacher would ever tell you that .
Oh no , you 'd be forced to enter the commands line by line .
Then once you 'd completed your square , the teacher would come over and be like " Guess what ?
You do n't have to press enter after every command ! "
Then you 'd have to do it again the new way .
Yeah , thanks for wasting my time , Mr. Computer Teacher .
I do n't want to make a square again , you bastard ; I want to learn new shit .
And then you 'd learn the REPEAT command , which makes things even easier .
With REPEAT , you can make a square in one simple line of text :
REPEAT 4 [ FD 100 RT 90 ]
Then you get pissed off at your teacher again .
Why the fuck do math and science teachers always make you do a task out one way and then show you an easier way to do it ?
My theory : they 're all pricks .
I know there 's some bullshit philosophy about how knowing how to do stuff out the hard way helps you understand the theory behind it , but I do n't buy that for one second .
I think teachers are just lazy .
By teaching you the same thing two different ways , they 're saving themselves from having to teach you more stuff .
At any rate , the REPEAT command is really useful , especially if you want to make a circle :
REPEAT 360 [ FD 0.5 LT 1 ]
Without REPEAT , you 'd have to type in FD 1 RT 1 in excess of 359 times to make a goddam circle .
With it , you just have to watch a painfully slow drawing process .
Seriously , there 's a reason that the cursor is called a fucking turtle .
When people left their computers unguarded , they would often return to find that someone had sent their turtle on a mission to draw long lines at bizarre angles at REPEAT 1000 .
Sadly , this only worked so long as the person did n't hit CTRL - G or call the teacher over for help .
But Logo is so much more than just circles , squares , and repeating lines !
There 's rectangles too !
And hexagons !
Why with the use of procedures , you could make anything , even a flower :
This is a flower I designed in my third year of Logo , because that 's when I was informed of superprocedures .
You see , by typing in EDIT at the prompt you can enter editor mode and define procedures .
For example , let 's say you wanted to be able to make a triangle whenever you felt like it without having to type in the commands over and over .
You'd go into editor mode and input something like this :
TO TRI
RT 30 FD 50
REPEAT 2 [ LT 120 FD 50 ]
END
Then you 'd hit CTRL -C to leave the editor and define TRI as a procedure .
After that , you'd be able type TRI into the prompt and activate the procedure whenever the urge struck you .
But that 's just a regular procedure .
A superprocedure is a procedure that 's comprised entirely of procedures , known as subprocedures .
So if you were going to make a flower , you might make a flower superprocedure out of blossom , stem , and pot subprocedures .
Or you might not .
Here 's how I made the cheesy flower shown above :
TO DAISY
MOVE
TRIANGLE
BLOSSOM
STEM
LEAVES
GROUND
END TO MOVE
PU
FD 50
PD
END TO TRIANGLE
REPEAT 3 [ FD 30 RT 120 ]
END
TO BLOSSOM
REPEAT 22 [ TRIANGLE RT 15 ]
END TO STEM
RT 30 BK 70
END TO LEAVES
REPEAT 91 [ FD 1 RT 4 ]
REPEAT 91 [ FD 1 LT 4 ]
END TO GROUND
BK 30
RT 90
FD 1000
HT
END
Once all the procedures have been input , all you need to do is type DAISY to make the flower .
Let 's ignore the fact that the flower looks much more like a sunflower than a daisy , OK ?
The project was to make a flower superprocedure and that 's what I fucking did , so back off .
I made other stuff too .
For my end project for Logo Level III , I made a television .
It kinda sucked , but oh well .
On the one hand , Logo was extremely lame because anything you could draw in Logo could be drawn by hand much faster and with more colors .
On the other hand , holy shit , we were doing stuff on computers !
Now , it 's true that color monitors were available for the Apple II .
In the computer lab at summer school , we had exactly one .
There was a rotating schedule and every lab pair ( or trio ) got to use it maybe two or three times during the summer program .
The color monitor was absolutely glorious ; it utilized six amazing colors !
BLACK !
WHITE !
GREEN ! FUCHSIA !
ORANGE !
BLUE !
Yes , by using the PC and BG commands followed by a number 0 - 5 , you could change your pen color or background to one of these fabulous colors .
Black ( PC 0 ) also works as an eraser ; you can use it to backtrack over colored lines and fix your mistakes .
Additionally , PC 6 is pen reverse and it will make the turtle draw in the opposite color of the background .
As you can see , the color command is largely lacking .
Basic colors such as yellow and red are missing along with old favorites such as gray and cyan .
The color monitor 's was white on black .
Since you can't change the turtle 's color , you were stuck with a white turtle .
I always found this rather annoying ; a turtle is green , dammit .
Although Logo is largely useless as a programming language , it is a great application for teaching kids math .
In order to make a hexagon or an isoceles triangle , you need to develop an understanding of angles .
As such , Logo is a good way to get kids ready for geometry and even trigonometry .
Logo supports both SIN and COS functions as well as variables .
In this regard , Logo certainly benefitted me .
Six full years before I would take Pre-Algebra in junior high , I was introduced to variables through Logo .
My first experience with variables came in the form of a procedures to make an X - sided star :
TO STAR :N :SIDE
REPEAT :N [ FD : SIDE RT 360/:N FD : SIDE LT 720/:N ]
END
This procedure has two variables that must be defined by the user , N and SIDE .
N determines the number of sides the star will have and SIDE determines the side length .
You know , those probably are n't the best variable names to use when teaching kids .
Personally , I would have used names like STARSIDES and STARLENGTH .
True , they 're a lot longer to type out , but they 'd probably make a lot more sense to second graders with no prior experience with variables .
But hey , I 'm not a certified teacher , so what the fuck do I know ?
In order to run this procedure , you must define the variables in the command line .
For example , STAR 6 30 will produce a six - point star with a side length of 30 .
This procedure was a lot of fun to play around with , until I realized that the stars look like total crap when N is less than 5 or greater than 8 .
In addition to its graphic capabilties , Logo could be used to write stupid text - based programs not unlike the ones that one might normally learn in BASIC .
You could program the computer to ask the users for their names and then greet them seconds later using the data that they justed fucking entered .
That , or you could write a program that would loop until the user typed in that you were the greatest person ever .
Either way .
Also , please note that the exclamation point after PRINT on line 3 is not an actual part of the program ; Terrapin put the exclamation point there to signify that the command string has carried over to a new line .
Logo was certainly not the greatest programming language ever and that was especially true of MIT 's Terrapin Logo .
After I completed all six levels of Terrapin Logo instruction , I got a chance to play around with LogoWriter briefly .
LogoWriter was a much better product .
It had a built - in word processor and supported multiple turtles onscreen at once .
Not only that , you could change the turtle icon .
If you decided that you would rather have a race car , a rabbit , or an actual turtle as your cursor , you could .
It was a fun little program , but its time has come and passed .
When you get right down to it , Logo lacks any sort of practical application as a programming language .
Although newer versions such as MSWLogo are light years ahead of the Logo I learned , you 're still never going to see any commercial software programmed in Logo .
Well , maybe Duke Nukem Forever .
That could be why it 's taking so fucking long .

REPEAT 1000 [ PRINT [ BACK TO SYDLEXIA.COM ] ]
Tip to aspiring undercover reporters : when you 're given four chances to sign up as press , you 're not really undercover anymore .
Cut your losses and stop pretending already .
In a developing story that only keeps getting richer , an undercover reporter for Dateline NBC was outed Friday and embarrassed in front of hundreds of attendees at this year 's DEFCON in Las Vegas .
As an associate producer of Dateline , Michelle Madigan tried to attend this year 's DEFCON undercover , registering as a programmer and coming to the conference with a hidden camera set up in a shoulder bag .
One small problem : she was never really undercover .
From the moment Madigan got to the show , word was out among its organizers that she was a member of the press and that she knowingly intended to violate the rules prohibiting media from photographing or videotaping without approval .
Displeased with her intent , the organizers decided to give her several chances to get a legitimate press pass , the final chance coming after outing her in front of convention attendees in a mock - game of " spot the undercover reporter " ( caught on video ) .
Madigan fled , much to the delight of attendees who followed her out to the parking lot , mocking her along the way .
Hack job
Lost in the cackles of laughter at the reporter 's embarrassment is an account that is truly confusing and , at times , difficult to believe .
Press is truly welcome at DEFCON , but Madigan 's attempt to break the rules was unacceptable , if at first understandable .
Madigan was reportedly going to the show to report on a cat - and - mouse game between hackers and the undercover federal agents that keep an eye on them .
Her goal was to find evidence of nefarious hacking going on by catching someone admitting to a felony on tape and to out a federal agent who was also attending the conference undercover .
According to the Register 's report , she bragged to an informant that " the people in Kansas would be very interested in knowing what was happening at DEFCON . "
Organizers got the sense that Madigan was interested in doing a hack job on the show , and nothing else .
Her plan was foiled from the get - go , however , because DEFCON was tipped off to her presence before she even arrived — with the tip , according to ThreatLevel , coming from a mole at NBC .
Organizers then attempted to convince her to get a press pass instead , but she declined on four separate occasions , setting the stage for her embarrassment later that day .
To make matters worse , Madigan twice declined a press pass by phone before she arrived , long before organizers started warning attendees that an undercover reporter was in their midst .
Indeed , it was Madigan 's insistence on staying undercover , even when it was clear that she was never truly undercover to begin with , that set up the embarrassing outing in front of the standing - room - only crowd in Vegas .
After she had already declined to get a press pass several times , organizers fooled her , leading her to believe that she could get video of a federal agent being outed on the conference hall floor .
After directing her to the hall in advance of the event , the organizers then set their own plan into motion , which was to out Madigan , not a Fed.
Duped , Madigan fled the scene .
Dateline has issued a general statement saying that it does not comment on its news - gathering practices .
Attempts to contact Madigan have been unsuccessful , and it appears that she 's even nuked her MySpace page .
DEFCON 's organizers expressed displeasure at what Madigan was trying to do , saying that Dateline 's sensationalist approach to news could harm the show 's " open " atmosphere where hackers — and indeed government agents — come together in the spirit of communication .
Without pinhole cameras .

The M - Network is doing a group writing project this week on the topic of new cars , used cars , or no car .
We would like to invite you to participate as well .
Please include a trackback to this post in your article or include a link via a comment below and I ’ll add you to the list at the bottom of this article .
I ’ve been pretty vocal in my previous articles about how I am a huge proponent of buying used .
We currently own two used cars .
One is a 2001 Nissan Sentra we payed cash for and the other a 2004 Dodge Durango that we purchased in 2005 .
The Durango was a Dodge demo that we got for a steal due to being only 1 year old and having higher than normal miles .
Since I would suspect you ’re tired of reading about my feelings on used cars , I thought I ’d give you some reasons why you should buy new instead :
1 . You do n’t think car dealerships make enough money and you want to help them out
Sure , dealerships make money on used cars , but they make more selling new cars .
Why ?
Dealerships get tons of hidden kickbacks and incentives from the auto manufacturers that you never see .
Ever been to a dealership and purchased a car at invoice driving away thinking “ Ha , I showed them … I am the negotiating King ! “ .
Well , sorry to tell you , the dealership did n’t pay invoice for the car .
In fact , chances are , if you purchased from a fairly large dealership they made a good $ 1000 on the car by selling it to you at invoice .
Not to mention the fact that they made additional money by financing it for you .
When you buy used , they only make the difference between what they purchased the car for and what you paid for it .
Many dealerships in fact sell pre-owned cars just to entice you into looking at their new cars .
Let ’s face the facts , when you buy new you pay more money and the dealership makes more money .
2 . You enjoy throwing money out out the window as you drive down the road in your new car
The average new car loses anywhere from 3 - 5 % of it ’s value as soon as you drive it off the lot .
For a $ 30,000 that is $ 900 – $ 1,500 dollars .
Over the course of the next 3 years , that same car will continue to plummet in value and lose on average 45 % of it ’s initial value .
With this kind of depreciation , it ’s the equivalent of throwing $ 12 a day out of your window as you drive that fancy new car around .
Not including the interest you ’re paying if you financed it .
I have a better option , buy a car that is 3 years old and well cared for and save that $ 12 a day instead .
At the end of the year , you would have $ 4,380 not including interest .
3 . That great new car smell really is worth 5 - 10 k
I love the smell of a new car , especially one with leather interior .
It ’s probably one of my favorite smells , but let ’s look at the facts .
On average , purchasing a car that is 1 year old with low miles can save you $ 5,000 – $ 10,000 .
We were actually look at Ford Expedition ELs this weekend .
They had a really nice 2007 Eddie Bauer edition with only 4,000 miles on it for $ 37,000 .
The same model new ( 2008 ) was around $ 47,000 .
That ’s a difference of $ 10,000 .
The pre-owned 2007 smelled new , looked new , and was significantly cheaper .
Be smart , let someone else take the initial hit .
Oh , we did n’t buy it …it was just too much money .
4 . You enjoy parking in the back of the lot sideways with orange cones surrounding your new vehicle
Every time I have ever purchased a new car , I spent the first 6 - 12 months driving the car on egg shells .
I was paranoid about it getting dinged , scratched or even getting dirty .
When I graduated from college in 1992 , I purchased a brand new Mustang 5.0 liter .
It was one sweet ( and fast ) car .
But I was so incredibly paranoid about it , people actually did n’t enjoy riding in it with me it .
I about drove my wife ( then my finance ) crazy .
Sure enough , it eventually got dinged , received a scratch or two and I accepted the fate that it was just a car .
Honestly , when you spend that much money on something so new and shiny , your automatic reaction is protect it .
It ’s going to get dinged , scratched and even get dirty .
I now buy used and let someone else be paranoid about those first few dings and scratches .
Less stress in life is a good thing .
5 . You work hard and deserve a new car
Here is probably the biggest , and most childish reason to buy an expensive new car … ” I work hard and I deserve one ” .
This is exactly how smart people justify a stupid decision in most cases .
I do agree with this thought process though , but only if you add the following “ and I can afford it ” .
Cars are expensive , and in most cases a depreciating asset ( i.e. not something anyone financial savoy person would recommend you put your money into ) .
Unless you have some spare cash laying around , you need to be really smart about your car purchasing decisions and not fall into the emotional trap of buying one because you think you deserve one .
Here are links to other articles from both M - Network members and other bloggers participating :
I ’d also like to invite you to take a peek at a car blog started by my 11 year old son .
He ’s so excited :-)

Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Charles Prince is planning to resign at a board meeting on Sunday , according to people familiar with the situation , as the bank faces big new losses from distressed mortgage assets .
The move would end the four - year tenure of Mr. Prince , a longtime lawyer and loyal lieutenant of former Citigroup head Sanford Weill , who assembled the financial giant that stands as America 's largest bank by assets .
It would make Mr. Prince the second major chief executive in finance to leave his job in a week , following the ouster of Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Stan O'Neal .
Mr. Prince , 57 years old , moved before the board considered his fate .
His tenure has been rocky .
He faced pressure to cut costs , and more recently , debt - market turmoil has taken a tremendous toll .
Citigroup 's stock is down 31 % this year and almost 9 % in the last week .
People familiar with the matter said the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the bank 's accounting for its off - balance sheet investment funds that have recently attracted scrutiny .
" Chuck took a very unusual move and is resigning , " said one person familiar with the situation .
" He 's stepped up and done the right thing without forcing the board to act . "
Just a few weeks ago , board members including Robert Rubin , the influential chairman of Citigroup 's executive committee , expressed support for Mr. Prince and said that his job was n't in jeopardy .
" I think Chuck 's going to be here for a lot of years , " Mr. Rubin said in an interview last month .
A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment Friday .
John Tehranian 's paper , " Infringement Nation : Copyright Reform and the Law / Norm Gap , " from a forthcoming symposium issue of the Utah Law Review on " Fixing Copyright , " is a great , tight little essay on the way that the growing gap between what technology allows us to do and what copyright tells us not to do is turning us all into mega-crooks .
Just by doing the normal , everyday stuff — chatting with friends , sharing the moments of our lives — we commit billions of dollars ' worth of infringements :
By the end of the day , John has infringed the copyrights of twenty emails ,
three legal articles , an architectural rendering , a poem , five photographs , an
animated character , a musical composition , a painting , and fifty notes and
drawings .
All told , he has committed at least eighty - three acts of infringement and
faces liability in the amount of $ 12.45 million ( to say nothing of potential criminal
charges ) .50
There is nothing particularly extraordinary about John 's activities .
Yet
if copyright holders were inclined to enforce their rights to the maximum extent
allowed by law , he would be indisputably liable for a mind - boggling $ 4.544 billion
in potential damages each year .
And , surprisingly , he has not even committed a
single act of infringement through P2P file sharing .
Such an outcome flies in the
face of our basic sense of justice .
Indeed , one must either irrationally conclude that
John is a criminal infringer–a veritable grand larcenist–or blithely surmise that
copyright law must not mean what it appears to say .
Something is clearly amiss .
Moreover , the troublesome gap between copyright law and norms has grown only
wider in recent years .
OIL prices seem to hit a new peak each week .
This is good news for governments , which take a cut of revenues .
And coffers will swell further as companies explore new sources of oil that had previously been too pricey to extract , such as oil sands in Alberta , Canada .
The province 's government recently announced an increase in royalties from 47 % to 55 % of net revenues in 2010 .
But this is still a relatively small share compared with many countries .
The tax man in Norway , Russia and Libya takes over 70 % of revenues .

President Jimmy Carter was demonized for pointing out in his book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , that there are actually two sides to the Israeli - Palestinian issue .
Distinguished American scholars , such as John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have suffered the same fate for documenting the excessive influence the Israel Lobby has on US foreign policy .
Americans would be astonished at the criticisms in the Israeli press of the Israeli government ’s policies toward the Palestinians and Arabs generally .
In Israel facts are still part of the discussion .
If the Israeli newspaper , Haaretz , could replace Fox " News , " CNN , New York Times and Washington Post , Americans would know the truth about US and Israeli policies in the Middle East and their likely consequences .
On September 1 , Haaretz reported that Rabbi Eric Yoffie , the president of the Union for Reform Judaism , which represents 900 Congregations and 1.5 million Jews , " accused American media , politicians and religious groups of demonizing Islam " and turning Muslims into " satanic figures . "
Rabbi Yoffie is certainly correct .
In America there is only one side to the issue .
An entire industry has been created that is devoted to demonizing Islam .
Books abound that misrepresent Islam as the greatest possible threat to Western Civilization and seek to instill fear and hatred of Muslims in Americans .
For example , Norman Podhoretz proclaims " World War IV : The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism . "
Daniel Pipes shrieks that " Militant Islam Reaches America . "
Lee Harris warns of " The Suicide of Reason : Radical Islam ’s Threat to the West . "
Think tanks have well - funded Middle East programs , the purpose of which is to spread Islamophobia .
Fear and loathing pour out of the Middle East Forum and the American Enterprise Institute .
In the US it is acceptable , even obligatory in many circles , to hate Muslims and to support violence against them .
Pipes has been described as a " leading anti-Muslim hate propagandist . "
He is on record advocating the use of violence alone as the solution to the Muslim problem .
This won him the endorsement of the Christian Coalition , AIPAC , and the Zionist Organization of America for appointment to the board of the United States Institute of Peace .
President George Bush used a recess appointment to appoint this man of violence to the Institute of Peace .
Pipes advocates that the Muslims be beaten into submission by force , the view that has guided the Bush administration .
To brainwashed and propagandized Americans , the Pipes appointment made perfect sense .
Podhoretz believes that Islam has no right to exist , because it is opposed to Israeli territorial expansion , and that America must deracinate Islam , which means to tear Islam up by the roots .
While neoconservatives , Christian Zionists , and the Bush administration embrace unbridled violence against Muslims , Lee Harris warns that America is much too tolerant and reasonable to be able to defend itself against Muslim fanaticism .
America ’s " governing philosophy based on reason , tolerance , consensus and deliberation cannot defend itself against a [ Muslim ] strategy of ruthless violence . "
Islamophobia overflows with such absurdities and contradictions .
Harris tells us that the Enlightenment overcame fanatical thinking in the West , leaving the West unfamiliar with fanaticism and helpless to confront it .
Harris , who fancies himself an authority on fanaticism , is deaf , dumb , and blind to Communism and National Socialism and is completely ignorant of the fact that neoconservative fanatics are the direct heirs of the Jacobins of the French Revolution , itself a fanatical product of the Enlightenment .
If Americans did rely on reason , tolerance and deliberation , they might free their minds of shrill propaganda long enough to consider the " Muslim threat . "
Muslims are disunited .
Their disunity makes them a threat to one another , not to the West .
In Iraq most of the fighting and violence is between Sunni and Shi’ite Arabs and between Arabs and Kurds .
If Iraqis were unified , most of the violence , instead of a small part of it , would be directed against the American troops , and the remnants of a defeated US army would have been withdrawn by now .
However much Iraqis might hate the American invader and occupier , they do not hate him enough to unite and to drive him out .
They would rather kill one another .
Iran , the current focus of demonization , is not Arab .
Iranians are descended from the ancient Persian race .
Indeed , Iran would do itself a favor if it changed its name back to Persia .
For eight years ( 1980 - 1988 ) the Iranians and Iraqis were locked in catastrophic war with horrendous casualties on both sides .
Despite its military exhaustion , Iraq was considered a " threat " by the American Superpower and was bombed and embargoed for the decade of the 1990s , one consequence of which was the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children .
Not content with the complete crippling of Iraq by the Clinton administration , the Bush administration invaded Iraq in 2003 and has been dealing more death and destruction to Iraq ever since .
Palestine has been under Israeli occupation for decades .
Israel has simply stolen most of Palestine , and the remaining Palestinian enclaves are ghettos policed by the Israeli army .
The rulers of Saudi Arabia and the oil emirates are Sunni Arabs .
They are more afraid of Shi’ite Arabs than of Israelis .
Egypt , Jordan , and Pakistan are ruled by bought - and - paid - for American puppets .
The Turkish military is also in the American pocket and suppresses any Islamist influence in the civilian government .
Afghanistan is a disunited country of tribal peoples , each holding sway in their area .
The Taliban were attempting to unify Afghanistan , and the Bush administration ’s fear that the Taliban might succeed was the reason for the US invasion of Afghanistan .
The US allied with the defeated Northern Alliance , in part a remnant of the old Soviet puppet government , and turned Afghanistan back over to warlords .
When the facts are considered 
Muslim disunity and the absence of modern technology , navies , and strategic reach  the Bush / Cheney / neoconservative / Zionist propaganda that " we must fight them over there before they come over here " is such a transparent hoax that it is astounding that so many Americans have fallen for it .
To the extent that there is any Muslim threat , it is one created by the US and Israel .
Israel has no diplomacy toward Muslims and relies on violence and coercion .
The US has interfered in the internal affairs of Muslim countries during the entire post World War II period .
The US overthrew an elected government in Iran and installed the Shah .
The US backed Saddam Hussein in his aggression against Iran .
The US has kept in power rulers it could control and has pandered to the desires of Israeli governments .
If America is hated , America created the hate by its arrogant and dismissive treatment of the Muslim Middle East .
There is no such thing as Islamofascism .
This is a coined propaganda word used to inflame the ignorant .
There is no factual basis for the hatred that neoconservative Islamophobes instill in Americans .
God did not tell America to destroy the Muslims for the Israelis .
In America today , blind ignorant hate against Muslims has been brought to a boiling point .
The fear and loathing is so great that the American public and its elected representatives in Congress offer scant opposition to the Bush administration ’s plan to make Iran the third Middle East victim of American aggression in the 21st century .
Most Americans , who Harris believes to be so reasonable , tolerant , and deliberative that they cannot defend themselves , could not care less that one million Iraqis have lost their lives during the American occupation and that an estimated four million Iraqis have been displaced .
The total of dead and displaced comes to 20 percent of the Iraqi population .
If this is not fanaticism on the part of the Bush administration , what is it ?
Certainly it is not reason , tolerance , and deliberation .

TEHRAN , Oct. 15 — Iran is bending its religious restrictions on television series in an effort to attract more of the country ’s audience to state - run television .
State TV , which had a monopoly on viewership until satellite channels began to draw more viewers beginning in the early 1990s , has been trying to win back its audience for several years .
One result : a spate of mini-series that depict love stories between characters who are not necessarily pious , and that allow women to show more of their hair — both of which have been considered un -Islamic .
Analysts say the new programs are part of the government ’s bid to use television as a more effective instrument to shape public opinion .
Most series still have clear political messages , though they are conveyed with much more subtlety than in the past .
They say the government appears to have realized that political programs , such as those showing confessions extracted from democracy advocates in prison , have not achieved its goal of building domestic unity at a time when the country is under intense international pressure for its nuclear program .
I recently finished reading the fascinating book The Places in Between by Rory Stewart ( see also NY Times review ) .
The book describes the authors journey 2002 journal between Herat and Kabul in the middle of winter just after 9 - 11 .
Mr. Stewart gives a rarely seen glimpse of life for rural Afghanis and how they view the Taliban , the U.S. , and local warlords .
One footnote describing contemporary UN and OECD policy makers particularly caught my attention :
“ Critics have accused this new breed of administrators of neo-colonialism .
But in fact their approach is not that of a nineteenth - century colonial officer .
Colonial administrators may have been racist and exploitative but they did at least work seriously at the business of understanding the people they were governing .
They recruited people prepared to spend their entire careers in dangerous provinces of a single alien nation .
They invested in teaching administrator sand military officers the local language .
They established effective departments of state , trained a local elite and continued the countless academic studies of their subjects through institutes and museums , royal geographical societies and royal botanical gardens .
They balanced the local budget and generated fiscal revenue because if they did n’t their home government would rarely bail them out .
If they failed to govern fairly , the population would mutiny .
Post - conflict experts have got the prestige without the effort or stigma of imperialism .
Their implicit denial of the difference between cultures is the new mass brand of international intervention .
Their policy fails but no one notices .
There are not credible monitoring bodies and there is no one to take formal responsibility .
Individual officers are never in any one place and rarely in any one organization long enough to be adequately assessed .
The colonial enterprise could be judged by the security or revenue it delivered , but neo-colonialists have no such performance criteria .
In fact their very uselessness benefits them .
By avoiding any serious action or judgement they , unlike their colonial predecessors , are able to escape accusations of racism , exploitation and oppression .
Perhaps it is because no one requires more than a charming illusion of action in the dev4eloping world .
If the policy makers know little about the Afghans , the public knows even less , and few care about policy failure when the effects are felt only in Afghanistan . ”
PARIS , Nov. 20 — Last month , French law forced Apple to promise that consumers could buy a version of its iPhone in this country without having to be locked into a long - term contract with Orange , the only mobile phone operator offering the new device .
Now , the same issue is tripping up Apple ’s plans to sell the music - playing cellphone in Germany , the largest European telephone market .
Last week , the Vodafone Group won the first round of a legal case against T - Mobile over its exclusive deal to sell the iPhone there .
A German court ruled that T - Mobile must offer the iPhone to everyone , even without the 24 - month contract that it had required for buyers of the phone , which went on sale in Germany for 399 euros ( $ 591 ) on Nov. 9 . T - Mobile is appealing the ruling .
Vodafone of Britain had tried to secure its own pan-European exclusive deal with Apple for the iPhone .
A spokesman , Simon Gordon , said the company was not trying to block the sale of the device but rather trying to level the playing field in Germany .
Vodafone operates Vodafone Germany , the No. 2 German carrier .
T - Mobile , a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom , is the industry leader there , with 34 million customers .

Blackwater .
The name says it all , conjuring images of imminent danger , hidden predators and night terror .
From the moment Blackwater USA arrived in Iraq to protect L. Paul Bremer III ’s Coalition Provisional Authority until last week , when its guards killed 11 Iraqis and wounded 13 more while escorting a diplomatic convoy through Baghdad , the North Carolina - based private security company has been known for its swaggering image and “ Dirty Harry ” demeanor .
All the U.S. private security armies in Iraq may be cut from the same khaki cloth , but each has its own personality .
When I arrived in the country in September 2004 as a senior information officer for the U.S. Agency for International Development , bodyguards with Kroll Inc. , whose credo is “ in risk there is opportunity , ” met me at the airport .
They were British and Irish veterans of Belfast ’s “ Troubles ” and viewed terrorists with a world - weary stoicism .
Our convoy had pulled onto the airport highway and was heading for the Green Zone when three black Chevy Suburbans flashed past .
The rear door of the trailing vehicle was open , and inside sat a man dressed in black cradling a large - caliber machine gun .
Bandoleers crisscrossed his chest , several handguns and a large knife dangled from his weapons harness and an enormous handlebar mustache covered most of his face .
The look was designed to inspire dread , but it was carried to such cartoonish extremes that the man resembled Yosemite Sam more than the Terminator .
“ That ’s Blackwater , ” said the Kroll driver disdainfully .
“ You ’ll see a lot of them while you ’re here . ”
Once inside the Green Zone , it became clear to me that protecting American civilians was a prime directive of the U.S. occupation .
A cold calculus had determined that the volunteer army could tolerate casualties but that Congress would never accept images of American civilians beheaded on Arab TV .
The responsibility for protecting embassy personnel and nongovernmental contractors fell to the State Department ’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security , which had regional security officers embedded in every government agency .
In post - conflict situations , these security officers normally work with U.S. Embassy Marine guards and local police .
But when I was in Iraq , the police barely existed and U.S. military units were stretched to the breaking point .
Indeed , around the time of President Bush ’s “ mission accomplished ” speech on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln , a Rand Corp. study concluded that , based on the postwar history of Germany and Japan , Washington would need a minimum of 500,000 troops to rebuild Iraq .
Unfortunately , coalition forces numbered only 211,000 .
Because the Pentagon refused to increase troop levels , the State Department was forced to sign contracts with dozens of private security firms .
The companies with government contracts in Iraq have no trouble recruiting people with military or law enforcement experience .
Most of the 20,000 guards thought to be working in Iraq come from the rural U.S. , where a deputy sheriff is lucky to earn $ 40,000 a year .
In Iraq , where Western bodyguards can earn $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 a week working for one of the 37 private security companies registered with the Iraq Ministry of Interior , a job with Blackwater -- which pays bodyguards assigned to the U.S. ambassador $ 1,000 a day -- is seen as the windfall of a lifetime .
Bodyguards protecting U.S. civilian contractors have one main goal : bring ‘em back alive .
Innocent Iraqis who get in their way do so at their peril .
In 2005 , when Kroll lost the USAID security contract to DynCorp International , a Virginia - based military contractor with $ 2.3 billion in annual revenues , the tactics of protection outside the Green Zone became more like military maneuvers .
During a March visit to the Baghdad South Power Plant , our three - car convoy was joined by an OH - 6A “ Little Bird ” helicopter that swooped low over the vehicles whenever we neared an intersection .
To avoid congestion , we bounced over traffic medians , ran through a police checkpoint and used an offramp to enter the Doura Expressway , which rings eastern and southern Baghdad .
As we sped down the wrong side of the freeway , a DynCorp guard tethered to the helicopter warned approaching traffic to get out of the way by throwing plastic water bottles at cars .
The return trip was much the same , save for the Iraqi one of our cars clipped when he walked into the road from between two parked cars .
Back inside the Green Zone , I told several colleagues about not stopping after hitting a pedestrian and then asked if I should report DynCorp ’s behavior to the U.S. Embassy .
“ You got back safely , did n’t you ? ” came the response .
“ So what ’s your problem ? ”
Because bodyguard services got paid whether they left the Green Zone or not , they made it as difficult as possible to leave .
No U.S. Embassy employee could go into Baghdad without specific map coordinates for the destination , but obtaining this information was problematic because the embassy and the military telephone networks were incompatible , and cellphones and e-mails were considered insecure .
It was much easier to get an Army helicopter for trips outside the capital .
The real victim of the “ safety at any cost ” policy was the U.S. development program .
Government careers and inflated contractor salaries depended on keeping civilians out of harm ’s way .
As a result , bodyguards looking out for civilians halted work at the slightest hint of trouble .
In theory , billions of dollars were being spent every month on new roads , sewers , hospitals and schools , but much of the work went unsupervised during election campaigns , holidays -- both U.S. and Iraqi -- and whenever the threat level increased .
One director of the USAID ’s Office of Transition Initiatives signed millions of dollars ’ worth of grants over the course of her year in Baghdad yet left the Green Zone only once to inspect completed work .
Still , that may have been the wisest course of action because riding with private security contractors is no way to win Iraqi hearts and minds .
Blackwater claimed last week that its employees were responding to hostile fire , and a fuller investigation of the tragedy may partly exonerate those involved .
But anger over last week ’s deaths will probably linger because many Iraqis remember that in May 2004 , two Blackwater guards shot a Baghdad taxi driver and killed his 19 - year - old passenger without warning .
In 2003 , private security guards were regarded as efficient , cost - effective labor .
But the unintended consequences of that assumption are piling up fast .
Even if the Iraqi government does not expel Blackwater , the security firm should prepare to leave .
In Iraq , the day of the gunslinger should end .

Holy men are renowned for their healing powers
The 80 - year - old holy man , Yanadi Kondaiah , claimed to have healing powers in the leg .
He is now recovering from his ordeal in hospital in the city of Tirupati in the state of Andhra Pradesh .
Local people believed they could be healed of spiritual and physical problems if they touched his leg .
They also believed in Mr Kondaiah 's predictions of the future .
Police say the incident happened 550 km north of the state capital , Hyderabad .
' Brutal manner '
Police say that the self - styled ' Godman ' - who lives in a village near the city of Tirupati - was approached a few days ago by two strangers who came to seek his advice over a medical problem .
Holy men are revered throughout much of India
They say that the pair returned to the old man on Tuesday ostensibly to thank him for his help .
" As the old man had the weakness of drinking , he accepted their invitation to have drinks with them , " said local police Sub - Inspector Pendakanti Dastgiri .
" They took him to a deserted spot in the outskirts of the village .
" After the old man had passed out under the influence of liquor , they cut off his right leg from the knee , " he said .
Mr Dastgiri said that the amputation was carried out in a very " brutal manner " and that police are still looking for the leg and the men who so cruelly took it .
He said that the assailants used a sharp hunting knife , and left the old man alone and bleeding slowly to death .
Mr Kondaiah was popular among Hindu devotees
Local people who found him unconscious alerted the police , who rushed him to hospital in Tirupati .
After regaining consciousness
Mr Kondaiah said that he had no idea why he was targeted in such a manner , and did not understand the motive of the miscreants in taking away his leg .
" I have always been good to others and helped who ever came to me .
Then why has this been done to me ? " he asked amid his tears .
Police say the reason for the attack could be because Mr Kondaiah told too many people of the alleged magical powers of his right leg .
" This might have motivated some people to take away his leg hoping to benefit from it , " a police spokesman said .
" But it is difficult to say that this was the only motive .
It could also be a case of a revenge attack . "
Heinze joined United from Paris St Germain in 2004
United disputed claims from Heinze , 29 , who said the Red Devils gave him written permission to pursue a transfer to another club for a fee of £ 6.8 m .
But a Premier League arbitration panel concluded that the permission " was unambiguous in that it envisages only an international transfer " .
The defender is set to appeal against the panel 's decision .
United will have 14 days to respond and , with the transfer window scheduled to shut on 31 August , Heinze is short of time if he wants to leave Old Trafford .
606 : DEBATE Has Heinze made a massive mistake not only wanting to join our rivals but also going to arbitration ?
RR1984
But his solicitor Richard Green says the Argentine could still join Liverpool after that date using Rule M4 , which allows the Premier League discretion to grant a transfer outside the window .
Green told BBC Radio 5 live : " My client and myself hoped the appeal would be concluded by the end of the window but that is clearly not going to take place .
" It is too early to say what may happen .
" I do n't know if there will be any other teams interested .
I do n't know if United 's attitude will change or if they are happy for him to stay or not . "
The arbitration panel 's verdict read : " The Premier League Board - appointed panel have heard submissions of evidence from both parties and has ruled to dismiss the player 's case .
" The hearing concluded that nature and intention of the disputed 13 June 2007 letter , especially when taken in context of verbal discussions and Manchester United FC 's transfer policy , was unambiguous in that it envisages only an international transfer .
" Furthermore , the hearing finds the letter constitutes an ' agreement to agree ' and did not create an obligation or binding agreement for the club to transfer the player to any particular club . "
United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and chief executive David Gill travelled to Monday 's hearing in London to put their case and will be happy with the verdict .
A Manchester United spokesman said : " We are pleased that the panel has endorsed our case . "
The Old Trafford side said they did not want to sell Heinze to a Premier League rival .
They said they made it clear to the defender both orally and in writing that he would not be allowed to join one of their title competitors .
But Green is adamant that Heinze should be allowed to move to Anfield , adding : " The player believes , as do his advisors , that the fax which was sent - which is the one being talked about - gives him the right to move to any club .
" The club were happy to sell the player .
" As a result his agent went to find clubs who were keen to buy him .
That is how this has arisen - it is not because he has tried to force a sale or engineer a sale of any sort . "
Transfers between the two north - west rivals are rare and the last first - team player to move from United to Liverpool was Phil Chisnall in 1964 .
Any appeal will be heard by the Premier League 's appeals committee .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 30 — Moments before a Mississippi prisoner was scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday evening , the Supreme Court granted him a stay of execution and thus gave a nearly indisputable indication that a majority intends to block all executions until the court decides a lethal injection case from Kentucky next spring .
There were two dissenters , Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. , but neither they nor the majority gave reasons for their positions .
Because only five votes are required for a stay of execution , it is not clear whether all the remaining seven justices supported it .
The stay will remain in effect until the full court reviews an appeal filed on Monday by lawyers for the inmate , Earl W. Berry , who is on death row for having killed a woman 20 years ago .
While there is no schedule for that review , it almost surely will not take place until the court decides the Kentucky case , Baze v. Rees , which will be argued in January .
The issue in that case is not the constitutionality of lethal injection as such , but rather a more procedural question : how judges should evaluate claims that the particular combination of drugs used to bring about death causes suffering that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment , in violation of the Eighth Amendment .
Even without a written opinion , the Supreme Court ’s action Tuesday night clarified a situation that had become increasingly confusing as state courts and the lower federal courts , without further guidance from the justices , wrestled with claims from a growing number of death - row inmates that their imminent executions should be put on hold .
Erwin Chemerinsky is one of the finest constitutional scholars in the country .
He is a gentleman and a friend .
He is a gifted teacher .
As someone who participates regularly in legal conferences and symposiums , I have never seen him be anything other than completely civil to those who disagree with him .
So the news that UC Irvine had selected him to be the first dean of its new law school was welcome indeed .
And the subsequent news -- that it withdrew the offer Tuesday , apparently because of Erwin ’s political beliefs and work -- is a betrayal of everything a great institution like the University of California represents .
It is a forfeiture of academic freedom .
Erwin and I seldom agree on constitutional outcome .
I ’m conservative , and he ’s liberal .
We have written competing textbooks .
We have debated frequently in the media .
Before the U.S. Supreme Court , if Erwin is for the petitioner , it ’s a good bet I can find merit in the cause of the respondent .
Yet there is no person I would sooner trust to be a guardian of my constitutional liberty .
Nor is there anyone I would sooner turn to for a candid , intellectually honest appraisal of an academic proposal .
When students have difficulty grasping basic concepts , I do not hesitate to hold out his treatise on the Constitution as one that handles matters thoroughly and dispassionately .
Across the nation , federal and state judges turn to Erwin each year to give them an update on the changes in the law and the legal directions of the Supreme Court .
Erwin has never hidden his progressive politics ; they must have been known to the search committee that identified him as a candidate to head the law school .
In conversation , in the classroom and in the courtroom , he fights passionately for human rights , while giving less deference , in my opinion , to the needs of law enforcement or to those who seek to preserve order , structure and tradition in society .
Yet he does not denigrate his opposition .
He engages .
He challenges .
He inspires .
It was my privilege to serve as a law school dean for a number of years .
I know that faculty members look to their deans for leadership , encouragement and support .
The fate of the law school , especially one just starting out , is often determined by the hard work and dedication of its dean .
UC Irvine would have benefited greatly by Erwin ’s service .
He would have been a model for the faculty -- widely published , dedicated to his students , civically involved .
He would have assembled a world - class faculty and , in a short period , would have competed for some of the most talented students in the country .
Ironically , Erwin and I have often disputed the extent to which law is only politics .
It has been my view that law must be understood as its own discipline and that the Constitution must be interpreted in a manner that respects its text and its history rather than any desired outcome .
If federalism is a principle to be honored in the Constitution , for example , deference must be given to state choices , whether they are liberal or conservative .
Erwin was less confident that law and politics could be so neatly divided .
I will continue to believe that the law has its own place above politics , but Erwin ’s dismissal surely makes that belief harder to sustain .
UC
Irvine ’s inability to keep politics out of its decision - making will make things difficult for the new law school .
It will become more difficult to recruit new faculty and to attract the respect that the school would have so easily acquired by giving the deanship to Erwin -- and which it so tragically forfeited by its casual , and all too last - minute , withdrawal of the offer .
However great the difficulties that await the UC Irvine law school , I know this for sure : Erwin Chemerinsky , as a man of goodwill and abundant kindness , will wish it only the best .
It will need every bit of his goodwill now that it has forfeited and spurned his good services .

Boras and his client Alex Rodriguez , the Yankees ’ third baseman , whom he has made the top - grossing athlete in team sports .
MARK ULRIKSEN
Scott Boras has season tickets to see the Dodgers , the Angels , the Padres , the Giants , and the A’s — a full California sweep .
In Los Angeles and Anaheim , he also maintains luxury boxes , but , for the most part , wherever he goes he sits , or sometimes stands , in one of the first few rows directly in back of home plate , cell phone at his ear .
Boras represents baseball players — among them the Yankees ’ Alex Rodriguez ( A - Rod ) , the top - grossing athlete in team sports , Barry Zito , the beneficiary of the largest pitching contract ever signed , and the Mets ’ Carlos Beltran .
Before a game , players will tend to approach the backstop and , in Boras ’s telling , thank him for the work he does on their behalf .
They need n’t even be his clients .
( Ballplayers are firm believers in trickle - down economics . )
Groundskeepers , umpires , and reporters , too , regularly drop by to pay their respects , trading anecdotes for scoops and the feeling of proximity to power .
They shake his hand — fingers poking through the protective netting — without quite getting a firm grip .
To the extent that lay people still find it offensive when baseball players command salaries equivalent to those of movie stars and underperforming hedge - fund managers , Boras is a convenient bogeyman , and at every ballpark there are bound to be a few hecklers who let him know it .
He was brought up Catholic , and , as he told a newspaper reporter earlier this year , “ Being Catholic , who you are as a person , you do n’t appreciate any association with Satan . ”
Still , there is a devilish turn to his smile — a glint of righteous defiance — and if there is a popular association that genuinely troubles him it is more likely that of Jerry Maguire , the smooth - talking Tom Cruise character , whom he does not at all resemble .
Maguire is an agent .
Boras is an attorney — a master of fine print , not histrionics .
You wo n’t find him in a bar with his clients ( he prefers the working breakfast ) , or pleading with them in the locker - room showers .
He wears his thinning brown hair combed perfectly across his scalp , left to right , and his clothes are overdeliberate California casual : pressed jeans , polo shirt fully buttoned .
Spontaneity has not recently occurred to him .
Out of superstition , or some symbolic show of authenticity , he has carried the same beat - up leather satchel for years .
“ People call me from the outside world all the time — they want me to negotiate everything , ” Boras says , with a hint of irritation .
“ I ’m not the person who will go out and negotiate anything , at any time , for anyone who happens to wear some sort of uniform . ”
He regards his nominal colleagues — the three hundred - odd agents who have been certified by the Major League Baseball Players Association , and many of whom represent athletes in several sports — as glorified valets .
“ You have to distinguish between someone who has a sales personality versus someone who is substantive , and has a form of legal practice representing individuals who just happen to play a singular sport , baseball , ” he says .
Like a celebrity criminal - defense attorney , Boras serves his rich and cosseted clientele with a high - minded sense of purpose , and he has little use for the notion that his tenacity as an advocate is a reflection of soulless greed .
( An old baseball acquaintance of his , George Kissell , likes to joke that only eight people will attend Boras ’s funeral — “ and all eight will be pallbearers . ” )
In fact , Boras is a moralist — he sometimes calls himself the only Democrat in Orange County — and prone to lecture about capitalism and education and the larger meaning of it all .
( “ I see grand houses of symphonies and performing - arts centers and such , which is great for a community to have , but on the other hand I walk four blocks away and I see a run-down school and I ’m wondering , Where are our priorities ? ” )
When he talks about baseball , he likes to diagnose the state of the game .
“ We have no leadoff hitters anymore , ” he once told me , laying part of the blame on veiled racial discrimination by the N.C.A.A .
And , “ The eradication of steroids is , frankly , not that noticeable . ”
Last December , at Baseball America ’s annual banquet , Boras was named the game ’s most influential non-player in the twenty - five years since the magazine began publishing , beating out the current Major League Baseball commissioner , Bud Selig , who had recently declared the sport to be in its “ golden age , ” as well as Don Fehr , the longtime head of the Players Association .
( The most influential player was Barry Bonds , who is a former Boras client , and similarly regarded . )
“ I could kind of feel in the room that it was , like , ‘ What is this ?
Why is this guy up here ?
We ’re baseball people , ’ ” Boras recalls .
The banquet is traditionally a feel - good event for management types , with a charitable focus and an emphasis on youth coaching and mentorship .
Boras took the stage and delivered a sermon on economics .
“ What I told them all was : ‘ You know what this business is about , guys ?
We ’ve gone from , when I came into it , an industry that made , economically , about five hundred million dollars , and we went to a billion in 1990 .
We went to three billion in 2000 .
And now we ’re near six billion in 2007 .
What it says for all of us in this room is this :
We ’re doing a good job with the game .
We ’re growing the game , as it should be grown .
There ’s a balance that ’s needed in the growing of the game , and I provide the balance on one side , and you provide it on the other . ’ ”
The applause was tepid .
“ You just wanted to crawl behind the curtain , ” a Baseball America contributor told me .
One National League manager considered walking out , in protest .
And yet influence , however coolly embraced , can be infectious .
Boras , who is fifty - four , seems to have become impatient with mere balance - provision .
This spring , he mailed a letter to Commissioner Selig , in which he outlined a proposal to alter the format of the game ’s most sacred ritual , the World Series .
Why not make it nine games , instead of seven , he argued , and hold those extra two games — the first two games — at a neutral site ?
Cities all over the nation , or even the world , could compete for the honor of playing host , as with the Olympics .
“ It ’s a fact that our game needs a forum that ’s akin to the Super Bowl , ” Boras explained to me not long after he ’d sent the letter .
“ People do n’t go to the Super Bowl for the game .
Most Super Bowl games are not competitive , or good games .
They go there for the event .
They go there for the three - day weekend . ”
He described a vision of “ corporate hospitality , ” including a “ gala , like the Oscars , ” during which the M.V.P. and Cy Young awards , among others , would be announced , with all the finalists present and on view , and presumably walking the red carpet in sponsored menswear .
Who could argue against such a change ?
It would mean more money for the owners , more “ marketable content ” for the media to broadcast , more attention for the stars — more everything .
“ He takes himself very seriously , ” Fay Vincent , the former commissioner , said recently of Boras .
“ I ’m not surprised that he ’s beginning to make grandiose suggestions . ”
Vincent added that he thought this particular World Series suggestion was “ preposterous , ” and , giving voice to a common complaint of fans and players alike , he said , “ I mean , the season goes on endlessly as it is . ”
( Reuters ) - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , whose tenure has been marked by controversy over civil liberties and the firings of prosecutors , announced his resignation on Monday .
Following is reaction from several candidates in the 2008 presidential election .
* NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC SEN .
HILLARY CLINTON : “ This resignation is long overdue , and so is the appointment of an attorney general who will put the rule of law and our Constitution above partisan politics .
... time and time again , he demonstrated that his loyalties lie with the president and his political agenda , not the American people or the evenhanded and impartial enforcement of our laws . ”
* FORMER NORTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC SEN .
JOHN EDWARDS : “ This is a victory for all of us .
...
Instead of replacing him with another political insider , we need to make sure that President ( George W. )
Bush replaces him with someone who is essentially nonpolitical . ”
* ILLINOIS DEMOCRATIC SEN .
BARACK OBAMA : “ I have long believed that Alberto Gonzales subverted justice to promote a political agenda , and so I am pleased that he has finally resigned today .
The president needs to nominate an attorney general who will be the people ’s lawyer , not the president ’s lawyer . ”
* NEW MEXICO DEMOCRATIC GOV .
BILL RICHARDSON : “ The resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is long overdue .
The president must nominate an attorney general who is a lawyer for the American people , not a political arm of the White House . ”
* DELAWARE DEMOCRATIC SEN .
JOSEPH BIDEN : “ His resignation is long overdue .
...
When I voted against Attorney General Gonzales ’ confirmation , I voiced concern about his ability to go from being the president ’s lawyer to the people ’s lawyer .
...
My skepticism was confirmed by his conduct . ”
* CONNECTICUT DEMOCRATIC SEN .
CHRIS DODD : “ Mr. Gonzales ’ Justice Department became a political wing of the Bush administration and his resignation is long overdue .
I will only vote to confirm a nominee for attorney general who is truly independent and who will guarantee reforms that restore and uphold the Constitution . ”
* FORMER MASSACHUSETTS REPUBLICAN GOV .
MITT ROMNEY : “ I believe the attorney general made the right decision to step aside .
The resignation is an opportunity for President Bush to renew the nation ’s commitment to the law enforcement officers and personnel who are dedicated to enforcing the rule of law and protecting the American people from the threat of terrorism around the globe . ”
* FORMER NEW YORK CITY REPUBLICAN MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI : “ Judge Gonzales served his nation honorably and I wish him well in the next phase of his career . ”
The crater has been spewing fetid gases , reports say
Crater site
They say the object left a deep crater after crashing down over the weekend near the town of Carancas in the Andes .
People who visited the scene have been complaining of headaches , vomiting and nausea after inhaling gases .
But some experts have questioned whether it was a meteorite or some other object that landed in Carancas .
" Increasingly we think that people witnessed a fireball , which are not uncommon , went off to investigate and found a lake of sedimentary deposit , which may be full of smelly , methane rich organic matter , " said Dr Caroline Smith , a meteorite expert at the London - based Natural History Museum .
" This has been mistaken for a crater . "
A team of scientists is on its way to the site to collect samples and verify whether it was indeed a meteorite .
I think there 's also a certain psychological fear in the community
Local mayor Nestor Quispe
Can meteorites make you ill ?
Geologists have called on the authorities to stop people going near the crash site .
A local journalist , Martine Hanlon , told the BBC experts did not believe the meteor would make anybody sick , but they did think a chemical reaction caused by its contact with the ground could release toxins such as sulphur and arsenic .
An engineer from the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute told AFP news agency that no radiation had been detected from the crater .
He ruled out any possibility that the fallen object might be a satellite .
Afraid
Nestor Quispe , the mayor of the municipality to which Carancas belongs , told the BBC that many residents had been affected .
" Lots of people from the town of Carancas have fallen ill .
They have headaches , eye problems , irritated skin , nausea and vomiting , " he said .
" I think there 's also a certain psychological fear in the community . "
Local resident Heber Mamani said a bull and some other animals had become ill .
" That is why we are asking for an analysis , because we are worried for our people .
They are afraid , " he said .
Another local villager , Romulo Quispe , said people were worried that the water was no longer safe to drink .
" This is the water we use for the animals , and for us , for everyone , and it looks like it is contaminated , " he said .
" We do n't know what is going on at the moment , that is what we are worried about . "
The incident took place on Saturday night , when people near Carancas in the remote Puno region , some 1,300 km ( 800 miles ) south of the Peruvian capital , Lima , reported seeing a fireball in the sky coming towards them .
The object then hit the ground , leaving a 30 m ( 98 ft ) wide and 6 m ( 20 ft ) deep crater .
The crater spewed what officials described as fetid , noxious gases .
Jorge Lopez , a health director in Puno , told Reuters news agency he had an irritated throat and itchy nose after visiting the site .

The US has not ruled out the use of force against Iran
It claims it would bolster domestic support and increase the country 's willingness to use all means possible to attain a weapon .
In his report , Frank Barnaby argues that an attack might not destroy all of the nuclear programme .
In its wake , it would be much more feasible for Tehran 's political leadership to pull out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and launch a crash programme , devoting maximum resources to developing one or two bombs as quickly as possible .
This , it is argued , means that a nuclear - armed Iran might end up occurring sooner rather than later as a result of military intervention .
The Iranian government denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and insists its interest in nuclear technology is for peaceful purposes only .
The UN atomic watchdog , the IAEA , has been unable to either rule out or confirm a weapons programme based on what it has seen .
But international proliferation experts generally agree that Iran is , at the very least , seeking to develop technology which could quickly be diverted towards weapons if required .
Learning lessons
The US has examined the possibility of military strikes on other countries ' nuclear facilities in the past .
It came closest in 1994 , when a White House meeting discussing whether to strike North Korea was interrupted by news of a possible deal over the country 's nuclear programme .
The option of military strikes against Pakistan 's Kahuta plant were also examined in the late 1970s but ruled out because the chances of success were rated too low when compared to the consequences of going ahead .
After the Israeli bombing ... many scientists came and applied specifically to work on the programme
Dr Jafar Dhia Jafar , Iraqi scientist
But there is one important precedent for an attack on nuclear facilities .
In June 1981 , eight Israeli fighter jets took only 90 seconds to destroy Iraq 's Osirak reactor in an audacious bombing raid .
It is sometimes cited as a precedent for a US or Israeli ( or joint ) attack on Iran , but is it really a useful parallel ?
In that case , Israel had come to the conclusion that the US and the international community were not willing to take sufficient action after Iraq purchased a reactor from France .
Once it became clear that diplomatic pressure and covert methods had failed to stop Iraq - and also that an attack by commandos was too difficult - Prime Minister Menachem Begin ordered an aerial assault .
But did the Osirak raid stop - or even significantly slow down - the Iraqi nuclear programme ?
The evidence is not conclusive .
In terms of intent , the raid did not stop Saddam Hussein , it only forced him to change tactics for achieving his goal of a nuclear bomb and also intensify his work .
Increased determination
In the wake of the Israeli raid , Saddam Hussein personally summoned an experienced British - educated scientist Dr Jafar Dhia Jafar from jail .
" He told me we must develop a deterrent , " Dr Jafar recalled in an interview with me shortly after he fled Baghdad in 2003 .
It was in the wake of the raid that Saddam Hussein moved far more definitively towards an active weapons programme rather than a latent programme which could be diverted towards weapons at a later stage .
Iran 's Natanz nuclear plant is largely underground
And the attack failed to have any deterrent effect within the country .
" After the Israeli bombing of June 1981 , many scientists came and applied specifically to work on the programme , " Dr Jafar recalled .
The number of scientists increased from 400 to 7,000 and Saddam Hussein poured far more resources into the programme - something like $ 10 bn over the coming years .
He was also far more careful in hiding the programme from the outside world .
The result was that when inspectors scoured Iraq after the 1991 war they found that it had made much more progress than anyone had realised ( although what many failed to spot , according to Dr Jafar , was that in 1991 Saddam gave orders to destroy the programme ) .
Iran - and other countries - have also learnt from the Osirak raid by dispersing their nuclear research over a number of sites and by building plants such as Natanz deep underground covered by layer upon layer of earth and concrete , making the effectiveness of even bunker - busting bombs questionable .
There are also far more sites in Iran now than there were in Iraq back in 1981 and there are real questions over whether US and Israel can be confident enough that their intelligence has sight of all of the programme .
Because of the way in which states learnt from the Israeli raid on Osirak , that strike may well be a one - off in terms of effectiveness which cannot be easily replicated .
Tough choices
So a strike against Iran would risk leaving more of the programme and knowledge intact than was the case in 1981 but could have the same political impact in terms of increasing the determination to develop nuclear technology as fast as possible .
Of course , much would depend on the intensity of the strike - but a prolonged strike might lead to many more civilian casualties and a much greater international backlash .
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for energy only
As with many of the recent reports on the options against Iran , the latest report by Frank Barnaby and the Oxford Research Group emphasises the negative consequences of taking action .
But what is less fully analysed or debated are the consequences of failing to act and of Iran actually developing a nuclear arsenal ( if indeed that is what it is seeking ) .
Even if traditional deterrence made it unlikely that Iran would use the weapon , it could embolden Iranian behaviour across the region , directed not just against Israel through allies like Hezbollah but also against other states in the Gulf .
In turn it would almost certainly lead other Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt at the very least to consider whether they too required a nuclear option .
If the choice was between the status quo and military action then there would be no real need for a debate but , in the minds of many experts and policymakers , that is not the choice that is being faced .
Oil prices had risen on Thursday after a pipeline fire
Concerns that a pipeline fire in the US would disrupt supplies have also faded .
A barrel of light crude fell $ 2.3 to end at $ 88.71 in New York , far below its $ 99 high seen on 21 November .
Brent crude fell $ 1.96 to $ 88.26 in London .
Traders are focused on an OPEC meeting next week in Abu Dhabi , where the 12 - member cartel is expected to decide whether to increase production .
Several ministers from Opec nations have said in recent days that the group is ready to boost output to bring prices down
They do n't always have to be dropouts , just those that failed in school assessments ( so not people like Bill Gates who dropped out because of a clash with his fledgling business ) .
Bonus points if their failure is the same thing that led to their success - for instance , yesterday I read about an Australian music photographer whose photo won a music magazine competition and earned him a job as staff photographer , but the same photo got him a fail at TAFE .
Or a graphic designer who failed in Arts at school .
By " success " it does n't have to be " million dollars " - any definition ( respect , happiness , sustainability ) will do .
Who in history ( or in your life ) has flunked / failed in school or university , but has gone on to great success ?
Emanuel said Pelosi and other top Democrats have not begun key consultations with lawmakers yet — and he was unsure when they would .
Miers , Bolten contempt filings delayed
House Democratic leaders have decided to postpone a vote on a criminal contempt resolution against White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers for several weeks , and possibly longer , according to top lawmakers and aides .
The decision delays any constitutional showdown , at least for the moment , between Congress and President Bush over the extent of executive privilege and the president ’s ability to fend off congressional investigations .

But the slowdown , approved by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and her top lieutenants , is also stirring objections among Democrats .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) said he is uncomfortable with the delay and worries the House will be seen as toothless unless it moves quickly to hold top officials in contempt for failing to provide documents and testimony in congressional probes .
The House Judiciary Committee approved contempt citations against Bolten and Miers on July 25 , after the two failed to comply with subpoenas as part of the committee ’s investigation into the sacking of nine U.S. attorneys .
Bush declared that documents and testimony related to the scandal are covered by executive privilege , while Democrats argue that the White House must release the information or be in violation of the law .
The White House has instructed the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia , Jeffrey Taylor , not to enforce the contempt citations if approved by Congress .
That would force Democratic leaders to either go to court to enforce them or use the power of “ inherent contempt ” to hold congressional hearings on the matter , with the threat of imprisonment against noncompliant witnesses .
Democrats had vowed to take up the issue when Congress returned from its August break , with Democratic leaders declaring that any failure to do so would undermine the ability of Congress to conduct its constitutionally mandated oversight role .
“ Congress will act to preserve and protect our criminal justice system and to ensure appropriate congressional oversight in all areas essential to the well - being of the American people , ” Pelosi said back then .
But Pelosi decided to delay a vote until at least late September , and possibly into October .
Democrats said they are not yet ready for such a vote because they have not briefed lawmakers on what it would mean and how the controversy would play out , both legally and politically .
“ I do n’t think anything is going to happen on that for a while , ” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel ( Ill . ) .
“ When you decide to do that , you have to make your best case .
You want everyone to understand what ’s happening and why . ”
Emanuel said Pelosi and other top Democrats have not begun those consultations yet — and he was unsure when they would .
Conyers said it was critical for Congress to enforce its subpoenas against executive branch officials , including senior White House aides .
“ Otherwise , we just become a [ social ] club , ” Conyers said , adding that he would be reviewing the issue with Pelosi soon .
With the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on Aug. 27 , some of the urgency has gone out of the U.S. attorney probe , though both Conyers and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) have declared they will continue investigating .
Miers has been called to testify on her knowledge of the firings , while Bolten was subpoenaed as custodian of internal White House documents .
Leahy met with White House counsel Fred Fielding last week to discuss potential replacements for Gonzales , and Leahy reiterated that the White House must comply with congressional demands for documents and testimony on the U.S attorney firings , as well as the probe into the NSA ’s wireless eavesdropping program and other issues .
Fielding has declined to make Miers , former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove and other top Bush aides available to congressional investigators unless they appear behind closed doors , with no transcript kept and without any ability for lawmakers to subpoena them afterward .
House and Senate Democrats have rejected that offer , but only the House Judiciary panel has gone as far as to approve a contempt resolution .
Republican congressional leaders have dismissed the prosecutor probe as a politically motivated maneuver , designed to embarrass the White House .
But the Justice Department inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility have begun their own investigations into allegations of whether Gonzales or his senior aides lied to or misled congressional investigators or used political affiliation to screen applicants for career positions .

A large triple bombing killed or wounded scores of people in the southern city of Amarah .
Meanwhile a smaller blast in Baghdad left over a dozen casualties there .
Overall , 59 Iraqis were killed and 177 more were wounded in the latest violence .
No Coalition deaths were reported .
At least 28 people were killed and another 150 were wounded during a triple car bombing in Amarah .
Although small arms attacks against civilians have been increasing in recent weeks throughout Maysan province , the news of a triple bombing in Amarah stunned Iraq this morning .
The area had been relatively peaceful since the British handed over control to Iraqi forces in April .
British forces promise that an expected handover of neighboring Basra province will go on schedule this Sunday despite the bombing .
The casualty figures were downgraded on Thursday from 41 killed ; confusion following the blasts were the cause of misinformation .
In Baghdad , a booby - trapped car in the al - Ghadeer neighborhood left five dead and 13 injured .
In Doura , gunmen injured a policeman .
Three employees were wounded during an armed attack in al - Tobchi .
Mortas in al - Ganat injured three more people .
Also , five dumped bodies were recovered .
A roadside bomb killed one person and wounded two others in Kirkuk .
Two Sunni tribal council members were found dead in Latifiya .
In Saidiya , gunmen killed a headmaster and teacher at a school .

China has ordered a probe into the toxic river spill that led to millions of people having their water supplies cut for several days .
The government has also apologised to Moscow for the pollution , which is heading towards the Russian border city of Khabarovsk .
The accident could cause political damage as well as physical harm
A PUBLIC apology from China is an exceptionally rare event .
But as a slick of toxic water makes its way along the half - frozen Songhua River towards the Russian city of Khabarovsk , the country 's leadership is saying sorry .
This is not , however , to be read as a sign of an imminent end to the secretive culture that for days attempted to cover up one of China 's worst ever pollution spills into its waterways .
The November 13th discharge of some 100 tonnes of benzene and nitrobenzene from a petrochemical plant in the north - eastern province of Jilin could end up causing political damage as well as physical harm .
So far , at least , no casualties have been reported , apart from five people killed in the explosion that created the slick ( though local officials have a great incentive to cover up such details ) .
On Sunday November 27th , officials in Harbin , capital of the neighbouring province of Heilongjiang , reactivated the city 's water supply after the slick passed by without major incident .
The chemicals can be very dangerous if inhaled or ingested in sufficient concentrations .
To reassure jittery residents , the provincial governor , Zhang Zuoji , was shown on television drinking a glass of tap water pumped from Harbin 's stretch of the river ( which is hardly clean at the best of times but is now at least said to have safe levels of the leaked chemicals ) .
But as the 80 km ( 50 - mile ) slick moves on downstream towards Khabarovsk , 700 km to the northeast , where it is expected to arrive by early December , there could be significant political fallout .
China 's prime minister , Wen Jiabao , visited Harbin on Saturday , four days after the city had turned off all tap water to prevent contamination .
As many residents queued for water delivered to neighbourhoods by truck , Mr Wen pledged that investigations would be conducted to determine responsibility for the disaster .
PetroChina , a giant state - controlled company listed on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges , has apologised for the explosion at a factory run by Jilin Petrochemical , a subsidiary .
Officials in Jilin , who kept quiet for days about the slick , have also said sorry .
So too has China 's foreign minister , Li Zhaoxing , to Russia 's government .
But officials in Harbin have been defensive about their decision , even after they discovered the approaching threat , to keep the spill secret from residents until the last minute .
At first they said the water supply would be turned off for “ maintenance ” .
China has a habit of dishing out blame after big accidents , but remains unwilling to address the culture of secretiveness that can aggravate such problems .
Last year , PetroChina 's chairman , Ma Fucai , stepped down following an accident at one of his company 's plants in the south - western city of Chongqing in December 2003 , which killed more than 200 people in a cloud of hydrogen sulfide gas .
Earlier that year , the mayor of Beijing and the health minister were sacked for mishandling an outbreak of SARS , an often fatal respiratory disease .
Yet despite official admissions that the disease could have been better controlled if the public had been informed more promptly , Chinese officials have been reluctant , at least until very recently , to be fully open about the spread of bird flu .
It is highly unlikely that those sacked during the SARS outbreak were as responsible as they were portrayed to be .
Higher - level officials were almost certainly just as culpable , but were spared because of their rank .
What is unclear in the case of the Songhua River incident is whether the central authorities were aware of the extent of the problem before it was finally revealed last week .
The prime minister did not openly apologise for any central - government failings during his visit to Harbin .
The likelihood is that blame will mainly be apportioned lower down the line .
As during the SARS outbreak , China 's state - controlled media have been unusually feisty in their criticisms of the way news about the river pollution has been handled .
In 2003 , some optimists believed that China would emerge from SARS with a government less inclined to knee - jerk secrecy and possibly more tolerant of media exposure of its shortcomings .
Many Chinese journalists say they have been disappointed .
As the slick moved along the Songhua river towards Harbin , it passed through Songyuan , a big city in Jilin , without a word of warning being issued to the public ( though water supplies were suspended ) .
It may be a long time before there is a full accounting of any harm done .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - War and politics are largely ignored by American teenagers , according to a Harvard University study released on Tuesday , which found that 60 percent of them pay little attention to daily news .
Researchers interviewed 1,800 people between January and March and found that 28 percent of Americans between the ages of 12 and 17 said they pay almost no attention to news every day .
Another 32 percent said they pay only casual attention to one news source a day .
“ News is not something that gets a lot of time or attention or interest from teens , ” said Thomas Patterson , a professor of government and the press at Harvard ’s John F. Kennedy School of Government .
Among people aged 18 to 30 , the poll found 48 percent said they are inattentive to daily news .
Only 23 percent of older Americans said they largely ignore news .
In general , soft stories about celebrities interest young people more than hard news stories like congressional votes or developments in Iraq .
One reason teenagers may pay less attention to news than older Americans is only one in 20 young people rely heavily on a daily newspaper , according to the survey , which had a margin of error of 2 percent to 3 percent .
The poll was released amid tough times for many American newspapers , with falling readership and advertising revenue .
Even the Internet , the preferred way for teenagers and young adults to get news , is not stimulating interest in current affairs , Patterson said .
Internet - based news , receives about the same attention from older adults as it does from younger ones , the survey found .
“ It is hard to pick up a newspaper and ignore that there is a front page , but with the Internet it is easy to play games or conduct a search without seeing news , ” said Patterson .
“ On the Internet you have to make a deliberate choice to go somewhere and we are finding that young people are not making an appointment with news . ”
Teenagers and young adults are twice as likely to watch television for their daily news , relying largely on the same types of outlets as older Americans , the survey found .
The only difference is that older Americans are twice as likely to watch television news regularly .
Judge Submits Official Recommendation to DEA Urging End to 40 - Year Barrier to FDA - Approved Medical Marijuana Research
WASHINGTON D.C. – A U.S. Department of Justice - appointed judge submitted her final recommendation to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) on May 15 , calling on the agency to end a forty - year government monopoly on the supply of research - grade marijuana available for Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) - approved studies .
With this monopoly broken , new studies could lead to medical marijuana ’s availability in pharmacies as a legal , prescription drug .
DEA Deputy Administrator Michele Leonhart must now accept the judge ’s recommendation in order for the ruling to take effect , though she has no deadline for doing so and may choose to reject the recommendation .
“ Medical marijuana is one step away from the FDA development process , where it should be .
Science , not politics , needs to determine whether medical marijuana should be made legal , and the DEA has so far tried to block the scientific process , ” said University of Massachusetts - Amherst Professor Lyle Craker , who six years ago petitioned DEA for a license to grow research - grade marijuana for use in privately - funded , FDA - approved studies that aim to develop the plant into a legal , prescription medicine .
“ I hope that the Deputy Administrator acts quickly to allow this critical research to move forward . ”
On May 15 , DEA Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner submitted her recommendation to the DEA ’s Deputy Administrator in which she found that it is “ in the public interest ” to end the federal monopoly on the supply of marijuana that can be used in FDA - approved research , held by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) .
Following nine days of hearings , testimony and evidence from both sides , including from researchers who reported that the government denied their requests for marijuana for use in FDA - approved research protocols , Judge Bittner concluded that , “ NIDA ’s system for evaluating requests for marijuana has resulted in some researchers who hold DEA registrations and requisite approval from [ HHS and FDA ] being unable to conduct their research because NIDA has refused to provide them with marijuana .
I therefore find that the existing supply is not adequate . ”
She added , “ Respondent ’s registration to cultivate marijuana would be in the public interest . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) represents Craker in the proceedings , and pointed to the groundswell of support for medical research and calls for marijuana to go through the FDA development process without delay to determine whether it could be made available to patients in pharmacies .
“ The DEA has forced patients to get their medicine from the street corner instead of from pharmacies by blocking the very research that would put the medical marijuana issue through proper regulatory channels , ” said Allen Hopper , legal director of the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project .
“ The time has come for the government to stop putting politics before science and to allow the research , not the politicians , to decide whether medical marijuana should be made legal . ”
Legal papers filed throughout the proceedings pointed to the fact that marijuana is the only Schedule I drug the DEA has prohibited from being produced by private laboratories for scientific research .
Other controlled substances , including LSD , MDMA ( also known as " Ecstasy " ) , heroin and cocaine , are available to researchers from DEA - licensed private laboratories .
In contrast , NIDA has remained scientists ’ sole source of marijuana , despite the agency ’s repeated refusal to make marijuana available for privately - funded , FDA - approved research that seeks to develop smoked or vaporized marijuana into a legal , prescription medicine .
During the legal proceedings , the ACLU and others argued that such research conflicts with NIDA ’s core mission , which is to study the harmful , not potentially medicinal , effects of drugs of abuse .
In addition , researchers report that marijuana available through NIDA is of low quality and variety and is not optimized to meet FDA standards for prescription drug development .
Professor Craker ’s proposed facility to grow high - quality medical marijuana for research purposes will be funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( MAPS ) , a non-profit pharmaceutical company with plans to develop marijuana into a fully legal , prescription medication .
“ For decades , we ’ve been told by the politicians that marijuana has no proven medical value while scientists have been denied the ability to prove otherwise , ” said Rick Doblin , Ph.D. , president and founder of MAPS .
“ Judge Bittner ’s recommendation marks a shift in this debate .
I look forward to facilitating for marijuana the same rigorous , scientific research required to bring all other prescription medicines to market . ”
Thirty - eight members of the U.S. House of Representatives , Massachusetts Senators John Kerry ( D - MA ) and Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) , and a broad range of scientific , medical and public health organizations have joined Professor Craker in challenging the federal government ’s policy of blocking administrative channels and obstructing research that could lead to the development of marijuana as a prescription medicine .
These organizations include the Lymphoma Foundation of America , the National Association for Public Health Policy , the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation , as well as several state medical and nurses ’ associations .
Despite federal prohibition , 13 states have enacted legislation protecting patients who use medical marijuana with a physician ’s recommendation from prosecution under state law , and national polls consistently find that roughly 75 percent of Americans support the use of medical marijuana .
The ACLU is co-counsel in the case , In the Matter of Lyle Craker , with Julie Carpenter at the Washington D.C. law firm Jenner & Block , LLP and is assisted by Steptoe & Johnson , LLP .

When Someone Says
They Actually Mean
You have produced an especially insightful and valid point that seems to have potential benefits for all parties .
We will discuss your suggestion at the next meeting .
There is n't a chance in hell that we 'll approve your idea .
The promotion committee has spent countless hours carefully considering all your contributions , your research publications , your interaction with students , and your record of service to the department .
After two minutes of discussion , they decided that you wo n't get tenure .
A subcommittee of four has met and decided that students would benefit most from a diverse background that will be gained from selected courses .
We signed a mutual pact that requires all students to take one course from each of us .
High enrollments in elective courses cannot be used as a measure of content validity or teaching quality .
I do n't have high enrollments in my courses .
After careful study and long deliberation , we have finally decided to step aside and allow junior faculty more opportunities for contact with upper levels of the administration .
The Dean just demanded another pigeon for his new committee , and it certainly wo n't be us .
We should establish a policy that eschews industrial research funding because the long - term commercial influence of such grants will degrade our fundamental research emphasis .
Industry wo n't touch my work with a ten - foot pole , and I hate seeing other faculty get the money .
We agree that high quality in both our graduate and undergraduate program is of the utmost importance , and should be a priority item for the coming academic year .
We 'll talk about quality all year , but we wo n't change anything .
You are doing me an immense favor by agreeing to serve on the committee , and I will remember it when you come up for tenure .
You 're a sucker ; do n't expect anything in return .
Sure some of our faculty did their Ph.D. with ``big names '' .
But I ask you , have they actually achieved a career commensurate with their early promise , or are they merely overshadowed by a prodigious advisor ?
You never heard of my Ph.D. advisor .
We have decided to avoid discussion of national rankings because we have observed that continual references to such things can have a subtle and detrimental effect on the morale of our junior faculty .
We are spiraling downward , but let 's not talk about it .
It should be obvious that we are much better than others realize ; some of the research here is much more interesting , challenging , and significant than that of the ``so called '' experts .
I wish I could redefine the field so that someone valued what I did .
Sure , we have faculty who create software that is widely used in industry and has been incorporated into commercial products , but have they really amassed a solid record of publications in the most elite journals ?
My research only gets published in obscure theory journals , and I hate seeing other faculty have real impact .
Places like Stanford and MIT are n't as good as they think because I once beat a faculty from those places in a grant competition .
I only won against them once .
After careful consideration , I find that I cannot support a faculty candidate from a place like Stanford because experience suggests that they might not fit in well with our faculty , and collegiality is one of our most important goals .
Someone who is really smart and productive would make me look bad .
We decided that it would be in the student 's best interest to require a large set of prerequisites that broaden their background before they enroll in our more focused courses .
We signed a pact that requires students to take our obscure theory courses before they can get into the systems courses they want .
We know you will understand that in addition to an individual 's accomplishments and departmental contributions , there are a variety of considerations used in annual evaluation and justification of compensation , including absolute standing among peers at the same institution , resources available from the university administration , relative performance in specific areas of research , teaching , and service .
We decided to give you a low raise this year and use the money for something else .
Everything has changed and a new era has begun -- despite lean times in the past , the administration is now supporting our department by allowing us to hire as many new faculty as we need .
Now that demand is so high we can't find any faculty to hire , the administration has finally agreed to give us positions ; they will disappear as soon as supply increases again .
Should the state be involved in marriage ?
Writing in the NYTimes professor of history Stephanie Coontz notes :
The American colonies officially required marriages to be
registered , but until the mid-19th century , state supreme courts
routinely ruled that public cohabitation was sufficient evidence of a
valid marriage .
By the later part of that century , however , the United
States began to nullify common - law marriages and exert more control
over who was allowed to marry .
By the 1920s , 38 states
prohibited whites from marrying blacks , “ mulattos , ” Japanese , Chinese ,
Indians , “ Mongolians , ” “ Malays ” or Filipinos .
Twelve states would not
issue a marriage license if one partner was a drunk , an addict or a
“ mental defect . ”
Eighteen states set barriers to remarriage after
divorce .
It ’s no accident that the state began restricting and intervening in the marriage contract at the same time as it was restricting and intervening in economic contracts .
It was of course the evil Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. who dissented in Lochner v. New York and who also upheld forced sterilization laws in Buck v. Bell ( writing that " three generations of imbeciles in enough . " )
Economists do n’t like to talk about social externalities but the connection between economic and social regulation is very clear in the progressives .
I think it ’s time to restore
freedom of contract to marriage .
Why should two men , for example , be denied the same rights to contract as are allowed to a man and a woman ?
Far from ending civilization the extension of the bourgeoisie concept of contract ever further is the epitome of civilization .
Our modern concept of marriage , for example , is simply one instantiation of the idea of contract .
People will claim that this means a chaos of contracts for every form of marriage .
This is wrong factually and also conceptually misguided .
Factually , we already allow men and women to adjust the marriage contract as they see fit with pre-nuptials .
Moreover , different states offer different marriage contracts with some offering more than one type .
Partnerships of other kinds have access to all manner of contractual arrangements without insufferable problems .
More importantly , the chaos of contracts argument is fundamentally misguided .
The purpose of contract law is to give individual ’s greater control over their lives .
To make contract law a restraint on how people may govern themselves is a perversion of the social contract .
To restrict people from accessing the tools of civilization on the basis of their sexual preference is baseless discrimination .
It is time to restore
freedom of contract to marriage , Laissez - faire for all capitalist acts between consenting adults !
Thanks to Daniel Akst for the pointer .
Per a statement and video on his website :
As many of you know , over the last few months I have been thinking hard about my plans for 2008 .
Running for the presidency is a profound decision - a decision no one should make on the basis of media hype or personal ambition alone - and so before I committed myself and my family to this race , I wanted to be sure that this was right for us and , more importantly , right for the country .
I certainly did n't expect to find myself in this position a year ago .
But as I 've spoken to many of you in my travels across the states these past months ; as I 've read your emails and read your letters ; I 've been struck by how hungry we all are for a different kind of politics .
So I 've spent some time thinking about how I could best advance the cause of change and progress that we so desperately need .
The decisions that have been made in Washington these past six years , and the problems that have been ignored , have put our country in a precarious place .
Our economy is changing rapidly , and that means profound changes for working people .
Many of you have shared with me your stories about skyrocketing health care bills , the pensions you 've lost and your struggles to pay for college for your kids .
Our continued dependence on oil has put our security and our very planet at risk .
And we 're still mired in a tragic and costly war that should have never been waged .
But challenging as they are , it 's not the magnitude of our problems that concerns me the most .
It 's the smallness of our politics .
America 's faced big problems before .
But today , our leaders in Washington seem incapable of working together in a practical , common sense way .
Politics has become so bitter and partisan , so gummed up by money and influence , that we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions .
And that 's what we have to change first .
We have to change our politics , and come together around our common interests and concerns as Americans .
This wo n't happen by itself .
A change in our politics can only come from you ; from people across our country who believe there 's a better way and are willing to work for it .
Years ago , as a community organizer in Chicago , I learned that meaningful change always begins at the grassroots , and that engaged citizens working together can accomplish extraordinary things .
So even in the midst of the enormous challenges we face today , I have great faith and hope about the future - because I believe in you .
And that 's why I wanted to tell you first that I 'll be filing papers today to create a presidential exploratory committee .
For the next several weeks , I am going to talk with people from around the country , listening and learning more about the challenges we face as a nation , the opportunities that lie before us , and the role that a presidential campaign might play in bringing our country together .
And on February 10th , at the end of these decisions and in my home state of Illinois , I 'll share my plans with my friends , neighbors and fellow Americans .
In the meantime , I want to thank all of you for your time , your suggestions , your encouragement and your prayers .
And I look forward to continuing our conversation in the weeks and months to come .

I had a problem .
While using and teaching agile practices like test - driven development ( TDD ) on projects in different environments , I kept coming across the same confusion and misunderstandings .
Programmers wanted to know where to start , what to test and what not to test , how much to test in one go , what to call their tests , and how to understand why a test fails .
The deeper I got into TDD , the more I felt that my own journey had been less of a wax - on , wax - off process of gradual mastery than a series of blind alleys .
I remember thinking “ If only someone had told me that ! ” far more often than I thought “ Wow , a door has opened . ”
I decided it must be possible to present TDD in a way that gets straight to the good stuff and avoids all the pitfalls .
My response is behaviour - driven development ( BDD ) .
It has evolved out of established agile practices and is designed to make them more accessible and effective for teams new to agile software delivery .
Over time , BDD has grown to encompass the wider picture of agile analysis and automated acceptance testing .
Test method names should be sentences
My first “ Aha ! ” moment occurred as I was being shown a deceptively simple utility called agiledox , written by my colleague , Chris Stevenson .
It takes a JUnit test class and prints out the method names as plain sentences , so a test case that looks like this :
public class CustomerLookupTest extends TestCase { testFindsCustomerById ( ) { ... } testFailsForDuplicateCustomers ( ) { ... } ... }
renders something like this :
CustomerLookup - finds customer by id - fails for duplicate customers - ...
The word “ test ” is stripped from both the class name and the method names , and the camel - case method name is converted into regular text .
That ’s all it does , but its effect is amazing .
Developers discovered it could do at least some of their documentation for them , so they started to write test methods that were real sentences .
What ’s more , they found that when they wrote the method name in the language of the business domain , the generated documents made sense to business users , analysts , and testers .
A simple sentence template keeps test methods focused
Then I came across the convention of starting test method names with the word “ should . ”
This sentence template –
The class should do something – means you can only define a test for the current class .
This keeps you focused .
If you find yourself writing a test whose name does n’t fit this template , it suggests the behaviour may belong elsewhere .
For instance , I was writing a class that validates input from a screen .
Most of the fields are regular client details – forename , surname , etc. – but then there is a field for date of birth and one for age .
I started writing a ClientDetailsValidatorTest with methods like testShouldFailForMissingSurname and testShouldFailForMissingTitle .
Then I got into calculating the age and entered a world of fiddly business rules :
What if the age and date of birth are both provided but do n’t agree ?
What if the birthday is today ?
How do I calculate age if I only have a date of birth ?
I was writing increasingly cumbersome test method names to describe this behaviour , so I considered handing it off to something else .
This led me to introduce a new class I called AgeCalculator , with its own AgeCalculatorTest .
All the age calculation behaviour moved into the calculator , so the validator needed only one test around the age calculation to ensure it interacted properly with the calculator .
If a class is doing more than one thing , I usually take it as an indication that I should introduce other classes to do some of the work .
I define the new service as an interface describing what it does , and I pass this service in through the class ’s constructor :
public class ClientDetailsValidator { private final AgeCalculator ageCalc ; public ClientDetailsValidator ( AgeCalculator ageCalc ) { this .ageCalc = ageCalc ; } }
This style of wiring objects together , known as dependency injection , is especially useful in conjunction with mocks .
An expressive test name is helpful when a test fails
After a while , I found that if I was changing code and caused a test to fail , I could look at the test method name and identify the intended behaviour of the code .
Typically one of three things had happened :
I had introduced a bug .
Bad me .
Solution : Fix the bug .
The intended behaviour was still relevant but had moved elsewhere .
Solution : Move the test and maybe change it .
The behaviour was no longer correct – the premise of the system had changed .
Solution : Delete the test .
The latter is likely to happen on agile projects as your understanding evolves .
Unfortunately , novice TDDers have an innate fear of deleting tests , as though it somehow reduces the quality of their code .
A more subtle aspect of the word should becomes apparent when compared with the more formal alternatives of will or shall .
Should implicitly allows you to challenge the premise of the test : “ Should it ?
Really ? ”
This makes it easier to decide whether a test is failing due to a bug you have introduced or simply because your previous assumptions about the system ’s behaviour are now incorrect .
“ Behaviour ” is a more useful word than “ test ”
Now I had a tool – agiledox – to remove the word “ test ” and a template for each test method name .
It suddenly occurred to me that people ’s misunderstandings about TDD almost always came back to the word “ test ” .
That ’s not to say that testing is n’t intrinsic to TDD – the resulting set of methods is an effective way of ensuring your code works .
However , if the methods do not comprehensively describe the behaviour of your system , then they are lulling you into a false sense of security .
I started using the word “ behaviour ” in place of “ test ” in my dealings with TDD and found that not only did it seem to fit but also that a whole category of coaching questions magically dissolved .
I now had answers to some of those TDD questions .
What to call your test is easy – it ’s a sentence describing the next behaviour in which you are interested .
How much to test becomes moot – you can only describe so much behaviour in a single sentence .
When a test fails , simply work through the process described above – either you introduced a bug , the behaviour moved , or the test is no longer relevant .
I found the shift from thinking in tests to thinking in behaviour so profound that I started to refer to TDD as BDD , or behaviour - driven development .
JBehave emphasizes behaviour over testing
At the end of 2003 , I decided it was time to put my money – or at least my time – where my mouth was .
I started writing a replacement for JUnit called JBehave , which removed any reference to testing and replaced it with a vocabulary built around verifying behaviour .
I did this to see how such a framework would evolve if I adhered strictly to my new behaviour - driven mantras .
I also thought it would be a valuable teaching tool for introducing TDD and BDD without the distractions of the test - based vocabulary .
To define the behaviour for a hypothetical CustomerLookup class , I would write a behaviour class called , for example , CustomerLookupBehaviour .
It would contain methods that started with the word “ should . ”
The behaviour runner would instantiate the behaviour class and invoke each of the behaviour methods in turn , as JUnit does with its tests .
It would report progress as it went and print a summary at the end .
My first milestone was to make JBehave self - verifying .
I only added behaviour that would enable it to run itself .
I was able to migrate all the JUnit tests to JBehave behaviours and get the same immediate feedback as with JUnit .
Determine the next most important behaviour
I then discovered the concept of business value .
Of course , I had always been aware that I wrote software for a reason , but I had never really thought about the value of the code I was writing right now .
Another colleague , business analyst Chris Matts , set me thinking about business value in the context of behaviour - driven development .
Given that I had the target in mind of making JBehave self - hosting , I found that a really useful way to stay focused was to ask :
What ’s the next most important thing the system does n’t do ?
This question requires you to identify the value of the features you have n’t yet implemented and to prioritize them .
It also helps you formulate the behaviour method name :
The system does n’t do X ( where X is some meaningful behaviour ) , and X is important , which means it should do X ; so your next behaviour method is simply :
public void shouldDoX ( ) { // ... }
Now I had an answer to another TDD question , namely where to start .
Requirements are behaviour , too
At this point , I had a framework that helped me understand – and more importantly , explain – how TDD works and an approach that avoided all the pitfalls I had encountered .
Toward the end of 2004 , while I was describing my new found , behaviour - based vocabulary to Matts , he said , “ But that ’s just like analysis . ”
There was a long pause while we processed this , and then we decided to apply all of this behaviour - driven thinking to defining requirements .
If we could develop a consistent vocabulary for analysts , testers , developers , and the business , then we would be well on the way to eliminating some of the ambiguity and miscommunication that occur when technical people talk to business people .
BDD provides a “ ubiquitous language ” for analysis
Around this time , Eric Evans published his bestselling book Domain - Driven Design .
In it , he describes the concept of modeling a system using a ubiquitous language based on the business domain , so that the business vocabulary permeates
right into the codebase .
Chris and I realized we were trying to define a ubiquitous language for the analysis process itself !
We had a good starting point .
In common use within the company there was already a story template that looked like this :
As a [ X ]
I want [ Y ]
so that [ Z ]
where Y is some feature , Z is the benefit or value of the feature , and X is the person ( or role ) who will benefit .
Its strength is that it forces you to identify the value of delivering a story when you first define it .
When there is no real business value for a story , it often comes down to something like ” . . .
I want [ some feature ] so that [ I just do , ok ? ] . ”
This can make it easier to descope some of the more esoteric requirements .
From this starting point , Matts and I set about discovering what every agile tester already knows :
A story ’s behaviour is simply its acceptance criteria – if the system fulfills all the acceptance criteria , it ’s behaving correctly ; if it does n’t , it is n’t .
So we created a template to capture a story ’s acceptance criteria .
The template had to be loose enough that it would n’t feel artificial or constraining to analysts but structured enough that we could break the story into its constituent fragments and automate them .
We started describing the acceptance criteria in terms of scenarios , which took the following form :
Given some initial context ( the givens ) ,
When an event occurs ,
then ensure some outcomes .
To illustrate , let ’s use the classic example of an ATM machine .
One of the story cards might look like this :
+ Title : Customer withdraws cash +
As a customer ,
I want to withdraw cash from an ATM ,
so that I do n’t have to wait in line at the bank .
So how do we know when we have delivered this story ?
There are several scenarios to consider : the account may be in credit , the account may be overdrawn but within the overdraft limit , the account may be overdrawn beyond the overdraft limit .
Of course , there will be other scenarios , such as if the account is in credit but this withdrawal makes it overdrawn , or if the dispenser has insufficient cash .
Using the given - when - then template , the first two scenarios might look like this :
+ Scenario 1 : Account is in credit +
Given the account is in credit
And the card is valid
And the dispenser contains cash
When the customer requests cash
Then ensure the account is debited
And ensure cash is dispensed
And ensure the card is returned
Notice the use of “ and ” to connect multiple givens or multiple outcomes in a natural way .
+ Scenario 2 : Account is overdrawn past the overdraft limit +
Given the account is overdrawn
And the card is valid
When the customer requests cash
Then ensure a rejection message is displayed
And ensure cash is not dispensed
And ensure the card is returned
Both scenarios are based on the same event and even have some givens and outcomes in common .
We want to capitalize on this by reusing givens , events , and outcomes .
Acceptance criteria should be executable
The fragments of the scenario – the givens , event , and outcomes – are fine - grained enough to be represented directly in code .
JBehave defines an object model that enables us to directly map the scenario fragments to Java classes .
You write a class representing each given :
public class AccountIsInCredit implements Given { public void setup( World world ) { ... } } public class CardIsValid implements Given { public void setup( World world ) { ... } }
and one for the event :
public class CustomerRequestsCash implements Event { public void occurIn ( World world ) { ... } }
and so on for the outcomes .
JBehave then wires these all together and executes them .
It creates a “ world , ” which is just somewhere to store your objects , and passes it to each of the givens in turn so they can populate the world with known state .
JBehave then tells the event to “ occur in ” the world , which carries out the actual behaviour of the scenario .
Finally it passes control to any outcomes we have defined for the story .
Having a class to represent each fragment enables us to reuse fragments in other scenarios or stories .
At first , the fragments are implemented using mocks to set an account to be in credit or a card to be valid .
These form the starting points for implementing behaviour .
As you implement the application , the givens and outcomes are changed to use the actual classes you have implemented , so that by the time the scenario is completed , they have become proper end - to - end functional tests .
The present and future of BDD
After a brief hiatus , JBehave is back under active development .
The core is fairly complete and robust .
The next step is integration with popular Java IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse .
Dave Astels has been actively promoting BDD .
His weblog and various published articles have provoked a flurry of activity , most notably the rspec project to produce a BDD framework in the Ruby language .
I have started work on rbehave , which will be an implementation of JBehave in Ruby .
A number of my co-workers have been using BDD techniques on a variety of real - world projects and have found the techniques very successful .
The JBehave story runner – the part that verifies acceptance criteria – is under active development .
The vision is to have a round - trip editor so that BAs and testers can capture stories in a regular text editor that can generate stubs for the behaviour classes , all in the language of the business domain .
BDD evolved with the help of many people , and I am hugely grateful to all of them .

I agree with Kevin Drum .
It ’s befuddling that the weekend ’s news about the Higazy decision and the FBI ’s attempt to censor the details of their conduct in the case out of the judges opinion has gone largely unremarked .
Now that I 'm reading the story : Holy shit !
Basically , the FBI coerced an innocent man into confessing by threatening his family with torture , eventually the man 's innocence became clear and an appeals court ruled in his favor , but the opinion was swiftly pulled off the web .
Then up came a new version :
The court simply omitted from the revised decision facts about how the FBI agent extracted the false confession from Higazy .
For some reason , this information is classified .
Just as the opinion gets interesting , when we are about to learn how an FBI agent named Templeton squeezed the " truth " out of Higazy , the opinion reads at page 7 : " This opinion has been redacted because portions of the record are under seal .
For the purposes of the summary judgment motion , Templeton did not contest that Higazy 's statements were coerced . "
The new rule of law -- even when your banana republic antics get caught and exposed , you can use the cover of national security secrets to keep the facts obscured .

The documentary War Made Easy : How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us To Death ( based on Norman Solomon ’s book of the same title ) is now playing at movie theatres and other independent venues throughout the United States .
The movie , narrated by actor Sean Penn , uses stunning archival video to expose a 50 - year pattern of White House deception and media propaganda that has dragged our country into one military intervention after another from Vietnam to Iraq .
Rare footage also spotlights heroes who have resisted the war barrage : people like Sen.
Wayne Morse , Rep. Barbara Lee and Phil Donahue .
Reviewers have called it “ Superb ” ( Howard Zinn ) , “ Chilling and persuasive ” ( The Nation ) and “ Damning ” ( Variety ) .
Your seeing War Made Easy now and spreading the word , particularly if you buy a ticket to a theatre , could help it gain wider release .
See where the nearest showing to you is now .
The Bush Administration has carefully described its warrantless wiretapping program by saying it involved international phone calls and emails where at least one party was suspected of ties to terrorist groups and one party was inside the country .
Most , including this reporter , have assumed that this meant that the program eavesdropped on the communications of Americans who emailed or called a suspected terrorist outside the country .
But it ’s seeming increasingly likely to me , that both of the “ one parties ” in their description really refers to people inside the United States .
That is the program seems to have targeted the international communications of Americans who the government suspected of ties to terrorist groups , but who the government did not have enough information to get court approval to spy on .
For instance , if the government learned of a cell phone number being used in the Pakistan trial regions , the intelligence community could target that phone and listen in to all calls to and from that phone so long as the National Security Agency listened in using spy gear outside the United States ( there are some nuances that allow the NSA to listen in on radio and satellite communications from U.S. soil , but anything on a copper or fiber optic wire has to be captured outside the United States ) .
Calls from an American to that phone could be listened to without getting a warrant , but if the conversation had no intelligence value it had to be destroyed .
So if the NSA was targeting suspected terrorists overseas , they could listen in to Americans who called that person without getting a warrant , and not be doing so outside of the nation ’s spy law ( the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . )
Suppose , however , the nation ’s intelligence community wanted to find “ sleeper cells ” or terrorist sympathizers inside the United States .
In this scenario , the nation ’s spooks decide to get years of phone records from American telecom companies and data mine them for people who made repeated calls to suspect regions , such as Lebanon , Somalia or the Pakistani .
The NSA could also use the records to determine who called a newly discovered overseas suspected terrorist number in the time before the government knew about that overseas person .
Then the NSA could decide they have enough information to target those Americans ’ overseas communications , but not enough to get a warrant from a secret spy court to go after all of their phone calls .
This is all in keeping with 1 ) the government ’s acknowledgment that it had a targeted eavesdropping program , 2 ) its claims that it did not engage in dragnet “ content ” surveillance , and 3 ) that it has refused to confirm or deny reports that it created a massive call record database of American ’s communications ( though Congress members briefed on the program did confirm it )
But the difficulty in spying on Americans without warrants is that the government needs to get at the communication systems to capture the outgoing messages .
Overseas , the NSA uses its billions of dollars to find ways to capture satellite calls , wiretap cell phone networks and tap underseas cables .
But they legally can’t do that inside the United States .
So they ask the nation ’s telecoms to help them with an anti-terrorism program .
One says no , but others play along .
The NSA asks for , and gets , trillions of phone records .
Then they ask for and get help wiretapping the internet to look for overseas emails ( using the to : from : and subject lines ) that might lead them to “ sleeper cells ” in the United States .
Once they have that list of targets , say 1,000 or so ,
Indeed in the first press briefing on the program in December 2005 , then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and NSA chief Michael Hayden , Gonzales acknowledged that the target of the surveillance could be an American :
To the extent that there is a moderate and heavy communication involving an American citizen , it would be a communication where the other end of the call is outside the United States and where we believe that either the American citizen or the person outside the United States is somehow affiliated with al Qaeda .
In that case , the program violated the Constitution , according to the current Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell .
Today when asked about targeting Americans after hearing them on wiretaps targeting foreigners , McConnell told the Senate Judiciary Committee , “ If a U.S. person becomes a target .
you need to get a warrant .
[ Targeting a U.S. person without a warrant ] would be a violation of the Fourth Amendment . ”
That said , McConnell believes that nation ’s spy organization should be given the power to permanently infiltrate American ISPs and telecoms , and that everyone in the Administration and their partners ( ranging from telecoms , ISPs and hardware companies ) that were complicit in a four year program designed to violate the Constitutional rights of American citizens should be given immunity from any sanction from anyone .
FISA also makes it a crime , punishable by up to five years imprisonment , to spy on Americans except when authorized by law .

These days , if Rian Romoli accidentally bumps into a child , he quickly raises his hands above his shoulders .
" I do n't want to give even the slightest indication that any inadvertent touching occurred , " says Mr. Romoli , an economist in La Cañada Flintridge , Calif .
Ted Wallis , a doctor in Austin , Texas , recently came upon a lost child in tears in a mall .
His first instinct was to help , but he feared people might consider him a predator .
He walked away .
" Being male , " he explains , " I am guilty until proven innocent . "
In San Diego , retiree Ralph Castro says he wo n't allow himself to be alone with a child -- even in an elevator .
Last month , I wrote about how our culture teaches children to fear men .
Hundreds of men responded , many lamenting that they 've now become fearful of children .
They said they avert their eyes when kids are around , or think twice before holding even their own children 's hands in public .
Frank McEnulty , a builder in Long Beach , Calif. , was once a Boy Scout scoutmaster .
" Today , I would n't do that job for anything , " he says .
" All it takes is for one kid to get ticked off at you for something and tell his parents you were acting weird on the campout . "
It 's true that men are far more likely than women to be sexual predators .
But our society , while declining to profile by race or nationality when it comes to crime and terrorism , has become nonchalant about profiling men .
Child advocates are advising parents never to hire male babysitters .
Airlines are placing unaccompanied minors with female passengers .
Child - welfare groups say these precautions minimize risks .
But men's rights activists argue that our societal focus on " bad guys " has led to an overconfidence in women .
( Children who die of physical abuse are more often victims of female perpetrators , usually mothers , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . )
Though groups that cater to the young are working harder to identify predators , they also ask that risks be kept in perspective .
Big Brothers Big Sisters of America does criminal background checks on each of its 250,000 volunteers , and has social workers assess them .
Since 1990 , the group says , it has had fewer than 10 abuse allegations per year .
More than 98 % of the alleged abusers were male .
" If we wanted to make sure we never had a problem , one approach would be to just become Big Sisters -- to say we wo n't serve boys , " says Mack Koonce , the group 's chief operating officer .
But , of course , that would deny hundreds of thousands of boys contact with male mentors .
The Boy Scouts of America now has elaborate rules to prevent both abuse and false accusations .
There are 1.2 million Scout leaders , and the organization kicks out about 175 of them a year over abuse allegations or for violating policies .
These policies can be intricate .
For instance , four adult leaders are needed for each outing .
If a sick child must go home , two adults drive him and two stay with the others , so no adult is ever alone with a Scout .
" It 's protection for the adults , as well as the children , " says a Scouts spokesman .
The result of all this hyper - carefulness , however , is that men often feel like untouchables .
In Cochranville , Pa. , Ray Simpson , a bus driver , says that he used to have 30 kids stop at his house on Halloween .
But after his divorce , with people knowing he was a man living alone , he had zero visitors .
" I felt like crying at the end of the evening , " he says .
At Houston Intercontinental Airport , businessman Mitch Reifel was having a meal with his 5 - year - old daughter when a policeman showed up to question him .
A passerby had reported his interactions with the child seemed " suspicious . "
In Skokie , Ill. , Steve Frederick says the director of his son's day - care center called him in to reprimand him for " inappropriately touching the children . "
" I was shocked , " he says .
" Whatever did she mean ? "
She was referring to him reading stories with his son and other kids on his lap .
A parent had panicked when her child mentioned sitting on a man 's lap .
" Good parenting and good education demand that we let children take risks , " says Mr. Frederick , a career coach .
" We install playground equipment , putting them at risk of falls and broken bones .
Why ?
We want them to challenge themselves and develop muscles and confidence .
" Likewise , while we do n't want sexual predators to harm our kids , we do want our kids to develop healthy relationships with adults , both men and women .
Instilling a fear of men is a profound disservice to everyone . "

LOS ANGELES —
In a sprawling , white - on - white lab here that looks like a set from Stanley Kubrick ’s “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey , ” a British scientist named Thomas Learner recently lifted the top from a small box of slides , the kind that usually contain microscopic samples of bacteria or chemicals .
But this was a different kind of lab , and the slides were coated with dozens of shades of dried acrylic paint , at once as ordinary as house paint and as precious as rare isotopes .
This is because the acrylics had been taken from the Santa Monica studio of Sam Francis , the abstract painter , who died in 1994 and who , like many artists of his generation , had largely abandoned the oils that had been the medium of painting for at least five centuries .
Instead , he turned to their modern successors : acrylics , enamels , alkyds and many other substances that are more synthetic than organic .
The new paints , which began to emerge in the 1930s and made their way into many studios by the 1950s , allowed artists to do things they could n’t do with oil .
Morris Louis used thinned acrylic to stain , rather than coat , canvases , creating an ethereal effect .
Jackson Pollock used gloss enamel because it poured and dripped the way he wanted .
Bridget Riley and Frank Stella both used ordinary house paints , Mr. Stella because they “ had the nice dead kind of color ” that he wanted , right out of the can .

But while conservators have inherited generations ’ worth of knowledge about oil paints , they know comparatively little about synthetics and how to protect the masterpieces created by using them , many of which are rapidly approaching the half - century mark .
The moral of the story is either
A. )
You should n’t always be disappointed when you find out that the only advantage you have over your evil arch nemesis is your capacity to love .

Lining a blazer and jumper with Kevlar costs £ 130
A company is offering to modify blazers and jumpers by lining them with knife - resistant Kevlar .
Bladerunner in Romford , east London , said it has been contacted by the parents of five local pupils about the £ 130 adaptation .
But the government said stabbings in schools were very rare and accused the firm of scaremongering for profits .
Jim Knight , Department for Children , Schools and Families minister , said : " Stabbings in schools are exceptionally rare .
This is a commercial organisation scaremongering to sell its products . "
Kevlar is a synthetic material that can be spun into a fabric which makes it light but also very strong .
Seven teenagers have so far been stabbed to death in London this year .
I think paying £ 130 is worth it for peace of mind - kids spend more than that just on trainers
Parent Jo Coleman
Adrian Davis , from Bladerunner , said : " We introduced Kevlar - lined hooded tops out earlier this year and off the back of that a few parents asked us if we could alter school uniforms to make them stab proof .
" So we are offering the service on a private , individual basis . "
He added the pupils were not from any one school .
' Peace of mind '
Alf Hitchcock , from the Association of Chief Police Officers , said it was an " extraordinary step " .
" The reality of course is that crimes involving knives are proportionately very very low .
" But we do recognise that some parents do have that fear ( of crime ) and some feel they need to go to these steps . "
One parent , Jo Coleman from Romford , said she was thinking of getting her son's jacket lined with Kevlar .
She said : " I think paying £ 130 is worth it for peace of mind - kids spend more than that just on trainers .
" I think it is a good idea .
You are not so much worried now about adults snatching kids , but about the other children . "
Next up in the budget battle :
playing the debt - ceiling card
January 27 , 1996
Web posted at : 10:45 p.m. EST
From Correspondent Kathleen Koch
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The government is up and running Saturday , thanks to a short - term spending bill signed by President Clinton Friday night .
The measure keeps unfunded departments and programs going until March 15 , many with reduced spending levels .
The next hurdle in the continuing budget negotiations is raising the debt ceiling , which the president insists is a must .
The United States has hit its debt ceiling of $ 4.9 trillion , and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin says that around March 1 the government will run out of borrowing power .
In his Saturday radio address , Clinton called on Congress to stop playing politics on the issue .
The consequences of default , he said , are grave .
" Interests rates could also go up for businesses , consumers , and homeowners .
And for tens of millions of Americans , the unthinkable could happen .
The Social Security checks they count on would not be able to be mailed out , " Clinton said .
Budget director Alice Rivlin said that 's no exaggeration .
" If we do not raise the debt limit , the Treasury will not be able to pay the Social Security checks .
That is a fact , " she said .
During debate over keeping the government funded , Republicans assured jittery financial markets that they will vote to raise the debt ceiling .
But in its radio address Saturday , the GOP said giving the government a blank check is unacceptable .
" It is wrong -- immoral , really -- to be borrowing against our children 's future .
The national debt is $ 5 trillion .
A child born today will have to pay $ 187,000 just in interest on the national debt , " said Sen. Judd Gregg , R - New Hampshire .
Republicans vow any debt - ceiling bill will have strings attached , advancing their agenda .
" We have to negotiate what can we put on a debt ceiling that helps us start to lower the deficit and move towards a balanced budget , " said House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
Republicans are promising cooperation , but their scheduling could push the debt ceiling issue to a critical point .
Congress is to adjourn next week until February 26 , just days before the government is likely to default .

The craft of CIA analysis was designed to be an all - source operation , meaning that we analysts were responsible - and held accountable - for assimilating information from all sources and coming to judgments on what it all meant .
We used data of various kinds , from the most sophisticated technical collection platforms , to spies , to - not least - open media .
Here I must reveal a trade secret and risk puncturing the mystique of intelligence analysis .
Generally speaking , 80 percent of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media .
It helps to have been trained - as my contemporaries and I had the good fortune to be trained - by past masters of the discipline of media analysis , which began in a structured way in targeting Japanese and German media in the 1940s .
But , truth be told , anyone with a high school education can do it .
It is not rocket science .
Acquiescence in Executive war , [ Fulbright ] wrote , comes from the belief that the government possesses secret information that gives it special insight in determining policy .
Not only was this questionable , but major policy decisions turn " not upon available facts but upon judgment , " with which policy - makers are no better endowed than the intelligent citizen .
Congress and citizens can judge " whether the massive deployment and destruction of their men and wealth seem to serve the overall interests as a nation . "
...
The belief that government knows best was voiced just at this time by Governor Nelson Rockefeller , who said on resumption of the bombing , " We ought to all support the President .
He is the man who has all the information and knowledge of what we are up against . "
This is a comforting assumption that relieves people from taking a stand .
It is usually invalid , especially in foreign affairs .
" Foreign policy decisions , " concluded Gunnar Myrdal after two decades of study , " are in general much more influenced by irrational motives " than are domestic ones .
This is the critical point that many commentators never grasp , especially those in our mainstream media , and that many others minimize .
It may indeed be comforting to think that decisions of war and peace are made on the basis of facts , cold , clear logic , and " secret information " ( information that is accurate , I hasten to add ) -- but history , including our most recent history , does not support that view .
We might think that is the correct method that should be utilized in pondering the fates of many thousands of soldiers and innocent civilians -- and indeed , it is the right procedure , if leaders were amenable to being directed solely by facts and what is in their nations ' best long - term interests .
But if leaders were ultimately moved by such factors , World War I would not have witnessed years of endless slaughter , it would not have lasted as long as it did , and it might not have begun at all .
And if our own political and military leaders focused on those factors that ought to serve as their lodestar to the exclusion of all else , we would not have had the nightmare of Vietnam then -- or the nightmare of Iraq now .
The opposition conclusion -- the one Myrdal was inevitably led to after 20 years of immersion in the subject -- is that " irrational motives " impel foreign policy decisions .
Only a few scant months after winning reelection on a " peace " platform , Woodrow Wilson began a propaganda campaign to convince the American public to swallow his plans for U.S. intervention in Europe that the Bush administration can only look upon with envy .
The U.S. entrance into the First World War prolonged that conflict .
Among other consequences , it helped lead to the collapse of the Russian government and the rise of the Soviet Union , and it sowed the seeds for the rise of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany .
In all crucial ways , the " war to end all wars " led directly to World War II .
As one commentator concisely puts it :
In 1917 the U.S. government decided to embark on another overseas military adventure — entry into World War I , which involved a complex conflict between many European powers .
...
More than 100,000 American men were sacrificed in World War I .
One consequence of the war was the Russian Revolution , which brought Vladimir Lenin and communism to power in the Soviet Union .
Another consequence , which can be directly attributed to U.S. intervention in the war , was the chaos arising from the total defeat of Germany , which in turn gave rise to Adolf Hitler and National Socialism .
As a general rule for understanding public policies , I insist that there are no persistent " failed " policies .
Policies that do not achieve their desired outcomes for the actual powers - that - be are quickly changed .
If you want to know why the U.S. policies have been what they have been for the past sixty years , you need only comply with that invaluable rule of inquiry in politics : follow the money .
When you do so , I believe you will find U.S. policies in the Middle East to have been wildly successful , so successful that the gains they have produced for the movers and shakers in the petrochemical , financial , and weapons industries ( which is approximately to say , for those who have the greatest influence in determining U.S. foreign policies ) must surely be counted in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
So U.S. soldiers get killed , so Palestinians get insulted , robbed , and confined to a set of squalid concentration areas , so the " peace process " never gets far from square one , etc. , etc. – none of this makes the policies failures ; these things are all surface froth , costs not borne by the policy makers themselves but by the cannon - fodder masses , the bovine taxpayers at large , and foreigners who count for nothing .
The first error is the belief that decisions of war and peace are based on intelligence at all .
To excerpt myself still one more time , because of the importance of this point : Intelligence is completely irrelevant to major policy decisions .
Such decisions are matters of judgment , and knowledgeable , ordinary citizens are just as capable of making these determinations as political leaders allegedly in possession of " secret information . "
Such " secret information " is almost always wrong -- and major decisions , including those pertaining to war and peace , are made entirely apart from such information in any case .
The second you start arguing about intelligence , you 've given the game away once again .
This is a game the government and the proponents of war will always win .
By now , we all surely know that if they want the intelligence to show that Country X is a " grave " and " growing " threat , they will find it or manufacture it .
So once you 're debating what the intelligence shows or fails to show , the debate is over .
The war will inevitably begin .
...
To repeat : the decision to go to war is one of policy , and the intelligence -- whatever it is alleged to show -- is irrelevant .
Do n't argue in terms of intelligence at all .
If you do , you 'll lose .
The administration knows that ; many of its opponents still have n't figured it out , even now .
The above is in no way intended to minimize the value of intelligence collection by CIA case officers recruiting and running clandestine agents .
For , though small in percentage of the whole nine yards available to be analyzed , information from such sources can often make a crucial contribution .
Consider , for example , the daring recruitment in mid-2002 of Saddam Hussein 's foreign minister , Naji Sabri , who was successfully " turned " into working for the CIA and quickly established his credibility .
Sabri told us there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
My former colleagues , perhaps a bit naively , were quite sure this would come as a welcome relief to President George W. Bush and his advisers .
Instead , they were told that the White House had no further interest in reporting from Sabri ; rather , that the issue was not really WMD , it was " regime change . "
( Do n't feel embarrassed if you did not know this ; although it is publicly available , our corporate - owned , war profiteering media has largely suppressed this key story . )
It is all too rare that states overcome illusions , and the United States is no more an exception than Germany , Italy , England , or France before it .
The function of intelligence anywhere is far less to encourage rational behavior -- although sometimes that occurs -- than to justify a nation 's illusions , and it is the false expectations that conventional wisdom encourages that make wars more likely , a pattern that has only increased since the early twentieth century .
By and large , US , Soviet , and British strategic intelligence since 1945 has been inaccurate and often misleading , and although it accumulated pieces of information that were useful , the leaders of these nations failed to grasp the inherent dangers of their overall policies .
When accurate , such intelligence has been ignored most of the time if there were overriding preconceptions or bureaucratic reasons for doing so .
NEVER , EVER ARGUE IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE AT ALL .
Welcome to readers from Naked Capitalism .
While I appreciate the link to this article , I 'm certain the only reason it was noticed is that I mentioned this piece in a recent installment of my series about Wikileaks .
These issues are critically related to a very significant aspect of Wikileaks ' work and why I consider that work genuinely radical in a way that , in my view , far too few people appreciate .
The article on Wikileaks that discusses this earlier one appeared several days ago : " Good - bye to All That : Good - bye Consensus , Good - bye Establishment , Good - bye Mainstream . "
So while it 's lovely to see an article from three years ago linked today -- better late than never , and so forth -- this subject is of immense importance to a major news story The Wikileaks piece explains why .
]
My title is not intended to be at all humorous .
It is meant to convey a critically important truth , one that most Americans , almost all politicians , and the overwhelming majority of political commentators ( bloggers and otherwise ) still do not understand to this day .
Ray McGovern has written an article about our inexorable progress toward military confrontation with Iran .
For reasons I 've explained , I am not concerned with discussing that aspect of his commentary here , although I recommend you read his entire piece .
But a few of McGovern 's other points deserve emphasis and further discussion .
I remind you that McGovern worked as a CIA analyst .
Toward the beginning of his article , he writes : I genuinely do not intend to insult any reader by noting the following : you may think you understand what McGovern says here , but the fact is , you almost certainly do not .
It took me a few years and a lot of reading and thinking to understand these issues myself .
I return once again to what I regard as the classic formulation of the most critical point , one that I excerpted in " How the Foreign Policy Consensus Protects Itself . "
At the conclusion of that essay , you will find links to many other articles I 've written on the subject of intelligence , and the ways in which it is misunderstood and misused .
Here is Barbara Tuchman , in The March of Folly , writing about the catastrophe of Vietnam :
As I wrote about this passage in one of the first of my essays about the coming conflict with Iran , from NovemberAs
I have continued to read about and examine this subject , I have come to understand these issues more thoroughly in the last few years .
I therefore want to offer a clarification that may help to dispel a particular confusion that can arise .
From one perspective and with regard to one type of analysis , it is certainly true that " irrational motives " lead to catastrophically bad decisions in the realm of foreign policy , including virtually all decisions to go to war .
You can read history covering thousands of years , and you will find perhaps a handful of wars out of hundreds and , more likely , thousands that have been fought , that were genuinely necessary , i.e. , that were unequivocally dictated by the demands of the very survival of a nation .
Almost all wars could have been avoided -- and , in terms of this point , their results were directly opposed to what the stated aims had been .
To choose the most notable example from the last century , Wilson proclaimed that he was making " the world safe for democracy " -- but the U.S. entrance into World War I and the resulting prolongation of that awful conflict led to the rise of Soviet Russia , Fascist Italy , and Nazi Germany , thus leading to World War II , a further 60 years of war -- and to the crisis that confronts us today .
As I wrote some time ago
The same overall dynamic is true of almost every other conflict you can name .
But from another perspective and utilizing a different analysis , the motives are not irrational at all .
When one considers how these unending wars and devastations affect the primary powers that drive them ---- they tragically make all too much sense , even if that " sense " is of a kind that some of us find contemptible and entirely loathsome .
Once again , I offer Robert Higgs ' comments on this issue .
I think the title of my earlier post admirably conveys the point , " Chaos , War , Murder and Destruction Are What They Want . "
Higgs :
It is important to recognize the two perspectives and the two kinds of analysis , and to keep them separate .
Almost all of our public debate is conducted on the first level of analysis : what various political leaderstheir goals and objectives are .
In terms of those stated goals , their decisions in foreign policy are uniformly calamitous , and they lead to results that are the opposite of what they claim they hope to achieve .
No public figure will admit the truth of the second kind of analysis and , I regret to note , most Americans are not the least bit interested in hearing such unpleasant truths .
Nonetheless , theytruths : a huge swath of our economy is now devoted to preparing for war , making war , and cleaning up after war .
To one degree or another , most members of Congress are beholden to the economic powers that drive the obsessive concern with war , and its cornucopia of economic opportunity .
Both parties are enmeshed in the War State , and the current corporatist warmaking apparatus devours almost all those who go into public service .
Until this intricate and complex system is altered , nothing else will change , except in comparatively superficial ways .
To summarize this point concerning the actual role of intelligence in policymaking , I offer these earlier comments of mine :
There is a second way in which the true role of intelligence is unappreciated ; in a sense , it is even worse than the fact that intelligence is irrelevant to major policy decisions , despite all the protestations to the contrary .
And that is the fact that , on those rare occasions when intelligence is correct , it is disregarded when it conflicts with a policy that has already been decided upon .
McGovern writes : I have made this point on a number of occasions , often citing Gabriel Kolko , who writes : I therefore repeat my major admonition , and give it special emphasis :
It is always irrelevant to major policy decisions , and such decisions are reached for different reasons altogether .
This is true whether the intelligence is correct or not , and it is almost always wrong .
On those very rare occasions when intelligence is accurate , it is likely to be disregarded in any case .
It willbe disregarded if it runs counter to a course to which policymakers are already committed .
The intelligenceIt is primarily used as propaganda , to provide alleged justification to a public that still remains disturbingly gullible and pliable -- and it is used , to justify decisions that have already been made .
None of these facts and this background are all that difficult to ascertain , if one is committed to finding out the truth .
It is a measure of the monolithic , deadly grip that so - called " conventional wisdom " holds on our public discourse that what ought to be regarded as noncontroversial and even obvious truths are transformed into forbidden matters never to be mentioned in " polite " company .
And it is entirely remarkable that the intelligence game continues with none of its lethal force spent .
As Jim Webb 's recent pathetic explanation of his support for the abominable FISA legislation demonstrates , there would appear to be only one value that our politicians refuse to compromise or surrender : their wholehearted , indeed passionate devotion to abject stupidity .
But two can play this game , and the politicians and the " professionals " can be turned into fully deserving losers .
As the above indicates , you too can be an " intelligence analyst " -- and you can do it with far more accuracy and insight than those with careers that will be imperiled if they deliver unwelcome news .
Make your own judgments based on what is in the public record , as McGovern indicates , and resist the calls to war .
After all , it is members of the public who pay for it all -- and it is members of the public who die for it , too .
Let the public decide .
It 's only just .
And perhaps , one day in the future , we finally will have peace .

Gov. Tony Evers said President Trump should not come to two rallies in the state this weekend or should insist that everyone who attends the events wear masks so they do n't become super - spreader events .
I 've always said you 'd get a lot more kids interested in science if you told them it involves fighting - which of course it does .
This week , for example , Professor David Colquhoun FRS - one of the most eminent scientists in the UK - has been forced to remove his quackbusting blog from the UCL servers where it has lived for many years , after complaints from disgruntled alternative therapists .
They objected , for example , to his use of the word " gobbledygook " to describe Red Clover as a " blood cleanser " or a " cleanser of the lymphatic system " .
Somebody from the " European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association " complained that he'd slightly misrepresented one aspect of herbalists ' practice .
One even complained about Colquhoun infringing copyright , simply for quoting the part of their website that he was examining .
They felt , above all , that this was an inappropriate use of UCL facilities .
Now I do n't want to get into the to and fro here , but it is striking that none of them engaged the prof himself on the issue of the ideas .
They ran to the provost , or rather , to teacher ; and the provost asked Colquhoun to take his blog elsewhere , on the grounds that it was bringing the university too much flak .
This episode reveals some unfortunate contrasts .
Firstly , in a world where most orthodox " public engagement with science " activity consists of smug , faux - radical " science meets art " projects , Colquhoun - a world expert on single ion channels - was showing the world what science really does .
He took dodgy scientific claims , or " hypotheses " as we call them in the trade , and examined the experimental evidence for them , in everyday language , with humour and verve .
I would say his blog is a treat for the wider public , and arguably a rather good use of the time and resources of a public servant who has devoted his entire life to academia , on its relatively low wages , never once working for industry .
Secondly , giving special attention to a blog shows that we may not have got to grips with new forms of social media yet .
I 've heard Prof Colquhoun speak about quackery in UCL lecture theatres .
Was the electricity , the publicity material , the room rent , a misuse of public funds and resources ?
I 've done talks myself , in universities and schools : are they all guilty of wasting public money on robust , challenging , childish and sarcastic discussion of ideas ?
But lastly , if you 're worrying about the appropriate use of a science departments resource , Prof Colquhoun is the bloke who made the fuss in Nature about British universities giving away science degrees in quackery .
The people who run the BSc " science " degrees have refused to answer questions from David , and from me , about what " science " they teach .
Nobody is making the jokers behind these quackery BScs take their gobbledygook - a word that sounds best being snorted through Colquhoun 's impressive nasal hair - off university webservers .
Courses in gobbledygook make money .

While the aim of WhatGreenCar ?
is to provide ratings for all new cars and promote the greenest models , we often get asked to identify the greatest environmental offenders .
Although the usual suspects do appear in the ' most wanted ' list , there are a few surprises , and lessons to be learned that can help car - buyers of all persuasions make greener choices should they so wish .
So , without wishing to offend too many manufacturers or existing owners , here is a selection of some of the top 10 new ' gas guzzlers ' by vehicle class .
For each model we have included the WhatGreenCar ?
( WGC ? ) rating that indicates the total environmental impact of each car 's lifecycle ( fuel and vehicle ) , expressing it as a score between 0 and 100 - the lower the score , the less the environmental impact .
For comparison , an average small family car has a rating of around 50 .
We normally top out the rating at 100 , but for this article we make an exception !
Super-mini : Mini Cooper S Convertible ( automatic ) - 56
Small family car : Mazda 3 2.3 Turbo MPS - 62
Small family car : VW Golf 3.2 V6 4 Motion - 68
Large family car : Saab 9 - 3 Saloon 2.8 TS ( automatic ) - 69
Large family car : Vauxhall Vectra 2.8i V6 Turbo ( automatic ) - 70
Executive : Audi A8 W12 quattro Tiptronic Sport - 94
Executive : BMW M5 Touring - 96
Sports utility : Hummer H3 3.7 L5 ( automatic ) - 92
Sports utility : Cadillac SRX 4.6 V8 ( automatic ) - 105
Sports car : Lamborghini Murcielago 147 Coupe - 132
Given its reputation , it is surprising that a Mini should appear in this list at all - all the more so as one of its sister models , the diesel Mini Cooper D , is one of the greenest cars in this class ( WGC ? rating 30 ) .
This illustrates the first lesson regarding choosing a green car - model variants within a vehicle range will vary widely in their environmental performance .
That said , if you want a super - mini that leaves a disproportionately large environmental footprint , this is a car for you .
With CO2 emissions of 208g / km and a fuel economy of only 32.5 miles per gallon ( mpg ) , the 1.6 litre Mini Cooper S will also help burn a hole in your pocket - the Cooper S is in the highest but one band F for road tax ( £ 205 a year ) .
Do the right thing - buy a Cooper D instead !
It must take a great deal of skill and determination on the part of auto engineers to make a small family car like the Mazda 3 have such high CO2 emissions that it falls into the highest road tax band G , more usually associated with the ' Chelsea tractor ' .
This not - so - hot ( eco-wise ) ' hot hatch ' emits an astonishing 231gCO2 / km and only gives 29.1 mpg of fuel - the emissions being well above the average of 160gCO2 / km for this class .
What makes this eco-unfriendly model worthy of note is that all the other Mazda 3's in the line up have excellent fuel economy and relatively low emissions - the diesel 1.6 TS 110 ps has a WGC ?
rating of 37 and CO2 emissions of only 128g / km .
If you buy the 4 - wheel drive 3.2 litre VW Golf , street cred and pulling power ( in both senses ) will probably be more of an issue than its green credentials .
If your passengers knew that the 4 Motion emits a whopping 255g / km CO2 , this might detract from any positive impressions , as may the fuel economy of only 26.4 mpg .
Although you do n't have to downsize all the way to the best - in - class VW , the Jetta 1.9 TDI with particulate filter ( WGC ? rating 38 ) , you might want to consider at least switching to the 2.0 litre TFSI DSG GTi ( WGC ? rating 50 ) .
While one part of Saab is pioneering the use of bioethanol ( e85 ) that can cut life - cycle CO2 emissions by up to 70 % , another design team has produced a model with significantly higher emissions than the average UK family car ( WGC ? rating 56 ) .
With a fuel economy of 26.2mpg and CO2 emissions of 259g / km , you are not going to get much sympathy from the chancellor either as you 'll be ( quite rightly ) clobbered with the highest rate of road tax ( band G , £ 300 and probably rising ) .
So if it 's got to be a Saab , check www.saabbiopower.co.uk to see if there are any e85 stations near to where you live .
If there are , at least consider the 2.0 litre BioPower option .
You will lose 80 bhp , but you could save up to £ 4 k on the list price .
Oh yes , and if you happen to be in Stockholm , you wo n't have to pay the congestion charge either .
The Vectra 2.8i is another good example of how increased power leads to more emissions .
Using petrol and being a V6 does n't help either .
With an emission rating 25 % above the average in this class , a fuel economy of 25.9mpg and CO2 emissions of 262g / km , this model is in road tax band G. OK so it 's got plenty of ' va - va - voom ' , but if you could settle for the a 2.2 i 16 v Direct Hatch , you 'd still get ' va - voom ' and your WGC ?
rating would fall to a relatively respectable 48 ( CO2 180g / km ) .
If you are happy to settle just for an everyday ' voom ' , the Vectra range also includes some very clean diesels - the 1.9 CDTI 16 v comes in at 44 .
With a 6.0 litre engine packing over 440 bhp , it 's not a great surprise that this particular gas guzzler ( 19.2 mpg ) is in the Top 10 .
This A8's CO2 emissions of 353g / km exceed the average carbon emission for this class ( 202g / km ) by 75 % .
Not that all the models in the A8 range have such a large environmental impact - both the petrol 3.2 litre FSI and the diesel 3.0 litre TDI ( with particulate filter ) manage to achieve WGC ?
ratings in the low 60s ( CO2 emissions 227-237g/ km ) .
However , ironically , only the 3.0 litre TDI without a filter manages to beat the 225g / km CO2 threshold by one point and avoid being stung by next year 's proposed £ 25 congestion charge for band G vehicles .
If you use a company car and you drive this particular 5.0 litre model , then either the recent reforms of the company car tax system have completely passed you by or your company is doing so well that profit is no longer your overriding motive .
At 18.8 mpg and 361gCO2 / km , the M5 Touring leaves a larger environmental footprint than a Hummer ( see below ) !
Luckily BMW are making it increasingly easy for you to own all the refinements you would expect from the brand and be green - the new 5 Series 520d Touring ( with particle filter ) comes in with a WGC ?
rating of just 38 ( CO2 136g / km ) .
You could n't do a Top 10 ' gas guzzler ' list without including the Hummer .
And with a mass of over 2.2 tonnes , staggering CO2 emissions of 346g / km and a WGC ?
rating of 92 , it sure does n't do the environment much favours at all .
What is surprising is that , as you can see from some of the other cars in this list , it 's not the most environmentally frightening car on the road by a long way .
That said , there 's plenty of room for improvement - by switching to other well known SUV models such as the ( not insubstantial ) diesel BMW X3 Series E83 X3 2.0d ( WGC ? rating 47 ) or the petrol Dodge Caliber 1.8 ( WGC ? rating 48 ) , you could easily cut your environmental impact by half .
It 's BIG , it 's a Cadillac , it 's 4.6 litres , it 's a V8 , it 's an automatic , it weighs over 2 tonnes and it uses petrol ( not known for its low CO2 ) - ergo its got high emissions to say the least - 396g / km of pure CO2 .
It 's actually worth repeating this figure again but in better units - it emits a kilogram of CO2 every 1.5 miles !
It burns fuel so fast , that its imperial ( 16.9mpg ) and metric fuel economy figures ( 16.7 litres / 100 km ) are almost numerically equivalent .
In real money , this car costs around 26 p / mile in fuel alone - almost as much as the price of a local bus ticket .
Our verdict ?
Do the environment a favour and buy a Hummer instead !
Lamborghini do n't just make sports cars , they define what we think and desire a sports car should be .
However at this level , design and performance come at an environmental price - generally speaking , engines with high power emit plenty of emissions .
Just take a look at the stats - 631 bhp , 495gCO2 / km and 13.3 mpg .
If you are going to drive one , certainly celebrate engineering at its fastest - but do n't use it to nip down to Tesco for a pint of milk or drop the kid ( singular as there is n't room for any more ) off at school to impress the other parents .
Although if you already own one , your little one is probably already at school where the air is clean ... in Switzerland !

Almost everyone I know is working more time than they would like .
That ’s why a book like The 4 - Hour Work Week by Timothy Ferriss has been such a big bestseller .
This is a great book , but the promise is a little over the top .
I do n’t know of anyone , including Tim Ferriss , who really only works four hours .
Photo courtesy of ©iStockphoto.com/ferrantraite
But what if you could shave ten hours off your work week ?
In my opinion , that is much more do - able .
Virtually anyone , with a little thought and effort can do it .
Here ’s how :
Limit the time you spend online .
In my experience , the Web is most people ’s # 1 time suck .
Yes , I know it is a wonderful tool for research , blah , blah , blah .
But I often catch myself and my family members mindlessly surfing from one page to another with no clear objective in mind .
Before you know it , you can eat up several hours a day .
The key is to put a fence around this activity and limit your time online .
Set a timer for yourself if you have to .
This is true for Web surfing and it is also true for email .
Unless you are in a customer service position where you have to be “ always - on , ” you should check email no more than two or three times a day .
Touch email messages once and only once .
Okay , let ’s be honest .
How many times do you read the same email message over and over again ?
Guess what ?
The information has n’t changed .
That ’s right .
You are procrastinating .
I have a personal rule : I will only read each message once then take the appropriate action : do , delegate , defer , file or delete it .
I describe these in more detail in a post I made last week .
Follow the two - minute rule .
My to - do list is very short .
It never gets longer than about thirty items .
This is because I do everything I can immediately .
If I need to make a phone call , rather than entering it on my to - do list , I just make the call .
If I can complete the action in less than two minutes , I just go ahead and do it .
Why wait ?
You will be amazed at how much this “ bias toward action ” will reduce your workload .
Conversely , when you do n’t do it promptly , you end up generating even more work for yourself and others .
The longer a project sits , the longer it takes to overcome inertia and get it moving again .
The key is to define the very next action and do it .
You do n’t have to complete the whole project , just the next action .
Stop attending low - impact meetings .
If there ’s one thing we can probably all agree on , it ’s that we go to too many meetings .
Either the meeting organizer is n’t prepared , the meeting objective is n’t defined , or you ca n’t really affect the outcome one way or the other .
Every meeting should have a written objective and a written agenda .
If you do n’t have these two minimal items , how do you know when the meeting is over ?
Could this also explain why meetings seem to drag on and on until everyone is worn out ?
If the content of the meeting is irrelevant to you and your job or if you do n’t feel that you really add that much to the discussion , ask to be excused .
Schedule time to get your work done .
This is crucial .
As the saying goes , “ nature abhors a vacuum . ”
If you do n’t take control of your calendar , someone else will .
You ca n’t spend all your time in meetings and still get your work done .
Instead , you need to make appointments with yourself .
Yes , go ahead and actually put them on your calendar .
Then , when someone asks for a meeting , you can legitimately say , “ No , I ’m sorry , that wo n’t work .
I already have a commitment . ”
And you do — to yourself !
Cultivate the habit of non-finishing .
Not every project you start is worth finishing .
Sometimes we get into it and realize , “ This is a waste of time . ”
Fine , then give yourself permission to quit .
I do this all the time with reading .
It ’s why I am able to read so many articles and books .
Here ’s publishing ’s dirty little secret : most books are not worth finishing .
Most books could be cut in half and you would n’t miss a thing .
The key is to read as long as you are interested and then stop .
There are too many great books to read without getting bogged down in the merely good ones .
Engage in a weekly review and preview .
Part of the reason our lives get out of control is because we do n’t plan .
Once a week , you have to come up for air .
Or — to change the metaphor — you have to take the plane up to 30,000 feet , so you can see the big picture .
I generally do this on Sunday evening .
I review my notes from the previous week and look ahead to my calendar .
I have written elsewhere on this topic , so I wo n’t repeat myself here .
You may not be able to reduce your workweek to four hours — and honestly , who would want to ? — but you can certainly scale it down to a manageable level by cutting out the wasted motion and developing a few good habits .
What other tips have you discovered for trimming your work week ?
Christmas has come early for a group of enterprising burglars , after they broke into a meat factory and stole truckloads of holiday hams over the weekend .
The thieves even taunted the owners of Zammit Ham and Bacon Curers , in Sydney 's north - west , by leaving a large note scrawled in texta on a wall inside the meat warehouse that read : " Thanks ... Merry Christmas . "
The thieves cut a hole in an exterior wall at the warehouse , on Nirvana Street in Pendle Hill , and removed 16 pallets - each weighing about a tonne - of double - smoked hams , Christmas leg hams , banjo hams and oven roasted turkey breast , co-owner of the warehouse Anthony Zammit said this morning .
The danger of cigarettes is mostly not in smoking them , argues a study by three doctors at the KS Hegde Medical Academy in Mangalore , India .
Or , put another way : the danger comes from not smoking .
Figuratively blowing smoke in the face of conventional wisdom , the study asks : " Are lung cancers triggered by stopping smoking ? "
Arunachalam Kumar , Kasaragod Mallya and Jairaj Kumar take little for granted .
They begin : " The clinically high correlation between smoking and carcinoma of the lungs has been the focal point in societal campaigns against the habit and the tobacco lobby . "
But their experience with patients suggests to them a different , seldom - told story .
" We are struck by the more than casual relationship between the appearance of lung cancer and an abrupt and recent cessation of the smoking habit in many , if not most , cases . "
Experience is their guide , numerically speaking .
Of the 312 lung cancer patients they treated during a four - year period , 182 had recently quit smoking .
The report goes into detail .
" Each had been addicted to the habit no less than 25 years , smoking in excess of 20 sticks a day .
The striking direct statistical correlation between cessation of smoking to the development of lung malignancies , more than 60 % plus , is too glaring to be dismissed as coincidental . "
One might quibble about this statistic - 182 cases out of 312 is 58 % .
In technical terms , one could accurately describe that as less than 60 % minus .
But it 's still a startling number .
Kumar , Mallya and Kumar sketch out a possible explanation of what happens .
There is , they surmise , a biological mechanism that protects smokers against cancer , that gets exercised and strengthened by years of diligent , heavy smoking .
As in habitual marathon running , the body becomes accustomed to suffering grievous damage , and develops habitual ways to fix up whatever breaks down .
The smoker 's body becomes a sort of lean , puffing , self - damaging - yet - self - repairing machine .
But when a smoker gives up that regular regimen , the body cannot adjust .
" It is our premise , " say the doctors , " that a surge and spurt in re-activation of bodily healing and repair mechanisms of chronic smoke - damaged respiratory epithelia is induced and spurred by an abrupt discontinuation of habit , goes awry , triggering uncontrolled cell division and tumor genesis . "
Things go downhill from there , in theory .
The study appears in the journal Medical Hypotheses .
In two pages , Kumar , Mallya and Kumar bleaken the already dire picture that research has painted about smoking cessation .
The medically documented risks incurred by anyone who gives up cigarettes are well known .
Depression , weight gain , irritability - these cruel fates have been written about time and again .
Now add to them the risk of cancer , and the case against the case against smoking becomes even more persuasive .
At the very end of their paper , Kumar , Mallya and Kumar sum up their new view of things .
" No doubt , " they write , " tobacco kills too many .
Or does it ? "

This study quantitatively assesses the effects of inflation through changes in the value of nominal assets .
It documents nominal asset positions in the United States across sectors and groups of households and estimates the wealth redistribution caused by a moderate inflation episode .
The main losers from inflation are rich , old households , the major bondholders in the economy .
The main winners are young , middle - class households with fixed - rate mortgage debt .
Besides transferring resources from the old to the young , inflation is a boon for the government and a tax on foreigners .
Lately , the amount of U.S. nominal assets held by foreigners has grown dramatically , increasing the potential for a large inflation - induced wealth transfer from foreigners to domestic households .
TORONTO , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) - Strong commodities prices gave a boost to the Canadian dollar , which reached a 33 - year high against a weaker U.S. dollar on Friday .
Domestic bond prices , with no major economic data to consider , moved higher as the relentless climb of the Canadian currency increased the likelihood that the next interest rate move by the Bank of Canada will be a cut .
The Canadian currency closed at at US $ 1.0393 , making a U.S. dollar worth 96.22 Canadian cents , up from Thursday 's close of US $ 1.0353 , or 96.59 Canadian cents .
During the overnight session the Canadian dollar hit US $ 1.0428 , its highest level since 1974 .
That was partly due to U.S. crude oil prices CLc1 surging to a record high above $ 92 a barrel .
A 28 - year high for gold prices XAU= above $ 785 an ounce also helped the currency , as Canada is a major commodities producer and exporter .
While it slipped back some during the session , the currency stayed well bid as investors sold off the U.S. dollar .
" We 've seen oil , gold , and base metals increasing and providing strong backdrop for the Canadian dollar , but the driving force was U.S. dollar weakness , " said Matthew Strauss , senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
The greenback has been under siege as of late as the U.S. economy has been battered by a credit crunch and a crisis in the housing sector .
The U.S. dollar hit a record low against a basket of major currencies on Friday as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates when it meets next week , and that it may be forced to cut again after that .
The market has priced in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed to 4.50 percent next week , which would put the key U.S. rate on par with Canada 's for the first time since February 2005 .
BONDS MAKE GAINS
Canadian bond prices climbed higher ahead of next week 's
Fed meeting and as market players worried that an interest rate cut may also be in Canada 's near future .
" One factor I can point to ( for the rise in bond prices ) is just the relentless strength of the Canadian dollar , " said Doug Porter , deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets .
That 's because there is a growing sense that the currency is getting away from policy makers , despite the growing rhetoric over how the Canadian dollar has risen too far too fast .
That may increase the chances that the Bank of Canada will have to translate their words into action by cutting interest rates , he said .
Porter added that the strong Canadian dollar could also translate into significantly lower inflation as it allows firms to cut prices .
A survey released by Statistics Canada showed Canadian manufacturers ' optimism about output and demand for their goods dimmed in the fourth quarter .
The firms cited more production difficulties due to the rapid rise of the Canadian dollar and a skilled labor shortage .
The two - year bond was up 8 Canadian cents at C$ 100.25 to yield 4.122 percent , while the 10 - year bond rose 31 Canadian cents to C$ 97.81 to yield 4.280 percent .
The yield spread between the two - year and 10 - year bond moved to 15.8 basis points from 16.0 at the previous close .
The 30 - year bond increased 61 Canadian cents to C$ 110.85 to yield 4.344 percent .
In the United States , the 30 - year treasury yielded 4.697 percent .
Even though the battle between the two formats that want to follow up DVD , naming Blu-ray and HD - DVD , is still going on , does n't mean that the DVD is already kicked out of the market .
This is , if designers such as Yeon - shin Seung keep on making concepts like this one .
Here 's the coolest PDP ( portable DVD player ) concept that I 've ever seen .
The plan is to use the Sony full color flexible organic electroluminescent display as a flexible , thin and lightweight screen .
This screen makes use of OLED technology .
A while ago I posted the coolest MP3 player and this DVD player uses the same technique of an external disk loader .
It 's just a concept and I do n't know if it 's coming to the market soon or not , but what the heck , just like the MP3 player , it just looks so awsome !

Learning about science and the experimental method is a lot of fun .
Mix this with that and see what you get !
Sometimes the result can be , well , hazardous to your health .
But if you survive such an encounter , you have to tell all your friends .
With the internet , you can tell everyone , and even show the video .
But seeing it done does n't make these experiments any safer .
Remember , the ones who survived to tell their tales are the lucky ones .
Most of the experiments detailed here were done by professionals .
Theodore Grey has an index of Fun / Dangerous Experiments .
He includes a special note for teenagers about mortality and how it will mean something in a few years .
And about safety glasses .
Why are glasses so important ?
Because having your cheeks ripped off by shrapnel , your hair burned to the roots , and your nose split open and folded up over your forehead is nothing , nothing compared to being blind for the rest of your life .
Not even close .
He then documents quite a few experiments with the elements , including this fascinating account of his Sodium Party .
Besides the explosive combination of sodium and water , I found out there are butterflies who collect sodium , and how to protect fish from exploding sodium .
Unwise Microwave Oven Experiments has a scary disclaimer , pointing to the fact that these experiments were done by a professional electrical engineer with his own microwave ovens .
Then there are lnks to different microwave effects , including superheated liquids that we should all be aware of .
Other experiments include nuking flames , light bulbs , molten materials such as Pyrex , and other very dangerous things you should never put in a microwave .
More dangerous experiments after the jump .
Powerlabs Unwise Liquid Nitrogen Experiments describes the Liquid Nitrogen Baseball Bat Cannon and Pressure Bomb projects .
Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic fluid much colder than frozen water , and can cause frostbite if it comes in contact with skin .
As its temperature rises , it expands so much that it is used as a pressurant .
Not something you play with unless you know what you are doing .
A Tesla Coil consists of two or three coupled resonant electric circuits .
The explanation is complicated , but it appears to come down to sending electricity through the air .
Adam posted pictures of things he has zapped on the page Fun with Tesla Coils .
This picture shows the effect of a Tesla Coil on an old CD .
He also documented some other Extremely Stupid and Dangerous Experiments .
Fantastically Dangerous Capacitor - Bank Discharge Experiments has an extensive disclaimer , including the caveat that these experiments require expensive lab equipment and otherwise cannot be reproduced .
I do n't understand the science involved at all , but the watergun experiment mentioned 150,000 volts , which is enough to make me run away screaming .
A link on this page took me to T. Johnson 's Can Crusher , the apparatus pictured .
He used a pulse capacitor to crush cans with electricty .
He started with 200 volts and worked his way up to 2700 volts , detailing the effects of each voltage increase .
At least he warned the neighbors .
Thermite is a combination of materials that will produce a large amount of heat .
The process is used to weld railroad ties .
From Wikipedia :
Although the reactants are stable at room temperature , they burn with an extremely intense exothermic reaction when they are heated to ignition temperature .
The products emerge as liquids due to the high temperatures reached ( up to 2500 Â°C ( 4500 Â°F ) with iron ( III ) oxide ) — although the actual temperature reached depends on how quickly heat can escape to the surrounding environment .
Thermite contains its own supply of oxygen and does not require any external source of air .
Consequently , it cannot be smothered and may ignite in any environment , given sufficient initial heat .
It will burn well while wet and cannot be extinguished with water .
Of course , with a reaction like that , people are going to use it for entertainment .
Thermite is not difficult to make .
The danger of igniting the stuff should be apparant in this video .
The story of The Radioactive Boy Scout sounds like a movie script .
17 - year - old David Hahn endangered 40,000 people with radioactive materials he was using to build a nuclear reactor .
The EPA packed his experiment into 39 barrels and buried it in a nuclear waste dump .
Hahn apparently did not learn his lesson , as he was recently arrested for stealing smoke detectors to obtain radioactive materials .
Do n't try this at home .

Columns Eating French
Having recently spent a month in France , I have come to the conclusion that the French are sneaky .
They eat three - course meals with gorgeous sauces , drink red wine constantly , have no apparent shame availing themselves of those sinful French pastries , p•te , and cheeses , and yet still remain - by American standards - thin .
And rarely will you see those French guys or gals sweatily jogging down the boulevard ; they just walk about looking very stylish .
If you do n’t trust my observational skills , try these stats on for size :
Only 11 percent of the French population qualifies as obese , while we almost triple that percentage mark here in the land of plenty .
Furthermore , the French eat three times as much saturated animal fat as Americans do and only a third as many die of heart attacks .
I have long heard about this French Paradox , and after a month of fluffy croissants full of almond paste and copious amounts of French rouge du maison , I was certain it was all a bunch of bull .
To prove the point , I immediately mounted my bathroom scale upon returning home .
Imagine my shock when I discovered that after a month of French gastronomic debauchery ( and no organized exercise regimen ) I only gained one pound !
So if it is n’t Splenda , no - carb PowerBars , or an obsession with spinning classes , what ’s their secret ?
I consulted Santa Barbara ’s own expert on the subject , Laurence Hauben , herself a lovely Frenchwoman who actually helps people learn about the French way with food in her Market Foray classes ( marketforays.com ) .
According to Laurence , it ’s all about the lifestyle .
“ The French do n’t traditionally wolf down a meal at their desk or while commuting in traffic , ” she said .
“ They sit down with family or colleagues at a table , taking the time to relax and share conversation .
When you are talking , you are not eating , and because you are relaxed , the hormones released help in the assimilation of calories , unlike the stress hormones we are riddled with here , which trigger hoarding of fat .
In other words , eat 800 calories while sitting at a cafe in Paris , and they will get spent .
Eat 800 calories while sitting in your car in traffic on the freeway , and most of them will settle in your hips or gut . ”
Mireille Guiliano , author of the recent bestseller French Women Do n’t Get Fat , would no doubt agree with Hauben .
In her book , she emphasizes the importance of savoring one ’s food and how this directly contributes to a cornerstone of the French diet : portion control .
I realize this is a very un-American concept , but it does seem to work .
The French way is not about deprivation .
Their main dishes are bathed in lush sauces , their desserts are irresistible culinary masterpieces .
They make the effort to make sure their food is fresh and flavorful , with the payoff that their satisfaction - and most importantly , their satiation - will come from quality instead of quantity .
According to Hauben , the French Paradox is n’t a paradox at all , but a logical consequence of the traditional French way of life , which is less materialistic , less driven .
“ We need to slow down , think about our priorities , and ask ourselves what the point is of an expensive kitchen remodel when we do n’t take the time to cook , and why we work so hard that we never have time to see the people we love , ” she said .
“ Maybe if we traded some of our discretionary income for discretionary time , that would be the true luxury . ”
Taking the time to prepare meals with fresh ingredients , walking to the markets to buy those ingredients , and then actually sitting down with friends and family to savor the meal ?
Now that ’s a start .
“ If we want to lose weight , we need to make a choice to enjoy life more , ” said Hauben .

The American healthcare catastrophe is simply too immense to ignore .
The ACS made a major strategic decision .
The organization determined that alerting the American people to the importance of screening tests will take a back seat until and unless the political class summons the will to radically overhaul our collapsed healthcare system .
In a stark departure from past practice , the American Cancer Society plans to devote its entire $ 15 million advertising budget this year not to smoking cessation or colorectal screening but to the consequences of inadequate health coverage .
The campaign was born of the group ’s frustration that cancer rates are not dropping as rapidly as hoped , and of recent research linking a lack of insurance to delays in detecting malignancies .
Though the advertisements are nonpartisan and pointedly avoid specific prescriptions , they are intended to intensify the political focus on an issue that is already receiving considerable attention from presidential candidates in both parties .
http://www.nytimes.com/...
These warnings are n't coming from a blogger named nyceve .
This is from The American Cancer Society , a major player , a major American institution .
Gosh , there must be many reasons why the American Cancer Society decided they had to take this extraordinary step .
Extraordinary times require extraordinary action .
Is one reason because more and more Americans are financing healthcare on credit cards ?
Could another reason be the shameful just published U.S. Census which revealed that the number of uninsured Americans has skyrocketed to 47 million , a new national disgrace .
Now we know even the family of Sandra Day you reap what you sow O'Connor is not immune to the consequences of this staggering crisis .
Maybe the American Cancer Society is also frightened about the nightmare consequences of the Bush war against America 's Children .
Health Secretary Defends Insurance Cutoff WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. health secretary defended new eligibility limits in a federal health plan for needy children on Thursday , urging states to take responsibility for insuring more of their populations .
. . . Medicare proposes strict limits on reimbursing states for families that earn above 250 percent of the federal poverty level , an idea opposed by many U.S. governors , including some Republicans .
That limit amounts to about $ 50,000 a year for a family of four .
" We believe ( the program ) was intended for low - income children , " Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt told reporters in Washington .
http://www.nytimes.com/...
Perhaps another reason the American Cancer Society felt compelled to go to these extraordinary lengths is because for - profit insurance companies like Blue Cross of California resist any efforts to make them abide by their contractual obligations to their policy holders .
Maybe the Cancer Society learned about the plight of an uninsured breast cancer survivor Pamela C. ( " Pam " ) Brunaccioni .
Maybe the Board of the Cancer Society sat together in a meeting and collectively said , this should n't be happening in the richest country on the planet .
With one breast gone , she had discomfort in her shoulders .
But she did n't have insurance , and paying for a prosthesis and a special bra would have been very hard on her finances .
http://www.masslive.com/...
Like I said , extraordinary times , require extraordinary actions .
That a charity like the cancer society felt compelled to join the access debate reflects both the urgency and the resonance of the issue .
Nonetheless , Mr. Donaldson said it was " risky business " for the tax - exempt group .
http://www.nytimes.com/...
Sit back now and wait for the smears to begin .
This time the sleaze merchants will direct their venom and their efforts to derail authentic healthcare reform against this venerable American institution .
In several comments , a few people have suggested that I include a link to the donations page of the American Cancer Society
Update [ 2007 -9-1 8:38:44 by nyceve ] ::
This is directed most particularly to members of the political class who may be reading Daily Kos .
This diary about the bold and audacious decision by the American Cancer Society to sound the alarm has remained at the top of the recommended diary list for over twenty - four hours .
The diary right below this one , explains in excruciating detail the common tactic used by the for - profit insurance industry to deny healthcare by practicing medicine without a license .
Gov. Spitzer : Why are Insurance Companies Allowed to Practice Medicine in NY State ?
http://www.dailykos.com/...
Understand very well , that the American people expect bold and audacious leadership and a bold and audacious healthcare plan from the next Democratic President of the United States .
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , of Liverpool , was found guilty of " insulting religion " after an eight - hour hearing in Khartoum north court .
The maximum penalty she had faced was 40 lashes and six months in prison .
Ali Ageb , a member of Gibbons ' defence team , said he was " very unhappy " with the verdict and would appeal .
" She did this as part of her profession as the teacher , " he told reporters outside the court .
" She did not intend to insult anybody . "
Ageb said Gibbons , who was arrested on Sunday , had been calm when the verdict was announced .
" I think she was expecting it , " he said .
Gibbons was sent to Omdurman women 's prison , from where she will be deported after serving her sentence .
She has served five days in jail , so should be eligible for release in 10 days ' time .
The Foreign Office said it was " extremely disappointed " by the sentence , and David Miliband , the foreign secretary , again summoned the Sudanese ambassador to explain the verdict .
During the 45 - minute meeting , Miliband expressed concern at the continued detention of Gibbons " in the strongest terms " .
The Foreign Office said in a statement last night that there would be further contact today " in the search for a swift resolution of this issue " .
Earlier , Miliband had told Omer Siddig of his " serious concerns " about the decision to charge Gibbons , calling the incident an " innocent misunderstanding " .
British Muslim groups had also called for her acquittal , saying the case was harming Islam 's image .
Louise Ellman , MP for Liverpool Riverside , said the teacher 's family were very upset .
" I do realise that the sentence could have been harder , but 15 days in a jail in Sudan could be very , very harsh , " she told Sky News .
" There is still an appeals process ... the decision is one for the Sudanese authorities .
I hope we can see some common sense here .
I think there 's distress and there 's anger and I can't see much positive that has come from this . "
It had emerged earlier in the day that complaints about naming the teddy bear Muhammad had come from a fellow member of staff at the exclusive Unity High School where Gibbons was working .
Teachers and clergy from the school 's board turned up at court in support of Gibbons .
Robert Boulos , the school 's director , said education ministry officials had originally told him that a number of parents had laid complaints about the naming of the bear .
But , he added : " Today I heard that it was a member of the school staff .
I was horrified . "
The complainant was named as Sara Khawad , an office assistant at the school , who was the key prosecution witness .
Gibbons had arrived at the modern marble - and - steel court in the Sudanese capital shortly before 1 pm to answer charges of " insulting religion and inciting hatred " .
Wearing a blue blazer , blouse and skirt , she appeared dejected and stared straight ahead as four policemen escorted her into the courtroom on the first floor , pushing through a throng of journalists , lawyers and supporters from the school .
Another group of policemen barricaded the door , shouting and waving angrily for people to move away .
The prosecution team was already inside , but Gibbons ' defence team was locked out .
British embassy representatives , including consul Russell Phillips , were also prevented from entering .
A line of 15 police officers then formed a human chain , shoving the onlookers away .
After a half - hour standoff , Kamal al - Jazouli , Gibbons ' lawyer , pushed through the crowd and began shouting at the police .
He was let in , but his assistants and embassy staff had to wait a further hour - during which time they witnessed two offenders being flogged with a rubber hose in the court corridor - before being admitted to hear the prosecution arguments .
The charges stem from a project initiated in September when Gibbons , who had been in Sudan for a month , asked pupils to suggest names for a bear , which each child would be able to take home and then write in a diary about their experience .
The chosen name was Muhammad , one of the most common names in Sudan , and also the name of Islam 's Prophet .
The diary featured a picture of a bear on the front and the label : " My name is Muhammad " .
Since her arrest , there have been fears for Gibbons ' safety , and that of her colleagues at Unity , which is now closed .
Riot police wearing helmets and shields and clutching batons and rifles were posted outside the court .
But though leaflets condemning Gibbons had been distributed in Khartoum on Wednesday , there was no sign of protesters .
After the verdict , announced by judge Mohammed Youssef at 9 pm , Boulos attempted to quell any lingering anger on the streets .
" We are happy with the verdict , " he said .
" It is fair .
There were a lot of political pressures and attention .
We will be very sad to lose her . "
Video : Squirrel waves hot tail at rattle snake
Video : Squirrel waves cold tail at gopher snake
It ’s Californian ground squirrel versus rattlesnake in a potentially lethal showdown .
But the squirrel has a secret weapon that until now has remained invisible to the human eye .
The ground squirrel heats up its tail then waves it in the snake ’s face – a form of harassment that confuses the rattler , which has an infrared sensing organ for detecting small mammals .
Advertisement
This defensive tactic remained invisible to biologists until they looked at the animals through an infrared video camera .
Now they believe that many other animals might be using infrared weaponry to ward off potential predators .
Young California ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beecheyi ) are easy prey for snakes , so protective adults harass the predators while puffing up their tails and wagging them .
Infrared organ
Graduate student Aaron Rundus and his supervisor Donald Owings of the University of California , Davis , wondered how this might affect the snakes ’ interaction with the adult squirrels .
So he borrowed a $ 35,000 infrared camera from another scientist and spied on squirrel - snake stand - offs .
He saw the adults ’ tails heat up , presumably due to increased blood flow , when they were warning rattlers away – making the squirrel appear larger to the snake ’s infrared organ .
Confronted with a gopher snake , which has no infrared sensory organ , the squirrels wagged their tails but did n’t bother to warm them up first .
Tests with robotic squirrels confirmed that a warmed squirrel tail made rattlesnakes more likely to act defensively , say Rundus and Owings .
The squirrels themselves do not see in infrared , so they cannot see another squirrel ’s tail heating up .
But the snakes can , proving that the squirrels have evolved a specific way to deter rattlesnakes .
“ It taught us to focus on the perceptual world of the animal we ’re studying ” rather than thinking only of human perceptions , says Rundus .

The report says Iran is several years away from building a bomb
Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 but is continuing to enrich uranium , a National Intelligence Estimate assessment has concluded .
Enriched uranium is used in nuclear bombs but Tehran says the aims of its nuclear activities are peaceful .
A senior advisor to President Bush said the report was " positive " but the risk of a nuclear Iran remained " serious " .
Iran is currently under sanctions from both the UN Security Council , which is demanding the end of uranium enrichment , and unilateral US sanctions .
' Technical problems '
The declassified summary of the report , which draws together information from the US 's 16 intelligence agencies , says with " high confidence " that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 " in response to international pressure " .
The assessment says with " moderate confidence " that the programme has not restarted .
This is a turnaround from previous assessments , when US intelligence agencies believed Iran was trying to develop a nuclear weapon .
Iran made " significant progress " in 2007 installing gas centrifuges used to enrich uranium - a process necessary for producing the fissile nuclear material needed to build a nuclear bomb , the report says .
But the report 's authors judge with " moderate confidence " that Iran " still faces significant technical problems " operating the new equipment .
And they conclude that the country is not likely to have enough highly enriched uranium to build a bomb until 2010 - 2015 .
' Right strategy '
US National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley said the report 's findings confirmed the US was " right to be worried " about Iran 's nuclear ambitions and that President George W Bush had " the right strategy " .

The international community should " turn up the pressure on Iran " using diplomatic isolation , UN sanctions and other financial leverage , he said .
The BBC News website 's world affairs correspondent , Paul Reynolds , says the report is cautious in its assessment of Iran 's nuclear activities and provides little evidence for those who would like an early military attack .
He says it will strengthen the hand of those who want further sanctions since it states that past pressure has worked .
BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says the estimate is in stark contrast to the alarmist and hawkish language coming from some parts of the administration .
Last month Mr Bush warned that stopping Iran developing nuclear technology was vital to prevent World War III .
Supplies for generators at Al - Shifa hospital are said to be very low
The army said one was about to launch mortar shells at Israel from near Gaza City - a claim disputed by Hamas .
Three died in fighting near the Gaza border .
Israeli troops have killed about 20 people in the coastal strip in less than a week , mostly Hamas members .
The incidents come as medical officials in Gaza say hospitals are beginning to run out of vital fuel supplies .
Israel says its actions in Gaza are a response to security threats , including the regular firing of rockets into its territory .
' Collective punishment '
The BBC 's correspondent in the Palestinian territories , Aleem Maqbool , says it is not just military pressure that Israel is exerting on Gaza .
Sanctions have been imposed as well .
These include the reduction of fuel supplies upon which Gaza depends .
On Sunday , the Fuel Companies Association there said it refused a delivery after it was offered just one - quarter of the normal amount it receives .
The association 's chairman said accepting such low supplies would amount to participating in what he called " collective punishment by Israel " .
Officials say most petrol stations in Gaza have shut , and that medical patients are now at risk because fuel supplies at hospitals - vital for running generators - are running out .
There has been good news for some , our correspondent says : Israel allowed around 250 people to leave Gaza for Egypt .
Most either study or work abroad , but had been trapped since June , following the Hamas takeover of the territory , when Israel imposed strict travel restrictions .
Several thousand people , needing to get out of Gaza , have registered with the Israeli authorities .
They include medical patients , some of whom have died in recent weeks , waiting for treatment only available outside Gaza .

Believe me , I sympathize .
You are in possession of a truly incredible breakthrough that offers the prospect of changing the very face of science as we know it , if not more .
The only problem is , you 're coming at things from an unorthodox perspective .
Maybe your findings do n't fit comfortably with people 's preconceived notions , or maybe you do n't have the elaborate academic credentials that established scientists take for granted .
Perhaps you have been able to construct a machine that produces more energy than it consumes , using only common household implements ; or maybe you 've discovered a hidden pattern within the Fibonacci sequence that accurately predicts the weight that a top quark would experience on Ganymede , expressed in femtonewtons ; or it might be that you 've elaborated upon an alternative explanation for the evolution of life on Earth that augments natural selection by unspecified interventions from a vaguely - defined higher power .
Whatever the specifics , the point is that certain kinds of breakthroughs just are n't going to come from a hide - bound scholastic establishment ; they require the fresh perspective and beginner 's mind that only an outsider genius ( such as yourself ) can bring to the table .
Yet , even though science is supposed to be about being open - minded , and there 's so much that we do n't understand about how the universe works , it 's still hard for outsiders to be taken seriously .
Instead , you run up against stuffy attitudes like this :
If there are any new Einsteins out there with a correct theory of everything all LaTeXed up , they should feel quite willing to ask me for an endorsement for the arxiv ; I 'd be happy to bask in the reflected glory and earn a footnote in their triumphant autobiography .
More likely , however , they will just send their paper to Physical Review , where it will be accepted and published , and they will become famous without my help .
If , on the other hand , there is anyone out there who thinks they are the next Einstein , but really they are just a crackpot , do n't bother ; I get things like that all the time .
Sadly , the real next - Einsteins only come along once per century , whereas the crackpots are far too common .
And that last part is sadly true .
There is a numbers game that is working against you .
You are not the only person from an alternative perspective who purports to have a dramatic new finding , and here you are asking established scientists to take time out from conventional research to sit down and examine your claims in detail .
Of course , we know that you really do have a breakthrough in your hands , while those people are just crackpots .
But how do you convince everyone else ?
All you want is a fair hearing .
Scientists can't possibly pay equal attention to every conceivable hypothesis , they would literally never do anything else .
Whether explicitly or not , they typically apply a Bayesian prior to the claims that are put before them .
Purported breakthroughs are not all treated equally ; if something runs up against their pre-existing notions of how the universe works , they are much less likely to pay it any attention .
So what does it take for the truly important discoveries to get taken seriously ?
Happily , we are here to help .
It would be a shame if the correct theory to explain away dark matter or account for the origin of life were developed by someone without a conventional academic position , who did n't really take a lot of science classes in college and did n't have a great math background but was always interested in the big questions , only for that theory to be neglected because of some churlish prejudice .
So we would like to present a simple checklist of things that alternative scientists should do in order to get taken seriously by the Man .
And the good news is , it 's only three items !
How hard can that be , really ?
True , each of the items might require a nontrivial amount of work to overcome .
Hey , nobody ever said that being a lonely genius was easy .
So let 's begin at the beginning :
1. Acquire basic competency in whatever field of science your discovery belongs to .
In other words , " get to know what is already known . "
If you have a new theory that unites all the forces , make sure you have mastered elementary physics , and grasp the basics of quantum field theory and particle physics .
If you 've built a perpetual - motion machine , make sure you possess a thorough grounding in mechanical and electrical engineering , and are pretty familiar with the First Law of Thermodynamics .
If you can explain the cosmological redshift without invoking an expanding universe , make sure you know general relativity and have mastered the basics of modern cosmology and astrophysics .
Just as an example , if fundamental physics is your bailiwick , Gerard 't Hooft has put together a list of subjects you should get under your belt , complete with bibliography !
Many of them are online lecture notes ; some of them are by me .
So start reading !
It may seem like a daunting collection at first ; but keep in mind , this kind of curriculum is completed by hundreds of graduate students every year .
Most of whom are not singular geniuses who will transform the very face of science .
Now , you may object that steering clear of such pre-existing knowledge has played a crucial role in your unique brand of breakthrough research , and you would never have been able to make those dazzling conceptual leaps had you been weighed down by all of that established art .
Let me break it down for you : no .
There may have been a time , in the halcyon days of Archimedes or maybe even Galileo and Newton , when anyone with a can - do attitude and a passing interest in the fundamental mysteries could make an important contribution to our understanding of nature .
Those days are long past .
( And Galileo and Newton , let us note , understood the science of their time better than anybody . )
We 've learned a tremendous amount about how the universe works , most of which is " right " at least in some well - defined regime of applicability .
If you have n't mastered what we 've already learned , you 're not going to be able to see beyond it .
Put it this way : it 's a matter of respect .
By asking scientists to take your work seriously , you are asking them to respect you enough to spend their time investigating your claims .
The absolute least you can do is respect them enough to catch up on the stuff they 've all made a great effort to master .
There are a lot of smart people working as scientists these days ; if a basic feature of your purported breakthrough ( " the derivation of the Friedmann equation is wrong " ; " length contraction is a logical contradiction " ) is that it requires that a huge number of such people have been making the same elementary mistake over and over again for years , the fault is more likely to lie within yourself than in the stars .
Do your homework , first , then get back to me .
2. Understand , and make a good - faith effort to confront , the fundamental objections to your claims within established science .
Someone comes along and says " I 've discovered that there 's no need for dark matter . "
A brief glance at the abstract reveals that the model violates our understanding of perturbation theory .
Well , perhaps there is something subtle going on here , and our conventional understanding of perturbation theory does n't apply in this case .
So here 's what any working theoretical cosmologist would do ( even if they are n't consciously aware that they 're doing it ) : they would glance at the introduction to the paper , looking for a paragraph that says " Look , we know this is n't what you would expect from elementary perturbation theory , but here 's why that does n't apply in this case . "
Upon not finding that paragraph , they would toss the paper away .
Scientific claims -- whether theoretical insights or experimental breakthroughs -- do n't exist all by their lonesome .
They are situated within a framework of pre-existing knowledge and expectations .
If the claim you are making seems manifestly inconsistent with that framework , it 's your job to explain why anyone should nevertheless take you seriously .
Whenever someone claims to build a perpetual - motion device , scientist solemnly reiterate that the law of conservation of energy is not to be trifled with lightly .
Of course one must admit that it could be wrong -- it 's only one law , after all .
But when you actually build some machine that purportedly puts out more ergs than it consumes ( in perpetuity ) , it does a lot more than violate the law of conservation of energy .
That machine is made of atoms and electromagnetic fields , which obey the laws of atomic physics and Maxwell 's equations .
And conservation of energy can be derived from those laws -- so you 're violating those as well .
If you claim that the position of Venus within the Zodiac affects your love life , you 're not only positing some spooky correlation between celestial bodies and human affairs ; your theory also requires some sort of long - range force that acts between you and Venus , and there are n't any such forces strong enough to be relevant .
If you try to brush those issues under the rug , rather than confronting them straightforwardly , your credibility suffers greatly .
For example , imagine you say , " I have a method of brewing a magical healing potion that bypasses the ossified practices of your so - called `medicine , ' and I 've personally known several people who were miraculously cured by it , and also there was a study once in some journal that did n't conclusively rule out the possibility of an effect , and besides you do n't know everything . "
No non-crackpot person is going to pay a whit of attention to you , except perhaps to poke fun in between doing serious work .
But now imagine you say " It 's true that my claimed magical healing potion appears to violate this famous law of chemistry and that well - established principle of medicine , which have been painstakingly developed and stringently tested against experimental data over the course of many decades , and it 's natural that you would be skeptical of such a claim -- but here is the empirical evidence that is dramatic enough to overcome that skepticism , and this is the reason why there might be a loophole in those laws in this particular circumstance . "
People will be much more likely to take you seriously .
3 . Present your discovery in a way that is complete , transparent , and unambiguous .
What we 're getting at here is that scientific discoveries , unlike sonnets or declarations of love , are universal rather than personal .
They belong to everyone , and once they are presented to the world , they can be explored equally well by anybody .
By almost any standard , I understand general relativity better than Einstein ever did .
( Most parts of it , anyway . )
Not because I 'm anywhere nearly as smart as Einstein , but because we 've learned a lot about GR since Einstein died .
Once the theory was invented , he did n't have a monopoly on it ; it was out there for anyone to understand and move forward with .
Even if he had repudiated his own theory , it would have had no effect on whether or not it was correct .
Your discovery should be the same way .
If it 's a revolutionary new theory , it should be a theory that anyone can use .
That means it needs to be clearly expressed and unambiguous .
I 've had more than one long and fruitless discussion with alternative scientists who would say " You tell me the experimental result , and I will explain it with my theory . "
That 's not the way it works .
Your theory should have a life of its own ; it should be a machine that I ( or anyone ) could use to make predictions .
And if it 's a physics theory , let 's face it , it 's going to involve math .
In this day and age , nobody is going to be moved by a model of elementary particles that comes expressed as a set of three - dimensional sculptures constructed from pipe cleaners .
Likewise , if your breakthrough is an experiment , it had better be a dramatically obvious one -- and the more you are violating cherished scientific beliefs , the more dramatic the effect had better be .
If what you 're claiming requires a re-arrangement of the energy levels in organic molecules , in flagrant disregard of the Schrodinger equation , you are going to need much more than a two - or three - sigma effect .
And , equally importantly , you have to be up front about what the apparatus is , so that anyone can reproduce the experiment .
No fair saying " Well , if you come into my lab , I 'll turn it on and show you how it works . "
And " This experiment was done in the ' 70's in a secret underground lab in Gdansk , and the KGB has suppressed the lab notebooks " is n't any better .
If you 're actually playing the role of a scientist , share your procedure with everyone , so that they can become true believers themselves .
If , on the other hand , you just want to make money , then by all means do n't tell anyone ; just start producing the free energy ( or amazing stretchy widgets , or whatever ) and sell it on the open market .
The millions of dollars that will doubtless flow your way will be very comforting as you rail against the establishment for failing to appreciate your genius .
So there you go !
Modesty aside , this post might be the single greatest favor that has ever been done for the loose - knit community of non-traditional scientists .
We 've been very explicit about what is expected , if you want to get the recognition you believe is your due .
Three simple items , start checking them off !
Also , one last thing .
Do n't compare yourself to Galileo .
You are not Galileo .
Honestly , you 're not .
Dude , seriously .

It ’s good to see that this story is finally getting more mainstream media attention .
Appearing on MSNBC ’s Live with Dan Abrams , FDNY Deputy Fire Chief Jim Riches and his group , 9/11 Firefighters and Families , are challenging Giuliani ’s 9/11 credibility .
Riches said : “ We are going to follow him around and tell the true story of what happened on 9/11 . ” … “ and get the message out to all of America and every state to let them know that Rudy Giuliani is not Mr 9/11 .
He ’s not a hero .
He ran that day . ”
Read more and watch the interview : www.crooksandliars.com
An article in the New York Post also quotes Jim Riches :
“ Giuliani is running on 9/11 and portraying himself as a hero .
It ’s disgusting .
It ’s horrible , ” FDNY Deputy Fire Chief Jim Riches said .
“ This guy will do anything to get elected . ”
“ He ’s misleading voters and distorting the truth .
He did n’t prepare the first responders for a terrorist attack .
The Office of Emergency Management was a joke that day .

Jim Riches also appeared on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and was asked if he was trying to “ swift boat ” Giuliani :
“ Let ’s get right to the issue , ” Blitzer said .
“ Are you trying to ‘ swiftboat ’ Rudy Giuliani ? ”
“ No , we ’re going to set the record straight on 9/11 and we do n’t think he ’s the hero he says he was or the leader , ” Riches said .
Riches , who lost his son when the Towers collapsed , faults Giuliani for the Fire Department ’s faulty radios , a lack of training at the World Trade Center , an inept Office of Emergency Management , and “ incompetent and cowardly ” police and fire commissioners .
“ I take it that you ’re thinking of starting what ’s called a 527 , a committee that would raise money to go after a specific candidate without being involved in any another candidate , is that right ? ”
Blizter asked .
“ We ’re all from different - , we ’re conservatives , we ’re Democrats and I voted for Bush and I voted for Giuliani three times , ” Riches said , “ This is not political , this is strictly about his leadership . ”
Riches also rejected claims by the Giuliani campaign that his group was politicizing 9/11 .
“ Well , that ’s a lie because they ’ve politicized it from day one and if he wants to run on his record of failure and everything else then let him run on it , but we ’re going to set the truth out , ” Riches said .

Ira Glass :
What makes for a good story ?
We are a storytelling animal .
In fact , we are wired for story .
The thing is , there is no single right way to tell a story or to use story elements in your presentations and other communications .
There are many paths .
The important thing is to be aware and open to the many lessons that are out there .
About nine years ago I originally pointed to these four , short videos made by Ira Glass ( in those days YouTube videos had to be shorter ) .
Below are the four videos of Ira Glass , a veteran radio personality and host of This American Life , giving advice to those making short stories .
There are good pieces of wisdom in there we can apply to presentation in the broader sense as well .
All this time later and his advice is still valuable .
If you have never seen these clips , I highly recommend you set some time aside to watch these this week .
And if you have seen them , they are worth watching again .
I have highlighted some of my key takeaways from his monologue .
Part 1 ( on the basics ... )
The old way , says Ira , looks like this :
Have a topic statement then fill out the facts that support your statement .
( This is not to say that logic and evidence and support are not important .
Of course , they are important , but they 're rarely sufficient . )
In storytelling there are two basic building blocks , says Ira Glass :
(1) The anecdote , a sequence of actions , a story in its purest form , one thing following from another ( rather than just disjointed " facts " ) .
" The Power of the anecdote is so great ... No matter how boring the material is , if it is in story form ... there is suspense in it , it feels like something 's going to happen .
The reason why is because literally it's a sequence of events ... you can feel through its form [ that it 's ] inherently like being on a train that has a destination ... and that you 're going to find something ... "
— Ira Glass
( 1a ) Raise questions .
Provide the " bait . "
The anecdote should raise a question right from the beginning .
Implied in any question that you raise , however , is that you are going to answer it .
Constantly raise questions and answer them .
The shape of the story is that you are throwing out questions and answering them along the way .
(2) The moment of reflection .
What is the key point ?
What does this all mean ?
Why have I asked you to sit and listen for 30 min , etc .
It is not just a series of facts / events .
Many people get the first part , they tell an interesting sequence of events , but in the end it fails because it does n't say anything new , it did not have meaning .
And sometimes people have the reflection part and the question is clear in their mind , but they fail to put it in a sequence that compels people to follow and engage .
In a good story you need both -- you can flip back and forth between the two .
The Anecdote and the Moment of Reflection are interwoven to make a story .
Part 2 ( on finding great stories ... )
Here Ira is talking about the importance of editing and choosing , choosing even to decide to not do something ( because it is not meeting your standards , etc. ) .
The hardest thing can be deciding to cut and even abandon , but it must be done .
" Not enough gets said about the importance of abandoning crap . "
— Ira Glass
Part 3 ( on good taste , persevering ... )
If you 're going to do creative work , you may go through years of producing stuff that does not meet your own high standards .
The way to get better is to keep you standards high and just keep doing a lot of work and getting a lot of experience .
This applies to presentations too .
Guy Kawasaki , for example , said that he used to be a terrible presenter when he was young .
Today he 's great , but it took years and lot 's of experience .
Part 4 ( on finding your own voice ... )
Speaking in your own voice .
Good advice applicable to live presentations or making podcasts , etc .
" Everything is more compelling when you talk like a human being , when you talk like yourself . "
— Ira Glass
So are there boring subjects ?
Sure , some subjects may be sexier than others , but I do n't buy the notion that there are necessarily boring presentation subjects .
If you 're presenting then there must be an important reason why you have been chosen to do so .
If not , why on earth are you going to speak ?
If it 's important , then what is the point in just getting through it and appearing effective when in reality the audience got nothing and remember even less ?
Here 's an example from my undergraduate days long ago :
The most boring class I ever had in college was a course called Human Sexuality .
I do n't know how he did it , but the stuffy , boring , rambling lecturer managed to make the subject as dry as burnt toast .
I received a final score of " B " for the class . " B " !
Do you know how humiliating it is not to ace a class on sex ?
Yet , my Economics class — a so - called " boring topic " — was fascinating to me , largely because the lecturer was passionate about the topic ( and showed it ) and taught concepts and illustrated them with real stories and real examples .
He also had a sense of humor .
I liked the class and aced it even though when I registered for the class I hoped only just to " get by " and survive in what I thought would surely be a tediously dull , difficult subject .
The moral of the story for me is that any subject can be boring and any subject can be quite interesting indeed , but no subject is necessarily either .
Designing a story is not easy work , but it 's worth it .

Mystery : How Wealth Creates
Poverty In The World
By Michael Parenti
24 April , 2007
Countercurrents.org
T here is a “ mystery ” we must explain :
How is it that as corporate investments and foreign aid and international loans to poor countries have increased dramatically throughout the world over the last half century , so has poverty ?
The number of people living in poverty is growing at a faster rate than the world ’s population .
What do we make of this ?
Over the last half century , U.S. industries and banks ( and other western corporations ) have invested heavily in those poorer regions of Asia , Africa , and Latin America known as the “ Third World . ”
The transnationals are attracted by the rich natural resources , the high return that comes from low - paid labor , and the nearly complete absence of taxes , environmental regulations , worker benefits , and occupational safety costs .
The U.S. government has subsidized this flight of capital by granting corporations tax concessions on their overseas investments , and even paying some of their relocation expenses --- much to the outrage of labor unions here at home who see their jobs evaporating .
The transnationals push out local businesses in the Third World and preempt their markets .
American agribusiness cartels , heavily subsidized by U.S. taxpayers , dump surplus products in other countries at below cost and undersell local farmers .
As Christopher Cook describes it in his Diet for a Dead Planet , they expropriate the best land in these countries for cash - crop exports , usually monoculture crops requiring large amounts of pesticides , leaving less and less acreage for the hundreds of varieties of organically grown foods that feed the local populations .
By displacing local populations from their lands and robbing them of their self - sufficiency , corporations create overcrowded labor markets of desperate people who are forced into shanty towns to toil for poverty wages ( when they can get work ) , often in violation of the countries ’ own minimum wage laws .
In Haiti , for instance , workers are paid 11 cents an hour by corporate giants such as Disney , Wal - Mart , and J.C. Penny .
The United States is one of the few countries that has refused to sign an international convention for the abolition of child labor and forced labor .
This position stems from the child labor practices of U.S. corporations throughout the Third World and within the United States itself , where children as young as 12 suffer high rates of injuries and fatalities , and are often paid less than the minimum wage .
The savings that big business reaps from cheap labor abroad are not passed on in lower prices to their customers elsewhere .
Corporations do not outsource to far - off regions so that U.S. consumers can save money .
They outsource in order to increase their margin of profit .
In 1990 , shoes made by Indonesian children working twelve - hour days for 13 cents an hour , cost only $ 2.60 but still sold for $ 100 or more in the United States .
U.S. foreign aid usually works hand in hand with transnational investment .
It subsidizes construction of the infrastructure needed by corporations in the Third World : ports , highways , and refineries .
The aid given to Third World governments comes with strings attached .
It often must be spent on U.S. products , and the recipient nation is required to give investment preferences to U.S. companies , shifting consumption away from home produced commodities and foods in favor of imported ones , creating more dependency , hunger , and debt .
A good chunk of the aid money never sees the light of day , going directly into the personal coffers of sticky - fingered officials in the recipient countries .
Aid ( of a sort ) also comes from other sources .
In 1944 , the United Nations created the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
Voting power in both organizations is determined by a country ’s financial contribution .
As the largest “ donor , ” the United States has a dominant voice , followed by Germany , Japan , France , and Great Britain .
The IMF operates in secrecy with a select group of bankers and finance ministry staffs drawn mostly from the rich nations .
The World Bank and IMF are supposed to assist nations in their development .
What actually happens is another story .
A poor country borrows from the World Bank to build up some aspect of its economy .
Should it be unable to pay back the heavy interest because of declining export sales or some other reason , it must borrow again , this time from the IMF .
But the IMF imposes a “ structural adjustment program ” ( SAP ) , requiring debtor countries to grant tax breaks to the transnational corporations , reduce wages , and make no attempt to protect local enterprises from foreign imports and foreign takeovers .
The debtor nations are pressured to privatize their economies , selling at scandalously low prices their state - owned mines , railroads , and utilities to private corporations .
They are forced to open their forests to clear - cutting and their lands to strip mining , without regard to the ecological damage done .
The debtor nations also must cut back on subsidies for health , education , transportation and food , spending less on their people in order to have more money to meet debt payments .
Required to grow cash crops for export earnings , they become even less able to feed their own populations .
So it is that throughout the Third World , real wages have declined , and national debts have soared to the point where debt payments absorb almost all of the poorer countries ’ export earnings --- which creates further impoverishment as it leaves the debtor country even less able to provide the things its population needs .
Here then we have explained a “ mystery . ”
It is , of course , no mystery at all if you do n’t adhere to trickle - down mystification .
Why has poverty deepened while foreign aid and loans and investments have grown ?
Answer : Loans , investments , and most forms of aid are designed not to fight poverty but to augment the wealth of transnational investors at the expense of local populations .
There is no trickle down , only a siphoning up from the toiling many to the moneyed few .
In their perpetual confusion , some liberal critics conclude that foreign aid and IMF and World Bank structural adjustments “ do not work ” ; the end result is less self - sufficiency and more poverty for the recipient nations , they point out .
Why then do the rich member states continue to fund the IMF and World Bank ?
Are their leaders just less intelligent than the critics who keep pointing out to them that their policies are having the opposite effect ?
No , it is the critics who are stupid not the western leaders and investors who own so much of the world and enjoy such immense wealth and success .
They pursue their aid and foreign loan programs because such programs do work .
The question is , work for whom ?
Cui bono ?
The purpose behind their investments , loans , and aid programs is not to uplift the masses in other countries .
That is certainly not the business they are in .
The purpose is to serve the interests of global capital accumulation , to take over the lands and local economies of Third World peoples , monopolize their markets , depress their wages , indenture their labor with enormous debts , privatize their public service sector , and prevent these nations from emerging as trade competitors by not allowing them a normal development .
In these respects , investments , foreign loans , and structural adjustments work very well indeed .
The real mystery is : why do some people find such an analysis to be so improbable , a “ conspiratorial ” imagining ?
Why are they skeptical that U.S. rulers knowingly and deliberately pursue such ruthless policies ( suppress wages , rollback environmental protections , eliminate the public sector , cut human services ) in the Third World ?
These rulers are pursuing much the same policies right here in our own country !
Is n’t it time that liberal critics stop thinking that the people who own so much of the world --- and want to own it all --- are “ incompetent ” or “ misguided ” or “ failing to see the unintended consequences of their policies ” ?
You are not being very smart when you think your enemies are not as smart as you .
They know where their interests lie , and so should we .

European football 's governing body has given a 96 - page report to Interpol alleging that 15 games in a variety of competitions were fixed .
" They all involve preliminary rounds of club competitions , " Uefa spokesman William Gaillard told BBC Radio 5 Live .
And Gaillard described claims that England might get a back way into the Euro 2008 finals as " pure fantasy " .
Some reports have suggested that the investigation could ultimately lead to England or Scotland - who both failed to qualify - getting places at next summer 's finals .
" In most cases it is just suspicion , " said Gaillard .
" There is only one match that involves an investigation and that was a match in the second round of the Intertoto Cup .
It was not a decisive match . "
This is clearly very serious and potentially one of the most serious things that has happened in world football .
Graham Bean
The BBC 's sports news correspondent Nigel Adderley said : " Uefa 's suspicions have been raised by unusual betting patterns .
" But history suggests that following the money is very difficult and , despite the scandal that rocked Italian football last year , cases where corruption has been discovered and proved are relatively rare . "
The story was first reported in German magazine Der Spiegel .
The magazine alleges that the vast majority of clubs involved come from countries in eastern and south - eastern Europe , with Bulgaria , Georgia , Serbia , Croatia and the Baltics among those named .
Graham Bean , the former police officer who used to head up the Football Association 's compliance unit , told BBC World Service : " They are exceptionally serious allegations if the stories are correct but they will be extremely difficult to investigate .
" Clearly Uefa , for them to pass this report across , do have some evidence of some kind that would suggest has come down the route of betting patterns or individuals rolling over and telling them what they know .
" Nevertheless if that is the case they still need to get corroborative evidence to prove what has supposedly gone on .
" If the evidence is there and football wants to take this on and deal with this properly with the police , then the simple fact is the punishments that should be imposed on any clubs or individuals found guilty should be extremely excessive .
" There is so much money involved now , not only in football but in the betting industry , whereby you can get a bet on anything , it clearly opens it up to corruption if a betting syndicate can drop on the right person .
" I can't remember anything happening on this scale before .
" For something of this magnitude and these type of games then this is clearly very serious and potentially one of the most serious things that has happened in world football . "
In what 's likely to be seen as a privacy - friendly move , IAC Search & Media 's Ask.com search engine Tuesday announced a ew feature called AskEraser that deletes a user 's search activity data from the company 's servers .
When enabled by the user , the feature will completely delete search queries and associated cookie information from Ask.com servers -- including IP addresses , user IDs , session IDs and the text of queries made , according to the company .
In most cases , the deletion will take place within a few hours of the time a search is completed , the company said .
The feature is available to users of the company 's U.S and U.K. search engines and is designed to give users more control over their search data , the company said in a statement .
" AskEraser is simple , straightforward and easy - to - use .
It is an idea whose time has come , " Ask.com CEO Jim Lanzone said in a statement .
The new feature is a step in the right direction , but it does n't go far enough in addressing consumer privacy concerns , said Jeff Chester , executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy , a Washington - based nonprofit .
Allowing users more control over their search data is likely to give Ask.com -- which lags behind Google and other search engines -- an important PR boost , Chester said .
It also strikes all the right notes at a time when there is growing concern around online privacy , he said .
But there are important caveats to keep in mind , Chester said , Ask.com , for instance , will still collect and store user search data by default , unless the user specifically enables AskEraser , Chester said .
And enabling AskEraser does nothing to prevent third parties with whom Ask.com has relationships from collecting and storing search data .
With third parties , Ask.com will continue to supply user information such as IP addresses , the last URL visited , browser and platform type , data in undeleted cookies from Ask.com and the search query data itself .
A recent Ask.com deal with Google Inc. for search display advertising would also allow the search giant to gain access to some of its smaller rival 's search data , Chester said .
Ask.com has also said that it will also retain user search data in cases where it is required by law to do so , according to Chester .
Formal legal requests for search data will continue to be honored , even if AskEraser is enabled .
As a result , Chester argued that Ask.com still has n't fully addressed consumer privacy concerns .
" Some privacy advocates will suggest that this announcement shows the ' market ' is working , " he said .
" No doubt , that 's what Google and the other online advertisers opposed to a serious privacy policy will echo , whispering it to regulators , lawmakers and journalists .
That 's why a national privacy policy is required . "
