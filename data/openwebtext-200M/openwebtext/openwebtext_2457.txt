Apple has removed a widely publicized support document from its website that encouraged Mac OS X users to install antivirus software , explaining that its operating system was designed with safeguards to protect against malicious attacks on its own .
The recommendation drew widespread attention given that the Mac maker has been critical in its television advertisements of Windows users ' need to stock up on virus detection software while its own computers remain immune to viral threats .
It was later revealed that the document was about a year old and only caught the attention of industry watchers after Apple recently updated it to reflect changes in the version numbering of the antivirus software it was recommending .
" Apple encourages the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities so that virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent , thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult , " the document said , in part .
Speaking to CNet News.com , Apple spokesperson Bill Evans said the article was removed last night because it was deemed to be " old and inaccurate . "
" The Mac is designed with built - in technologies that provide protection against malicious software and security threats right out of the box , " he said .
" However , since no system can be 100 percent immune from every threat , running antivirus software may offer additional protection . "
TidBITS security editor Rich Mogull speculates that Apple may have never intended to urge Mac users to install antivirus software , and that the support article may have found its way to the company 's website without being filtered through the proper channels .

If you have ever tried to apply sunless tanning lotion , then you know that it requires a good strategy to get it right .
While sunless tanners are a great way to get a bronzed look without the risks associated with the sun ’s rays , they can be a bit messy .
Here are some tips to help you learn how to apply sunless tanning lotions for an even application and flawless finish .
Prep your skin .
If you apply sunless tanner to dry , flaky skin , you are not going to like the results .
Sunless tanning lotions tend to gather around rough patches which will make you have orange splotches .
This is easy to avoid if you follow typical skin care tips – which always include exfoliation .
Exfoliate first by using a scrub in the shower .
Pay particular attention to your ankles , feet , knees , and elbows .
Get everything ready .
Once you have sunless tanner on your hands , you are not going to want to touch everything in the bathroom because the lotion might cause discoloration .
Gather an old towel , a nail brush , your sunless tanning lotion , and a sponge paintbrush if you plan to apply tanner to your back .
Set everything up near a sink .
Do n’t do this in the bathroom after a steamy shower because sweating is a sure way to mess up the end result .
Begin with your legs .
That way you wo n’t have to bend over while tanner is drying on your stomach and risk smudges .
Start at the top of each leg and work your way down , applying it the same way you would a regular lotion but taking extra care not to miss any areas .
Use a circular motion to avoid creating streaks .
When you get to the bottom of each leg , try to extend the lotion downward onto your ankles and feet .
You do n’t want to add too much tanner to this area because it will build up and look strange .
Wash your hands and scrub your nails with the nail brush .
Sunless tanners will tan your palms if you are not careful , so it ’s a good idea to wash your hands before proceeding so your palms do n’t get stained .
Next work on the upper half of your body .
Start with your chest and work down to your stomach , again working in a circular motion .
Then use the sponge paintbrush to apply it to your back or get help from someone else to reach this area .
Next , apply it to your arms beginning at the top and working downward to the hands .
Finally , apply the lotion to your face and neck using a very light hand as tanner seems to get darker in this area .
Wash your hands again , being careful not to splash water up on your arms which would rinse away the tanner .
Allow the tanner to dry .
Wait for at least thirty minutes before dressing or putting on makeup , although it ’s better if you can wait even longer .
During this time , avoid sweating or contact with material such as your sofa or bed .
You really have to be patient and let it dry thoroughly or you will end up with all kinds of streaks and markings .
How To Apply Sunless Tanning Lotions
Watch out Politico and First Read .
Competition is on the horizon , albeit a distant one .
Stanislaw " Stas " Gunkel may soon be a big name in the political blogosphere .
He 's already been recognized by President - elect Barack Obama , who told him in a letter to " make a difference everywhere you go . "
Never mind that Gunkel is 7 years old and wo n't even be able to vote until 2019 .
The Edison Park boy 's blog , planetstas.blogspot.com , has covered such heady topics as alternative energy , the war in Iraq and yes , even Sarah Palin .
" It was not , like , really hot , " Gunkel told the Sun - Times about the talk on the presidential race during recess at Beaubien Elementary School , where he 's in second grade .
" We talked about it , and I read some Scholastic magazines . "
His parents , Ann Hetzel Gunkel and David Gunkel are both academics and gave young Stas the idea because they both have blogs .
At this point , it 's clear that the $ 99 iPhone 3G rumor was just that : rumor .
We have a letter that we believe to be authentic from a source within Walmart that says the iPhone will launch in the house that Sam built at 9 am December 28th .
At launch , only the 8GB ( $ 197 ) and 16GB ( $ 297 ) iPhone 3Gs will be available with a required signature on a 2 - year AT&T contract .
An internal pilot program kicks off today at 488 stores across the nation .
The iPhone 3G and a sack of garden manure all under the same roof ... heaven .
Johnny Depp : ' Public Enemies ' Results in $ 116,000 Road Collapse
The film Public Enemies , starringas famed bank robber John Dillinger , was filmed on location in Columbus , Wisconsin in March of this year , some 25 miles from the city of Madison and 75 miles from Milwaukee .
The city , population 4500 , agreed to divert traffic to facilitate filming and the county road that served as the detour collapsed under the added load of traffic .
The resulting repairs are more than chump change at $ 116,000 and remain a bone of contention .
The film company transformed the Columbus downtown area to resemble what it might have looked like in 1930 for the filming of several scenes including a bank robbery .
They also transformed a local Craftsman era mansion into a brothel to shoot an assignation scene between Dillinger and his prostitute girlfriend .
Dodge County , left holding the bag so far for the spendy road repair , has filed a claim against the city of Columbus .
Mayor Nancy
Osterhaus said that talks are ongoing between city , county and NBC Universal to split the bill .
Public Enemies hits theaters on July 1 , 2009 .

Designers Create Solar Power Generating Sunglasses
December 18th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
A team of designers have created solar power generating sunglasses capable of charging portable electronic devices on - the - go .
The SIG , or ‘ self - energy converting sunglasses , ’ contain integrated dye - solar cells and can be simply connected to the power jack in an iPod or PSP , allowing devices to be charged without the need to hook up to the mains supply .
According to the SIG ’s designer ’s , Hyun - Joong Kim and Kwang - Seok Jeong the glasses employ , “ cheap organic dye [ used with ] nano technology [ providing ] cheap but high energy efficiency . ”
As yet , there is no news on an anticipated launch date or expected price .
However , as long as they can target the right demographic , I ’m guessing the potential market for a nifty innovation like this could be huge .

Sun 's free and open source virtualization software , VirtualBox , has seen several upgrades since we took a look at a beta early this year .
Sun today announced a significant update to version 2.1 , with several important feature additions for those running virtual machines under Mac OS X .
Since the beta , Sun has addressed nearly every issue we pointed out back in February .
The latest release in particular adds support for hardware 3D graphics acceleration of OpenGL in Windows guests .
Hardware virtualization support for Intel VT-x and AMD - V now works on Mac OS X , and that support enables 64 - bit guest operating systems to be hosted by 32 - bit operating systems as long as the hardware is 64 - bit capable .
Other Mac OS X - specific improvements include the addition of ACPI host power status reporting and the ability to pause running VMs when your Mac is put to sleep and resume the paused VMs on wake .
Sun has a complete list of changes , including bug fixes and other improvements , on the VirtualBox website .
VirtualBox , like Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion , only works on Intel - based Macs , and is available for download now .
If your virtualization needs do n't require lots of host integration , à la Coherence or Unity , or the words " free " or " open source " rub your rhubarb , then VirtualBox is certainly worth a look .
Hope you ’re not bored of stories about water ice on Mars :
Now that scientists have found it , they ca n’t seem to stop finding it .
Just a few months after the dear , departed Mars Phoenix Lander made history by touching and analyzing water ice beneath the soil near the Martian north pole , researchers using NASA ‘s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have discovered massive glaciers near the equator .
The glaciers , buried under rocky debris , are said to be more than three times the size of Los Angeles , up to half a mile thick and skirt the edges of mountains and cliffs [ Telegraph ] .
The glaciers ’ presence means that rovers on future scientific missions wo n’t have to land at the freezing cold poles to study the planet ’s ice .
The glaciers could even prove helpful as a source of drinkable water to future astronauts exploring Mars .
“ This says there may be samples of ice within our reach , ” [ researcher Jim ]
Head said .
“ If we ’re thinking ahead to human exploration of Mars , it means we could go to some of these places and actually have water ice there ” [ Wired News ] .
Astronauts could also make hydrogen fuel from the ice , researchers say .
Researchers were somewhat surprised to encounter ice so close to the equator , but say it must have formed millions of years ago during an ice age , when the planet tilted on its axis and ice sheets may have spread over the mid-latitudes .
Writing in Science [ subscription required ] , researchers explain that the lingering glaciers were then covered by a blanket of debris .
Without the protective covering of dirt , all of the glacier ice would probably have sublimated into Mars ’ thin atmosphere , erasing this record of past climate change [ Science News ] .
There ’s also a chance that the ice could have preserved microbial life from an earlier era .
The hidden glaciers look like gentle slopes around the edges of steeper hills and were first spotted by the Viking spacecraft in the 1970s , but earlier researchers thought the landforms were mostly rock .
However , study coauthor Jim Head had studied the debris - covered glaciers in Antarctica ’s Dry Valleys , and says that the earthly landforms made him want to take a second look at the Martian structures .
The team used a radar on NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , and the radar echoes received back indicated that radio waves passed through the overlying debris material and reflected off a deeper surface below without losing much strength — the expected signal for thick ice covered by a thin layer of debris [ SPACE.com ] .

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , which began its operations on October 1 , 1958 , we offer this list of the 50 most memorable images from NASA ’s history ( see all 50 in the photo gallery below ) .
We recognize that any such ranking is inherently subjective .
The rationale for why any one image ranked two slots higher than any other combines several factors , including our attempt to balance the list between human spaceflight , satellite imaging , and planetary exploration .
Many wonderful images did not make the final cut — we could n’t convince the editors to give us 20 pages instead of 10 .
Related Content 50 Years of Spaceflight
The list omits significant events from space history that were not NASA achievements , such as the famous 1958 photograph of Wernher von Braun and the other architects of the Explorer 1 satellite celebrating their success by holding a model of the satellite over their heads , an event that occurred months before NASA existed .
Photos from the Apollo moon program predominate , as well they should — it remains the agency ’s crowning achievement .
We also recognize that , even though the first “ A ” in NASA stands for “ aeronautics , ” our list is light on aeronautical breakthroughs .
Our only excuse is that the ranking reflects the affinity of the division of space history staff for space topics .
Topping the list is the view of the whole Earth above , arguably the most influential image to come out of the American space program .
Used significantly by the environmental movement ( although NOT , as often reported , the inspiration for Earth Day ) .
This particular shot was from Apollo 17 , but all of the moon - bound astronauts took similar photos .
Although a satellite had returned a picture of the whole Earth in 1967 , it was n’t until humans saw this view for the first time a year later that it entered our collective mind .
We welcome the discussion we know this list will spark .
Debating which images should or should n’t have been ranked , and how high , would be an appropriate way to mark the past half century of NASA ’s accomplishments .
MUMBAI , India  Indian commandos took control of the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower , the last nest of terrorist resistance , on Saturday morning , after a lengthy assault that left three terrorists dead and sections of the hotel in flames , the head of the commando unit said in a televised news conference .
Soldiers were still combing the hotel , going room to room in search of remaining gunmen , but the siege appeared finally to have ended , J. K. Dutt , director general of the National Security Guard , an elite commando force , said in the news conference at 9 a.m .
Firefighters were permitted to begin pouring water over the flames that had burned out of control in the hotel ’s lower floors for as much as an hour while the commandos battled the terrorists .

It was the third day of a siege that has shaken India , raised tensions with neighboring Pakistan and prompted questions about the failure of the authorities to anticipate the tragedy or to react swiftly enough as it unfolded .
All told , after attackers were cleared from a second hotel and a Jewish center on Friday , more than 150 people had died .
Most of the dead were apparently Indian citizens , but at least 22 foreigners were killed .
Among the dead reported were a rabbi from Brooklyn and his wife , who ran the Jewish center .
The main success for the authorities on Friday came at the second hotel , the Oberoi .
The authorities said that two gunmen had been killed and 93 foreigners  some of them wearing Air France and Lufthansa uniforms  had been rescued , though 30 bodies were found .
Survivors offered harrowing accounts of their ordeal , trapped on the upper floors of the high - rise hotel while gunmen prowled below .
The National Security Guard said it recovered two AK - 47s , a 9 - millimeter pistol and some grenades .

For the first time , after several veiled accusations that Pakistan was involved , Indian officials specifically linked the attacks to their neighbor and longtime nemesis .
India ’s foreign minister blamed “ elements in Pakistan ” for the attacks , spreading the repercussions of the attacks beyond India ’s borders .
American intelligence and counterterrorism officials said Friday that there was mounting evidence that a Pakistani militant group  Lashkar - e - Taiba , which has long been involved in the conflict with India over the disputed territory of Kashmir  was responsible .
The Indian authorities were beginning to face sharp questions about why operations to flush out a handful of assailants at the Jewish center and at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower had not moved more rapidly .
And many other basic questions remained for a crisis that unfolded so publicly , on televisions , Web sites and Twitter feeds across the world .
Who were the attackers ?
The police tally was at least 11 killed and one captured alive , but could so few militants have caused such mayhem ?
Indian commandos said the attackers at the hotels were well trained , with one carrying a backpack packed with hundreds of rounds of ammunition , and they seemed to know the buildings ’ layout better than the security forces , indicating a high degree of preparation .
Some were seen arriving by boat ; others may have been guests at the hotels for days .
While we all think that Wall Street greed and the huge pay packets of “ fat cat ” speculators and bankers brought about the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , the actual cause is entirely different .
This was said to be just the trigger of the real cause , which is US gluttony .
America has gotten used to stuffing itself .
You would understand if you had seen the 2004 documentary , “ Super Size Me , ” by Morgan Spurlock .
It conveys the consequences of gluttony .
What does supersizing mean ?
It refers to the American habit of “ supersizing ” all the fast foods and getting consumers to opt for the bigger sizes for reasons of “ economy ” or savings .
You would have seen the pricing policy adopted by most fast food sellers .
The bigger the size , the lesser you pay .
This psychological trigger works wonders and consumers end up being the scapegoats opting for bigger sizes while the people selling them laugh all the way to the bank .
In fact , Morgan Spurlock , the film - maker practically tested this by surviving on a diet of three McDonald meals a day , for thirty days .
The result was drastic – he ended up heavier by 11.1 kg .
This weight gain was the least of his worries .
He also developed all sorts of health problems ; such as high blood pressure , psychological disorders and liver problems .
Coming back to normal was a long and arduous task , which included a rigorous detoxification program for 14 months .
This experiment brings to light America ’s insatiable appetite , not only for food but for everything , right from gas - devouring cars to climate - controlled condominiums .
United States ’ consumption levels far exceed its population , which is only 5 % of the World population .
America consumes 24 percent of the world ’s energy .
It is said that an average American consumes as much energy as 13 Chinese , 31 Indians , 128 Bangladeshis or 370 Ethiopians .
Statistics reveal that approximately , a total of 815 billion calories are consumed by America daily .
According to nutritionists , this is 200 billion more than the required amount .
This figure is without taking into consideration the huge amounts of completely edible food thrown away by Americans daily , which is around 200,000 tons .
Experts are of the opinion , that very soon , the Earth will be bereft of resources and it will become necessary to create four new Earth - sized planets .
When will American consumers realize that the huge sodas and supersized fast foods that come cheap can cost them dearly in the long run ?
America has become the land of the obese and statistics show that the number of obese adults doubled in the last couple of years .
It has become almost an epidemic and about 300,000 Americans are said to die each year due to overweight .
It is the second leading cause of preventable death after smoking .
People in the Public Health departments realize that obesity is a long - neglected problem and solutions need to be found .
They say that obesity will very soon exceed the risks cause by puffing on butts .
It is important to know that obesity is not just storing fat in the body , but a cause for dreaded diseases , such as high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , cancer , sleep apnea and many others .
It would be interesting to note that the problem of obesity has created a controversial debate over whether it can be classified as a disease .
While the National Institutes of Health say that it should be considered as a disease ; the U.S. surgeon general is of the opinion that obesity is a condition .
They say that obesity cannot be classified as a disease because people have control over it and it is in their hands to reduce weight .
It is a sad day indeed , because while others fight over the issue of classification of obesity , we continue to eat those huge burgers and drink gallons of cola and add on pounds .
We may get way with consuming more energy , because we may not be affected by it during our lifetime ; but can we say the same about our health – about our lives ?
The saying , “ we are what we eat ” holds true .
In order to be healthy and to keep physical and emotional suffering at bay as long as we live , we have to understand what our body needs – not what satisfies our palate .
Supersized America has to think of the children who are going to suffer the same fate tomorrow .
After all , children learn by following their parents .
Time to realize that the colas you so lovingly give your children are harming them .
Tammy and I thought it would be great to produce a series of T - shirt designs for those occasions when it is appropriate to wear our ideas on our sleeves .
Bonus points if they are n’t just provocative but actually spark some good engagement !
Here are two designs that respond to the religionists who called on Congress to edit our nation ’s official Pledge of Allegiance in the 1950′s to include the phrase “ under God ” — along with all those today who smile on that and wrongly insist that our great nation was founded on religious ideals .

Radiologists who read imaging exams -- such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and CT scans -- may do a better job if they see a picture of the face that goes with the diagnostic test , according to research presented this week at the Radiology Society of North America 's annual meeting in Chicago , Illinois .
" I noticed that I know the patient 's liver and spleen better than I know him , " says study author Dr. Yehonatan Turner .
Radiologists in the study said they read CT scans more meticulously and felt more empathy when they saw a patient 's face , although it 's not clear whether the photo actually improved their accuracy in interpreting the test results .
Yehonatan N. Turner , M.D. , a radiology resident at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem , Israel , came up with the idea of adding photos to patients ' files after reading dozens of CT scans as a medical resident .
" I noticed that I know the patient 's liver and spleen better than I know him , " he says .
" I thought maybe attaching the patient 's photograph to the file may make the scan unique and important . "
Turner says he was also drawing on the twentieth - century philosopher Emmanuel Levinas ' idea that seeing another person 's face instills a sense of responsibility for that person .
In the study , Turner and his colleagues photographed the faces of 267 patients ( with their consent ) two minutes before they underwent a CT scan .
Fifteen radiologists interpreted the CT exams with patients ' photos alongside , and then completed a questionnaire .
Three months later , 30 of the CT scans that included an incidental finding ( an unexpected finding that may or may not have health implications ) were shown to the radiologists again , without the patient photos .

Study participants said that seeing the photograph did n't increase the amount of time it took them to interpret the scan , but they did say they interpreted it more meticulously .
In fact , in 80 percent of the scans reviewed without photos , the radiologists did n't report the incidental findings that they had seen when they originally viewed the images .
" I think it 's a really fun study to have done .
I think it 's very imaginative , " says Etta D. Pisano , M.D. , a Kenan professor of radiology and biomedical engineering at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill .
She 's also the director of the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging Center .
" It sort of makes intuitive sense to me . "

But the implications are limited for the time being , she adds , given that the researchers did n't test the accuracy of the radiologists ' readings with and without the photographs .
" Anything that you do , even taking a photograph of a patient , costs money and time , " Pisano says .
" If radiologists ' performance could improve for something important , then it might be worth implementing .
Something like incidental findings is n't worth changing our system of providing care . "

There 's also the possibility that seeing what a patient looks like could have a negative impact on the radiologists ' ability to interpret images accurately , notes Robert Smith , Ph.D. , director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta .
" The physician could bring stereotypes and other information to bear that may diminish the accuracy , a perfectly human thing to do , by the way . "
He points to a study in which radiologists who learned about a patient 's family history of breast cancer spotted more tumors than if they did n't have this information .
But they also came up with more false - positives .
" It 's hard at face value to imagine that having the patient 's photograph could be harmful , " Smith says .
" Typically , radiologists may work in isolation .
They may actually find that this helps them to connect with the patient and helps them think more holistically about the image they 're reviewing . "

Pagophone

( Pagophone performance )
( Explanation of pagophone and context with H 2 Orchestra )
The pagophone makes sound from ice ( i.e. from H 2 O in its solid - state ) , when struck , rubbed , or manipulated , usually with rubber mallets .
" Pago " is Greek for ice , and " phone " is Greek for " sound " , so " pagophone " means " ice sound " , in much the same way that " xylophone " means " wood sound " ( " xylo " is Greek for " wood " ) .
This instrument was invented by Steve Mann , who also coined the term " pagophone " to describe it , based on proper Greek etymology .
It is intended to add a unique musical texture to the other H 2 O - based instruments that he invented , such as the hydraulophone .
There are two main preferred embodiments of this invention :
In one embodiment , sound transducers ( acoustic pickups ) in one or more pieces of ice pickup sound when the ice is struck by mallets , rubbed , or otherwise manipulated ;
In another embodiment , the electrical pickups are mounted in the mallets or ice scrapers themselves , and a separate input device , similar to a guitar effects pedal , is used to post - process the ice - generated sound .
Typically the separate input device is a musikeyer connected to a wearable computer that does the effects processing .
Typically ( in the Canadian tradition ) the ice - scrapers are ice skates , and the instrument is played by skating and the sound is typically produced by gliding , scraping , stomping , or otherwise moving around on a skating rink .

Last week I thought I had found the best snow screensaver for Mac OS X with LotsaSnow , but I was wrong .
This is the best snow screensaver for Mac OS X , and if you want proof – it is what Apple is using in the Apple Stores this holiday season !
Snowfall is a beautiful screensaver of falling three dimensional snowflakes rendered incredibly smoothly in quartz composer ( so it only works in Mac OS X Tiger and newer , tested to work in 10.6.5 ) .
It is a real treat for your Mac desktop and highly recommended to get you in the holiday spirit .
The default setting is snow falling on a red striped backdrop , you can change the color scheme to anything , but you can also set a background picture if you ’d like .
The screenshots really do n’t do it justice .
This is pure holiday joy , check it out yourself !
Snowfall requires Tiger ( 10.4 ) to Snow Leopard ( 10.6 ) so if you have a later version of Mac OS X you ’ll need to use LotsaSnow instead .
Andrew Lahde is an…er .. interesting guy .
The manager of Lahde Capital , his hedge fund , US Residential Real Estate Hedge V Class A , returned at one point nearly 1000 % by doing what James Mackintosh referred to as “ shorting US subprime mortgage - related structured credits , particularly the ABX indices . ”
What that means is that he bet against the sub - prime mortgage industry and won .
Big .
And then he bowed out .
In September , he closed his fund and returned money to his investors , stating that the risk of a bank collapse , which would be hell for hedge funds , was too high : “ While we concede there are additional opportunities in this episode of crisis and uncertainty , we have concluded that those opportunities are far outweighed by the risks attendant in the use of the over - the - counter derivatives market . ”
Interesting , yes , but is it er…interesting ?
No .
The err…interesting moment came when he delivered a bizarre , audience - inappropriate , Neo-Marxist stoner rant of a goodbye letter to his investors , calling for things like hemp legalization and government meritocracies , discussing the obvious insanity of illegal marijuana in a Bud Light world , and declaring capitalism dead .
He started off by lamenting how he made his money off of college - educated morons and legacy kids , what he considers this nation 's aristocracy .
He called them the “ low hanging fruit , ” saying that they were often “ truly not worthy of the education they received ( or supposedly received ) , ” and that through a nepotistic system they “ rose to the top of companies such as AIG , Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government . ”
He wished , as many have before , that it was a meritocracy , saying that “ Capitalism worked for two hundred years , but times change , and systems become corrupt . ”
What he does n't understand , though , is that capitalism is a meritocracy , and had capitalism been allowed to run its course , all his aristocratic trust fund legacy brats would be falling on their faces right now .
But instead , the system we have is mercantilist , whereby the government tries to promote the interests of business because it thinks it can generate wealth .
So , instead of letting the market punish stupid people for bad choices , our government socialized the failure by robbing taxpayers to the tune of an estimated $ 1 trillion .
Shrewd economic actors like Lahde help the economy by doing what he loathed – picking off the substandard – what he called the “ low hanging fruit ” – and freeing up that capital for more efficient uses .
It 's a shame that they do n't see their own importance , and instead , like a suddenly famous actor , are blinded by their guilt at having made it while others still struggle .
Not content with just providing meritocratic solutions to our economic system , he said meritocracies all around and set his sights on fixing our government , saying that since “ Thomas Jefferson and Adam Smith ” we 've had a “ dearth of worthy philosophers in this country , at least ones focused on improving government , ” ( clearly forgetting that Adam Smith was Scottish ) and said Linux 's open - source model was the way to governmental enlightenment :
George Soros , a man of staggering wealth , has stated that he would like to be remembered as a philosopher .
My suggestion is that this great man start and sponsor a forum for great minds to come together to create a new system of government that truly represents the common man 's interest , while at the same time creating rewards great enough to attract the best and brightest minds to serve in government roles without having to rely on corruption to further their interests or lifestyles .
This forum could be similar to the one used to create the operating system , Linux , which competes with Microsoft 's near monopoly .
I believe there is an answer , but for now the system is clearly broken .
The first problem with what he is saying is that the best and brightest are n't driven to governance – they are driven to business , to ideas and innovations .
They look for ways to improve our standard of living , whether it is through inventing a lifesaving vaccine , creating the biggest flatscreen , or like him , smoothing out economic transitions and creating capital for future growth and recovery .
They take risks with their own time and money , and rely on performance and persuasion to get ahead through voluntary arrangements .
Government is n't interested in performance and persuasion .
It does n't work through voluntary arrangements – it only works through force .
Therefore , those attracted to government are those that seek power , and those that make it in government are those that can lie and manipulate the best .
These are not the people we are to trust with power .
Like humorist PJ O'Rourke said , giving power to politicians is like “ giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys . ”
Government should n't serve “ the common man , ” anyway .
It should serve all men equally .
It 's the same kind of divisive and elitist thinking that drives so many east and west coast liberals think every inch of ground between LA and New York is filled with illiterate rubes , while conservative talk hosts call those same people “ the real Americans . ”
We 're all real Americans .
But if he truly wants to try this open source type of crafting good government , there is a good and successful example for him to study .
They created a government once where the whole country was separated into different regions that were independent of each other , but united under a common banner .
Each of these regions sent representatives to a council , whose mission it was simply to protect the collective from invasion , and make sure that trade flowed smoothly between the regions .
The beauty of that regional approach was that it was an open source model , whereby each region was free to make their own rules and approach to governance , so that each region could test out different plans and tactics , and the other regions could learn from their successes and failures .
By practical application , each region would improve on the other 's success , and in the end , all would be more efficient and effective for it .
This system was called Federalism , and it was practiced for almost 100 years in these United States .
What if I told you that you can live well in California with an income of less than $ 50,000 a year ?
A budget of this kind is not some sort of financial bait and switch but a realistic budget that many frugal people use on a daily basis .
California has one of the highest costs of living and if you can figure out how to live here making $ 46,000 a year , you can live anywhere in this country .
While many working professionals in California struggle with the ability of buying a home , there is a large class of people who are simply dealing with the day to day items of life .
In fact , if we look at a county like Los Angeles , the most populous county in Southern California 52.1 % of households actually rent .
This is significant given the population of this county is approximately 10,000,000 people .
This is not as far fetched as you would suspect .
The median household income for the entire United States is $ 46,326 .
* Source : Wikipedia – Census Bureau data
The median household income for Los Angeles County in 2004 was $ 43,518 so our hypothetical budget of $ 46,000 could apply to 5,000,000 people living in this highly populated area .
This probably goes against the wide perception that most people in California are wealthy and live in Beverly Hills , Brentwood , or Laguna Beach but this is a very tiny part of the population .
This is not the reality .
Many of these working families are simply getting by and have little way of accessing the media to discuss their struggles .
In this article , we are going to provide a full monthly budget for either a single person or working couple that pulls in $ 46,000 a year .
Many families live on this amount .
In fact , this works out to be about $ 11 per hour for 2 full - time workers or one worker pulling in $ 22 per hour .
First , let us provide the full monthly budget and discuss the line items in greater detail :
Now I know there have been many budgets put out on various finance and housing sites yet they really do not point you in the right direction as to where to find information .
After all , where do you find a fuel economical car for $ 3,000 ?
Or where can you shop for groceries and pay $ 400 a month to take care of breakfast , lunch and dinner ?
We will go into the details of the budget above .
Make no mistake , this is a minimalist budget here .
You wo n’t be buying a McMansion here but you wo n’t be drowning in debt either .
With this budget , you are even saving !
So if you find yourself in a situation like this , you may want to consider some of the items on the list .
The most expensive line item of any California resident is housing .
With $ 46,000 you should n’t even consider buying a home since it will sink you .
In fact , many people did buy homes with this kind of budget and now find themselves part of the problems the state is facing .
With this kind of budget you have small room for errors .
We are giving this person a $ 1,250 a month allocation for rent .
Believe it or not there are many nice 1 bedroom apartments for this price .
Craigslist will be one of your tools for investigating rental properties .
Take a look at what I found with a quick query :
As , you can see there are plenty of places in safe neighborhoods for this price range .
Now you have to manage your expectations .
You wo n’t be renting a beach front home in Newport Coast but you also wo n’t be living in unsafe neighborhoods .
Your quality of life will depend on whether you want a studio , 1 bedroom , or 2 bedrooms home .
Also , how close to your work would you like to be ?
The next tool you ’ll be using to find out whether you are paying too much or getting a good deal is Rent - o - meter .
With this tool , you simply put the address of the potential rental and it will use Goolge maps to give you a rough estimate of other rentals in the area .
For example , let us take a quick look at some rentals in Seal Beach :
After running this quick query , we can determine the market price of homes in this immediate region .
Since our budget is sensitive to housing prices , it is important we first manage our expectations in regards to price .
But with 88 Cities in Los Angeles County we do have some room for flexibility .
It will take some time to research but you will find something safe and comfortable for $ 1,250 a month .
The next major line item we ’ll look at is automobile costs .
It is hard to get around California with no car .
With the cost of fuel soaring , we wo n’t be purchasing a Hummer .
But you can get a reliable fuel efficient car for $ 3,000 that will cost no more than $ 133 a month in fuel even with current gas prices .
Where can you find such a deal ?
Once again we ’ll look at Craigslist :
First , you need to realistic about what you can buy .
For our example , we are looking at purchasing a 1993 Toyota Corolla .
You can probably get a 1994 or go with a Honda Civic of the same year and still fall under your $ 3,000 budget .
These cars if you go with the manual version will get you 35 miles per gallon .
You are almost getting the efficiency of a hybrid !
Plus , if the car is well maintained these things will last you forever .
Let us assume you drive to work 15 miles each way .
So you put in 30 miles per day 5 times a week .
We ’ll give you the same for weekend driving :
7 x 30 miles per day = 210 miles per week x 52 weeks = 10,920 miles per year
Monthly miles 10,920 / 12 = 910 miles per month
910 miles per month / 35 miles per gallon = 26 gallons of gas needed
Cost per gallon $ 4.25 x 26 = $ 110.50
We ’ll give you another $ 23 bucks in your budget in case you took a longer trip or added a few additional miles .
Or , if prices go up , you have a bit of a cushion up until gas hits $ 5.11 a gallon which is still a distance away .
Liability insurance on these cars is minimal and if you have a good driving record , you can get by with $ 30 a month .
So now we covered two big line items , your transportation and your housing .
Eating is another major item .
With $ 400 you can feed yourself well for a month .
Here in California we are fortunate enough to have regional markets that compete with your common supermarkets .
What you ’ll find in these regional markets is that produce is nearly 40 to 60 % cheaper than your common chain markets .
Also , you will find better deals on meats .
So this is where you will do your shopping .
For items like toothbrushes which can go for $ 6 at a pharmacy store or supermarket , you can go to the 99 Cent store and get a couple .
You will also find that these dollar stores carry many items that you ’ll need around your house like tools , cleaning supplies , and snacks .
These snacks ( like yogurts and nutrition bars ) can be part of your brown bag lunch .
For breakfast which you should n’t skip , you can have a nutritious cereal with fruit or buy some whole grain waffles for the go .
You can make sandwiches for lunch with some chips and fruit and you ’re good to go .
For dinner , with the produce and meat you can make yourself a solid dinner .
Listen , you are n’t going to eat Lobster each night but you are n’t eating Top Ramen either .
This is doable if you know how to manage your budget .
Most phone companies are trying to sucker people in trying to have them keep their land lines .
They ’ll do package deals with DSL or cable which make no sense .
You can request to have “ naked DSL ” which is strictly DSL alone .
Many companies provide this and you ’ll find reasonable rates where $ 25 per month will keep you connected to the internet .
For phone service you are going to have a pre-paid service with Virgin Mobile or T - Mobile which can be as cheap as $ 10 per month .
Places like Virgin Mobile require you to “ top - off ” your account each few months but is much cheaper than say going with an iPhone and running yourself down $ 100 for the service .
With one month of iPhone service you can pay for nearly a year of pre-paid service with Virgin Mobile .
Again , it is learning to control your spending here .
Many apartments will pay for your trash and water service .
Electric will be minimal in most cases since our weather in California is perfect nearly year round .
If you must , by a fan or go outside .
That is after all why you live in California !
We ’ve even provided a line item for clothes .
Places like Ross and even Old Navy , provide quality clothes at discount prices .
You are not going to be shopping at Macys or Nordstrom ’s so get used to it !
But it does n’t mean you have to look poor either .
With $ 100 for entertainment you have some leeway for what you want to do here .
You can go to a few movies a month , eat out a couple of times , or even take a nice camping trip .
There are many places in Southern California that are actually free and great .
You can go to the Getty ( free ) or go to the great beaches ( free as well ) .
With this budget , we also have n’t forgotten saving for retirement and also building an emergency fund .
We are putting away $ 250 a month into a Roth IRA since many people that are making $ 11 an hour do n’t have options of saving with their company or employer .
If you do , this would be preferable since it is taken out before taxes and will increase your take home pay a bit .
It is important to remember that you will need to set something aside for your protection down the road .
With your emergency fund , you will save $ 300 per month in an ING or Emigrant Direct account .
There are other online saving accounts but these places have strong balance sheets and are n’t at risk of going belly up like some institutions here in California .
After 1 year , you will have approximately 1.5 months of living expenses saved and after 2 years , you will have 3 months saved .
Given that you are also saving in your IRA you should have a minor safety cushion after 2 years .
Again , we are emphasizing minimalism here .
This budget is put together from personal experience .
I know how hard it is to live in California on a tight budget .
Any starving college student will tell you this !
In fact , many families are living this on a daily basis .
The purpose of this article is to offer at least some hope that you can make it on a lower income .
There are ways and resources free of charge that are available to you in helping you reach some form of financial stability .
This article is n’t intended to cover every unforeseen circumstances since life itself is unpredictable but it should give you a blue print of living life on a tight budget and not feeling like you have to go into more and more debt .
Of course to move higher , most likely you will need to further yourself via an education and fortunately through the community college system and our state schools , education is still relatively affordable and there is financial aid .
Knowledge is power and given the hard economic times , regardless of your income you should feel in control of your life .

Three of the last surviving veterans of the First World War joined serving soldiers in current conflicts today to mark the 90th anniversary of the day peace returned to Europe .
Henry Allingham , 112 , Harry Patch , 110 , and Bill Stone , 108 , led the nation as it remembered the sacrifices made by the 1914 - 1918 generation .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
All three men laid wreaths at the Cenotaph in central London to commemorate Armistice Day .
The men each represented the armed service they belonged to - the Royal Air Force for Mr Allingham , the Army for Mr Patch and the Royal Navy for Mr Stone .
Heroes of today 's armed forces accompanied the three men to the Cenotaph - Marine Mkhuseli Jones ( Military Cross ) , Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry ( Victoria Cross ) and Flight Lieutenant Michelle Goodman ( Distinguished Flying Cross ) .
They were joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Defence Secretary John Hutton , the Duchess of Gloucester and thousands of members of the public .
This will almost certainly be the last significant anniversary that any of those who fought in the First World War will mark .
Of the five million men and women who served in Britain 's armed forces in the war , only four are still alive .
The other surviving veteran , Claude Choules , 107 , lives in Australia and will mark the 90th anniversary at local events there .
Last Tuesday , Sydney Lucas , originally from Leicester , who was just 17 when he was conscripted as a soldier with the Sherwood Foresters regiment , died in Australia aged 108 .

Mr Patch was a machine - gunner in the Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry and fought during the Battle of Passchendaele in Ypres , which claimed the lives of more than 70,000 soldiers .
He served in the trenches as a private from June to September 1917 .
Before the ceremony he said : " I am very happy to be here today .
It is not just an honour for me but for an entire generation .
It is important to remember the dead from both sides of the conflict .
Irrespective of the uniforms we wore , we were all victims . "
Mr Stone said : " I shall never forget it .
I was one of the lucky ones and I 'm thankful for that .
" Of course they should be remembered .
If it was n't for them ( those who died ) we would n't be here . "
He said he would spend the day " thinking of all those who are gone .
We must not forget them " .
Mr Allingham said : " I 'm glad to be here .
It means a lot to me .
I hope people realise what my pals sacrificed on their behalf .
" May they never be forgotten .
I can't describe what they mean to me . "
Mr Hutton said : " The First World War devastated a generation of men and women and left an indelible mark on the 20th century .
" Today , as we commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Armistice , the actual events of the First World War will have long since faded from common memory .
However , it is important for us to remember the sacrifices that were made by that brave generation and try to repay the debt of gratitude that we all owe them . "
The three veterans led a two - minute silence on the stroke of 11 am as the nation stopped to mark the moment - the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month - in 1918 that the war ended .
Afterwards , Mr Brown was meeting the veterans at a reception in Downing Street .
In addition to the service at the Cenotaph , a simultaneous ceremony was held at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire .
In Dorset , a new war memorial in Bovington , commemorating soldiers of the Household Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps who have died on active service since 1945 , was being dedicated .
And in France the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were the guests of honour of President Nicolas Sarkozy .

Honey bees on cocaine dance more , a finding that sheds light on bee language
12/23/2008
Diana Yates , Life Sciences Editor
217-333-5802 ; diya@illinois.edu
YouTube video clip from PBS " Nature " series featuring an inside look at a honeybee hive , including the labors of the queen , worker bees and drones , and remarkable close - up footage of the honeybee 's " waggle dance , " a method of providing directions to a pollen source that is the only known symbolic language existing outside of humans and lower primates .
CHAMPAIGN , Ill . —
In a study that challenges current ideas about the insect brain , researchers have found that honey bees on cocaine tend to exaggerate .
Normally , foraging honey bees alert their comrades to potential food sources only when they ’ve found high quality nectar or pollen , and only when the hive is in need .
They do this by performing a dance , called a “ round ” or “ waggle ” dance , on a specialized “ dance floor ” in the hive .
The dance gives specific instructions that help the other bees find the food .
Foraging honey bees on cocaine are more likely to dance , regardless of the quality of the food they ’ve found or the status of the hive , the authors of the study report .
The findings , detailed this month in the Journal of Experimental Biology , shed new light on the famous honey bee dance language , said University of Illinois entomology and neuroscience professor Gene Robinson , who led the study .
The research also supports the idea that in certain circumstances , honey bees , like humans , are motivated by feelings of reward .
“ The honey bee dance is this incredibly complex set of activities , ” Robinson said .
“ It ’s a very integrated communication system , very elaborate and very elegant , one of the seven wonders of the animal behavior world . ”
Click photo to enlarge Photo by L. Brian Stauffer Entomology and neuroscience professor Gene Robinson and his colleagues believe their results support the idea that there is a reward system in the insect brain , something that has never before been shown .
The dance is also an important tool for understanding social behavior in animals – in particular altruism , the “ social glue ” in all societies , including our own , he said .
Robinson ’s interest in the waggle dance led him to study octopamine , a neurochemical known to be important to insect behavior – particularly in regard to movement and eating .
“ A variety of solitary insects respond to treatment with octopamine by eating more , ” he said .
Honey bees do n’t eat more when treated with octopamine , but accept a lower quality of food .
This fact led Robinson to wonder whether octopamine also influenced the waggle dance , a behavior unique to foraging honey bees .
In an earlier study , Robinson found that foragers have higher levels of octopamine in the brain than all other bees in the hive .
In a study published in 2007 , Robinson and his colleagues reported that treatment with octopamine caused foraging honey bees to dance more often .
This indicated that octopamine played a role in honey bee dance behavior .
It also suggested a framework for understanding the evolution of altruistic behavior , Robinson said .
“ The idea behind that study was that maybe this mechanism that structures selfish behavior – eating – was co-opted during social evolution to structure social behavior – that is , altruistic behavior , ” he said .
“ So if you ’re selfish and you ’re jacked up on octopamine , you eat more , but if you ’re altruistic you do n’t eat more but you tell others about it so they can also eat . ”
But it was not even known if insects have a bona fide reward system .
That question led the researchers to study the effects of cocaine on honey bee behavior .
Cocaine – a chemical used by the coca plant to defend itself from leaf - eating insects – interferes with octopamine transit in insect brains and has undeniable effects on reward systems in mammals , including humans .
It does this by affecting the chemically related dopamine system .
Dopamine plays a role in the human ability to predict or respond to pleasure or reward .
It is also important to motor function and modulates many other functions , including cognition , sleep , mood , attention and learning .
One aspect of reward in the human brain involves altruistic behavior , Robinson said .
Thinking about or performing an altruistic act has been found to excite the pleasure centers of the human brain .
“ There are various lines of thought that indicate that one way of structuring society is to have altruistic behavior be pleasurable , ” he said .
Because cocaine causes honey bees to dance more – an altruistic behavior – the researchers believe their results support the idea that there is a reward system in the insect brain , something that has never before been shown .
To determine whether the cocaine was merely causing the bees to move more or to dance at inappropriate times or places , the researchers conducted a second set of experiments .
These tests showed that non-foraging honey bees do n’t dance , even when exposed to cocaine .
They showed that foragers on cocaine do not move more than other bees ( except when dancing ) , and that they do not dance at inappropriate times or in locations other than the dance floor .
The researchers also found that the bees on cocaine do not dance every time they go on a foraging excursion .
And , most important , their dances are not distorted .
“ It ’s not like they ’re gyrating wildly on the dance floor out of control , ” Robinson said .
“ This is a patterned response .
It gives distance information , location information .
That information is intact . ”
In a final experiment that also shows parallels to human behavior , the researchers found that honey bees on cocaine experience withdrawal symptoms when the drug is withheld .
“ This study provides strong support for the idea that bees have a reward system , that it ’s been co-opted and it ’s now involved in a social behavior , which motivates them to tell their hive mates about the food that they ’ve found , ” Robinson said .
The findings also indicate that honey bees are good subjects for substance - abuse research , he said .
The study was supported by a National Institutes of Health Cutting Edge Biological Research Award .

Historians claim Bombardier invented the first snowmobile in 1958 when he bolted a Ford Model T engine to a sleigh .
He was 15 years old at the time , which explains everything .
Bombardier eventually founded the Ski-Doo snowmobile company , and Canada rewarded him for it by pasting his face on a postage stamp .
Snowmobiling has come a long way since .
The International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association says half of all adults in North America want to go snowmobiling and the other half are lying .
There are more than 2 million snowmobiles on the continent , and conservative estimates peg its contribution to the continental economy at a snow dance worthy $ 20 billion .
Also despite the recession and continued efforts by environmentalists to ban the machines from national parks , sales are expected to grow in 2009 .
Snowmobile clubs and councils are all over the place , and snowmobile shows are gaining huge popularity .
At these shows , like any other bike rally or car show , snowmobile enthusiasts gather to showoff their pimped out rides .
These people will stop just short of slapping a tread and a pair of skis on a baby carriage .
After the jump you ’ll get the idea .
The Nytro
The Custom Sled Shop , located in Sharon , Ontario , is the maker of this Yamaha Nytro and like the West Coast Choppers of snowmobiling .
" Putting together a custom sled is not about who is fastest or who has spent the most money .
It 's about being different , " says The Custom Sled Shop 's John Bradley .
The Nytro we think is more about kick ass seeing as how its equipped with a nitro turbo GT - 25 good for 260 hp .

Mr. T
It does n't get much better than doing donuts on an snow covered parking lot in a Model T Ford .
Bombardier would be proud .
And apparently such a thing is an annual occurrence for The Model T Snowmobile Club .
The club formed in 2000 and has members all over the world .
All that 's required for membership is a snowmobile ( vintage 1908 ) and a hankering for hot dogging .

Ski-Doobie Doobie Doo
" You 're either born with snowmobiling in your blood , or your not , " says Allen Mangun of Timbersled of Sandpoint , Idaho .
Mangun put this 260 hp Ski-Doo together a few years ago .
Ski -Doos do n't have a whole lot of " pimping out " potential ( a stock Ski- Doo is already a good sled ) , but we consider this one a fine looking piece of machinery .

The Super Snova
This boat of a sled was originally put together by Scott Windle from Cedar City , Utah .
The Nova 's 400 - cu.in. small - block V8 roles the three one - ton axles equipped with what looks like M1 Abrams tank treads .
Windle told novaresource.com he put over 1000 hours into the fabrication of this snow beast on wheels .
He also says it runs well and that it can handle a 10 foot snowdrift at 45 mph .
You can't guess what we would do for ten minutes behind the wheel of this thing on the streets of New York City in February * .

It 's Electric
The McGill Electric Snowmobile won The Clean Snowmobile Challenge of Houghton , Michigan in 2001 .
The project according to Professor Peter Radziszewski has been up and running ever since .
The electric sled only weighs 500 lbs and can reach speeds of up to 45 mph .
Students from McGill University located in Montreal designed the Electric Snowmobile in class as a group project .
They used a standard chassis and manufactured whatever parts they could .

The Metro Sled
This classy sled is a so called " Saskatchewan - ized " Nash Metropolitan ' 57 rear mounted on a Yamaha '98 three cylinder 700 SRX snowmobile engine , twin Ski - doo suspensions and twin Polaris tracks .
We 're not sure why there is a spare tire tacked on to the back of this automosled and love the two tone red and white paint job –very Christmassy .
We can totally see Santa giving Mrs. Clause the joyride of her life while on the North Pole and behind the wheel of this bad boy .

The Lion of the North
Artic Enterprises built the King Kat with a four - cylinder 800 cc Kawasaki two - stroke way back in 1971 .
These rare snow felines of monstrous proportions were not meant for trail riding by any stretch of the imagination .
Cornering is hardly an option , but who cares .
The front skis barely touch the ground at full throttle , and you used to have to have racing credentials to buy one .

The numbers on homes in one Worcestershire street appear to defy logic and have been described as an " accident of history " .
Some councils have also banned the number 13 because many people believe it to be unlucky and refuse to buy houses of that number .
Richard Westcott reports from Bewdley .
A spokesman from Guinness World Records said a ginger cat called Spike was the last feline to hold the title of UK 's oldest cat but since he died in 2001 , there had been no further record holder .
He encouraged Mr and Mrs Thorne to get in contact with Guinness World Records .
Two centuries on , a salute to Charles Darwin : Hero for our age
As the world faces an uncertain future , Britain 's leading anthropologist toasts Darwin , born 200 years ago , for identifying adaptability as man 's greatest asset
Charles Darwin :
His observations undermined the traditionally held view of ' stability of species '
There is a strange object sitting on my desk as I write .
It is a shiny sphere of fossilised , primeval slime .
Known technically as stromatolites , this blue - green slime was the original ooze from which all life on this planet evolved .
This painfully slow process began about 3,000 million years ago and has led , ultimately , to us , the extraordinary human species .
Whenever my gaze happens to fall upon my lump of fossilised slime I experience a strange sensation , a deep respect , for I am looking at my most ancient ancestor .
Yours , too , unless you still believe in the tale of Adam and Eve and a talking serpent in the Garden of Eden .
In a few weeks , on February 12 to be exact , the scientific world will be celebrating the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin , the man whose theory of the gradual evolution of living things has changed the way in which most of us see the world in which we live .
Thanks to him , we see ourselves as part of nature , instead of separate from it and superior to it .
If it were n't for him , we would not be concerned about the way we have , in our arrogant past , ravaged the small planet on which we live .
What kind of a man was Charles Darwin ?
To the naive mind he is sometimes pictured as a giant intellect of Victorian England , with his long , flowing white beard and his solemn expression , the product of a brilliantly studious education and intense academic application .
Well , no .
In reality he was a mess , both physically and mentally , which makes his gigantic contribution to human understanding even more extraordinary .
He was the son of a sickly mother who died when he was eight .
Her lack of impact on him is clear when , as an adult , he wrote a letter of condolence to a grieving friend that opened with the remarkable statement : ' Never in my life having lost one near relation , I dare say I cannot imagine how severe grief such as yours must be .'
Darwin ( inset ) and an artist 's impression of the Beagle , the ship which took him to all parts of the world
His father , a doctor , was a giant of a man , weighing more than 24 stone and capable of cutting sarcasm and tyrannically enforced views .
He had been disappointed by his son's failure to do well at school , an education that Charles later described as ' simply a blank ' .
The young Darwin had instead taken great pleasure in collecting shells and watching birds in his spare time , but his father decided his son must attend Edinburgh University to study medicine and follow in his own footsteps .
Charles found the lectures there either ' awful ' or ' dull ' , but was too scared of his father to tell him that he did not wish to become a physician .
After two years his exasperated father gave up this attempt , stating that Charles was ' doing no good ' at his studies .
Unassuming beginnings
Instead the old man decided his son should become a clergyman and must go to Cambridge to read for Holy Orders .
This was an even bigger failure .
Charles later wrote : ' My time there was wasted - as completely as at Edinburgh and at school . '
He fell in with a dissipated sporting set and spent a great deal of time in the countryside on shooting trips .
Luckily , one of Charles 's teachers at Cambridge had spotted the young man 's interest in field studies and recommended him for the unpaid role as naturalist on board the Beagle , a ship that was about to set off to explore the world .
His father refused , forcing Charles to turn down the offer , but a supportive uncle intervened and in December 1831 the Beagle sailed with Darwin on board .
Desmond Morris 's interest in evolution was inspired by his hero , Darwin .
This photo is from the 1950s
The rest , as they say , is history .
Away from has father 's domineering presence and from failed attempts to embrace medicine or theology , Charles was at last in his element .
He described the first day on the Beagle as ' a birthday for the rest of my life ' .
He spent the next five years sailing around the world on that small ( only 90 ft long ) ship , collecting specimens wherever he was able to land .
He was astonished at the huge variety of exotic creatures that he encountered , and little by little began to formulate his ideas about their relationships and the way they had managed to adapt to so many environments .
At any interesting landfall he would rise before daylight and often travelled long distances on horseback .
On one occasion he had ridden 80 miles in a burning sun , but commented that he was ' but little fatigued ' .
His health was robust and he often out - stripped his companions when on collecting expeditions .
He was a man on fire with an all - consuming curiosity about the natural world .
He wrote home saying : ' I literally could hardly sleep at night through thinking of my day 's work . '
In 1835 , four years after leaving home , he had travelled all around South America to the Pacific , where he was able to spend four crucial weeks on the Galapagos Islands .
It was there that he first sensed that the traditional idea of the ' stability of species ' - that all animals have always been the way they are now , created by God in some distant past - was being undermined by his observations .
A land iguana in the Galapagos Islands
He saw how a variety of birds , apparently with a common ancestor , had adapted to the slightly different conditions on each of the Galapagos Islands .
This was the moment when the concept of evolution by natural selection first began to form in the mind of the young Charles Darwin - who was still only in his mid-20s .
It would take nearly a quarter of a century before it would see the light of day in his book The Origin Of Species .
After five years away , in 1836 the Beagle returned home to England .
Despite his fear that a wife would mean a ' terrible waste of time ' because of the need for socialising , Charles was soon married and , significantly , within a few months of his wedding was already complaining about being too tired to go out to parties .
An honest , objective observer
The third phase of his life was about to begin , and how different it would be - a long period of almost constant illness accompanied by slow , painstaking work on his many scientific investigations .
For much of the rest of his life he was a walking textbook of stress symptoms .
He suffered from sweating hands , heart palpitations , a swimming head , swoonings , flatulence , gastric pains , vomiting , boils , chronic anxiety , fits of depression , panic attacks and hyperventilation .
On bad days he would lie on his sofa for hours , groaning and grumbling .
After 30 years of robust , vigorous good health , this change was bizarre and has led to much debate as to its cause .
The author of this essay , Desmond Morris , says Darwin 's contribution to human understanding should be celebrated
Several explanations have been offered .
The first sees him as the victim of a parasitic disease picked up in the tropics , but the symptoms do not quite fit with this idea .
The second sees him simply as a poor physical specimen who inherited his weaknesses .
His mother had been a chronic invalid , his brother , Erasmus , was constantly ill , and he had a grandfather who suffered nervous breakdowns and an uncle who was a depressive .
With relatives like that , he may simply have been following in his family 's footsteps .
The third explanation saw him as being intensely neurotic about his theory of evolution and the devastating impact it would have upon the deeply religious Victorian society in which he lived .
On his travels , he had , almost by accident , been thrust up against an inescapable truth : that life forms had not been rigidly created by God , but had been slowly evolved from ancestral types , forever changing as they competed with one another and adapted to environmental changes .
As an honest , objective observer , he could not allow himself to gloss over this biological truth , even if it meant causing untold outrage among devout Christians of his day .
The mental pressure under which this put him is thought to have caused all the classic stress symptoms from which he suffered for the last 40 or so years of his life .
In other words , he was sick , but his ailments were all the result of his inner emotional conflicts , rather than by some tropical parasites .
Finally , there is the view that he was a malingerer and hypochondriac , using his ailments to give him an excuse to stay shut away in his country house , while the furious debate about his theory of evolution raged elsewhere .
Yes , he was sick , but not as sick as he made out .
This enabled him not only to avoid the public controversy , but to escape the heavy social duties of Victorian life , too , and therefore to have more time to devote to his studies .
Darwin's great - grandson , Randal Keynes , and National History Museum bird curator Jo Cooper examine mockingbirds Darwin brought back to England from the Galapagos Islands
The truth is , he was bitten by some nasty bugs in South America and was probably left with a residue of physical weakness .
Add to that his family background and his understandable horror at the profoundly anti-religious message of his discoveries , and you have the perfect setting for the magnification of his ailments .
And if he found that , to his delight , his condition left him greater time for the solitary scientific studies that meant more to him than anything else , you have a perfect recipe for constant ill - health - a weakened condition that nevertheless allowed him to work for three or four hours most days .
A rare individual
The point is , Charles Darwin was one of those rare individuals who devoted themselves entirely to the pursuit of knowledge , to the detriment of everything else in their lives .
He was , and remains , one of our greatest ever thinkers - a man whose discovery changed the way we see the world .
As a lifelong naturalist myself , he is not only a personal hero but the root from which all my own professional studies stemmed .
Which is why I feel it so important to celebrate the anniversary of his birth - if only because I fear many of his core discoveries are in danger of becoming muddled through the prism of modern spiritualism .
For there are plenty of people today - not all of them religious fundamentalists - who seem to think Darwinian evolution cannot explain why , for the most part , humans are a uniquely civilised species .
After all , they posit , how can Darwinism explain empathy , charity or self - sacrifice ?
How can it explain the ' good deeds ' of humans , whether religious or not ?
With its emphasis on ' the survival of the fittest ' , is n't Darwinism simply an excuse for rampant capitalism and personal greed ?
To answer this attack , we need to take a closer look at the biology of our species .
In our ancient past , when we were evolving as a tribal species , the competition between individuals had to be tempered by a greatly increased urge to cooperate with our companions if our tribe was to flourish .
Darwin 's observations led him to formulate his Theory of Evolution - that all creatures , including man , have evolved in their environments over time
By a division of labour and by assisting one another , we also helped ourselves to succeed .
And one of our great survival weapons was our ability to communicate with one another in much greater detail than other species .
When we developed language , we also became greatly interested in symbolism .
The word ' tree ' did not look like a tree or sound like a tree , but it nevertheless conjured up an image of a tree in our minds .
Making one thing stand for another in this way was a habit that spread through all aspects of our lives .
If we feel protective towards a kitten , it is because the little animal acts as a symbol of a human child and stimulates our parental urges .
If a nun sees each human being as one of ' God 's children ' , then she will want to help them all , as though they were real children .
Our good deeds are extensions of our powerful parental feelings , or our inborn urge to co-operate with the members of our tribe .
We are not helpful to one another because of some sophisticated moralising , but because we have evolved that way .
It is as much a part of our animal nature as is our urge to compete with one another .
That is the way we are , and there is no need to introduce the pious teachings of the Church to make us good - it is already in our genes .
Creationists will have none of this , and insist that all of nature is the work of what they now call an ' intelligent designer ' .
If such a being existed , this monstrous designer would have to accept the responsibility for having created all the wonderful life forms we see around us , and then of cruelly inventing countless unspeakable agonies for them in the shape of leprosy , cholera , cancer , syphilis , plague , malaria , AIDS , fevers , parasitic worms and the rest .
What a charmer this designer must be ; creationists are welcome to their hideous creation .
No , Darwinian competition is a much more reassuring scenario .
In this , we will , as a species , devote more and more energy to defeating these viruses , bacteria and other parasites .
Eventually , we will eradicate them .
We will refuse to accept that it is God 's design that we should be made to suffer from these afflictions forever more .
We will do our best to improve our lot on this small planet , and to see ourselves as part of a larger , natural environment .
Then , one day , when a major crisis occurs - a massive epidemic that nearly wipes us all out , or a huge asteroid that strikes Earth - we will be ready to evolve a little further and to survive this disaster because natural selection will be able to find just enough of us who can cope with whatever new environment comes our way .
Sooner or later , inevitably , there will be a gigantic planetary upheaval of some kind and Homo post - sapiens will eventually emerge from the chaos .
Let 's just hope that it turns out to be Homo super - sapiens , and not Homo sub-sapiens .
Ryan Whitney had been back in the U.S. less than two months when he received an urgent call from Geekcorps .
The nonprofit service agency wanted him to travel to Cape Town to help a consortium of African universities develop and promote open - source software .
Although Whitney had just spent nine months backpacking through Central America , he leapt at the chance to return to foreign soil .
Whitney is n't some rudderless techie with time to kill .
Before hitting the road , he had been earning six figures as an independent IT contractor , but he could n't shake the feeling that something was missing in his career .
" Over the last couple of years , I realized that technology was n't the problem ; I just had the wrong job , " Whitney says .
He called it quits in the summer of 2007 and enlisted with Geekcorps .
" Geekcorps was an opportunity to do some good with my skills , " he explains .
Whitney is just one of a growing number of seasoned IT professionals trading in annual bonuses and executive perks to volunteer their time and expertise in developing countries .
In fact , phone calls and e-mails from techies interested in registering with Geekcorps have increased 30 % over the past year , says Karen Muir .
" We have more geeks now than we have projects , " she admits .
Muir is senior director of program development at Geekcorps ' parent organization , the International Executive Service Corps .
Geekcorps itself is a nonprofit that sends highly skilled IT professionals to developing countries to assist in computer infrastructure development projects .
It 's one of a number of nonprofits such as NetHope , Engineers Without Borders and ACDI / VOCA that send teams of techies around the world for two to 12 months to offer technology training and resources -- for free .
Corporate Cooperation
But nonprofit organizations are n't the only facilitators of volunteer activity .
Although the turn - of - the - millennium 's dot - com bust drove yesterday 's techies into the arms of nonprofits , and today 's economy may have the same effect , healthy companies have also been supporting volunteerism .
" Companies now have a renewed sense of giving employees the flexibility to do volunteer work , " says Muir .
For example , earlier this year , IBM launched a program called Corporate Service Corps to send 100 employees to Romania , Turkey , Vietnam , the Philippines , Ghana and Tanzania to work on projects that combine economic development and IT .
And the response was impressive : More than 5,000 employees applied to participate .
Such programs mark a significant shift in the way some companies view volunteerism , and they 're not only facilitating humanitarian efforts , but also helping IT professionals discover a previously untapped job market .
Just ask Steve Ollis , a former IT project manager and consultant .
His overseas volunteer experience includes analyzing the financial systems of a farmers savings and credit cooperative in rural Kenya for ACDI / VOCA and helping the consortium of African universities that Whitney assisted through Geekcorps .
" I was looking for an adventure , " says Ollis .
" If I was working as hard as I was , I wanted to be working for something that had more meaning than just making money . "
Shortly after completing his two - month stint with Geekcorps last year , Ollis landed an IT management position with a nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) specializing in international health care .
Now stationed in Tanzania , he says he never would have qualified for the job without his overseas volunteer experience .
Whitney , too , has been able to parlay his volunteer experience into full - time employment with an NGO .
He 's now a technical program manager with the Grameen Foundation , where he 's building an open - source software system in Tunisia to help microfinance institutions fight global poverty .
Into the Mainstream
High - tech positions with a social agenda , such as those available through NGOs , are becoming an increasingly mainstream option for skilled IT professionals .
That certainly holds true for Edward Granger - Happ .
Granger - Happ is chief technology officer at the nonprofit organization Save the Children and a co-founder of NetHope , a consortium of 22 international nonprofits focused on communications technology and collaboration .
" Most of us that are working in IT in nonprofit organizations can double our income by going elsewhere , " he says .
" But there comes a point when the next dollar is n't worth it . "
In fact , corporations are facing increasing competition from NGOs in the IT talent market , particularly as a labor shortage looms .
In a 2006 study by communications agency Cone LLC , 79 % of the 1,800 13 - to - 25 - year - olds surveyed said they wanted to work for a company that cares about how it affects and contributes to society .
And 69 % of survey respondents with jobs said they were aware of the extent to which their employers were committed to social and environmental causes .
Many large companies have risen to the challenge by rolling out in - house volunteer programs and granting employees ' requests to work with organizations such as Geekcorps .
Leading IT companies , including Microsoft , Hewlett - Packard and Cisco , have loaned employees to the popular nonprofit .
" Companies are starting to realize that they do n't just have a financial responsibility but a social responsibility as well , " says Whitney .
" There 's more to being a corporation than making money . "
Of course , corporate intentions are n't entirely altruistic .
A growing number of companies now view overseas volunteer work as an experience that can deliver value to enterprise IT teams .
In fact , in an April 2008 Deloitte LLP study ( PDF ) of 250 human resources leaders , 91 % of the respondents said that they agreed that skills - based volunteering ( which involves lending business knowledge and experience to nonprofits ) would add value to training and development programs by fostering employees ' leadership skills .
Clement Marcellus was willing to take a chance on that proposition .
Marcellus is practice area leader at IBM Global Business Services .
Earlier this year , he approved employee Scott Jenkins ' request to spend two months in Bamako , Mali , working with fellow Geekcorps volunteers building radio stations and training local people to maintain them .
" We really encouraged Scott to volunteer overseas , but it 's a two - way street .
These volunteers are also bringing back a lot into IBM 's own IT environment , " says Marcellus .
Nearly 70 % of IBM 's IT projects involve " a mix of talent , languages and culture , " he adds -- and they can only benefit from the experiences of a well - traveled technology pro .
Off the Track
Temporarily abandoning the rat race to work in a developing country may no longer be considered a blot on an IT professional 's résumé , but not all employers support the concept .
" Sometimes people read [ about overseas volunteer work ] and think it 's the coolest thing in the world .
Other people have a closed - minded view and see volunteering as a less ambitious goal , " says Jenkins , now an associate partner in the application innovation services practice within IBM Global Business Services .
Recruiters are n't completely sold on the idea either .
According to Andy Steinem , CEO of executive search firm Dahl - Morrow International , volunteering may " show strength and the capacity to be flexible , " but " potential employers want to know why you were on the fast track and all of a sudden took yourself off . "
John Estes , vice president of strategic alliances at staffing firm Robert Half Technology , warns that although volunteering can enhance a CV , too much of it raises a red flag .
" If I saw a résumé that was dotted with a lot of volunteer work , I 'd question how money - motivated they are , " he says .
" Employers want people to jump in and earn bonus money . "
Turning off potential employers is n't the only risk techies face when they choose to volunteer in developing countries .
Temporarily moving from a well - oiled , state - of - the art IT environment to a makeshift tech shop in rural Kenya can result in culture shock .
" In the U.S. , we complain about network speeds and computers that do n't work .
But when you 're working in a rural setting in Africa , you 're happy if you have electric power , " says Ollis .
And then there 's the difficulty of reacclimating after spending months abroad .
" It 's very hard to travel to a developing country for any length of time and not be affected .
Reverse culture shock is very common , " says Muir .
But it 's a danger that more and more techies are willing to face as personal enrichment -- not just riches -- takes center stage in some IT careers .

Regular visitors of Wikipedia have become so familiar with the standard fundraising banner at the top of the page that they 've practically become blind to it , but Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has mixed things up by replacing it recently with a personal plea for donations .
Wales ' appeal has triggered renewed discussion about the site and its ability to sustain itself without advertising , while many remain skeptical about the severity of the situation .
In his letter to Wikipedia readers , Wales notes that the Wikimedia Foundation has a relatively small staff ( 23 members ) and that all of its content is free .
He says that donations help the organization cover the increasing cost of bandwidth and help improve the site 's software .
" Like a national park or a school , we do n't believe advertising should have a place in Wikipedia .
We want to keep it free and strong , but we need the support of thousands of people like you , " reads the letter .
Wikipedia visitors are presented with this banner when visiting the site Wikipedia visitors are presented with this banner when visiting the site
Wales ' appeal has been compared to a PBS pledge drive — annoying at best , unnecessary at worst .
Critics have long suggested that Wikipedia simply give up harassing its members with endless donation requests and turn to the ad - based revenue model that supports many other sites that offer free content to users , but Wikipedia has so far been adamantly against this option .
Not that an ad model would somehow automatically solve Wikipedia 's funding issues .
Companies like YouTube have had serious trouble trying to monetize user - generated content through advertising , and it's not hard to see why ; what big - time brand wants to take a chance on appearing above unvetted and potentially libelous entries that could , at any moment , have key words replaced by terms for genitalia ?
Former Wikimedia employee Danny Wool publicly criticized Wikipedia 's constant donation drive on his blog last month by saying the organization is incredibly bloated and inefficient .
He points out that Wikipedia once accepted numerous tiny donations ( á la the Obama campaign — every little bit counts ) but now has a suggested minimum of $ 30 .
" As for Administrative expenses , should a charity that lives on $ 6 million be paying bloated salaries to the ED and her office , i.e. , 8 percent of the budget ? "
Wool wrote .
" Is that what people should be donating to support ?
Please donate to Wikipedia , so that [ executive director ]
Sue Gardner can be among the elite few whom Obama admits he will raise their taxes ?
No wonder the WMF does n't want the small donations any more . "
Additionally , Wikipedia 's own volunteer administrators and editors have had a strong negative reaction to the donation banners .
Some have argued that they do all the work for free already , so what 's with the increasing operating expenses — $ 6 million this year , up from $ 3.5 million last year ?
Others try to find ways to hide the Wales appeal from appearing on the site at all .
Wales , on the other hand , feels that the accusations of bloat are a bit much .
" We are an astoundingly effective charity with a tiny budget , " Wales told Ars .
" The idea that our budget is ' bloated ' is ludicrous - we run the 4th most popular website in the world for $ 6 million a year . "
On top of it all , some critics are still jaded over incidents that surfaced earlier this year in relation to Wikipedia and Jimmy wales .
Former Novell scientist and Wikipedia donor Jeff Merkey issued a statement earlier this year essentially accusing Wales of extortion — he claims Wales offered him " special protection " for his Wikipedia entry " in exchange for a substantial donation and other financial support of the Wikimedia Foundation projects . "
This is , of course , not the first or only accusation against Wales related to his editing and protecting of various people 's entries in exchange for certain favors — just do a Google search for " rachel marsden " + " jimmy wales " to get enough gossip to fuel the National Enquirer for months .
( Keep in mind that Merkey has a reputation of his own as well .
Jimmy Wales denies any wrongdoing in all of these supposed incidents . )
Still , the site is a unique worldwide phenomenon , and turning it into yet another place for advertisers to hawk their wares would certainly alter the feel of the wild but noncommercial encyclopedia .
A screen capture of the offending Web page from McAfee 's virus directory
Reports circulated today about a virulent piece of malware making its way around Facebook , a major hub of the social Web with 120 million users .
Because of its walled - off internal e-mail system , Facebook has long been a tough target for spammers and other fraudsters , but the " Koobface " virus is a sign that the relative viral calm on the site -- which just today announced an ambitious program to extend its services outside its own tight perimeter -- may have been a luxury .
The virus ' most insidious property is that users receive the offending message from a friend :
On Facebook , only people whom users have explicitly approved as friends can send them e-mails .
The Koobface e-mails have a subject like " You look so amazing funny on our new video , " and contain a link to a YouTube - like video site that appears to contain a movie clip ( see image ) .
The video , however , does n't play , and the website then asks the user to update his or her video software by downloading a file .
It 's that file that contains the malicious code .
" Unfortunately , users are very trusting of messages left by ' friends ' on social networking sites .
So the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high , " said Alexander Gostev , a security analyst at Kaspersky Lab , in a several - month - old blog entry about the virus .
" At the beginning of 2008 we predicted that we'd see an increase in cyber - criminals exploiting MySpace , Facebook and similar sites , and we 're now seeing evidence of this . "
A variant of the Koobface virus was reportedly circulating on MySpace earlier this year but was eliminated after new security measures were put in place .
Facebook has posted limited instructions about how to remove the virus on its security page :
In essence , users should install one of several available anti-virus programs , and be sure to change their Facebook password here .
UPDATE : Here are some more detailed instructions Facebook evidently sent to users whose accounts may have been compromised :
We have detected suspicious activity on your Facebook account and have reset your password as a security precaution .
It is possible that malicious software was downloaded to your computer or that your password was stolen by a phishing website designed to look like Facebook .
Please carefully follow the steps provided : 1 . Run Anti-Virus Software :
If your computer has been infected with a virus or with malware , you will need to run anti-virus software to remove these harmful programs and keep your information secure .
For Microsoft : http://www.microsoft.com/protect/viruses/xp/av.mspx
http://www.microsoft.com/protect/computer/viruses/default.mspx
Then they had a link for Mac users too but it was broken .
Will update if we get a better one .

Biden has made clear that he does n't expect to run for President again - - one of the few attributes he shares with Cheney .
Biden to shrink VP role — big time
Joe Biden is laying plans to significantly shrink the role of the vice presidency in Barack Obama ’s White House , according to an official familiar with his thinking .
It ’s not just that Biden wo n’t sit in on Senate Democrats ’ weekly caucus meetings – a privilege Republicans afforded outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney .
He wo n’t have an office outside the House floor , as House Speaker Dennis Hastert gave Cheney early on .

Biden will not begin every day with his own intelligence briefing before sitting in on the president ’s .
He will not always be the last person Obama speaks to before making a decision .
He also will not , as a transition official calls it , operate a “ shadow government ” within an Obama administration .
One of the few ways he will resemble Cheney is in making clear his future ambitions , or lack thereof : Biden does n’t expect to run for president after leaving the vice presidency , according to a transition source who was not authorized to speak on the record .
“ What he has said previously is that Vice President Cheney had an overly expansive view of the vice president , almost created like a shadow government inside the White House , " said the transition official familiar with Biden 's role .
" Vice President - elect Biden has a very strong view that the vice president ’s role is to be an adviser to the president and to be a member of the president ’s team , and that ’s how he ’s going to be in the job . ”

A tale of two vice presidencies
Cheney made clear he had no intention of succeeding President George W. Bush , which along with his expanded role contributed to his almost unparalleled freedom to act – pushing controversial positions on torture , energy policy and Iraq , knowing he’d be spared facing voters to explain his actions .
But Cheney also had Bush , who gave his more seasoned No. 2 broad sway – with a particular emphasis on foreign policy , where Cheney already had a well - established portfolio as a former defense secretary during the Gulf War .
Obama has shown no inclination to do the same for Biden .
In fact , Biden ’s goal of restoring the office to its “ traditional role ” is something he and Obama agreed on before the Delaware senator was named to the Democratic ticket , the transition official said .
As part of that understanding , Biden is unlikely to have a specific docket of issues .
“ He ’s been very clear about that from the start that he was not going to take a portfolio in particular areas , ” the transition official familiar with Biden ’s role said .
Biden would “ be available widely and broadly to offer his advice on whatever hard questions the president was trying to decide . ”
And even if the vice presidency will have less dominance in the executive office than it has over the past eight years , it ’s a change those close to Biden say he supports .
“ If Joe were unhappy or feeling left out of this thing , I could tell it just by looking at him , ” said Biden 's close friend Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , who added that he was the first person Biden called , after his wife , once Obama asked him to be on the ticket .
“ My sense is that Joe ’s involved in everything and he has n’t been pigeonholed . ”
One area that seems to be shaping up as a Biden emphasis is labor policy .
Thea Lee , assistant director of public policy at AFL - CIO , says she has gotten strong indications from “ various sources ” in the Obama transition that Biden will be a point - person for their concerns .
“ We certainly have gotten that impression , unofficially , ” Lee said .
Biden 's recent selection of Jared Bernstein , a strong labor advocate , as his chief economic adviser further heartened labor .
But even in the transition , Biden is already showing signs he ’ll be different than Cheney .
As vice president - elect , Cheney famously worked multiple cell phones and drafted a list of possible Cabinet appointees – a move that allowed him to salt his allies throughout the Bush administration and expand his reach , particularly at the Pentagon , with Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz .
So far , Biden has offered Obama advice and recommendations for appointees he ’s made so far , but the president - elect ’s cabinet is certainly not stocked with Biden allies .
As vice president , Cheney often took advantage of his standing invitation to attend any meeting in any policy area he wanted , with or without the president .
Biden , too , has an open invitation to attend any meeting .
But it seems he will take a more selective approach .
“ He ’ll attend those meetings where he can be helpful in gathering information and in helping to formulate the advice he ’ll be giving the president , ” the transition official said .
As vice president , Cheney received his own intelligence briefing every day , then sat in on President Bush's .
During the transition , Obama and Biden sometimes take their intelligence briefings together , and sometimes separately .
Cheney would gather a small legal team of staff from the Justice Department and Pentagon to find ways to expand the White House ’s authority .
He advocated the adoption of Bush administration policies , such as establishing guidelines for the use of torture and denying foreign terrorism suspects access to courts .
For Biden , his primary legal advice will come from the counsel he appoints in his office .
In short , Biden will be no Dick Cheney – who redefined the office of the vice presidency to gather unprecedented influence and reach .
Instead , Biden will serve the role of trusted backup , but someone who wo n’t be mistaken for a co-president single - handedly crafting and promoting policy .
Cheney came to the vice presidency with decades of executive experience , in both the executive branch and the private sector , having served as White House chief of staff for President Gerald Ford , House minority whip , secretary of defense under President George H.W. Bush and chairman of the oil services company Halliburton before becoming Bush ’s running mate .
Biden , on the other hand , was a lawyer in Delaware and then a member of the New Castle County Council before spending 36 years in the U.S. Senate .
Cheney gave top - classified intelligence briefings that the president would typically give .
He headed up a group that gave Bush a shortlist for Supreme Court nominees .
Cheney joined the weekly luncheon of Bush ’s economic team , and he seen as the force behind the Bush tax cuts .
He was known to present the president with proposals that would more commonly be the purview of Cabinet members .
Biden recently shared the stage with homeland - security designee Janet Napolitano to be briefed on a report on weapons of mass destruction , a possible hint at how he will operate in office .
One of the more obvious changes in the future vice presidency can be found in Biden and Cheney ’s contrasting personalities .
Cheney 's public persona is as a man of few words and stern gaze , whose trademark penchant for secrecy seemed perfectly embodied in his oft - visited “ undisclosed location ” after 9/11 .
Biden , by contrast , is more pure politician , backslapping his way through union halls and firehouse chicken - and - dumpling dinners .
“ If Joe was going to be there and he was going to speak , they knew they were going to be there for a while , ” said Sam Lathem , president of the Delaware State AFL - CIO .
“ We always had his cell phone number .
We could call him any time we want . ”
Lathem never got Biden ’s new cell phone number .
And when Biden stayed out of the limelight for the first few weeks after the election , it raised speculation that he might be a sidelines vice president .
More recently Biden has re-emerged , and he is scheduled to give his first interview on December 21 with ABC ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopoulos . ”
Those close to Biden say he will be a more town hall - style vice president than Cheney .
He will do more television shows and press availabilities .
He and his wife , Jill , will likely be out promoting their favorite causes , although they will likely still not be part of the Washington social scene .
And in a small shift , Biden has expressed interest in bringing back the Al Gore tradition of hosting an annual Halloween party for the press corps at the vice presidential residence .
Those parties did not continue under Cheney .
Like a lot of Obama supporters , my emotions surrounding this whole campaign have run me so ragged I think I may have lost some weight .
I ’ll leave it there , because I ’m not about to hop on a scale and meet heartbreak face - to - face .
But you get my point .
This thing is not easy to handle without a drink in one hand and a bottle in the other .
It ’s hard to point to any one specific time and say “ That was when it was the worst , ” but I will say that the so - called ‘ bump ’ that came after McCain chose Palin as his vice presidential running mate clearly ranks as one of my all - time whiplash moments .
First I was thrilled to death because I figured McCain had just handed us the election in a gift - wrapped package .
Alaska ’s Gov. Sarah Palin was – and is – so clearly unprepared for the nation ’s highest Number Two slot that it seemed like a slam dunk .
Silly me , allowing myself to forget how many truly stupid people there are in America .
What was I thinking ?
Next thing you know , we start hearing things like how Palin has actually energized the Republican base .
About how much she has added to the ticket .
About how so many more Republicans , particularly the Religious Right , are feeling so much better voting for McCain now that ultra-rightwing religious Sarah Palin is on board .
Her admittedly impressive speech at the Republican Convention was celebrated as if she had turned water into wine , and Obama into a silly afterthought .
A woman who possesses virtually none of the credentials required to be able to take over as President if McCain bites the dust was being re-created into a Republican Joan of Arc , the face of salvation .
To imagine how I was feeling , imagine the Titanic being pulled from the belly of a whale by a triumphant Minnie Mouse .
Some things are just hard to picture .
Then came the Charlie Gibson interview .
Palin was finally , and definitively , exposed for the inch - deep dimwit she is .
Sure , she has some political skills , and she knows how to perform at a podium , but ask her a tough question about how she might handle Russia , and she replies that she can actually see the Big Bad Commie Menace from her doorstep .
Asked about energy issues , and the woman whom McCain described as a formidable energy expert says with a straight face that her state provides 20 percent of America ’s energy supply .
Actually it ’s somewhere around one - tenth that amount , but that ’s OK Sarah .
We know the training wheels have n’t arrived yet .
Meanwhile McCain ’s aides are still trying to mop up that oil spill of a fuck up while stitching her lips shut as best they can .
This would be a wonderful comedy if it were n’t so scary .
The fact that this race is close at all is all the proof anyone should need that America needs to purify the gene pool before the stupidity genes take over and infect the masses .
Obama is such an obviously superior candidate to McCain in so many ways that it ’s almost not fair to McCain .
It ’s like putting a youthful Muhammad Ali in the ring with Donald Duck .
In normal circumstances , all the betting money would be on Ali because most folks figure that anyone who can beat Joe Frazier can probably whup a cartoon duck .
But these are not normal times and this is America .
So then Wall Street went haywire .
It was almost like God was saying , “ What in the hell do I have to do to make you people see ?
What ?
You want another flood ?
WHAT ??? ”
Well , now it finally appears that the Code Red status of the American economy is starting to wake up enough fencewalking voters .
They ’re starting to think maybe , just maybe it ’s time to give the black guy a shot .
Hell , everything is falling apart anyway .
If he screws up , we get to blame the nigger , which is always fun .
And if he succeeds , then , well , what the hell , right ?
Hooray for change and all that good shit .
You know , I ’m trying my best to battle my natural cynical instincts and see the glass as half full .
Honest .
Because I do realize that the mere fact Obama has made it this far is not only historic but mind - boggling in America .
This is something virtually no political ‘ expert ’ would have ever foreseen , which is why all those experts were writing him off for so long in the early days .
It was a cute , energetic , hopeful story , but it just could n’t happen .
But then it did happen .
And so just on that basis alone I should probably be smiling and feeling good about my country because of how far this has come .
And I admit I feel better about America than I have in a long , long time .
That ’s no joke .
But having come this far , I want the whole damned enchilada .
I ’ve already gone through the warm - up routine three times with Shirley Chisolm , Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton .
I believe black folks are plenty warm enough now .
No more advance acts .
Time for the real deal .

Gamasutra's Top 20 Trends of 2008
By Christian Nutt
Last year , we only picked five trends .
This year , we went crazy .
There are so many exciting and relevant changes happening in the game industry right now , it 's difficult to keep abreast of them .
With that in mind , we created a list that covers the breadth of the industry as best as possible -- an industry that is going through a major evolution .
And while we have selected 20 , know that it 's pared down from an initial list of over 40 .
We probably could have thought of many more .
We realize that , especially as the industry expands to encompass everything from casual online games to Facebook applications and support three dedicated consoles and two handheld platforms , there 's too much diversity to make choosing simple .
That said , we have identified and explained -- with relevant links to further information , where possible -- 20 trends that have risen to the level that they cannot be ignored as 2008 draws to a close .
1. The Continued Rise Of Outsourcing
Speak to any number of developers these days about asset generation , and the topic of outsourcing is never far from the discussion .
Some companies , such as Alex Seropian 's Wideload Games and American McGee 's Spicy Horse Games , have built their business models around a " core " team , while using contractors for much of the process .
Whether or not you do , however , it 's becoming increasingly relevant in these cost - cutting times .
Major publishers , like Electronic Arts , Ubisoft , and Konami , among others , maintain their own fully - owned outsourcing studios in China , which primarily handle art requests .
Though it 's most prominent , it 's not just Asian outsourcing that is necessarily the most relevant .
Wideload 's model suggests finding the most talented and experienced practitioners to produce the components of the game .
For example , in the case of Hail to the Chimp , the creators found a firm that had worked on actual news programs to do the game 's faux - newscast motion graphics .
In this sense , it 's as much about talent and relevance as it is about savings , and points to another sign of the " Hollywoodized " future the industry continuingly hints at .
2. Casual MMOs ?
For Kids !
This market , which began under the radar and burst into headlines last year with the $ 350 million plus incentives acquisition of Club Penguin by Disney , continues to maintain its relevance in important ways .
Chief among them : MMO mavens ' firm belief that the kids playing Club Penguin and other kids '
MMOs today will demand services that offer similar ( but improved ) functionality as they outgrow these sites .
When their first taste of the power of social gaming technology is a Disney online world and not a Wii or Xbox 360 , the expectations that drive the industry 's possibilities for online interaction are being set outside of what is often considered the " norm " .
Daniel James , president of casual MMO developer and publisher Three Rings ( Puzzle Pirates ) puts it this way : " People talk about the digital generation or whatever you want to call them ... but I think there is a genuine shift when you have access to something at a young age .
It changes your way of looking at the world . "
With perhaps a glut of cute , original IP , venture - funded kids worlds out there , but a number of major brand - based and consumer - friendly projects ( Fusion Fall from Cartoon Network , Gaia Online 's zOMG ! ) yet to completely launch , it 's a space that 's still rapidly expanding .
3. You Don't Want DRM - You Want Services
As piracy grows ever easier , and as users become more and more vocal about the measures publishers take to try and stop it -- witness the Spore DRM controversy -- the appeal of user - friendly DRM lumped into a subscription service seems like the best solution .
After all , very few players complain about the fact that World of Warcraft is tied to a unique account that costs a constant $ 15 per month fee to keep playable -- because that 's the very point of the game .
But even for games that do n't require online interaction , the tied - to - an - account model can work a charm : Valve 's Steam service is typically extremely well - regarded , thanks to its selection of games , its appealing community features , and most recently , the addition of its Steam Cloud service .
This makes online integration all the more relevant , as user data is stored on servers and accessible on any PC the player logs into .
Surely , providing a tangible benefit for users to tie themselves to a verification system is the way to make to help the copy protection - related medicine go down ?
4. Downloadable Content - A Cure For All Game Ills ?
Whether or not GameStop 's management wants to admit it , many developers and publishers consider the used game market to be , well , less than benevolent .
Whether it should or can be stamped out completely is not the issue ; few would disagree that at least discouraging players from selling games back quickly is a good idea .
One of the best current tools for doing so is downloadable content -- or as Xbox Live group program manager Alvin Gendrano put it at Microsoft 's GameFest this year , " Using [ premium DLC ] we can keep your games being used over a long time .
The longer your users play your titles , the less chance they give those titles away to retailers and sell them for used . "
Moreover , stats Gendrano released suggest that games with strong DLC retain their market value for longer : " Games with PDLC were still selling for $ 59 in [ the second quarter of their release lifespans ] ; those without were selling for $ 56 . "
And Microsoft's Gears of War 2 recently took a new tactic ; it shipped with one - time - use coupon for free DLC that can only be downloaded by the initial purchaser .
Perhaps the boldest mover in this space , however , is EA 's Criterion studio , which has launched the " Year of Paradise " initiative for the company -- its Burnout Paradise , which was first released in January , is still receiving substantive free DLC on a regular basis , with its first paid pack , Big Surf Island , coming approximately one year after the game 's retail release .
5 . The Inevitable User - Created Content Entry
LittleBigPlanet is generally viewed as the watershed moment for user - created content in console games .
It 's true that the game invites and champions it , and has a flexible environment for its creation .
But it 's not the only example , and it 's sure to be far from the final one .
Heck , Microsoft 's XNA Community Games experiment , while flooding its Xbox 360 channel with games that are difficult to sort through at times , at least shows the potential of handing console game creation over to high - level hobbyists -- another win for UCC .
And for conventional retail games , as professional creation of content gets ever more expensive , as the economy worsens , as the YouTube generation comes of age , the need to extend the lifespan and interest of titles continues to grow -- for retention and acquisition reasons .
Can there be any doubt that user - created content will become bigger and bigger ?
With the advent of the form -- big on PCs in one way and another for years -- on consoles in a truly user - friendly , 21st century way , it 's going to drive the direction of the medium as much as any other recent innovation .
6. Indies Go Pro , Pros Go Indie
The murky division between indie and pro developers is getting , well , murkier .
The creativity of indie developers has been recognized for years , but the proliferation of premium download services has made creating these games more financially viable and appealing .
In fact , it 's got to the point that the stars shine bright enough to be pulled into the studio system .
For example , consider thatgamecompany , developers of flOw and Flower , who signed a three - game - deal with Sony .
Mommy's Best Games ' Weapon of Choice
But developers can go the other direction , too .
Insomniac Games ' coder Nathan Fouts decided he wanted out of the LA area and ended up creating Weapon of Choice , one of the most acclaimed games in the Xbox Live Community Games marketplace , self - publishing without Microsoft 's assistance .
In another example , Torpex Games , developer of Schizoid , was founded by two alumni of Activision 's Treyarch studio who decided that striking out as indie developers was more appealing than working on more Spider - Man sequels .
The success of games like Braid and Castle Crashers proves the commercial viability of the proposition ; the flexibility of working from where you want to , how you want to , as Fouts did , proves the creative appeal .
7. New Retro Games + Retro Franchise Reboots = $ $
New IP is tough to make work .
Endless sequels become boring .
Look to the past .
Capcom has taken this tactic to heart , with three standout titles each taking their own angle on the tactic .
Capcom's Mega Man 9
Firstly , there 's the pure approach of Mega Man 9 , which works entirely within the conceptual limitations of the NES - style platform that spawned the first six games in the series .
Then , there 's Super Street Fighter II HD Remix reimagines the classic fighter as a hand - illustrated , more accessible online dream .
Finally , there 's Bionic Commando Rearmed , which uses contemporary technology to remake a die - hard gamer classic that has n't had a fitting followup in 20 years -- in itself a teaser for a more fully - featured franchise reboot due next year .
( Capcom had less interesting examples , too : 1942 and Commando had forgettable installments this year . )
It 's not just Capcom which is taking this tactic -- it 's just the most significant practitioner , with strong classic IP and robust support of download platforms .
With other companies such as Namco Bandai resurrecting Pac - Man and Galaga in enhanced form , and Tecmo Bowl returning on Nintendo DS , existing names that people have nostalgia for , as in many other industries , might be gold .
8. Japan - Insular ?
Obsolete ?
Self - Critical !
Japan is widely perceived as struggling this generation .
Yes , Nintendo is a world - beater .
But core gamers have shifted their tastes to the wares of Western developers .
In fact , very few Japanese - headquartered companies have been able to capitalize on the strong support of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gamers with anything like the reliability that they had in previous generations , or find the success on Nintendo 's platforms that they previously had on Sony's .
This problem is significant enough that Yoichi Wada , president of both Square Enix and Japanese industry group CESA said in October that the Japanese games industry has " lost its position " on the world stage .
The problem is multifaceted , taking in technological , cultural , and audience issues that are difficult to untangle -- or solve .
A walk around the Tokyo Game Show floor this year showed that the response of many developers has been to concentrate on the platforms that are popular in Japan -- Nintendo's -- with games that cater to niches in the market : RPG and simulation titles which de-emphasize action .
Of course , this tactic keeps the developers from gaining the technological expertise or cultural currency to ship products with global appeal ; it 's a vicious cycle that Wada wants to see the Japanese industry break out of .
The most positive sign , though , is that Japanese developers recognize their limitations and how to work within them .
This war will not be won by ignoring these limitations , but by learning to work within them to create titles , like Grasshopper Manufacturer 's No More Heroes , which maintain the unique creative spirit of Japanese development while plumbing themes and gameplay enjoyable by broad audiences .
9. Free To Play , Pay For Items
Throughout 2008 , we saw the further diversification of the MMO model in the West .
While Mythic / EA's Warhammer Online : Age of Reckoning made a strong debut and Blizzard 's World of Warcraft somehow continued to grow , Funcom 's Age of Conan slid from a strong launch into apparent problems , and NCSoft announced the closure of its ambitious and problem - plagued Tabula Rasa .
While it 's tough to draw a direct trend line through these events , the sense is beginning to grow that the MMO market needs a shot in the arm to continue expanding , and one of the major possibilities that is being seriously considered is the adoption of the Korean - pioneered free - to - play , microtransaction - based model in major western - developed and western - targeted titles ; EA 's shooter Battlefield Heroes being an in - development , high profile example .
An ambiguous statement made by EA CEO John Riccitiello during a conference call that seemed to imply that the BioWare MMO , Star Wars : The Old Republic , may have some microtransaction - based content , caused excited murmurs throughout the blogosphere .
Those who have experience with the model , like Nexon VP Min Kim -- who revealed at Austin GDC that his company had pulled in $ 29.334 m in the U.S. in 2007 on the back of free - to - play in youth - oriented titles such as MapleStory -- have plenty of faith in it .
Or as CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar Petursson ( EVE Online ) puts it , " If you are building a pure subscription game you have to think very hard about how you build a meta economy that cannot be turned into a free to play after the fact ... you will always be a victim of people doing what they want to do , and it 's a losing war ... you should n't fight your customers . "
10 . Game Schools Birth Hit-Ready Titles
Game education at universities is n't a new trend -- but it 's interesting to see just how directly these students are transitioning into fully functioning professional teams directly from their educational careers .
Of course , the most famous example is the Narbacular Drop team , hired by Valve out of DigiPen , creating last year 's breakout hit Portal .
Thatgamecompany , of flOw and Flower , of course , arose from USC 's interactive media program .
But these are not the only examples .
Shortfuse Games , an 11 - man team who recently released Colosseum to Xbox Live Community Games , transitioned directly from the game development program at Sweden 's University of Skövde to professional concern with a minimal addition of staff from outside of the program .
The Dream - Build - Play winner , CarneyVale : Showtime , was created at MIT 's GAMBIT lab in Singapore .
Team Gambit's CarneyVale : Showtime
With IP ownership still an issue for some programs , the ability to do this may be difficult for some , but it 's clear that the working relationships fostered over multi- year programs provides for a fertile ground for future collaboration -- and the refinement of ideas that may have their genesis in classroom assignments , but clearly have broader appeal .
11 . Hollywood And Games - Equals ?
Given the cinematic aspirations of so many game developers , it 's surprising that true collaboration between the media has been so rarely seriously attempted or truly achieved .
To oversimplify this saga , let 's simply say that it appeared that until recently , Hollywood talent never took games seriously as a medium , and that , in the context of film - related products , game developers have been too constricted , in general , to provide anything that rises to parity with the film medium .
But recent moves have shown a much more promising light .
Steven Speilberg 's deal with EA resulted not in an overblown cinematic project , but Boom Blox -- a game that truly took advantage of the Wii .
While the fate of next - gen followup LMNO is in flux in the wake of the EA Blueprint closure and EA LA layoffs , EA 's signing of 300 director Zack Snyder to make three original titles makes it seem a little less troubled .
In other promising news , Cory Barlog , formerly of Sony Santa Monica , is working directly with original creator George Miller to bring the Mad Max film franchise to games -- in a much more collaborative way than most license - based projects , judging from his blog .
The long - feted marriage of film and games may finally work .
12 . Peripheral - Based Gaming Blasts Off
The explosion in popularity fostered by Guitar Hero III and Rock Band at the end of 2007 continued into 2008 .
Though analysts once wondered if this year 's editions were selling in sufficient numbers , it appears the trend is n't dead .
Guitar Hero : World Tour , even with an increased peripheral count , has still proven extremely popular -- with almost every version of the game showing up in the NPD top 20 for November 2008 .
But it 's not just music games that benefit from including a peripheral -- Nintendo's non-traditional Wii Fit , complete with Balance Board accessory , has been a runaway global success for the company .
It 's finding traction in the Japanese market , too , where peripheral - based music games are old news and no longer chart .
Recently , Activision even teased that next year 's relaunch for the Tony Hawk series , which has taken a year hiatus in the face of markedly decreased sales for its most recent installment , is one where " you 're not going to be playing this game with a controller in your hands . "
Peripheral - based games sell for more -- and thus make more money than a peripheral - free SKU .
Peripherals are also widely seen a way to make games more understandable for an audience daunted by traditional controllers .
Taking these facts into account , it seems likely that until someone 's burned by an warehouse of unsold Chinese - made plastic , the peripheral fad will continue .
13 . Downloadable Console Games Get Retail - Sized
It 's interesting to note that , at least in 2008 , Microsoft has been hesitant in all but a few cases of allowing full - sized download games on its service .
But Sony has not been so restrictive -- and consequently , has opened its service up to games that push the boundaries .
Thus , we 've seen PS3 re-releases of games that were previously available at retail ( Burnout Paradise ) , those with niche appeal ( NFL Head Coach ) , those which could n't support a retail release but exceed the scope of an average download title ( Wipeout HD ) , and those that are available at retail in other territories but become download - only products in North America ( Siren : Blood Curse ) .
Each of these cases points to an exciting future for the download market on the PlayStation 3 and , as standards inevitably change on the Xbox 360 and advance in further console generations .
We may obviously see a future where games that would previously have gone to retail on discs are now available as downloads .
( Microsoft does currently allow download of Xbox Originals titles on the 360 , despite their prior disc - based nature as Xbox 1 titles -- an important and often overlooked facet of Xbox Live . )
This service , of course , also in full swing with Sony 's PSP as well -- with Echochrome , again , being a download - only title in North America despite being out on disc in Japan and Europe .
This alternate delivery mechanism will , as it has on PC with services like Steam , only continue to gain ground on consoles .
14 . World Vs. WoW - Go Big Or Go Niche ?
We 've already talked about how microtransactions are going to become more significant to the MMO marketplace as time wears on .
But the stratification of the online game market may be an even bigger and more significant trend .
With the triple - A staying power of World of Warcraft the crown jewel in the subscription - based marketplace , the games that compete with are trying one of two things -- a gigantic all - out WoW - rivaling mega product , or an attempt at an entirely different , niche experience or business models .
Nexon 's 2D , anime - inflected MapleStory attracts a younger audience with less cash ; EVE Online maintains a base of hardcore subscribers ; free - to - play Guild Wars makes money on retail expansions and continues to flourish .
Other Asian MMO ports , while lacking in critical mass , can fill the cracks by appealing to niche audiences -- with games that have already been developed .
So sure , there 's still a core of big - budget MMOs going for a direct $ 15 - per- month run against Blizzard .
But those that are there are increasingly using existing IP ( Star Trek Online , Warhammer / Warhammer 40 k ) to stand out .
15 . Procedural Game Narrative - But Do Players Care ?
While a great majority of games continue to use cutscenes to tell their stories , the emergence of significant new narrative forms has given game developers plenty of food for thought in 2008 .
At the forefront of this is perhaps Ubisoft Montreal 's Far Cry 2 , which has an extremely dynamic world , with enemies that help each other to safety when wounded and an incredibly complex fire system , alongside ambitious narrative system that reacts to player actions in its sandbox world by dynamically reassigning dialogue to available actors .
According to the game 's narrative designer , Patrick Redding , " If we had tried to not support that dynamic approach , what we would have ended up with is a story that really felt like it was kind of progressing along more or less independently of player action ...
And we felt there was no point in doing that . "
With all kinds of artful , amazing events dynamically created by the randomness inherent in the game world -- such as bounding African fauna causing enemies to crash their vehicles -- it creates an expansion that 's new and different almost every time .
But as the game underperformed at retail , a question that probably needs asking is -- do players really want a living world , or do they just want scripted events that convince them they are playing in one ?
16 . Retail Games & The Six Week Problem
While there 's debate about how long games have to make an impact on store shelves before being pushed aside by bigger , shinier , and newer releases , six weeks has been thrown around as a rule of thumb .
It 's a problem .
We 're currently in the midst , as of this writing , of a retail season so choked with high - quality releases that it 's difficult for any company to feel confident about its success in the face of all the competition .
And the stakes are getting higher all the time , as higher - end development continues to increase in cost and the shelves are filled with more and more competition .
The solutions to the problem seem to lie in some of the related trends we 've already been discussing .
Robust downloadable content is vital so that people may return to consider buying the title , months after it first debuted -- something that seems to have been working with Burnout Paradise .
EA / Criterion 's Burnout Paradise
But it may be that a robust online community to build buzz before a game 's release is the ultimate arbiter of its long - term sales -- especially if it 's less of an evergreen product such as the Carnival Games - style titles which will sell long - term to new console buyers , whatever .
A unique proposition plus a robust fanbase equals a long - term winner .
17 . The Rise Of Non-Games
One of the most successful games of 2008 is n't really a game at all .
Nintendo's Wii Fit is an exercise program with game - like elements -- an accessible bit of exercise software that is peppered with clever game design that makes it compelling .
Users go into the package expecting not a game , but a piece of software that will help them live healthier lives .
Nintendo is n't alone here .
Ubisoft 's My Coach series helps users with everything from Japanese language study to smoking cessation .
Announced last year , the series has already blossomed into three different branches -- learning , language , and lifestyle -- on two platforms , Wii and DS .
Of course , Brain Age is the granddaddy of them all .
Niches can also be filled -- as with XSEED and AQ Interactive 's impressive Korg DS - 10 synthesizer and sequencer software , developed in cooperation with the long - established Korg instrument company .
There 's plenty of potential here , and an audience who simply want interactive information , and are hungry for new challenges .
Thus , this is a market that will only expand in the future , with Nintendo advertising its DS cooking tutor software on TV and in glossy gossip magazines being just the tip of the iceberg .
18 . Games & Social Connectivity , Duh
User - created content begets social connectivity , but social connectivity in games is something that is not important only in games with strong creative elements .
Whether it's the robust and customized leaderboards in N+ -- a game that encourages finesse gameplay and throws your friends ' scores in your face every time you finish a level , encouraging replay and competition -- or Rock Band 's comprehensive band rankings , these elements are absolutely compelling and will only increase .
Bungie.net has proven essential to fans of Halo 3 , and this integrated and meaningful web approach is being carried forward by other games , like the Guitar Hero series and Insomniac Games ' MyResistance .net - all of which provide practically a social networking experience on the web alongside your game - based social play .
What 's next ?
Peter Ryan , VP at community site creators Agora Games , which built Activision 's Guitar Hero site , believes in the future that " community will be as critical to the overall experience of a game as the game itself . "
And he may be right !
19 . Franchises Vs. Regular Revenue Streams
" With respect to the franchises that do n’t have the potential to be exploited every year across every platform , with clear sequel potential that can meet our objectives of , over time , becoming $ 100 million - plus franchises , that ’s a strategy that has worked very well for us . "
Above , you read the words of Activision CEO Robert Kotick , on the dropping of Brutal Legend and other titles after the Vivendi merger .
We all hate to hear it , but there 's something to his assertion that it made sense for Activision to drop Ghostbusters and others titles , due to the fact that they can't be spun into yearly franchises that will be consistent earners .
It may not appeal to our sense of artistry -- and Activision 's focus on a " one size fits all " approach ( can every viable game idea work on DS ?
Of course not ) may well be overkill .
But the game industry has been built on a foundation of franchises and sequels .
They may not have to come every year , but they must come -- Nintendo is n't abandoning Mario and Zelda in the face of Wii Fit 's success .
John Riccitiello , while still maintaining that quality is key to the " new EA " -- in fact , his company just formerly announced that it 's publishing the orphaned Brutal Legend -- still agrees , in the face of a disappointing fall season : " ... quality has not yet translated into enough sales , " he said .
Next year : titles with more " hit potential " than Mirror 's Edge .
It 's a tough line to walk : we 're hoping that we can stay on the more appealing side of it .
But there 's no ignoring that repeatable success is key to keeping companies in the business of publishing games -- and bankrolling the less sure thing .
20 . Game IPs , Multiple Media
It used to be that making a hit game was enough .
At this point , it 's not about the game -- it 's about the franchise .
And that franchise had better map beyond games to comics , films , viral marketing campaigns , tabletop RPGs -- whatever .
The importance is not just in creating something with recognizable characters or situations ; it 's creating a world with a richness that maps well to multiple media , something with texture that can be expanded without veering away from the core integrity of the original product .
When Microsoft sent game reviewers Gears of War 2 , it came packed with a graphic novel and a prose novel .
And witness Dead Space 's animated movie debuting alongside the game .
Final Fantasy VII was never intended , in 1997 , to be more than a single game , but has swelled to encompass several , and a film too -- and now 2009 's Final Fantasy XIII was fundamentally created not in a vacuum , but as one facet of a theme - based expandable media universe with its own name and concept ( the pretentious Fabula Nova Crystallis , or New Stories of the Crystals in English -- which reveals its intent . )
These universes not only allow for new games that explore the core ethos of that universe without relying on the specific situations of any one constituent product , but allow creative satisfaction for a variety of visionaries to contribute to the health of a company 's bottom line .
It 's a necessary way to tackle a very contemporary impulse .

A microscopic biological sensor that detects Salmonella bacteria in lab tests has been developed by an Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) scientist and university colleagues .
The sensor could be adapted to detect other foodborne pathogens as well .
The sensor is part of an evolving science known as nanotechnology — the study and manipulation of materials on a molecular or even atomic level , measured in billionths of a meter , which is about 10 to100 times thinner than a human hair .
There are examples of biosensors in nature .
Insects detect tiny amounts of sex pheromones in the environment and use them as a beacon to find mates .
And fish use natural biosensors to detect barely perceptible vibrations in the surrounding water .
ARS engineer Bosoon Park at the Quality and Safety Assessment Research Unit in Athens , Ga. , and cooperators at the University of Georgia used nanotechnology to develop the biosensor .
The detection method may have great potential for food safety and security , according to Park .
The biosensors that Park and his university colleagues developed include fluorescent organic dye particles attached to Salmonella antibodies .
The antibodies hook onto Salmonella bacteria and the dye lights up like a beacon , making the bacteria easier to see .
People who eat Salmonella - infected food products can get salmonellosis , a disease characterized by nausea , vomiting , severe diarrhea , and sometimes death .
For his research , Park recently received the prestigious first place Innovation Nano Research Award at the Sixth International Nanotech Symposium and Exhibition , in Ilsan , Korea .
Cheney claims power to decide his own case John Byrne

This I am the law .
That 's the message Vice President Dick Cheney appeared to send in a little - noticed court filing last week , in which his lawyers asserted that the vice president alone has the authority to determine which records are turned over to the National Archives after he leaves office .
But the law exempts " personal and partisan " records , which Cheney 's lawyers said he will be the sole decider upon .
" The vice president alone may determine what constitutes vice presidential records or personal records , how his records will be created , maintained , managed and disposed , and are all actions that are committed to his discretion by law , " according to a filing by Cheney 's office with the court hearing the case Dec. 8 , noted by the AP 's Pamela Hess .
" National Archives officials have said records of Cheney 's dealings with the Republican National Committee would not require preservation under the law , " Hess notes .
" As of November , it had not made a final determination on the status of Cheney 's records produced when he acts as president of the Senate , which he says are exempt . "
Steven Aftergood , government secrecy expert and editor of the blog , Secrecy News , told Hess the law is unclear as to who is supposed to determine what records can be kept as private property .
" Decisions that are made in the next couple of weeks may prove irrevocable , " he said .
" If records are held from the archivist now they may never be recovered . "
Cheney was ordered to preserve all records in September while the case progressed .
Citizens for Ethics has tangled with the White House for years .
Last year , they took issue with the White House 's announcement that they 'd lost more than five million emails generated between March 2003 and October 2005 .
" It s clear that the White House has been willfully violating the law , the only question now is to what extent ? " CREW executive director Melanie Sloan wrote .
" The ever changing excuses offered by the administration  that they didnt want to violate the Hatch Act , that staff wasnt clear on the law  are patently ridiculous .
Very convenient that embarrassing  and potentially incriminating  emails have gone missing .
It s the Nixon White House all over again . "

In the latest evidence of how Wall Street is seeking to broaden its sources of funds , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is weighing whether to launch an Internet banking operation , according to people familiar with the situation .
If Goldman goes ahead , the new unit will seek deposits that can be used to fund various businesses now that Goldman is a bank - holding company .
The possible online bank has n't been named yet , and many details of its operating plans are undecided .
It is likely to offer a range of savings products , such as certificates ...
MUMBAI / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Dow Chemical
Co said on Monday it will close 20 facilities , divest several businesses and cut 5,000 jobs , making it the latest large chemical company to throttle back operations due to the global economic slump .

Dow near the eastern German village of Lippendorf south of Leipzig March 25 , 2004 .

In addition to cutting 5,000 full - time jobs , or 11 percent of its workforce , the company also plans to reduce the number of outside contractors it employs by 6,000 , or about 30 percent , and temporarily idle about 180 plants .
Dow ’s shares rose over 7 percent in afternoon trade following the announcement .
Dow said its action , which comes less than a week after its U.S. rival DuPont Co announced cutbacks , marks an acceleration of its “ transformational strategy ” and should lead to annual cost savings of $ 700 million by 2010 .
The freeze in the global credit markets and a recession in many developed economies has hurt Dow and its peers .
The companies have also suffered from a sharp slowdown in many emerging regions -- areas which had been driving growth for them in recent quarters .
“ We are accelerating the implementation of these measures as the current world economy has deteriorated sharply , and we must adjust ourselves to the severity of this downturn , ” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris said in a statement .
The Midland , Michigan , chemicals maker is also in the process of buying specialty chemicals producer Rohm & Haas Co for $ 15.3 billion , a move the companies expect will yield $ 800 million in savings by 2010 .
The company is also contributing a portion of its assets to a joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum Corp .
The joint venture will make chemicals used in products ranging from plastic bottles and compact disks to computers and agricultural compounds .
Dow plans to transform its earnings profile by growing its high - margin specialty chemicals business , while reducing its exposure to the more cyclical commodity chemicals business through a series of joint ventures .
Dow , the largest U.S. chemical maker , said the facility closures will target high - cost locations .
The company also plans to sell non-strategic businesses .
Dow said it expects its restructuring actions to result in fourth - quarter pretax charges of $ 700 million .
The moves will hurt earnings in the quarter by 50 to 60 cents a share , the company said in a presentation .
The company expects its actions to result in annual cost savings of $ 350 million by the end of 2009 and $ 700 in annual cost savings by the end of 2010 .
INDUSTRY WOES
Chemical companies supply manufacturers of electronics , automobiles , paper , paint and a wide array of other companies that have all been hurt by the weak global economy and are all lowering output levels -- reducing demand for chemicals .
Dow and other chemical makers have warned that fourth - quarter shipment volumes have fallen between 10 and 20 percent .
Dow ’s restructuring move was widely expected after DuPont and Germany ’s BASF AG announced similar actions .
BASF , the world ’s largest chemicals maker by revenue , last month said it was temporarily shutting down around 80 plants worldwide and reducing production at about 100 plants , due to a massive decline in demand .
Last week , DuPont announced it was expecting a fourth - quarter loss and outlined plans to cut 4.2 percent of its workforce .
Celanese Corp and Eastman Chemical
Co have also issued profit warnings in recent weeks .
“ We expect a number of additional earnings warnings to be issued in the coming days as other companies acknowledge the exceptional destocking activity underway , ” said Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Koort , in a note to clients .
Dow ’s shares rose $ 1.36 to $ 20.36 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange .
BPSDBWhen it comes to climate change the stakes for humanity are high in the extreme , so you might think the people advising a laissez faire approach ( aka Deniers ) to the problem would want to be absolutely certain of their facts .
Something they would be willing to bet their money on for example .
Not phony challenges like Milloy ’s Carny Scam , but actually risk their own money as well as your life .
Turns out not to be the case .
It seems it started in 1995 when scientist Paul Ehrlich and physicists John Harte and John Holdren offered to bet Denier Julian Simon that the years 2002 - 2004 would be warmer than 1992 - 199 .
Simon refused and thereby saved his money .
In 2005 climate scientist James Annan challenged Denier Richard Lindzen ( and here ) , who declined .
He then bet numerous other prominent Deniers without any takers until finally Mashnich and Bashkirtsev accepted a bet .
Scientist and writer George Monbiot offered to bet Denier Myron Ebell 5,000 British pounds , and suddenly Ebell thought that maybe the earth might warm a bit ( amazing how large sums of money can clarify your thinking ) .
Brian Schmidt of “ Backseat driving ” apparently liked the idea so much he has challenged many Deniers and Denier blogs to bet , again with no one willing to risk their money .
Now , in his analysis of this decade as the warmest in history and the Denier cluster fest about “ 2008 is the coldest year of the decade ” scientist Joseph Romm states “ I stand by my offer to bet $ 1000 that the decade from 2010 to 2019 will be warmer than the decade from 2000 to 2009 “
Some dismiss these as “ stunts ” , but think about it .
When they spread their Denier fables these people are absolutely certain that ( variously ) “ climate change is a hoax ” , or “ the earth is cooling “ , etc , yet they are not willing to bet on it ?
Why not ?
You ’d imagine they would see this as a chance to make some easy money ,
no ?
When I “ know ” that I am right I like to sweeten it with some extra cash , why not them ?
It is n’t even that large an amount in most cases , particularly given that these are well paid professionals .
These largely older white men who do not expect to be around when the real catastrophe of climate change hits actually are betting .
They are betting the lives of the people already dying from the effects of climate change .
They are betting your life .
Apparently that is worth a lot less than $ 1,000 to them .
More 2008
Key quote from Romm is “ The climate story of the decade is that the 2000s are on track to be nearly 0.2 °C warmer than the 1990s .
And that temperature jump is especially worrisome since the 1990s were only 0.14 °C warmer than the 1980s ( see datasets here ) .
Global warming is accelerating , as predicted . ”
Brian Schmidt also notes that “ 2008 will be the warmest La Nina - influenced year discounting 1998 , a year that was split between La Nina and an even stronger El Nino . ” …
… “ global cooling ” indeed .
Red Herring Quiz Redux
Jules of Jules ’ klimaatblog noticed the same Red Herring quiz discussed in my last post also appears on the Heartland Institute web site with some interesting author notes from Steve Bloom , although there is some question as to who deserves the real blame credit for the quiz .
UPDATE : Dec 8 11:30 EST : Reader frankbi notes the quiz has been discussed before at DeSmoBlog , which in turn links to an interesting post at Global Warming Watch about a “ Denialist in service attack ” ( good one !
I call them “ Global Swarmings ” ( misappropriation of term at that ) ) associated with the quiz .
Speaking of the Heartland Institute ( now that you have an idea of their “ science ” ) , apparently they are organizing their 2009 International Conference on Climate Change and even “ to draw up to 1,000 scientists and experts . ”
WOW !
Maybe they ’ll break last years record and get two dozen scientists !
We give our consent every moment that we do not resist .
Denier “ Challenge ” aka Deathwatch Update : Day 58 … still no evidence .

Some beers were born to be stars of the small screen and have earned a place in our hearts – and our fridges – as a result of funny , thought - provoking , unusual or simply unforgettable TV commercials .
A good TV commercial is no guarantee of a good beer , but they do go well together .
We drank a few beers and researched the best of the best beer commercials on TV and can present them for your viewing pleasure .
So , what are you waiting for ?
Take a beer in hand , sit back and continue reading for the top 10 greatest beer TV commercials .

Guinness : Tipping Point .
Guinness have a long affinity with TV advertising and consistently produce some of the most innovative and complex commercials .
This spot has a great cinematic feel and reinforces the notion of the ‘ big pint ’ .
Stella Artois : Last Wishes of a Dying Man. Stella produced a string of clever , movie - like commercials riffing off the theme of the French film Jean de Florette ( including reusing the memorable score ) .
This commercial is the best of the series and manages to weave an entire short movie around the ‘ reassuringly expensive ’ beer .
Carlton Draught : The Big Ad.
This Australian beer pokes fun at the big set - piece commercials by being purposely self - referential , but is all the better for it .
Worth inclusion in the top 10 for the sheer audacity of pulling it off !
Guinness : Evolution .
Another classic from Guinness , this time with stunning visuals and spanning millennia to highlight the wait associated with a good pint .
One of the most original commercials for a beer on TV and instantly memorable .
Brahma : Refreshingly Voodoo .
From the Brazilian beer makers is this inventive commercial with an excellent punch line .
Saying any more than that would possibly ruin things …
Bud Lite : Swear Jar.
Inspired by The Office , this is a nice one - joke commercial that is played very well .
You can have some fun trying to fill in the bleeps .
Carlsberg : Dream Apartment .
This Irish - made commercial spawned a number of similar adverts and even made it ’s way into popular culture with it ’s signature “ Carlsberg do n’t do … ” .
The commercial nicely elevates the beer as a thing of excellence and brought their tag line of probably the best beer in the world into an interesting new dimension .
Castlemaine XXXX : Sherry for the ladies .
A great old Australian commercial , and a refreshingly frank , male - oriented piece that plays on the Aussie stereotypes , while at the same time , reinforces them !
Carlton Draft : Flashdance .
Another excellent Australian commercial , again for Carlton Draft .
This inspired advertisement takes a surreal turn for the better and never looks back .
The attention to detail is brilliant , especially the ‘ update ’ to the story at the conclusion .
Guinness : The Surfer. 3 out of the top 10 for Guinness ?
It could have been 10 out of 10 , such is the consistency and originality of their commercials .
This one is pretty stunning ; beautifully shot , highly original and unique .
It ’s such a huge advert that YouTube does n’t really do it justice – you ’d need a movie screen for it .
It manages to capture the essential nature of Guinness within a fascinating scene – the black and white , the patience , the fulfillment .
Sit back and admire !
And that makes 10 !
Are you thirsty for a beer yet ?
What was your favorite commercial of these , or have you another favorite that we missed ?

Millions suffer debilitating back pain
The team from the University of Manchester hope their treatment will be available within three years .
They are perfecting a way to rebuild the soft shock - absorbing discs which separate the vertebrae in the spine .
Damage to these intervertebral discs ( IVDs ) is a common cause of debilitating low back pain which affects around 12 million in the UK .
This is a really exciting area of research
Dries Hettinga
BackCare
A treatment which effectively cured the problem could potentially save the UK economy as much as £ 5 billion a year .
The new therapy , developed by Dr Stephen Richardson , uses mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) from adult bone marrow to regenerate spinal discs .
MSCs are a class of stem cell which can grow into many different cell types , including bone , cartilage , fat and muscle .
Dr Richardson has succeeded in turning MSCs into the cells which make up the gel - like nucleus pulposus ( NP ) tissue separating the vertebrae .
He plans to begin pre-clinical trials next year , with full patient trials to follow on .
Dr Richardson said : " Once we have extracted the bone marrow from the patient and have purified the MSCs , they will be grown in culture and our patented method of differentiation will be applied .
" They will then be embedded within a gel which can be implanted back into the patient . "
No rejection
Since the stem cells are taken from the patient 's own body , there is no chance of them being rejected by the immune system .
The gel is based on a natural collagen similar to one already used for the treatment of cartilage defects .
It is implanted using an arthroscope , a thin tube device slipped through a small incision in the back .
Dr Richardson said there was no reason why a patient should not return home on the same day as the procedure , or the day after .
He said : " Once implanted , the differentiated MSCs would produce a new NP tissue with the same properties as the original and would both treat the underlying cause of the disease and remove the painful symptoms . "
Currently , low back pain is treated with a combination of painkillers , physiotherapy or surgery .
In severe cases tissue is removed to relieve the pain , or vertebrae fused together .
However , success is limited , and these techniques do not solve the root cause of the problem .
Dries Hettinga , research and information manager at the charity BackCare , said : " This is a really exciting area of research and although it is still early days , the initial results look very promising . "
Recently , Google has stepped up its presence in the cloud computing arena .
Google 's new App Engine ( aka " AppSpot " ) lets you design and run web applications using Google 's existing infrastructure .
Their ( free ) basic account offers up to half a gigabyte of storage plus the computing power to push approximately 5 million page views per month .
That 's a nice starting point for anyone who might be looking into a web - based application environment .
App Engine applications run in secure sandboxes that distribute application load across multiple servers .
They offer distributed data storage with standard query , concurrency , and transaction features .
So the App Engine lends itself particularly well to structured knowledge repositories like the Open Radar community - sourced bug reports for Apple developers .
Python only
At this time , App Engine uses Python as its primary programming language .
Although Google is investigating other languages for future releases , if you want to get started with App Engine , you 'll need to first master the Python scripting language .
If you 're already conversant with Python , congratulations .
If not , Ars has put together the following site roundup to help you find resources for learning the language .

Programming language tutorials either appeal or do not appeal based on any number of personal factors .
Some developers prefer simple lessons that move learning forward in stages .
Others like the facts to be laid out in familiar terms with a minimum of hand - holding .
Each of the following sites presents its own approach to mastering Python , which you may or may not find useful for your learning path .
These represent just a fraction of the available online Python tutorial resources .
Online Python tutorials
Official Python Tutorial
It 's hard to go wrong when Python.org provides the tutorial for you .
The official tutorial offers an excellent language overview with all the details you could hope for .
That being said , the tutorial reads like a language manual , which it is .
This may be exactly what you 're looking for or something you 'd prefer to avoid .
People with passive - voice allergies are advised to grab some Claritin before reading .
Here 's an actual quote from the write - up " Perhaps the most well - known statement type is the if statement .
For example :
There can be zero or more elif parts , and the else part is optional .
The keyword ‘ elif ‘ is short for ‘ else if ’ , and is useful to avoid excessive indentation .
An if ... elif ... elif ... sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages . "
Strengths : Complete and correct coverage .
Weaknesses :
Not especially user friendly introduction .
Python Rocks !
Kent S. Johnson provides a terrific overview of the Python language — and why you should be excited by it — in his " Python Rocks ! " rant on his personal website .
His brief language tour covers a lot of the language highlights for anyone who wants to understand the big Python picture before settling down to a core Python tutorial .
It 's a great place to start to get you in the mood for learning the language .
Strengths : Helps you understand why Python rocks .
Weaknesses : Short , not a full language overview .
Dive Into Python Mark Pilgrim 's online book offers a highly regarded survey of the language .
First published in 2004 , Dive Into Python is considered one of the best comprehensive overviews by some of our Ars staffers .
Presented in outline format , the book covers language basics including statements , data types , objects , regular expressions and more .
If you have the time to spare , this book offers exhaustive detail .
The last chapter , which covers performance tuning , looks like a real gem for advanced programmers .
Strengths : Really detailed
Weaknesses : Slightly dated , with noticeable typos .
A Byte of Python Swaroop C H's online book offers many , many little knowledge chunks .
Each page offers a tiny bit of Python knowledge , with clean formatting and good examples .
It is not , however , a book that you 'll want to sit and read through as there 's little narrative flow from this Yahoo !
employee .
Instead , it works well as a reference .
Click through to the if statement , for example , to find out how to put this one statement together or to the tuple page to see examples of grouped data elements .
Strengths : Just the facts .
Weaknesses : Just the facts .
Learning With Python ( 2nd Edition )
For the experienced programmer who 's looking to get up and going with a language as quickly , Jeffrey Elkner , Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers ' Learning with Python site ( aka , " How to Think Like a Computer Scientist " ) provides a simple data dump .
Expressions , functions , conditionals , iteration , strings and more are covered in short , pointed chapters .
Each of the 11 chapters is presented on a single webpage with lots of well - focused sample code .
It 's a great resource for anyone who knows object oriented programming and scripting already but needs to quickly produce results in the new language .
Strengths : Direct and to the point ; my favorite site
Weaknesses : Misses advanced best practices .
Learning to Program Alan Gauld 's " Learning to Program " offers a series of tutorials that assume little or no programming background .
Using Python examples , it start with a surey of language basics and then moves on to more advanced topics including event - driven programming and file manipulation , touching on some basic CS introductions to functional programming and recursion .
You 'll probably find his " Python in Practice " and " Working with Databases " sections to be valuable , regardless of your background as it covers very practical applied Python .
Sadly , his " Writing Web Clients " and " Writing Web Applications " topics are referenced but not available online at this time .
Strengths : Suitable for new programmers
Weaknesses : Some topics are missing in action .
Other Books
The official Python.org wiki offers an excellent list of introductory Python books that are not necessarily available online but should be readily available from Amazon and other retailers .
Online tutorials are n't everybody 's thing , and the wiki's book list provides a good starting point for tracking down dead tree resources for learning .
Strengths : Excellent survey
Weaknesses : Resources must be tracked down and read in dead - tree format .
[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
The eyes often do n’t have it .
Tennis referees , for example , sometimes mess up when calling a ball in or out .
And a new study finds that refs are much more likely to make a mistake by calling a good ball out than by calling a bad ball in .
The research is in the October 28th issue of the journal Current Biology .
It takes at least a tenth of a second for us to become aware of an image striking the retina .
So we all have to construct our perception of moving objects .
And the way the brain works , we consistently think something has gone slightly further than it really has .
It ’s not surprising then that we misjudge the position of hundred - mile - an - hour tennis balls .
When researcher David Whitney saw a call overturned during Wimbledon , he decided to check out referee error rates .
He reviewed videos of more than 4,000 randomly selected tennis points , and found 83 incorrect calls .
Seventy of the 83 were the type predicted .
So players contesting calls are better off asking for reviews on their own shots called out than their opponent ’s called in .

As he had in years past , Bruce Jeffrey Pardo volunteered to serve as an usher at his church ’s midnight Mass on Christmas Eve .
Pardo , however , was miles away from the Holy Redeemer Catholic Church as the religious service got underway .
He had driven a rental car from his home in Montrose to the Covina home of his ex-wife ’s parents .
Shortly before 11:30 p.m. , dressed as Santa Claus , he approached the front door with a large , wrapped package .
Inside the two - story home at the end of a quiet cul - de- sac , his ex-wife , her parents and about two dozen others were enjoying their annual holiday party .
An 8 - year - old girl ran to answer his knock .
When the door swung open , Pardo , 45 , shot her in the face with a semiautomatic handgun , stepped into the house and opened fire on the revelers .
Amid the chaos , he doused the house with a flammable liquid contained in the package -- a pressurized fuel tank , about 2 1 / 2 feet tall .
Partygoers fled in panic as the house on Knollcrest Drive went up in flames .
They ran to neighbors ’ homes and frantically called 911 .
A young woman , according to a neighbor , leaped out of a second - floor window , breaking her ankle .
The 8 - year - old girl and a 16 - year - old girl who was shot in the back survived and were transported to local hospitals with non-life - threatening injuries , officials said .
Eight bodies remained in the ruins of the house , coroner officials later said .
It was thought to be the worst single killing spree in the county this year .
Overall , homicides have remained at relatively low levels compared to previous years .
The investigation , which began quickly and continued into Christmas Day , led to two other Southern California homes : Pardo ’s and his brother ’s , where Pardo was found dead .
It revealed a divorce , the flammable device like the one Pardo took into the Covina home -- police said they ’d never seen anything like it -- and incredulous reactions from people who knew Pardo as a reliable church usher and good , but quiet , neighbor .
By late Thursday night , authorities were n’t even close to identifying all the victims , although his former wife and her parents are thought to have been killed .
In Covina , police kept firefighters at bay as flames engulfed the house , believing the gunman might still be in the area .
About 80 firefighters battled the blaze for an hour and a half before extinguishing it , said Los Angeles County Fire Capt .
Mike Brown .
The second floor of the house fell to the ground .
Palm trees swayed eerily in the smoke .
Pardo had left the scene quickly , driving to his brother ’s house about 40 miles away in Sylmar .
Shortly before 3:30 a.m. , the brother summoned Los Angeles police , saying he had come home to find Pardo dead with a gunshot wound to the head .
When arriving officers ran Pardo ’s name through a law - enforcement database , they were alerted that he was wanted by Covina police .
By 9 a.m. , a pair of Covina detectives had arrived at Pardo ’s tan stucco house in Montrose and cordoned it off with tape .
A wreath was hung on the front door and candy canes adorned the fence .
An SUV and a military - style Hummer were parked in the driveway .
In midafternoon , authorities approached the house with guns drawn , shouting , “ We ’re police !
We have a search warrant ! ”
When no one responded , they used a battering ram to get in .
More than two hours later , officers carried away four shotguns , a handgun , wrapping paper and a fuel tank like the one Pardo used in the attack .
A label on the red tank read , “ WeFuelFun.com , ” the website of a company that specializes in fueling devices for all - terrain vehicles .
Buchanan , a 30 - year police veteran , said the tank Pardo used in the attack was “ nothing that we or the arson team had ever seen . ”
Recently , Pardo had been living in the Montrose home alone , said Det. Antonio Zavala .
Court records show that his wife divorced him last September .
He “ was apparently going through a bad time in his marriage , ” Covina Police Lt. Pat Buchanan said .
Neighbors said that Pardo had lived in the house with his wife , Sylvia , 43 , and her three children for a few years , until she and the children moved out last spring .
The family was often seen walking their dog in the neighborhood .
Pardo , several neighbors said , was a quiet , unassuming man who enjoyed tending his garden and regularly ushered at the evening Sunday Mass at Holy Redeemer .
“ Bruce ? ” said an incredulous Jan Detanna , the head usher at the church , when told about the attack by a reporter on the phone .
“ I ’m just -- this is shocking .
He was the nicest guy you could imagine .
Always a pleasure to talk to , always a big smile . ”
Bong Garcia , Pardo ’s next - door neighbor , said he last saw Pardo between 9 and 10 p.m. Christmas Eve. Pardo , who was dressed in regular clothes , said he was on his way to a party .
Pardo ’s former wife and her parents , Joseph Ortega , 80 , and Alicia Ortega , 70 , are believed to be among the dead .
Authorities said Thursday afternoon that the bodies found in the house were so badly burned that dental records would be needed to identify them .
The Ortegas lived in a bucolic neighborhood -- their street lined with large homes with swimming pools , valued upward of half a million dollars .
Tom Minter , 78 , who lives a few doors down from the Ortegas ’ house , was washing dishes when he heard a loud bang .
Soon after , police SWAT officers rushed a man and two women who had been at the party into his home , sat them down in the hallway and turned off all lights in the house , Minter said .
Both women were crying and the man was talking into his cellphone , saying ‘ They ’re all dead , he shot them all , ’ ” Minter recalled .
Gazing at the scene of destruction on Christmas morning , Frank Castillo , 46 , stood at the yellow police tape barrier trying unsuccessfully to obtain information about relatives he said had been at the party .
“ I want to make sure [ they ] are OK , ” he said , choking back tears .
The bizarre case continued to unfold into the night .
Bright lights brought in by police illuminated the crime scene in Covina .
In searching the rental car in Sylmar , the L.A. County sheriff ’s bomb squad found a suspicious object .
As they attempted to render the object safe , the car erupted in flames , said Los Angeles Police Sgt. James Bender .
Later , police evacuated houses close to Pardo ’s in Montrose , concerned that he might have left behind bombs .

He picked for Vice President one of the major architects of the Drug War .
He picked for Chief of Staff one of the chief opponents of medical marijuana .
He is talking about picking for the Drug Czar spot a conservative candidate who has been a congressional leader fighting drug reform .
He has promised to put an end to raids on medical dispensaries in California , but he has not said he will broadly support the Hinchey - Rohrbacher Amendment which would let states decide the issue .
He has moved from once supporting marijuana decriminalization to publishing comments that he cannot overuse ‘ political capital ’ on the issue .
He has now appointed for Attorney General a candidate who has a long history of opposing drug policy reforms and who has in court supported mandatory minimum sentencing and civil forfeiture .
Allen St. Pierre , the Executive Director of NORML , summed it up best about Mr. Obama ’s appointments thus far : “ So Far , Not So Good : ” His thought - provoking article appears on the NORML.com website at its blog .
From summarizing why the selection of Joe Biden as Vice President caused him ‘ digestive tumult ’ to tracing Rahm Emanuel ’s anti-drug policies for the past decade , the article captures a snapshot of what was routine politics as usual for the players soon to be in power .
When it comes to our 44th President , some of his positions on marijuana were once encouraging .
But as Mr. Obama has moved towards the national limelight , there is a new found frustration for reformers .
It seems the President to be is moving from the left to the middle .
And as Loudon Wainwright once wrote in a popular song , the only things you see in the middle of the road are dead skunks and yellow lines .
Still , I am not alarmed yet .
It is way too early , and there is still room and reason for optimism .
Commencing your administration in the face of a national economic crisis at home while American soldiers are at war abroad can focus your priorities on other issues outside the need for weed .
We have seen what happened to Bill Clinton when he tried , too early in his administration , to advance the cause of gay rights by banning discrimination against homosexuals in the military .
He started a firestorm which burnt up valuable first months of his presidency .
We do know this though , and it is a challenging start .
Rather decisively , on the official administration website , at www.change.gov, the following statement appears : President - elect Obama is not in favor of the legalization of marijuana .
What can we then expect of Mr. Obama once he becomes President ?
I think there are many encouraging things .
First , in his past he has acknowledged the broad failures of the drug war , declaring in 2004 that it was an “ utter failure ” which needs to be rethought .
Second , as an African - American in an urban community , few people will be as sensitive as Mr. Obama to the exhaustive legal toll this drug war exacts on minority communities .
The arrests come quicker , the prosecutions are more frequent , and the sentences are longer .
Drug arrests have been tools to deny poor people driver ’s licenses , scholarships and federal welfare benefits , causing innocuous conduct to endure catastrophic consequences for otherwise decent people .
Third , the President is ‘ with it ’.
His telling comments to a group of students when asked whether he ‘ inhaled ’ marijuana were “ Of course , I thought that was the whole purpose . ”
Those remarks are a reflection of the candor and commitment of Mr. Obama to address the issue in a new light .
He did not play a game of Clintonian holier - than - thou cover - up .
With the same self - deprecating qualities that he shared with the nation when he called himself a ‘ mutt , ’ Mr. Obama implied in tone and substance that marijuana may not be as bad as we have been hearing from the government for too many decades .
Last week , the website Change.gov asked the public to provide them with a list of the top public policy questions facing America .
Visitors to the site were then asked to vote on which questions should take priority for the incoming administration .
After receiving nearly 100,000 total votes on more than 10,000 separate public policy issues , the most widely voted on question for Obama is :
“ Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it , and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S. ”
Maybe Rahm Emanuel has turned a corner as well .
Rahm is politically smart if nothing else , so I hope that he ’ll follow his boss ’ lead in the area of criminal justice reforms .
Also , to his credit , after voting years against Hinchey - Rohrbacher Amendment in 2007 , as member of Congress from Illinois , Rahm voted in favor of holding back federal funding from law enforcement ( read DEA ) to raid or harass medical marijuana cultivators and dispensaries .
I know I have been unsuccessful in getting my own liberal Congresswoman from South Florida , Debbie Wasserman - Schulz , to even support this effort .
Maybe Mr. Emanuel will influence her and dozens of others .
It will take leadership from the oval office .
That can only happen when the people in office are looked upon as enlightened reformers rather than being weak on crime .
Politically , I know such polls as the one the administration inaugurated here are instrumental in turning mindsets .
If we can show politicians that it is ‘ safe ’ to support drug reform , even popular , we can suddenly find them on our side .
To their credit , outstanding philanthropists like Peter Lewis and George Soros have been national leaders in helping bring public opinion out of the closet .
These are men whose voices may be heard by the new administration .
And I am here for them too if they need me .
My number is listed .
So too is Barney Frank , the influential Massachusetts congressman who has long supported decriminalization legislation .
The truth is that people who support decriminalization have always been a silent majority afraid to speak out .
But give them a secret ballot box , and in state after state , you see massive support for medical marijuana and a more enlightened approach to marijuana reform .
Perhaps the President , in his own unique disarming way , can lead a new path .
He has surrounded himself with educated leaders who also have been willing to speak candidly in favor of decriminalization including new Cabinet nominee Bill Richardson .
We do not need a new Drug Czar , either .
This is America .
Czars are for Russia .
What we need is the appointment of an educator , a scientist , a doctor , a constitutional rights lawyer to pave the way to a new era of drug enlightenment .
At the last NORML Board of Directors meeting , one issue we raised was one many of us within the drug reform movement can support .
It has been three decades since the Shafer Commission released its national study on marijuana , which Nixon immediately trashed .
Perhaps a new Blue Ribbon Commission , with decades more research behind it , and years of medical marijuana evidence , can look into new recommendations for the 21st century .
On one hand , such a Presidential panel would buy time for the new administration to get settled in with more pressing priorities .
But it would also give drug reformers a national platform to address so many issues that have been , forgive me , cultivated - since the Shafer Commission , from forfeiture laws to raids on dispensaries , from the THC content of marijuana to medicinal initiatives .
It is time to look again at marijuana with a scholarly and clinical eye instead of with SWAT teams and law enforcement raids .
Correspondingly , it is also time for the national drug reform organizations to speak with a singular voice and work together for a common purpose .
There needs to be a unity of purpose , and leaders from the Marijuana Policy Project , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , the Drug Policy Alliance , Students for a Sensible Drug Policy , and a host of other respected reform organizations , too many to mention here , should hold their own meeting to develop a common theme with a collective initiative .
We need to work together to send a message that is enlightened and progressive , convincing legislators and the executive branch that we are responsible and right ..
The drug reform movement needs to act in a way that President - elect Obama has asked all of us to move towards : not to be tied to the politics of the past and the way things have always been done , but to engage hope by broadening our constituency and reaching out to others .
Within the drug reform movement , fratricide must come to an end .
We must bury the hatchet on our own rivalries , and move forward with a common purpose .
We defeat ourselves by ourselves when we do not .
Our cause is just , and our goals have always been righteous .
We may have only ourselves to blame if we cannot achieve now what we have fought so long for .
I would say our time is now , but I thought that in 1976 when the Attorney General of the United States , then Ramsey Clark , said we should see an end to unjust marijuana laws before the end of the decade .
I think we are overdue .
Together , let us do better than we have already done .
We have a President who is willing to listen , a Congress that is willing to learn , and a public that is salivating for a better solution .

A Far -Left Threat in the French Elections The Revolutionary Postman
Half a dozen far - left and Green candidates are on the ballot for the first round of the French presidential elections .
While they have no chance of winning , they could take vital votes away from the Socialist Party candidate Ségolène Royal and even prevent her making it to the next round .
The Food and Drug Administration said it would continue allowing the widespread use of a class of powerful antibiotics in food - producing animals , making a last - minute reversal after calling the practice a public - health risk in July .
The agency 's bid this summer to ban many uses of cephalosporin drugs in cows , swine , chickens and other animals came under fire from the industry .
Agriculture groups and animal - drug makers , including Pfizer Inc. , said the antibiotics are needed to prevent many infectious diseases in animals .

Gerrard scored twice in his team 's 5 - 1 win on Sunday
England and Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard is under arrest following an assault at a nightclub .
Police were called to the Lounge Inn in Southport , Merseyside after reports of a disturbance at 0230 GMT .
Six men were detained later in a nearby street .
The men , four from Huyton , one from Formby and one from Litherland , remain in police custody .
A 34 - year - old man from Southport was taken to hospital with facial injuries , not thought to be life - threatening .
The incident is alleged to have taken place at the restaurant and bar - which turns into a nightclub - on Bold Street .
Four men aged 33 , 31 , 29 and 19 , all from Huyton , a 28 - year - old from Formby and an 18 - year - old from Litherland were arrested a short time later on nearby Lord Street .
The Lounge Inn remained closed on Monday .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Midfielder Gerrard , 28 , is Liverpool captain and scored twice in his team 's 5 - 1 victory over Newcastle on Sunday .
A police spokesman said : " Merseyside Police is investigating an assault that took place in the early hours of Monday December 29 on Bold Street in Southport .
" At around 2.30 am this morning officers attended a disturbance at a licensed premises on Bold Street .
" Six men were arrested on suspicion of section 20 assault , on Lord Street . "
The spokesman added all six currently remained in custody .
It is believed no other Liverpool footballers are among those being held .
Gerrard was born and grew up on Huyton 's Bluebell Estate .
Last month the Premier League star was given the freedom of his home borough of Knowsley in recognition of his contribution to football .
Liverpool FC said it would not be commenting .
Fail and You Unveiled earlier this month at Microsoft 's Professional Developer Conference by Chief Whiteboard Operator Ray Ozzie , the Azure Services Platform confused damn near everyone .
But after days of collaboration with the top minds in both industry and academia , El Reg is proud to announce that we have finally figured out what Microsoft Azure is .
The Azure Services Platform is a clusterfuck of software that can be broken down into four basic parts : Windows Azure , .NET Services , SQL Services , and Live Services .
To get a general idea of what each is , you should probably read the sixteen - page white paper .
It is designed to compete with Amazon 's Web Services and Google 's App Engine - that is , once it gets over one slight hitch : tl;dr .
The Four Letters of the Apocalypse
tl ; dr stands for “ too long ; did n't read , ” and it is going to change communication as we know it .
Product managers at both Amazon and Google have figured out what tl ; dr means to their respective businesses , but the idea is clearly lost on Microsoft .
When a developer is evaluating different hosted computing platforms for his next application , the merits of each one are decided by how well they are explained :
Amazon EC2 : We have a lot of servers , and we run Xen on them .
You get virtual machines .
Google App Engine : Run your Python code on our machines .
You can use our scalable database , too , but you need to learn how it works .
Microsoft Azure : OK , so first there 's this operating system called Windows Azure that your apps are going to run on and will also be your development environment .
There 's some data storage that goes along with that , but it 's not very useful , so we have the SQL Service .
That does n't really give you SQL , but something sorta similar .
Ignore it for now .
Still with me ?
There 's also .
NET Services that lets you connect applications together somehow , and Live Services because we needed something to keep Ray Ozzie busy .
Wrap that all up , tape it together with some C# programming , and that 's the platform .
Fortunately for Microsoft , decision makers do n't choose a hosted application platform based on specifications .
They choose based on the number of stock photos of clouds and the amount of sans - serif blue typeface you have on your webpage .
In that regard , Redmond is the clear winner .
The Education Department announced Thursday that it would buy up to $ 6.5 billion of federally guaranteed student loans made in the 2007 - 8 academic year as part of its effort to make sure loans are available .
Congress has allowed the department to buy federal loans made from 2003 to 2009 , but the department has not yet used the full range of its authority .
The program announced Thursday will run from December to late February .
“ We have full confidence that the programs we ’ve announced will work in bringing liquidity to the marketplace , ” Sara Martinez Tucker , under secretary of education , said on a conference call .
Eligible loans are federal Stafford loans and parent PLUS loans , she said , but not consolidation loans , which students use to combine multiple loans and make a single monthly payment .
The department will pay 97 percent of the principal and outstanding interest due for loans .
Concern about availability of student loans has grown as the credit crisis has made borrowing more difficult for families .
Federal loans this year have so far been available and the Education Department has not had to use its “ lender of last resort ” program , Ms. Tucker said .
NEW YORK CITY SIGNS -- 14TH TO 42ND STREET
This site intends to survey all of the signs in New York City from 14th Street to 42nd Street .
Of course , this is not possible , since there would be tens of thousands of signs within this area .
The 29 crosstown streets are each 10 to 11 blocks long ( 1st Ave. to 11th or 12th Aves . ) .
This gives some 300 blocks , each containing , say , 100 signs of one type or another .
This would total 30,000 .
Even if we eliminated the repetitive traffic signs ( actually , each one is different , in setting if not otherwise ) , the remainder would probably be over 20,000 ...
Since it is possible to display only a small fragment of these images , the site will contain only a few highlights of the signs in this prolific area .
The emphasis is on vintage signs but not exclusively .
My earliest photographs date from the mid 1980's .
Many of these signs no longer exist .
Documentation is supplied wherever available .

The broad industry support Apple is building around OpenCL will help increase the critical mass behind OpenGL , the 2D and 3D graphics language Apple uses extensively in Mac OS X .
Since the mid 90s , Microsoft has worked to prevent the adoption of OpenGL as an interoperable industry standard in favor of its own proprietary DirectX portfolio of graphics software and gaming tools .
DirectX at Microsoft
Microsoft 's DirectX strategy was originally intended to push DOS game developers to Windows ; it has since served to tie PC gaming to Windows , as DirectX is only available on Windows .
Successive versions of DirectX have also been used to push developers to the latest version of Windows ; for example , the latest version 10 was intended to result in a crop of Vista - only games that would boost Vista sales .
However , this did not work out as intended , as the slow uptake of Vista prevented any real market for DirectX 10 games from developing , leaving PC games to target Windows XP instead .
OpenGL and Apple
The basis for OpenGL originated at high end graphics workstation vendor SGI in the 80s and became an open standard during the early 90s ; Microsoft released its competing Direct3D as part of Windows 95's DirectX tools .
Despite a period of codevelopment between SGI and Microsoft under the name Fahrenheit in the late 90s , efforts to merge the two never successfully materialized .
Instead , Microsoft 's dominance over PC computing allowed it to develop its proprietary DirectX and push its adoption with GPU makers , leaving the open source community around OpenGL without the support it needed to keep up as a viable option .
OpenGL nearly faded into obscurity until Apple dropped its own QuickDraw 3D architecture and adopted OpenGL as the official 3D library for Mac OS X in the late 90s .
The company 's consumer platform helped create a wider audience for OpenGL applications .
Interest in open source computing since then has also helped , as OpenGL is used by Linux and , more recently , by all of the major game consoles , including Sony 's PSP and PS3 and Nintendo's Wii .
The console exception is of course Microsoft's Xbox , which was named after the DirectX graphics libraries it was designed promote in an effort to stop a broad migration to OpenGL in gaming and a subsequent erosion of Microsoft 's software monopoly .
OpenGL is now more competitive with DirectX than ever .
Microsoft 's stumble with Vista and its DirectX / Direct3D version 10 has also helped to stall its momentum in the market .
Microsoft plans to add OpenCL - like support for GPGPU computing into DirectX 11 in Windows 7 , but Apple 's OpenCL , which is designed to work closely with OpenGL code , will arrive first and with broad industry support .
Apple has also released OpenCL as a royalty - free , open standard anyone can implement on any platform .
The design similarities between OpenGL and OpenCL make it easy for developers to create code that , for example , calculates the data for a visualization in OpenCL and then uses the same objects to render graphics in OpenGL .
Alternatively , graphics rendered in OpenGL can be processed and transformed using tasks built in OpenCL .
The adoption and familiarity of each will support the other .
An alleged ( and formerly convicted and released ) rapist was picked up in Staten Island , New York after being selected from a lineup by the victim .
Sources said the woman struck back during the attack by stabbing the perpetrator in the neck with a nearby iPod charger , and the man picked out of the lineup bore the twin bruises of an AC adapter on his neck .
He fled the scene before police arrived , but left his yellow jacket ( emblazoned with Sylvester the Cat ) behind , and in addition to the victim 's testimony will hopefully be enough to put this creep away for life .
Or several lifetimes .
[ Gothamist ]
During the second Palestinian " intifada " , I was sitting in the offices of Hizbollah 's Al - Manar television station in Beirut , watching news footage of a militiaman 's funeral in Gaza .
The television showed hordes of Hamas and PLO gunmen firing thousands of rounds of ammunition into the air to honour their latest " martyr " ; and I noticed , just next to me , a Lebanese Hizbollah member – who had taken part in many attacks against the Israelis in what had been Israel 's occupation zone in southern Lebanon – shaking his head .
What was he thinking , I asked ?
" Hamas try to stand up to the Israelis , " he replied .
" But ... "
And here he cast his eyes to the ceiling .
" They waste bullets .
They fire all these bullets into the sky .
They should use them to shoot at Israelis . "
His point , of course , was that Hamas lacked discipline , the kind of iron , ruthless discipline and security that Hizbollah forged in Lebanon and which the Israeli army was at last forced to acknowledge in southern Lebanon in 2006 .
Guns are weapons , not playthings for funerals .
And Gaza is not southern Lebanon .
It would be as well for both sides in this latest bloodbath in Gaza to remember this .
Hamas is not Hizbollah .
Jerusalem is not Beirut .
And Israeli soldiers cannot take revenge for their 2006 defeat in Lebanon by attacking Hamas in Gaza – not even to help Ms Livni in the Israeli elections .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Not that Hizbollah won the " divine victory " it claimed two years ago .
Driving the roads of southern Lebanon as the Israelis smashed the country 's infrastructure , killed more than a thousand Lebanese – almost all of them civilians – and razed dozens of villages , it did n't feel like a Hizbollah " victory " to me , theological or otherwise .
But the Israelis did n't win and the Hizbollah were able to deploy thousands of long - range rockets as well as a missile which set an Israeli warship on fire and almost sank it .
Hamas have nothing to match that kind of armoury .
Nor do they have the self - discipline to fight like an army .
Hizbollah in Lebanon has managed to purge its region of informers .
Hamas – like all the other Palestinian outfits – is infected with spies , some working for the Palestinian Authority , others for the Israelis .
Israel has successively murdered one Hamas leader after another – " targeted killing " , of course , is their polite phrase – and they could n't do that without , as the police would say , " inside help " .
Hizbollah 's previous secretary general , Sayed Abbas Moussawi , was assassinated near Jibchit by a missile - firing Israeli helicopter more than a decade ago but the movement has n't suffered a leader 's murder in Lebanon since then .
In the 34 - day war of 2006 , Hizbollah lost about 200 of its men .
Hamas lost almost that many in the first day of Israel 's air attacks in Gaza – which does n't say much for Hamas ' military precautions .
Israel , however – always swift to announce its imminent destruction of " terrorism " – has never won a war in a built - up city , be it Beirut or Gaza , since its capture of Jerusalem in 1967 .
And it 's important to remember that the Israeli army , famous in song and legend for its supposed " purity of arms " and " elite " units , has proved itself to be a pretty third - rate army over recent years .
Not since the 1973 Middle East conflict – 35 years ago – has it won a war .
Its 1978 invasion of Lebanon was a failure , its 1982 invasion ended in disaster , propelling Arafat from Beirut but allowing its vicious Phalangist allies into the Sabra and Chatila camps where they committed mass murder .
In neither the 1993 bombardment of Lebanon nor the 1996 bombardment of Lebanon – which fizzled out after the massacre of refugees at Qana – nor the 2006 war was its performance anything more than amateur .
Indeed , if it was n't for the fact Arab armies are even more of a rabble than the Israelis , the Israeli state would be genuinely under threat from its neighbours .
One common feature of Middle East wars is the ability of all the antagonists to suffer from massive self - delusion .
Israel 's promise to " root out terror " – be it of the PLO , Hizbollah , Hamas , Islamic Jihad , Iranian or any other kind – has always turned out to be false .
" War to the bitter end , " the Israeli defence minister , Ehud Barak , has promised in Gaza .
Nonsense .
Just like the PLO 's boast – and Hamas ' boast and Hizbollah 's boast – to " liberate " Jerusalem .
Eyewash .
But the Israelis have usually shown a dangerous propensity to believe their own propaganda .
Calling up more than 6,000 reservists and sitting them round the Gaza fence is one thing ; sending them into the hovels of Gaza will be quite another .
In 2006 , Israel claimed it was sending 30,000 troops into Lebanon .
In reality , it sent about 3,000 – and the moment they crossed the border , they were faced down by the Hizbollah .
In some cases , Israeli soldiers actually ran back to their own frontier .
These are realities .
The chances of war , however , may be less easier to calculate .
If Israel indefinitely continues its billion dollar blitz on Gaza – and we all know who is paying for that – there will , at some stage , be an individual massacre ; a school will be hit , a hospital or a pre-natal clinic or just an apartment packed with civilians .
In other words , another Qana .
At which point , a familiar story will be told ; that Hamas destroyed the school / hospital / pre-natal clinic , that the journalists who report on the slaughter are anti-Semitic , that Israel is under threat , etc .
We may even get the same disingenuous parallel with a disastrous RAF raid in the Second World War which both Menachem Begin and Benjamin Netanayahu have used over the past quarter century to justify the killing of civilians .
And Hamas – which never had the courage to admit it killed two Palestinian girls with one of its own rockets last week – will cynically make profit from the grief with announcements of war crimes and " genocide " .
At which point , the deeply despised and lame old UN donkey will be clip - clopped onto the scene to rescue the Israeli army and Hamas from this disgusting little war .
Of course , saner minds may call all this off before the inevitable disaster .
But I doubt it .
Burger King will debut a new “ documentary ” later this week called Whopper Virgins , where a documentary crew takes Whopper Hamburgers to obscure locations for a taste test .
The “ documentary ” is being filmed by the now officially the mother of all sellouts “ award winning director ” Stacy Peralta and includes the use of “ 13 planes , 2 dog sleds and 1 helicopter . ”
If visiting poor people in remote locations , some who would be at best surviving on below poverty levels and throwing a burger in their faces is n’t bad enough , it gets better , because they also ask the Whopper Virgins to compare the taste of the Whopper to a McDonalds Big Mac as well .
It ’s hard to place exactly where this begins on the level of wrongness .
The pipe flute South American music on the website , the pictures of people with horse and carts on one side , and on the other someone eating a Whopper .
Hey , but that ’s ok , because the testing was “ done by independent 3rd party testers . ”
I think I ’m going to throw up now .
If you ca n’t handle the pain of viewing the website , here ’s some promotional images for the “ documentary . ”
Update : we now have confirmation that the “ documentary ” is being promoted through a TV ad campaign .
We ’re trying to track down who is hosting the site , but what we can work out is that it ’s hosted on a PR company server , and the site shares hosting with Bayer and Florida Area Audi dealers .
Frustrated of not being able to get the limited discounted gadgets you want online ?
Here are the tips that will increase your probability of success .
1. Know What You Want
This is rule number one .
You got to know what you want to buy ahead of time the day before they start selling .
That way , you ’ll have enough time to do all the preparation work .
2. Fast Internet Connection
If you still use DSL , or even worse , a 56 k modem , then the chance for you get that deal is none .
Get real high speed internet like FIOS , cable , or T1 .
3. Download Multiple Browsers
Sometimes a particular web browser works better for a specific online retailer , so download and install all major browsers ( i.e. Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Safari ) on your computer before it ’s too late .
Put the retailer ’s site in the trust site zone to speed up load time .
4. Create Accounts Ahead of Time
Most online retailers require buyers to create their accounts before letting you check out .
Do it ahead of time and remember to login first before the deal starts .
5. Store Personal / Payment Information Ahead of Time
After creating your account , store your shipping address and payment information in their system to save you some steps to check out an item .
6. Get Familiar with their Website
What the title says .
Knowing their website ’s layout and checkout process ahead of time can save you a lot of trouble .
7. Disable Your Firewall , Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware Programs
Your internet security suite will dramatically slow down your load time , so disable them to speed things up .
Be careful though .
Now your computer is more vulnerable than ever , do not go to any sites that you do n’t trust .
8. Standby Early
If the retailer tells you that they ’ll start selling at 10:00 a.m. EST , be ready at around 9:30 a.m EST !
That ’s because those sneaky bastards sometimes start selling 15 minutes prior to their official start time without telling you .
Therefore , do n’t be surprised if the on sale item is all gone before 10:00 a.m .
9. Use Shortcut Keys / Buttons to Refresh
Server timeout ?
Keeping refreshing !
Your time is running out , so use your shortcut keys / buttons on your keyboard or mouse to refresh instead of rolling your mouse pointer all the way over to the refresh button on your browser and then click on that fresh button repeatedly .
Also , you got to know how to take advantage of tap - browsing by now .
Use multiple taps to add items to cart and refresh as necessary to increase your success rate .
10 . Communicate with Experts while Trying
No matter how good you are , a hundred healthy brains are always better than yours .
Someone is going to discover some easier ways to seal the deal .
While frustrating on checking out the damn item , go to slickdeals .
net or fatwallet.com to see how the others are doing .
You ’re going to see more whinners than helpers there but do n’t give up trying .

WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration is examining a range of options for providing emergency financial help to spur a merger between General Motors and Chrysler , according to government officials .
People familiar with the discussions said the administration wanted to provide financial assistance to the deeply troubled Big Three Detroit automakers , possibly by using the Treasury Department ’s wide - ranging authority under the $ 700 billion bailout program that Congress approved this month .
Another option under consideration is to tap a $ 25 billion loan program that Congress just created to help the auto companies modernize their plants .
A third option would involve going back to Congress , immediately after the Nov. 4 election , for authority to spend funds aimed specifically at the auto industry .
But officials have not yet decided how much assistance to provide or how to structure any aid program .
G.M. and the parent of Chrysler , Cerberus Capital Management , are in talks to possibly merge the two companies , which are losing sales and hemorrhaging cash .
People close to the talks said G.M. needs between $ 5 billion and $ 10 billion in assistance , mainly to cover G.M. ’s own needs between now and the time of the merger .
We have kept quiet for a while , but we bring you good news today .

A leading critic of AIG today demanded the company 's CEO resign in the wake of the disclosure of yet another " junket " at a resort spa .
In a letter to AIG's CEO Edward Liddy , Congressman Elijah Cummings ( D - Md. ) said the decision to hold an event for independent financial advisors last week at a luxury Phoenix resort was " outrageous " given an earlier pledge by Liddy to curtail such events .
Cummings wrote that AIG can begin to restore its trust with Congress " by accepting your resignation from the positions of chairman and chief executive officer . "
Reporters for abc15.com ( KNXV ) caught top AIG executives on hidden camera at a secretive gathering last week at the luxurious Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix .
AIG instructed the hotel to make sure no company logos and signs were seen on the property , according to a company spokesman .
Click here to see the full KNXV report .
In his letter , Cummings questioned how the Phoenix event could have taken place given Liddy 's earlier assurances that " not one cent of taxpayer dollars " would by used to pay for such events .
The decision to hold the event while AIG was asking for billions of dollars more in federal loans was " even more shocking " , wrote Cummings .
" Having received this assistance , which has been nothing less than a lifeline for AIG , you have decided to continue to hold corporate parties as if nothing has fundamentally changed with your business .
Click here to read letter .
An AIG spokesman has said that Cummings " was mistaken " about the nature of the Phoenix event .
The spokesman said the meeting at the resort was for independent financial advisors and that most of the $ 343,000 cost would be paid by product sponsors .
Click here to read AIG 's full response .
Cummings asked Liddy to provide him with details on who the sponsors were and how much money they were providing , as well as an itemized list of expenses incurred by AIG .
Cummings also requested a list of each of the 160 planned events that AIG said it had cancelled on or after October 30 .
" The American taxpayers who have prevented your firm from literally disappearing will judge your commitment to re-establishing their trust by your willingness to act in accordance with their expectations for the effective and efficient use of their money , " Cummings wrote .
Meanwhile , leading government watchdog groups are also taking AIG to task over the Phoenix event .
" AIG executives should be ashamed of themselves , " said Tom Schatz , president of Citizens Against Government Waste .
" Individuals across the country are on the precipice of financial ruin while AIG personnel still attend extravagant getaways at the taxpayers ' expense . "
The watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense also weighed in on on the controversy .
" AIG officials are obviously sensitive to public perception .
Just look at how they hid their sponsorship and logos , " said Stephen Ellis , Vice President of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
" But you 're not just supposed to hide your actions , you 're supposed to change your behavior .
AIG has lined up at the taxpayer trough again and yet current leadership still seems intent on living the lavish life . "

The Crown Prosecution Service is considering , yet again , whether to prosecute and possibly imprison otherwise law - abiding Britons for helping their loved ones to die .
The parents of Daniel James , a 23 - year - old rugby player crippled in a training accident , last month accompanied him to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal .
In all hundred such cases so far , the director of public prosecutions has declined to act .
The law is clearly unfit for purpose .
This is not regarded by parliament as a sufficient reason for changing the law .
Social reform in Britain occurs not when legislators feel it appropriate but when a heart - rending case achieves mass publicity and good people launch a campaign for change .
Such has been the case with laws on homosexuality , prostitution , abortion and self - defence - and perhaps one day will apply to recreational drugs .
Westminster inertia always holds sway until it is overcome by an infuriated public .
This depends on maintaining a sufficient level of fury .
The James case streaked across the media horizon at the weekend , but is fading already .
The CPS will probably leave it alone and another opportunity for reform will have passed .
Parliament will heave a sigh of relief and return to its fascination with Corfu yachts .
There cannot be a human freedom so personal as ordering the circumstances of one 's death .
Yet Britain is instinctively collectivist , enveloped in prejudice , religion , taboo and prohibition .
We are told how to die by the state , with no consideration for individual choice .
The 1961 Suicide Act decriminalised the act of suicide , an inherently absurd diktat , but criminalised any assistance to suicide , thus making it illegal to help somebody do something legal .
The law of death is a shambles .
A leading authority on euthanasia , Professor Emily Jackson of the LSE , began a recent lecture on the subject with the sensational question : " What is the most common cause of death in Britain ? "
Her answer was " death by killing " .
And who does the killing ?
" Doctors . "
One third of all registered deaths are by deliberate morphine overdose and one third by the removal of life support , premeditated acts by medical staff .
All over Britain , families gather every day of the week in hospitals and discuss with doctors how to bring a dignified death to a loved one , often in a turmoil of grief , indecision , exhaustion and shame .
The near universal desire " to be allowed to die in my own home " is wilfully disregarded .
Parliament 's one contribution to this supreme crisis in life 's journey is to threaten one and all with suits ranging from negligence to manslaughter .
Now judges are in a position to help .
Since they cannot realistically prosecute two thirds of the medical profession , nor it seems the few desperate individuals who take their relatives to Switzerland , judges are on the verge of rewriting the law .
The stream of visitors to Dignitas may be breaking the law , yet the CPS has not prosecuted one .
This state of affairs is being tested in the high court by a 45 - year - old MS sufferer Debbie Purdy , who has asked that the DPP reveal the criteria on which he exercises his discretion over whether to prosecute , which he refuses to do .
She understandably wants to know if her husband is likely to be imprisoned for taking her to Switzerland to die .
Can she regard the 1961 act , as it appears , to be akin to the treason and other archaic acts , and defunct in practice ?
Purdy is inviting the judicial system to do what parliament has declined to do , which is to define the reasons under which euthanasia will be allowed , if not yet regulated .
In this she is supported by a YouGov poll putting support for assisted euthanasia at 86 % .
A poll for Dignity in Dying records 76 % support , and a BMA survey of doctors 56 % .
The basis on which the authorities in Switzerland , the Netherlands , Belgium and Oregon allow assisted dying varies .
All require evidence of free will on the part of the dying but differ in such preconditions as the possibility of recovery , the extent of pain and the imminence of death .
None has led to an epidemic of " killings " .
The safeguards seem robust ( compared with those governing hospitals ) .
In more than a decade , Oregon has seen just 431 assisted deaths .
The James case , now also under judicial consideration , breaks new ground .
The young man 's condition was certainly not terminal and his mental state was clear .
After a number of failed attempts at suicide , he expressed his wish to escape from " the prison " of his crippled body .
He did not want to continue " what he felt was a second - class existence ... in fear and loathing " .
He asserted his desire to do something perfectly legal , to take his own life , but was impeded by his disability from doing so .
His parents freed him from that impediment .
To prosecute them would be an outrage .
Only the most warped collectivist could argue that individuals must be kept alive against their will .
One anti-euthanasia lobby last week even insisted that assisted suicide " would deprive the disabled of the benefit of suicide prevention " .
To honour this spurious benefit , those wishing to die - and their relatives - must endure unbearable suffering at the bidding of others " for the good of society as a whole " .
I wonder what kind of society that is .
Perhaps it is one that used to ban pain relief in childbirth , banned abortion , and held homosexuality a sin .
That this should be supported by such prominent churchmen as the archbishop of Canterbury , the archbishop of Westminster and the chief rabbi is astonishing .
In years to come , their attitude will seem not just illiberal but cruel .
I might do everything I can to persuade the victim of a mortal illness or crippling injury to squeeze the last shred from whatever life still has to offer them .
I might plead the example of those who have gone that extra mile and enhanced the lives of others thereby .
What can not be right is for me to deny those whose unfettered judgment has reached a wish to die , the freedom of this , the last of life 's great dignities .
It is specious to claim that no safeguards can be put in place to protect against abuse .
We have safeguards aplenty to regulate such risky social activities as drinking , driving , matrimony and procreation .
We can draw up rules to govern the process of dying .
This hangover of religious primitivism must surely end .
Yet again we must turn to judges rather than members of parliament to uphold a modern liberty .

Shameless , clueless Sarah Palin , speaking at a Florida rally today , did her Obama the terrorist - sympathizer schtick , leading one supporter in the audience to yell " Kill Him ! "
Palin 's response ?
Nada .
" Now it turns out , one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers , " Palin said .
" Boooo ! " said the crowd .
" And , according to the New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , ' launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol , ' " she continued .
" Boooo ! " the crowd repeated .
" Kill him ! " proposed one man in the audience .
Palin went on to say that " Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers 's living room , and they 've worked together on various projects in Chicago . "
If only cars could last so long .
This month , a satellite resembling a shiny spinning drum and orbiting 21,156 miles above Earth celebrated its 41st birthday , astounding engineers and scientists , some of them the children of those who built it .
For years , the satellite has served as an emergency communications link for rescue operations , including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the 1980 Mt. St. Helens volcanic eruption .
It was supposed to live for only three years when it was launched in 1967 .
That ’s when Lyndon B. Johnson was president and bell - bottom pants were the rage .
But the spacecraft , known as ATS 3 , is n’t alone .
Many satellites are operating well past their life expectancy , so much so that manufacturers are hurting from lack of demand for new , replacement satellites .
Advertisement
And those who are buying are asking for guarantees that the new satellites , which can cost as much as $ 300 million each , will last two to three times as long as the early birds .
“ It ’s a mixed blessing , ” said John S. Edwards , a space industry analyst for Forecast International .
“ It says great things about your product , but the satellite - making business is floundering because there are hardly any sales . ”
Engineers at Boeing Co.'s sprawling satellite - making plant in El Segundo know about the sales drought only too well .
Of the 245 Boeing satellites that have been launched into service , 166 have exceeded their design life .
That ’s more than two - thirds of the spacecraft built at the facility since the 1960s .
A third of all satellites have lasted at least twice as long as expected .
Advertisement
That has been the bane of the sales department .
With the telecom bust early this decade and consolidation in the satellite services industry , Boeing has sold only one commercial satellite this year .
In the late - 1990s boom years , it was tallying a dozen orders annually .
Some satellites are living longer because the initial estimates of their longevity were conservative , but many have operated well beyond even the wildest expectations .
“ In designing them , we had to take into account all the worst - case scenarios , ” said Art Rosales , Boeing ’s director of commercial and civil satellite services and a 29 - year veteran of the satellite business .
Because most satellites can’t be repaired once they ’re in space , every contingency was considered .
“ The worst cases did n’t happen , and that has translated to longer life , ” he said .

Last month , a satellite that was providing an Internet connection for scientists at the South Pole was retired , more than three decades after it went into service .
It was designed for a life span of five years .
The satellite ’s longevity “ has been truly remarkable , ” said Kay Sears , president of a government services subsidiary of Intelsat Ltd. , a satellite operator .
“ No one could have ever imagined that its power supply and batteries could have lasted this long . ”
In retiring the Marisat F2 satellite last month , Intelsat used up the remaining fuel on board to move it about 125 miles away from its original orbit so it would stay out of the way of other geosynchronous satellites before its power was shut off for good .
So - called GEO satellites orbit at the same speed as the Earth ’s rate of rotation , allowing them to remain stationary relative to the ground .
They are often used for communications , like giant radio transmission towers relaying signals from one place on Earth to another .
Advertisement
Intelsat ’s Marisat joined a cadre of about 2,000 decommissioned satellites that orbit the Earth as space debris .
Some deactivated satellites that orbit a few hundred miles from terra firma eventually burn up in the atmosphere , although fragments of some large satellites have been known to strike Earth .
There are an estimated 800 active satellites , including those built for secret military operations .
With satellites operating much longer than anticipated , customers are expecting more from the new generation of birds , which has led to headline - grabbing setbacks .
Boeing suffered a $ 1 - billion loss a few years ago , after technical problems delayed the delivery of new , more powerful satellites .
Some take up to 18 months to build .
Advertisement
The expected life span of the early generation was three to four years .
In succeeding generations those expectations rose to seven to eight years and then 10 to 12 years .
“ Nowadays , the standard design life is 15 years and everybody expects them to last over 20 years , ” said Marco A. Caceras , senior space analyst for the aerospace research firm Teal Group Corp .
With even older satellites lasting more than 20 years , some engineers have become emotionally attached to them .
“ It ’s like raising children .
They have tantrums and fits , ” said Erika Roesler - Wong , regional manager for Boeing ’s customer operations support center in El Segundo , where she helps satellite owners trouble - shoot problems .
She ’s kept an eye on some satellites for nearly 20 years .

When they have to be retired -- many are turned off because they ’re running out of fuel needed to keep them in a specific orbit -- Roesler - Wong gets a bit choked up .
“ It is sad , ” she said .
“ But you need to get over it because there are other children around . ”

PESHAWAR , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Pakistani militants attacked a parked convoy of trucks carrying military vehicles for Western forces in Afghanistan near Peshawar early on Sunday , destroying 96 trucks , police said .
Security guards said they were overpowered by more than 200 militants who attacked two terminals on the ring road round the northwestern city of Peshawar , where the trucks carrying Humvees and other military vehicles were parked .
“ It happened at around 2.30 a.m .
They fired rockets , hurled hand grenades and then set ablaze 96 trucks , ” senior police officer Azeem Khan told Reuters .
Most of the fuel and other supplies for U.S. and NATO forces in landlocked Afghanistan are trucked through Pakistan , much of it through the mountainous Khyber Pass between Peshawar , capital of North - West Frontier Province and the border town of Torkham .
Khan said one private security guard was killed in an exchange of fire between police and the militants .
“ They were shouting Allah - o - Akbar ( God is Great ) and Down With America .
They broke into the terminals after snatching our guns , ” said Mohammad Rafiullah , security guard at one terminal .
Militants destroyed 22 trucks carrying food supplies in the same area a week ago .
Last month the government closed the main supply route to Western forces in Afghanistan for a week after militants hijacked more than a dozen trucks on the road through the Khyber Pass .
ISLAMIST MILITANTS IN KHYBER PASS
There have been signs this year that Islamist militancy has spread to the area from more distant tribal regions where the Taliban and al Qaeda have taken root .
Peshawar city police chief Safwat Ghayyur said the government planned to launch an operation against “ miscreants ” soon .
“ A plan of operation is in place as we have crafted a strategy in which we will have to go after them , ” he said .
The other main land route to Afghanistan runs from the southwestern city of Quetta through the border town of Chaman to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar .
Pakistani forces are battling al Qaeda and Taliban militants in the northwest .
The militants have retaliated with a campaign of suicide bombings , particularly against security forces in the ethnic Pashtun tribal regions on the Afghan border .
The violence has raised concern about nuclear - armed Pakistan ’s stability as its eight - month - old civilian government is also grappling with an economic crisis .
Apart from the deteriorating security situation in the northwest , the government is trying to handle tension with India resulting from the militant attack that killed 171 people in Mumbai at the end of last month .
India and U.S. officials believe the attackers came from Pakistan , and New Delhi is demanding that Islamabad take action against their alleged backers .
News yesterday that a group of 700 conservative clergies in the U.S. and Canada have voted to split from the Episcopal Church is the latest and deepest rift yet in the Anglican Communion ’s fight over the issue of gay unions and clergy .
For me , this story is personal .
I ’ve been a fairly active member of the Church my whole life and yesterday ’s schism has me feeling confused , disappointed and even , as a gay person , also a little guilty .
The newly formed Anglican Church of the U.S. is the latest move by conservative church leaders to force the Episcopal Church of the United States to shift rightward .
In 2003 , the church famously approved the ordination of openly - gay New Hampshire bishop Gene Robinson and also began recognizing gay unions , though officially it no longer permits priests to perform the rite–even though many continue to do so .
Conservative church leadersÂ in the U.S. began affiliating their congregations with African dioceses as a way to protest the church ’s embrace of LGBT people .
This summer , with the global church increasingly dominated by conservatives , especially in Africa , where the religion is experiencing its biggest growth , the worldwide community issued a statement that basically told the U.S. Church that it ’s continued embrace of LGBT people put it at odds with the greater church .
This being Anglicanism , though - – it was done extremely politiely .
Being raised in the Church , I ’ve always been proud of its egalitarian qualities .
Formed the Church of England in 1533 as a way for Henry the VII to divorce Catherine of Aragon , the Church is about as democratic as a Christian religion can be .
It has no official head , with the Archbishop of Canterbury , currently Rowan Williams , being the closest thing : a “ first among equals . ”
The Church with its belief that human reason and intelligence has as much a place at the altar as scripture and creed does kept me interested throughout high school and I have great memories of serving as an acolyte at my church , going on camping trips and doing puppet shows for challenged kids through my youth group and learning about both the historical and liturgical traditions of my faith .
I ’ve always wondered if the reason I do n’t harbor a lot of the dismissive anger that many gay people hold towards Christianity is because the Church I grew up in did n’t seem to have any problem with gays and lesbians .
When the son of our youth group leader came out , nobody batted an eye and I remember a trip to Toronto where my parents took us to Church on Sunday only to realize half - way through the service that the congregation was primarily gay men .
Â
When people argue that Christians are instinctively and reflexively homophobic , I feel compelled to argue that in my experience , it ’s just simply not true .
In recent years , my attendance at Church has slipped .
Partly , it ’s the hectic lifestyle I lead , but partly it ’s because of the increasing schism happening in my Church– and the strange sense that it ’s people like me who ’s at the heart if it .
It ’s awkward having your spiritual family fight over you .
I take a lot of pride in the fact that the Episcopal Church has n’t backed down and reversed its support for gays and lesbians , despite all the pressure that ’s been put on it .
It was heartening to see the Church release a statement yesterday that read :
“ We will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting but simply continue to be clear that the Episcopal Church , along with the Anglican Church of Canada and La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico , comprise the official , recognized presence of the Anglican Communion in North America .
And we reiterate what has been true of Anglicanism for centuries — that there is room within the Episcopal Church for people with different views , and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in Christ . ”
It ’s the whole gay marriage debate write small :
The clergies which are departing the Church have decided that they can not live in a world of multiple viewpoints and ideas .
It ’s strange to me that they choose dogma over fellowship , that they would rather be alone with their beliefs than to be part of a wider community .
The gay community is founded on diversity , but how do we teach that to a wider audience ?
How do we explain that the sometimes uncomfortable contradictions and disagreements we live with make us collectively a richer people than if we all stood in the corner clutching on to our own sacred cows ?
It seems lately that we ’ve reached the point of no going back .
Be it over Prop 8 or gay adoption or gay clergy , there are those willing to accept diversity and tolerance and there are those who wo n’t .
Â
Do we abandon the people who wo n’t listen and dismiss them just as they have dismissed us , or is there another way ?
How do you love someone who tells you that your love is wrong ?
Do n’t bother looking for any electronic records of Carol Browner ’s first stint as a federal government executive .
The soon - to - be Obama administration climate czar intentionally did n’t keep many .
In sworn testimony obtained by The Washington Times , Ms. Browner disclosed that she refused to use e-mail when she served as President Clinton ’s Environmental Protection Agency chief in the 1990s for fear of leaving a digital trail .
She also ordered her government computer hard drive wiped clean of records just before leaving office .
“ It was a conscious decision not to use a piece of equipment or to learn how to use a piece of equipment because I did n’t want to be in a situation similar to what I had been in Florida , ” she testified about government computers .
The testimony referred to her days as an environmental regulator in Florida , where an e-mail message sent to her surfaced in litigation .
“ This is why I made this decision not to use my computer , ” she said .
“ I was very careful . ”
Ms. Browner ’s sworn statements were gathered in a little - noticed civil case involving the government ’s obligation to preserve its official records that transpired after Ms. Browner left office in January 2001 .
The lawsuit examined why EPA officials failed to save electronic records that chronicled the Clinton administration ’s final actions in office and that were being sought by a conservative legal group under federal open - records laws .
The same day a judge ordered the agency to preserve such records , Ms. Browner asked a staff member that any files on her government computer be erased , prompting allegations of a possible cover-up .
The ensuing investigation ultimately cleared Ms. Browner of any wrongdoing , concluding she was unaware of the judge ’s order .
Her former agency , however , did n’t fare as well .
It was found in contempt of court for failing to preserve government records at the heart of the case .
While exonerated , Ms. Browner ’s testimony provided a rare insight into her distaste for keeping historical government records in electronic form .
It ’s an aversion that concerns some government watchdogs as she prepares to take the high - profile job of coordinating President - elect Barack Obama ’s efforts against global warming .
“ Obviously , it ’s troubling that public officials would avoid doing things because they ’re afraid the public might see it later , ” said Mike Surrusco , senior researcher at Common Cause , a nonpartisan group that monitors government ethics and openness .
Charles Davis , executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition at the University of Missouri , said avoiding computers and e-mail “ seems a little drastic and over the top . ”
“ It ’s regrettable , ” Mr. Davis added .
“ It seems a rejection of the entire inertia of the marketplace to forswear digital communications . ”
Obama aides declined to say whether Ms. Browner plans to use email or computers in her new job but said she worked to improve transparency during her years at the EPA , where she made decisions on written memos instead of e-mails .
She is hardly the only high - ranking government official to avoid e-mail .
Former Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and current Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff have opted not to use e-mail on the job , either , according to a 2006 House report .
And President Bush has cited personal privacy issues for his decision to forgo e-mail .
In her deposition , Ms. Browner said she instructed her staff to remove her computer when she first took office at the EPA , though she later kept it when told the computer was assigned to her office .
Still , she said she hardly ever used it and relied on her staff to sort through e-mails and print out important messages .
In Florida , she said she was overwhelmed by e-mail .
She also said during her 2001 deposition that during her years as an environmental regulator in Florida , she once had to provide affidavits after an internal e-mail sent to her surfaced in litigation involving a permitting issue
“ I thought , you know what ?
I do n’t need this .
I do n’t need to go there again , I do n’t need to deal with this .
I will not use e-mail , and I did not use e-mail . ”
Just before leaving office , Ms. Browner ordered that the hard drive of her computer be wiped clean , though a group had been seeking a court injunction to preserve her records .
She said she was n’t told to keep the computer records intact in connection with the FOIA lawsuit , but wanted to make sure that computer games her son installed on her work computer were removed .
Landmark Legal Foundation ’s president , Mark R. Levin , who sued the EPA and was among the lawyers at Ms. Browner ’s deposition , said her answers suggested a “ culture of deniability ” during her years at the agency .
“ She was the most disconnected senior official I have ever come across in government , ” Mr. Levin said .
Tommy Vietor , a spokesman for the Obama transition team , disputed Mr. Levin ’s criticism , calling Landmark “ a partisan attack group that fought clean - air standards and efforts to get arsenic out of drinking water . ”
“ Carol Browner ’s record at EPA is marked by her work to increase the public ’s right to know about toxic chemicals in the air and water , and her efforts to improve the government ’s responsiveness to environmental issues , ” he said .
“ Both a judge and inspector general report found that Ms. Browner did nothing wrong ” by ordering her computer files deleted , Mr. Vietor said .
Meredith Fuchs , general counsel to the nonpartisan National Security Archive , which collects and publishes declassified government records , said government officials have to walk a fine line when it comes to e-mail .
“ A lot of these officials look at the record laws as a limitation of what they can do , ” she said .
“ But they ’re doing things on behalf of the public , and there has to be some transparency about what they ’re doing . ”
On the other hand , Ms. Fuchs added , “ We do n’t want these people heading big agencies reading e-mail all day . ”

Staff at hospital which ignored dying man for six hours posed as Hollywood stars for calendar shoot
Smiling for the camera , these are staff at the hospital where a dying man was not seen for six hours - posing for a calendar in which they mock waiting times .
Stewart Fleming , 37 , was left doubled up in agony despite arriving in casualty with a letter from his GP saying he needed immediate attention .
After he was finally seen on December 15 , he rapidly deteriorated .
He died two days after Christmas from a viral illness .
Fooling around :
But staff might now regret joking about waiting times at the hospital in their charity calendar
Cardiology assistant practitioner Leanne Thomas dressed up as Baywatch 's Pamela Anderson
Yesterday , his family questioned the hospital 's decision to release the charity calendar .
Mr Fleming 's sister - in - law , Lesley Mavin , 39 , said that she did not want to criticise efforts to raise money for a good cause .
However , she added : ' Their main job is to be a hospital . '
The calendar was launched at Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham , Kent on December 17 , and features doctors and nurses dressed up as stars from Fawlty Towers , Baywatch , Open All Hours and Pirates of the Caribbean .
In one picture a nurse and two medics pose next to a sign that reads : ' Waiting time 26.5 seconds ! '.
In another , a member of staff in a swimsuit clutches a first aid kit and pretends to help a drowning man in a hospital bath .
While there is no suggestion any of the staff involved in the shooting of the calendar have behaved improperly , patients yesterday said they felt that its publication was in poor taste .
The Medway hospital has previously come under the spotlight for a string of blunders .
These include the body of a dead patient being left undiscovered on a toilet for 12 hours , and the case of 31 - year - old Peter Cura , who died after Medway medics failed to spot his cancer despite 37 visits to the hospital .
' Jack Sparrow ' poses for February ( left ) .
Staff took on the classic sitcom Fawlty Towers for January
Nurse Christina Hemsley and patient Tanya Outen launched the calendar to raise funds for the hospital 's cancer unit .
Miss Hemsley said : ' We came up with the idea of a calendar full of celebrity look - a- likes because there are so many people at the hospital who closely resemble celebrities .
' Everyone was really supportive and they were more than happy to be photographed for such a good cause . '

But one outpatient , who did not want to be named , said yesterday : ' The simple fact that medical staff took time out of their day to pose up for these rather ridiculous photos must grate with the family of Stewart Fleming and anyone else who has an issue with the hospital . '
Mr Fleming 's GP , Dr Tamil Selvan , yesterday called for an inquiry into why his patient was left at the back of the queue - despite having a note specifying that he needed rapid admission .
Dr Selvan , 51 , said : ' I was very disappointed to hear what happened , and I sympathise with the family .
The Daily Mail 's headline on Monday
' As a GP , I am trained to recognise when a patient is acutely ill , or suffering from a condition that may have serious consequences .
' Doctors in primary care ( GPs ) endeavour to do the best they can , but when we refer patients to hospital for whatever reason , we expect the full support of our colleagues in secondary care . '
Mr Fleming , 37 , of Rainham , Kent was married to Sarah , 42 .
They had two children , 14 - year - old Lauren and 12 - year - old Matthew .
Mrs Fleming has criticised her husband 's wait for treatment for his mystery illness .
She said : ' He could have had all those hours on a monitor and they might have been able to stop the virus . '
Oft - spurned Senator repeats request for White House torture docs Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Patrick Leahy , in his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , has often found himself on the receiving end of a metaphorical middle finger from the White House when he 's tried to exercise oversight of the Bush administration .
Undeterred , Leahy reiterated his request for White House torture documents following reports that the White House sent the CIA memos explicitly authorizing the use of the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding .
Leahy and Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the committee 's ranking member , most recently requested any and all White House waterboarding documents in August , but the White House said it had already been fully cooperative .
Cue Leahy 's surprise when that assurance turned out to be untrue .
" I now read in The Washington Post that the White House issued two previously undisclosed memoranda to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 , " Leahy wrote Wednesday in a letter to White House counsel Fred Fielding .
" It is disturbing to be reminded , at this late date , of the stonewalling , misdirection and lack of accountability that has characterized this administration from its first days in office . "
Leahy said he and the committee 's staff were " surprised " by the Post 's report on explicit waterboarding authorization .
CIA had requested the memos in 2002 fearing that high ranking Bush administration officials would try to avoid accountability in the event that the use of waterboarding became public .
The pair of memos was sent in 2003 and 2004 .
A former intelligence official described CIA 's view on waterboarding to the Post as , " ' We do n't want to continue unless you tell us in writing that it 's not only legal but is the policy of the administration . ' "
Previous memos from the Justice Department , including several 2002 memos obtained by the ACLU and previously reported on by RAW STORY indicated that Justice had signed off on waterboarding .
The Post article was the first indication of explicit White House approval .
" I would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible , " Leahy wrote to Fielding , " regarding what additional materials exist that have not been shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee . "
Leahy 's full letter is reprinted below :
Mr. Fred Fielding , Esq .
Counsel to the President
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W .
Washington , D.C. 20500
Dear Mr. Fielding :
You and I have communicated several times about the Judiciary Committees oversight and legislative interest in the Governments use of torture , such as waterboarding , and other harsh interrogation practices .
Most recently , Senator Specter and I wrote to you in August , again seeking materials about the legal justification for these practices .
In your August 22 response , you refused our requests while claiming that the White House has been most accommodating to this Committee and to the Congress in its inquiries on these matters .
Several Judiciary Committee Republicans went so far as to rely on your letter while contending that the White House had been forthcoming and there was no need to subpoena Department of Justice materials that have been withheld during the last five years .
I now read in The Washington Post that the White House issued two previously undisclosed memoranda to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 .
It is disturbing to be reminded , at this late date , of the stonewalling , misdirection and lack of accountability that has characterized this administration from its first days in office .
Not only did those White House memoranda come as a surprise to me and the Senate Judiciary Committee , but I see from Chairman Rockefellers reaction that he was kept in the dark , as well .
I would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible regarding what additional materials exist that have not been shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Sincerely ,
PATRICK LEAHY
Chairman
( CNN ) -- Researchers have discovered a previously unknown group of rare monkeys in the forests of Vietnam .
The Tonkin snub - nosed monkeys were so skittish , researchers captured a photo of only one : an adult male .
Several biologists caught fleeting glimpses of about 15 or 20 Tonkin snub - nosed monkeys in a remote area near the Chinese frontier , the wildlife conservation group Fauna & Flora International said Thursday .
The " bizarre - looking " monkeys -- on the brink of extinction -- were so skittish around people that researchers were able to snap a photo of just one of them : an adult male scampering through the trees .
The monkeys were " very sensitive to the presence of people , giving warning signs to one another and fleeing " whenever biologists approached , the group said in a statement .
" It was apparent that the monkeys associated humans with danger -- perhaps due to ongoing threats from hunters , " the group said .
So few Tonkin snub - nosed monkeys have survived in the wild that scientists thought until recently that they were extinct .
Now they estimate that roughly 200 remain , mainly in parts of northern Vietnam near the Chinese border .
Hunters with a taste for bush meat and the loss of habitat have pushed the Tonkin snub - nosed monkey toward extinction , according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .
It classifies the primate as critically endangered " because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals , with no subpopulation greater than 50 mature individuals , and it is experiencing a continuing decline . "
Fauna & Flora said it is working with a variety of groups to improve the livelihoods and " reduce human pressures on the forest ecosystem " in an effort to safeguard the newly discovered group , which was spotted in a patch of forest in the Quan Ba district of Vietnam 's Ha Giang province .
The sighting thrilled conservation biologist Le Khac Quyet , described by Fauna & Flora as " one of the few people in the world who can claim to be an expert on this mysterious species " and as the person credited with discovering the new group of that species .
" When I saw the Tonkin snub - nosed monkeys ... I was overjoyed , " he said in the Fauna & Flora statement .
" There is still time to save this unique species , but with just 200 or so left and threats still strong , we need to act now . "

7 The Internet Subculture Oozed Into the Real World

How many of you had a secret club when you were in school ?
Maybe you did n't have an actual tree house to meet in or a secret handshake , but at the very least you had a series of inside jokes and references that absolutely nobody else would get in a thousand years .
But what if one day you heard the football team borrowing those jokes ?
Or worse , the teachers ?
What would that say about your club ?
Now imagine what the first few message board friends who started " Rickrolling " each other a couple of years ago must have felt like when they saw Rick Astley interrupt the 2008 Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade with " Never Gonna Give You Up " ...

... to universal laughter and applause by the crowd .
" Ah , yes , " said countless middle aged housewives and Armani - wearing stockbrokers , " I do believe we have been Rickrolled ! "
It was just the latest in a long line of the Internet subculture 's invasions into the mainstream .
The guys who remember that thread on Something Awful a few years ago , where everybody chipped in wacky facts about Vin Diesel ( and later , Chuck Norris ) saw that inside forum joke get mentioned in the 2008 presidential campaign .
Oh and you can buy the bound version of it in book stores .

Then we have the Anonymous protests against Scientology , where members of the 4chan boards and others formed the world 's largest flash mob to take on the cult while wearing V for Vendetta masks , making international news in the process .
Many thought this would stand as their largest accomplishment , but it turned out to be a distant second .
The first was when , after invading her message boards , they induced Oprah Winfrey to repeat about three different 4 chan memes at once on national television , culminating with the phrase " over 9000 penises . "
We guess you have to take the good with the bad from Anonymous .
And to be honest we 're not even sure which one that was .
Decades after farmers drove onto the Gilmore property to sell their produce during the Depression , a new generation of farmers is coming back to 3rd and Fairfax –- now the Original Farmers Market .
Holiday shoppers regularly paused this afternoon for samples of satsumas from Penryn Orchard Specialties .
Jeff Rieger , who drives south from Placer County for the Santa Barbara and Santa Monica markets , set up tables at midday with crates of satsumas , lemons and Hachiya persimmons -- one of the eight varieties he grows -- under the clock tower on the market plaza .
A cheese vendor was waylaid by snow - closed roads .
On Friday , Saturday and Sunday , four farms will sell seasonal wreaths and flowers , grapes and citrus fruit , goat cheese and other products .
Officials at the Farmers Market have for some time been thinking about adding farmers , said Stan Savage Jr. , the manager .
“ It ’s how we started originally .
It ’s something I wanted to do for a long time , ” Savage said .
“ The grocery component of the market is very important . ”
Savage said he also hopes to draw chefs to the market , but does not want to keep the farmers from the spots where they already set up stalls .
“ It ’s going to be a lot of fun , ” he said .
“ It ’s good for everybody . ”
No decisions have been made about how to include farmers permanently , but Savage has ideas .
He would like to see a rotating group of farmers , with nine or 10 coming each day .
The details have n’t been worked out .
There could be a permanent spot that vendors would share .
Or there could be more traditional stalls .
Vendors could be inside or outside .

“ NORMALLY , we cannot know God , ” says Rizwan Qadeer , a neat and amiable inhabitant of Lahore , Western - dressed and American - educated , eyes shining behind his spectacles .
“ But our saints , they have that knowledge . ”
Mr Qadeer is standing in the belly of a shrine that he is building to a modern gnostic , Hafiz Iqbal , whom he venerates especially .
Cool , and smelling pleasantly of damp earth and mortar , it holds Iqbal 's grave , covered by an embroidered green shroud and sprinkled with pink rose petals .
A young man — a Pakistani resident of London , Mr Qadeer says — stands in silent prayer to the saint , who was employed by Lahore 's municipal government as a street - sweeper , and died in 2001 .
In a tradition of popular Sufism , which mingles classical Islamic mysticism with Hinduism and folk beliefs and is a dominant feature of Islam in South Asia , the saint 's divine essence , or baraka , emanates from his tomb .
“ Physically , our holy saints do die , ” says Mr Qadeer .
“ But the spirit is still here , because they have reached eternity . ”
Echoing down a winding stairwell , a scraping of masonry and clink of chisel on marble signal a remarkable monument rising .
It is in the scruffy Lahori suburb of Baghbanpura , where Iqbal lived for six decades .
From a narrow alley running alongside the shrine , it is mostly hidden : its high outer walls , of recessed brickwork speckled with multicoloured tiles , rising out of sight to a pair of domes and skinny minarets .
A few steep steps lead into a small cloistered forecourt , where masons are at work .
Either side of the forecourt , about ten metres apart , are two false burial chambers .
These are beautifully decorated , with white marble lattice and marble mosaics studded with green jade , lapis lazuli and agate .
One is for Iqbal and the other for his mentor , a mystic called Baba Hassan Din , who lived in a brick cell on this site and died in 1968 .
The men's true graves lie underneath , in brick - walled chambers , faintly murmuring with the sounds of the street outside .
According to Mr Qadeer — who had it from Iqbal — Din was , unbeknown to many of his disciples , an Englishman from Birmingham who , early in the last century , abandoned his family and his job on the railways to become a Sufi ascetic .
His real name was Alfred , or possibly Albert , Victor .
He received his vocation one fine summer evening , in a visitation from Abu Hassan Ali Hujwiri , an 11th - century Persian saint , who is better known as Data Ganj Bakhsh .
In the 1950s , according to Mr Qadeer , Din arrived in Lahore , and passed himself off as a Punjabi .
He also adopted a poor local boy , Iqbal , and raised him to be a scholar .
According to Mr Qadeer , Iqbal earned several degrees from Government College University , Lahore — one of Pakistan 's finest .
But in the early 1960s he embarked on his own spiritual training : taking a job as a sweeper , under an assumed Christian identity .
He could not have sunk lower .
In the Hindu caste system , which is still discernible in Muslim Pakistan , many generations after its inhabitants converted from Hinduism , street - sweeping is a profession for “ untouchables ” .
Most Christians in Pakistan and India were originally members of that despised Hindu group .
Mr Qadeer , a well - to - do , secular Pakistani , who studied engineering at the University of Houston , became a follower of Iqbal in 1990 .
He was referred to him in a state of anguish , which he credits the saint , an irascible chain - smoker , with ending .
He also believes Iqbal cured his young daughter of a rare intestinal ailment .
Other disciples of Iqbal attribute miracles to him , including curing cancer .
They say he was omniscient .
They believe that , as the height of Sufi attainment , Iqbal knew God .
The stringent , legalistic creeds of the Taliban and other revivalists are on the rise in South Asia , but only a minority follow them .
Most of the 450 m Muslims in Pakistan , India and Bangladesh — nearly a third of the Islamic world — practise a gentler , more tolerant faith , in which pre-Islamic superstitions are still evident .
It is strongly influenced by Sufism , an esoteric and , in theory , nonsectarian Muslim tradition , which is strictly followed by a much smaller number of disciplined initiates .
In its popular form , Sufism is expressed mainly through the veneration of saints , including self - styled mystics like those in Lahore , canonised by their followers .
South Asia is littered with the tombs of those saints .
They include great medieval monuments , like the 13th - century shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti , founder of South Asia 's pre-eminent Sufi order , in Ajmer .
But for every famous grave , there are thousands of roadside shrines , jutting into Delhi 's streets , or sprinkled across the craggy deserts of southern Pakistan .
On a single hillside in Pakistan 's province of Punjab , outside the town of Thatta , legend has it that 125,000 Muslim saints are buried .
Pakistan 's southernmost state of Sindh , a vast desert bisected by the Indus river , is perhaps best known for its shrines .
A few miles outside the city of Hyderabad , in sight of the Indus , a middle - aged dwarf called Subhan manages one of them .
She found the shrine deserted a few years ago , and moved into it .
It is a small shack , with a low doorway hung with cowbells , in the tradition of a Hindu temple .
A dusty green shroud covers the grave .
Incense burns at its foot .
Subhan says it holds the dust of a medieval saint called Haji Pir Marad .
Sometimes , she says , he wrestles with the Indus to prevent it from changing course .
In fits of terrible rage , he has caused pileups on the road .
She advises passing motorists to propitiate the saint with a modest gift of rupees .
On a good day , she collects around 50 rupees ( 60 cents ) from the travellers who stop to pray .
All the traffic , on that recent sunny day , was bound for the nearby town of Sehwan Sharif , where Lal Shahbaz Qalandar , one of Pakistan 's most prominent Sufi saints , is entombed .
It was the 734th anniversary of his death , an event marked by an annual festival attended by several hundred thousand devotees .
This event is known as Qalandar 's urs , or wedding - night , to signify his union with God .
A three - day orgy of music , dancing and intoxication , literally and spiritually , the urs at Sehwan is one of the best parties in Pakistan , or anywhere .
Outside Qalandar 's shrine , a white marble monument , decorated with flashing neon , pilgrims work themselves into an all - night ecstasy .
Tossing their long black hair , a dozen prostitutes from Karachi or Lahore have a place reserved by the shrine 's golden doorway , to dance a furious jig .
It is the dhammal , a rhythmic skipping from foot to foot , for which Qalandar 's followers are well - known .
Thousands are moshing to a heavy drumbeat .
The air is hot and wet with their sweat .
A scent of rose petals and hashish sweetens it .
In a flash of gold , out in the crush , a troupe of bandsmen in braided Sergeant Pepper uniforms are blowing inaudibly into brass instruments , then lifting trumpets and trombones into the air as they dance the dhammal .
Fighting through the crowd , a stream of peasant pilgrims flows into the shrine .
Many carry glittering shrouds , lovingly embroidered by a wife or mother , as an offering for the tomb .
They will be bestowed with a poor man 's prayer , for a good harvest , debt relief , or a son .
“ Last year I told my master [ Qalandar ] that I would bring him a goat if he gave me a son .
I have come to honour that promise , ” said Muhammad Riaz Rahman , a shopkeeper from Multan , tugging a calm - looking billy , daubed with pink dye , through the crowd .
To orthodox Sufis , all this is absurd .
Islam 's mystical strain , like the Jewish and Christian traditions it somewhat resembles , is a strictly delineated path to self - knowledge .
The proper Sufi seeks to attain this state through rigorous disciplines , of which dhikr , the remembrance of God , by reciting or meditating on his name , is the most common .
Through self - knowledge , the devout mystic strives to attain knowledge of God Himself .
This sets Sufis apart from Islam 's other functionaries , its jurists , or mullahs , and its theologians .
Throughout Islamic history , Sufis and mullahs , dedicated to enforcing Koranic laws , have clashed .
Mullahs demand obedience ; Sufis tend to stress tolerance .
In their poetry , which mullahs shudder to read , Sufis often represent the state of rapture that they seek in the language of physical love or drunkenness .
“ I have no concern but carousing and rapture , ” wrote Rumi , Sufism 's greatest poet , whose followers , of the Turkey - based Mawlawi order , remember him in a whirling dance , the saga , which has become synonymous in the West with all Sufism .

Building Baba Hassan
Din's shrine
Yet — despite what the hordes at Sehwan may believe — orthodox Sufis are also law - abiding Muslims .
There should be no contradiction between these two positions .
“ Sufism is Islam and Islam is Sufism , ” says Khwaja Hasan Thani Nizami , the hereditary keeper of the shrine of Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi .
In orthodox Islam , for example , the limits of sainthood are strictly prescribed .
Dead Muslim saints cannot intercede with God or perform miracles .
If Muslims pray at their shrines , it can only be for the dead man 's salvation .
They may not pray to him , which would be shirk , a form of idolatry .
According to Ahmed Javed , a bearded Pakistani Sufi and scholar : “ You ca n't ask a dead saint to mediate , to solve a problem , to fulfil a wish , never , never , never .
That is shirk in law and in Sufism . ”
But South Asians never have been terribly law - abiding .
Nor , during the centuries - old process of Islamisation that they led , have the Sufi orders always insisted that they should be .
This really began in the 13th century , soon after the conquest of Delhi by an army of Persian - speaking Afghans .
A powerful Sufi order , the Chistis , proceeded to spread across north India , led by Chisti , the great mystic buried in Ajmer .
Chisti's initiates wore motley , practised poverty , neglected their families and despised the Muslim sultans and emperors who would rule India for five centuries .
In the words of a famous Chisti couplet : “ Why must you enter the doors of emirs and sultans ?
You are walking in the steps of Satan ! ”
The Chistis were known for their love of poetry and , especially , music .
Pilgrim - poets still gather in the shrine of Nizamuddin Auliya , another great Chisti saint and poet , in Delhi , wearing the yellow pixie - hats of the order 's initiates .
Under Chisti influence , low - caste Hindus converted to Islam , to escape their low birth .
Women , who are everywhere prominent in Sufism , were also especially welcomed .
Perhaps most remarkably , the Chistis accepted recalcitrant non-Muslims as Sufi initiates .
This set the tone for an astonishingly harmonious cohabitation between Hindus and Muslims in South Asia which continues , though it is sorely tested , to this day .
In the shrine of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai , a great poet of Sindh , musicians gather to sing hymns .
As their voices rise , in the blue - tiled portico of the shrine , a line of brightly clad Hindu women traipse in from the Sindhi desert which , for nomads like them , is still an open border to India .
The Pakistani Muslim crowd , seated cross-legged on the forecourt , stirs to give them room .
The women pass through , to give obeisance to Bhitai 's tomb .
It is a moving scene .
For its message of tolerance , Sufism has long been fashionable outside the Muslim world .
Outside Philadelphia , amid rolling green hills , is the shrine of Muhammad Raheem Bawa Muhaiyaddeen , a Sri Lankan Sufi saint , who died in America in 1986 .
In recent times , moreover , Western interest in Islamic mysticism has become urgent .
Some American commentators see Sufis as potential allies in a hostile Muslim world .
A report by RAND Corporation , an American think - tank , recommended bolstering Sufism , as an “ open , intellectual interpretation of Islam ” .
On the face of it , this makes sense .
In north - western Pakistan , where the Taliban rule , the Pushtuns have often taken against Sufi saints .
According to the 1911 Census of British India , the Afridi tribe , having no shrine to worship at , “ induced by generous offers a saint of the most notorious piety to take up his abode among them . ”
They then slit his throat , buried his corpse , and built a splendid shrine over it .
These days , alas , they would probably not build the shrine : the Taliban tend to consider Sufism idolatrous .
They are in the same puritan camp as Saudi Arabia 's unforgiving Wahhabi sect , their sometime sponsors .
In the land of Muhammad , whom mystics revere as the first Sufi , the Wahhabis have bulldozed many old shrines .
At Qalandar 's shrine in Sehwan , a pilgrim called Tanvir Ahmed describes spending four months among the Taliban last year , in Swat , a Taliban fief near the Afghan frontier .
He had thought to join the militants .
But he was put off by their injunctions against Sufi saints .
To a murmur of approval from other devotees , gathering thickly around us , Mr Ahmed says : “ No one can deny our respected saints of God . ”
But the urs also presents troubling scenes .
As dusk falls , and the crowd dancing the dhammal outside the shrine swells , so does an army of men and boys , stripped to the waist .
Legs akimbo , they sing a funeral dirge to the Shia martyr Hussain .
It describes the battle of Karbala , in which Hussain fell , and Sunni and Shia Muslims were so painfully divided .
As their deep voices rise , so the men's arms lift together .
Then each hand slaps down , with a thwack , on its owner 's red and glistening chest .
Alixandra Fassina
Hashish helps a mystic along the path to enlightenment
In daylight , inside the shrine , an even more strikingly sectarian ritual takes place .
Shia pilgrims flagellate themselves with chains dangling with knife - blades and cry out to Ali , father of the martyred Hussain , and revered in Shia Islam .
As they open their backs , sending blood onto the shrine 's floor , other pilgrims recoil .
Many appear disgusted .
In theory , Sufism transcends Islamic sects .
For example , Qalandar was a Shia ; many — or most — of his devotees are Sunni .
Yet the shrines of Sindh , where many Shia Muslims live , are increasingly seeing strident sectarian displays .
This may be partly a reaction to the attacks Pakistani Shias increasingly face from fundamentalists like the Taliban .
It is a sign of popular Sufism under duress .
Sufi scholars , in Karachi , Delhi and Lahore , are concerned by this .
But none wants government help — least of all from a reviled Western government .
Many also note that Sufism is not , as Westerners seem to think , uniform .
The conservative Naqshbandis , followers of another of South Asia 's main orders , have helped spread jihad : there was a Naqshbandi insurgent group in Iraq .
Qalandar , one of Pakistan 's most prominent Sufi saints , was not really of any order .
He exists in a tradition of eccentric , mendicant Sufis .
He was strongly influenced by Hinduism ; many Hindus consider him a manifestation of Shiva .
A Hindu performs the opening ritual of the annual urs .
During the festival many devotees bring clay dishes of henna to Qalandar 's tomb , as to a Hindu bride on her wedding - night , and spread it on themselves , invoking the name of a Hindu water - god .
Amid syncretism , heresy thrives .
Outside Qalandar 's mausoleum , just before dusk , a tall bearded man , wrapped in a black cloak and carrying a silver club , shouts into a loud - hailer : “ Ali Allah ! Allah Ali ! ” —
“ Ali is God ! God is Ali ! ”
He is Sayeed Ghafur Ali , a fine - looking dervish , and leader of a sect in Karachi which propagates this fearful blasphemy .
In many Muslim places it would cost Mr Ali his head .
But in Sehwan no one seems to mind .
Asked , in a calmer setting , whether he has been a dervish for long , Mr Ali smiles and removes two tightly - bound parcels , about the size of American footballs , from his trouser pockets .
They contain his hair , which grows in thick tresses under his cloak .
Mr Ali says he has not visited a barber since he dedicated himself to Qalandar .
Unlike most renowned Sufi saints , Qalandar left little literature .
In academic histories , his name hardly appears .
To plug the gap , his devotees attribute miracles to him .
One tells how Qalandar reconstituted a Hindu disciple , Bodhla Bahar , after an evil raja had made mincemeat of him .
The narrator of this story may appear to have been smoking drugs .
For Qalandar 's black - clad fakirs , many of whom are full time vagrants , much like Hinduism 's dread - locked saddhus , the urs is a wonderful opportunity to eat , dance and get stoned among friends .
“ Though I only smoke in the mornings to strengthen the body , ” cautions Emir Bux , an elderly itinerant inside the shrine , with an orange hennaed beard and a headdress of curvy wooden snakes .
Sex is also to be had at the urs , but less freely .
Sufi shrines have always appealed to prostitutes .
This is partly because of the Sufis ' tolerance of sinners , but also because they make good places to sin .
At Sehwan , which has a name for licentiousness , a transsexual prostitute — or hijra — called Ghazala says she came from Lahore , with 15 of her eunuch sisters , to pray and dance .
Smoking a cigarette down to its filter , Ghazala , a muscular figure with greying temples , claims : “ We came here only to worship our saint . ”
That is an unlikely story .
Presiding over this riot , from a grand house beside the shrine , is Mehdi Shah , a doctor from Islamabad , who recently inherited the title of sajjada nishin , or keeper of the shrine .
This is an important office in Pakistan .
The wardens of its most important shrines , including some , known as pirs , who claim descent from important saints , are among the country 's biggest landowners .
This is partly a legacy of their usefulness to two former invaders of South Asia , the Mughals and British , both of whom patronised the shrine - keepers .
Since the early 1960s , Pakistani governments have been taking over the most lucrative shrines , including Qalandar's .
But Pakistan 's pirs are still formidable .
By one estimate , pir politicians command 10 % of the popular vote .
The current prime minister , Yusuf Raza Gilani , and foreign minister , Shah Mahmud Qureshi , are both pirs .

A colourful version of Islam
Like so much else in Sehwan Sharif , this tradition has got messy .
Mr Shah , the keeper of the shrine , is candid about the responsibilities pir-dom confers : “ To guide people and make money . ”
But he regrets the competition for the office this has engendered .
In Sehwan Sharif , several dozen local families claim to be guardians of the shrine .
“ There may be a thousand Tom , Dick and Harrys claiming to be sajjada nishin , ” grumbles Mr Shah .
In a small room next to the shrine , decorated with peacock feathers , one of these wannabes , Paryal Shah , has set up shop .
As Mr Shah , a bearded man rattling with amulets , enters the room , pilgrims hurl themselves at his feet .
Grunting , occasionally slapping a pilgrim who crushes his toes , Mr Shah dispenses blessings among them .
“ God will help you , ” he growls , doling out white cotton threads , blessed in advance , or a scrap of paper scribbled with a Koranic verse .
It is hard to know how seriously anyone takes this charade .
Mr Shah 's English - speaking right - hand , Ahmed Bhutto , winks and says that he and Mr Shah 's other disciples practice strict chastity : “ I only do it with my wife ! ”
A more troublesome rival to Mehdi Shah is his uncle , Mozafir Ali Shah .
They are locked in a property dispute so ugly that Mehdi Shah refuses even to visit his uncle 's house for a traditional family celebration : a dance performance by a visiting troupe of prostitutes .
To the uninitiated , this splendid occasion is not obviously religious .
The men of Mozafir Ali's house sit in proud silence , as prostitutes straddle its courtyard , thrashing their long hair and kissing these hereditary notables ' knees .
The women of the house rain rupee notes down on the dancers from a balcony discreetly above .
A drummer shouts : “ Sakhi Shahbaz Qalandar duma dum mast ! ”
True Sufis are embarrassed by such scenes .
At Delhi's great Sufi shrine , Mr Nizami , the keeper , says a Sufi must have three qualities : knowledge of Islam ; love of God ; and sanity .
Whatever else they lack , he scoffs , the devotees of Qalandar are insane : “ there is no Sufi among them ! ”
Mr Javed , the Sufi in Lahore , agrees .
But he contrasts such harmless superstition , as he terms popular Sufi beliefs , with the ruthless literalism of the Taliban .
He says : “ I feel safe among shallow - minded occultists .
I do not feel safe among literalists . ”
Scholars like these are Sufism 's true keepers .
But in the undergrowth of popular Sufism , it is remarkable how little of their prescriptions survive .
It has always been so .
The diversity of South Asian Islam is a staggering multicultural achievement .
If its mystics , orthodox and popular , are now increasingly besieged by mullahs , fellows of the Taliban , the massive gatherings at Sehwan and other Pakistani shrines suggest they will not be overrun soon .
Moreover , South Asia 's popular Sufism is not all degenerate .
Some of South Asia 's greatest artistic achievements , especially in architecture , are expressions of it .
The shrine to Baba Hassan Din rising in Lahore is among them .
Mr Qadeer and Mr Niaz , the disciples of Hafiz Iqbal , began work on it a few months after his death .
It is being constructed entirely in natural materials , including clay bricks , white marble , gemstones , and lime plaster strengthened , as luck would have it , by the thousands of frogs that perished in it .
The craftsmen building the shrine use traditional tools and techniques , some revived especially for the task .
Unsupported by concrete , the shrine 's domes rest on the weight of their own artful construction .
Its cloisters are modelled on the shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf .
Its bejewelled mosaics are copied from the walls of Delhi's 17th - century Red Fort .
On the walls of the false burial chambers , Koranic verses , chosen by Hafiz Iqbal , have been inscribed in an ink made from burned mustard oil , in a style of calligraphy taken from the Taj Mahal .
It is a wonderful creation .
Kamil Khan Mumtaz , the architect , a Sufi initiate himself , believes there has been no Islamic monument built like it , anywhere in the Muslim world , for 300 years .
May it last longer .
Stocks snapped a brutal losing streak in resounding fashion as the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoyed its biggest one - day point gain ever following new moves by governments to shore up the global financial system .
The Dow leapt 936.42 points , or 11.1 % , to 9387.61 .
The rally ended an eight - day slide in which the blue - chip measure plummeted almost 2,400 points and endured the worst full - week performance in its 112 - year history .
Twenty - nine of 30 Dow components posted gains , with General Electric the only exception , sliding 2.3 % .
General Motors , which is reportedly in talks to merge with Chrysler , was among the big winners , soaring 33.1 % .
Alcoa and Chevron rose more than 20 % each , while Microsoft rose 18.6 % and American Express gained 17.9 % .
Regulators have been scrambling to shore up financial institutions and ease some of the fears that have led to a freeze - up in the credit markets .
Analysts hope the latest steps may have put the worst of the crisis in the rearview mirror , although some cautioned that economic weakness and skittish lending practices could persist .
The Dow is still down 29 % for the year to date and 34 % from its record close of 14164.53 hit on October 9 , 2007 .
Protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in London clashed with police
Ten people have been arrested for public order offences after clashes at a protest near the Israeli embassy in London against air raids on Gaza .
Police said up to 700 people joined the demonstration and nearby Kensington High Street was closed to traffic .
The protesters resisted and threw placards when officers forcibly moved them back so that the road could be reopened .
The UK government has urged an " immediate halt " to violence in Gaza .
The protesters had gathered to wave placards , banners and flags bearing slogans such as " End the Siege in Gaza " and " Free Palestine " .
Among them was 68 - year - old Gamal Hamed , from Hammersmith , west London , whose 23 - year - old son lives in Gaza .
" Yesterday was the bloodiest day in my homeland 's history , " he said .
" We will do what we can to make the world take notice .
The deteriorating humanitarian situation is deeply disturbing
Foreign Secretary David Miliband
Arabs rally against Israeli raids Voices : Reaction to Israeli raids
Some protesters were seen attempting to climb the gate towards the embassy and also throwing red liquid - to symbolise blood - towards the gate .
The clashes began after a small group of protesters stormed a barrier that had been penning them in .
Riot police were brought in to control the crowds and demonstrators were seen being handcuffed and taken away by officers as they tried to clear the street .
Several protesters left the scene with bloodied faces , according to a reporter from the Press Association .
The crowd chanted " shame on you " at officers as they were moved back from the embassy on Palace Green to Kensington High Street .
Campaigners said protests would continue on Monday .
' Deeply disturbing ' Foreign Secretary David Miliband has called for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes left hundreds dead .
He said a recent rise in rocket attacks against Israel and the " massive loss of life " from the Israeli bombings made it a " dangerous moment " .
" The deteriorating humanitarian situation is deeply disturbing , " he added .
The foreign secretary has called for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza Mr Miliband said Prime Minister Gordon Brown had spoken his Israeli counterpart Ehud Olmert and made it clear Israel must stick by its humanitarian obligations .
International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander said the amount of aid needed in Gaza was " enormous " .
" I note statements by the government of Israel that it wishes to avoid a humanitarian crisis , and its willingness to assist by opening one of the crossings into Gaza for limited humanitarian supplies today , " he said .
He added : " Rocket attacks out of Gaza into Israel are indefensible and hampering efforts to help . "
Conservative leader David Cameron called the violence " horrific " and said both sides must show " restraint " .
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey described the strikes as " disproportionate " and " unacceptable " .
' Shun Israel '
The demonstration outside the embassay was organised by the Stop the War Coalition and Respect MP George Galloway and former Labour MP Tony Benn were among those who addressed the crowd .
Afterwards Mr Galloway said : " The support at today 's demonstration has been overwhelming .
There are even Jewish rabbis who have joined us here .
" We should treat Israel as we treated South Africa during apartheid .
They should be shunned . "
One of the event 's organisers , Ghada Razuki , said she was pleased with the turnout .
" I hope that events like today 's show that there is hope for Palestinians - I really hope they see it , " she said .
Israeli jets have launched a second day of air attacks on the Gaza Strip amid warnings that operations will continue until Hamas ends rocket fire from Gaza .
Palestinians say at least 280 people have died in the air raids .
The UN Security Council has called for an end to all violence , including rocket attacks from Gaza .

Before a future version of Apple 's iPhone wakes you up in the morning , it will have downloaded the morning 's news feeds and sent a message to your coffee maker to begin brewing a fresh pot , says AT&T Mobile chief Ralph de la Vega .
Those are just two examples from a laundry list of future capabilities rattled off by the executive at the Web 2.0 Summit Thursday during his interview with TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington — the same conversation that brought word of an application under development at AT&T that will soon give way to an official iPhone 3G tethering solution .
If you 'd rather read the morning news on your TV while you sip your fresh brewed cup of Joe , you 'll be able to simply wave the handset towards the TV to throw the day 's feeds up on the big screen , de la Vega added .
" Some of this sounds pretty far - flung to me , and if this were some start - up company talking about these ' exciting new plans , ' I 'd probably take it with a grain of salt , " wrote PC World 's Mark Sullivan .
" But in my experience , AT&T plays it pretty close to the vest on its future plans , and usually does what it says it will do , eventually . "
De la Vega 's vision for future iPhone features is n't confined to the home .
He told Arrington that you 'll be able to use the handset to lock your doors on the way out each morning , then start your car .
There will also be little need to fiddle with your car radio while battling morning rush hour traffic , because the iPhone will start reading the remainder of the day 's news to you using its text - to - speech capabilities .
While at work , he continued , the iPhone will orchestrate a conference call with two potential clients in the Far East .
You speak English , they speak Japanese .
That 's not a problem , however , because the iPhone will handle the automatic translations in real time .
De la Vega also noted that AT&T is performing extensive testing within its labs regarding previously announced plans to integrate the handset with U - Verse , its suite of Internet television and VoIP services .
The goal is to allow customers to listen to their voice mails on their TV , and download shows from their digital video recorders onto their iPhones .
A new application for the handset would reportedly serve as a television remote that will let users search the Web and TV listings via the iPhone 's virtual keyboard .
Three police officers were charged on Tuesday for their roles in the alleged assault of a 24 - year - old body piercer on a busy Brooklyn subway platform in October .
One officer , Richard Kern , who is accused of sodomizing the man with his baton , faces the most serious charge , aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree .
The two other officers , Alex Cruz and Andrew Morales , were charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct .
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes announced the indictments at news conference several hours after the three officers surrendered , detailing the accusations and disclosing the charges by the grand jury that painted a chilling picture of police brutality and subsequent cover - up .
The officers were arraigned later in the day .
Prosecutors had asked that Officer Kern ’s bail be set at $ 50,000 , but the judge put it at $ 15,000 .
Officers Morales and Cruz were released on their own recognizance .
This unusual event raised questions in the kingdom about whether the morality police widely viewed as austere and brutal are trying to spruce up their public image by engaging with young people .
The newspaper said that high - ranking officials from this police force , who turned out to be talented bowlers , won the game against the young group of bowlers .
They all engaged in a friendly conversation , Al - Watan added .
But this time , the bearded men of the religious police had totally different intentions .
They just wanted to engage in a game of bowling with a group of youth at the mall in the Saudi coastal city , the local daily Al - Watan reported on Tuesday .
The religious force is notorious for beating up and arresting men and women in Saudi Arabia for what they perceive as immoral behaviors as well as Western ways of behaving or dressing up .
When the men from the Committee to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice arrived unexpectedly at a shopping mall in Jeddah , the trendy Saudi youth in their Western - style attire were seized with fear .
The few thousand clerical policemen , known in Arabic as Mutaween , have come under a lot of criticism lately for their extreme policing ways in implementing the laws of Islam in a country where the strict and puritanical Wahhabi interpretation of Islam is prevalent .
Officially recognized by the Saudi government , the religious police can raid private homes in search for “ sinners ” drinking alcohol or engaging in banned sexual activities .
They can stop men and women who are unrelated by blood or marriage for meeting in a public place .
They can also imprison those who are caught failing to perform one of the daily five prayers of Islam .
In August , the religious police banned Saudis from walking their pets in public because , they said , young men were using their dogs and cats to attract women on the streets .
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is trying to polish the image of his country as one of the most religiously strict places in the world .
Today , an international interfaith meeting spearheaded by the kingdom is starting at the United Nations in New York to foster dialogue among different religious groups .
But the Saudi initiative has been regarded as hypocritical by some human rights organizations .
Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch , said :
“ There is no religious freedom in Saudi Arabia , yet the kingdom asks the world to listen to its message of religious tolerance . …
The dialogue should be about where religious intolerance runs deepest , and that includes Saudi Arabia . ”
The New - York based human rights watchdog said that Saudi Arabia does not permit its citizens or foreign residents to publicly practice any religion other than Islam .

California ’s fair - elections commission is investigating a complaint against the Mormon Church ’s role in campaigning for Proposition 8 , which made marriage illegal between people of the same sex .
Based on the facts that have come out so far , the state is right to look into whether the church broke state laws by failing to report campaign - related expenditures .
Proposition 8 , which California voters passed on Nov. 4 , overturned a ruling by the California Supreme Court and wrote discrimination against one particular group of people into the State Constitution .
After it passed , tens of thousands of people rallied in cities across the country in support of same - sex marriage .
The California Supreme Court said recently that it would review whether Proposition 8 was constitutional .
Mormons were a major force behind the ballot measure .
Individual church members contributed millions of dollars and acted as campaign foot soldiers .
The church itself also played an unusually large role .
Michael R. Otterson , the managing director of public affairs for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints  the full name of the Mormons ’ church  said that while the church speaks out on other issues , like abortion , “ we do n’t get involved to the degree we did on this . ”
Fred Karger , the founder of a group called Californians Against Hate , who filed the complaint , contends that the Mormon Church provided significant contributions to the pro-Proposition 8 campaign that it did not report , as state law requires .
The Fair Political Practices Commission of California is investigating , among other things , commercials , out - of - state phone banks and a Web site sponsored by the church .
Marriage gets better when kids leave the nest Study of women finds an empty nest has its benefits
Marriages get better after the children grow up and move out , according to a UC Berkeley study that analyzed the marital satisfaction of more than 100 women over 18 years .
The study by three professors from UC Berkeley 's department of psychology and Institute of Personality & Social Research questioned the women at the average ages of 43 in 1981 , 52 in 1989 and 61 in 1998 and found that marriages grew increasingly better after the kids packed up and left .
" We found that marital satisfaction increased as the women transitioned to an empty nest , " said Sara Gorchoff , one of the authors of the study and a doctoral candidate in the psychology department .
" It was not that they spent more time with their partners but that they were better enjoying the time they spent with their partners . "
Though the women in the study were not named , several other Bay Area mothers shared similar views .
Terry Toczynski , a 55 - year - old mother of three , said she noticed an improvement in her marriage when her three children went off to school .
They were gone for about a year before one of them temporarily moved back recently .
" In the time they were n't there , we did n't have to focus 100 percent on raising children , and it was definitely better for us , " the Berkeley woman said .
" We were a couple again , two individuals who chose to live together and be with each other .
Got good at conversations
" At first , it is very quiet , but there is a lot of good in the lack of noise .
We got good at having conversations .
Our time is about us . "
The 123 women in the study were born between 1937 and 1939 and were first questioned for a study on creativity while they were seniors at Mills College in Oakland .
Since then , they have participated in numerous studies , including one on the effect of the women 's movement .
" We realized what an opportunity we had to study these women over the years , " said Gorchoff , who conducted the study with psychology Professors Oliver John and Ravenna Helson .
Though all the women attended college , they chose different career paths and had varying income levels and numbers of children .
Their martial status varied as well .
Some changed partners , some did n't .
Whatever the case , the study showed that they all reported becoming more satisfied when their children moved away from home .
" The increase was not at all dependent on whether they remarried , " Gorchoff said .
" And the women did not report that the general global satisfaction with their lives got better , just their marriages .
They were enjoying the time with their partners more . "
Shahla Piff , 59 , of San Bruno said she initially felt like her purpose in life was gone when her two sons moved out about six years ago but soon realized her marriage was growing stronger .
" We had time to pay attention to each other , " said Piff , whose sons are 26 and 28 .
" The boys were taking a lot of our attention and energy .
When they left , we could behave like adults .
We could do fun stuff , like travel and go to art shows .
" It gives us more time to focus on each other and our interests . "
Marriages improved with age overall , according to the study , but women who experienced the transition to an empty nest were happier with their mates than women with children in the home and women whose children had been gone for a while .
The first survey was done when most of the women still had children at home , the second when some of them still had kids at home , and the third when most kids were gone .
All were in middle age during the first survey .
Some got married , some raised kids , some were divorced , some remarried and some were in domestic partnerships .
The women rated how satisfied they were in their relationships using a five - point scale .
" The transition to an empty nest may be associated with an increase in the quantity of time and energy invested in one 's marriage , an increase in the quality of time spent with one 's partner and with perceptions of one 's child 's success , " the study said .
Not everyone agrees .
Barbara Lockwood , a 58 - year - old Brookdale ( Santa Cruz County ) woman whose sons left home in 1998 , said her marriage has remained pretty much the same .
Empty Nest Travel Club
Lockwood started the Empty Nest Travel Club for parents whose kids had moved out , because her husband does n't like to travel and she wanted to see the world .
" The kids leaving was a big adjustment and part of the reason I want to travel more , but I would n't say my marriage got more satisfying , " Lockwood said .
" We are now focused on ourselves and our discussions are about health problems , not the kids . "
The study , titled " Contextualizing Change in Marital Satisfaction During Middle Age , " was published in the November issue of the journal Psychological Science .
F. Scott Fitzgerald invented the reverse - aging phenomenon at the heart of " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , " which opened at movie theaters this week .
But there are plenty of unusual ailments that are quite real .
Here are just a few of them :
Foreign Accent Syndrome .
Seemingly out of the blue , sufferers start speaking with what sounds like a foreign accent -- often of a country they 've never visited .
In one noted case , a Norwegian woman developed a German accent after being hit by bomb shrapnel in 1941 .

A new book about media mogul Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corp. owns Fox News , is to be released next week .
Its most sensational revelations involve what the author describes as Murdoch 's loathing for leading Fox commentator Bill O'Reilly .
Murdoch is not only embarrassed at times by his ownership of Fox News , but that he " absolutely despises " O'Reilly ...
Wolff adds that Fox CEO Roger Ailes shares Murdoch 's opinion . "
It is not just Murdoch ( and everybody else at News Corp. ’s highest levels ) who absolutely despises Bill O’Reilly , the bullying , mean - spirited , and hugely successful evening commentator , but Roger Ailes himself who loathes him .
Success , however , has cemented everyone to each other . "
According to Wolff , Murdoch 's desire not to be defined solely by his ownership of Fox underlay his purchase last year of the Wall Street Journal , which " was in no small way about wanting to trade the illiberal -- the belligerent , the vulgar , the loud , the menacing the unsubtle -- for the better - heeled , the more magnanimous , the further nuanced . "
Thanksgiving is over , and yet ... there are so many dee - lish - ous tidbits to chew on : The book ?
Michael Wolff 's
The revelations ?
Awww , poor Bill - o .
Okay , hands :
How many think Keith Olbermann will report on this in his Monday show ?
And guess who wants to improve his image ?
Hint :
It 's not Bill - o . Not workin ' , Rupert .
Arrrh !
The transfer of power took place on two fronts , with President Bush summoning members of the White House staff to the South Lawn , where he pledged to make an “ unprecedented effort ” to ensure a smooth transition in the first handover of the presidency since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Mr. Bush said he would welcome Mr. Obama at the White House on Monday , the earliest such meeting after any recent presidential election .
“ We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new president settle in , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ This will also be America ’s first wartime transition in four decades . ”
Mr. Obama , who has declined to attend the president ’s global economic summit meeting on Nov. 15 , said he looked forward to meeting with Mr. Bush and the first lady , Laura Bush , at what might be the only get - together by the president and his successor before Inauguration Day .
“ I thank him for reaching out in the spirit of bipartisanship that will be required to meet the many challenges we face as a nation , ” said Mr. Obama , adding that his wife , Michelle , will join him as he visits the Oval Office and the rest of their future residence .
Their two daughters will not be taken out of school for the trip .
No incoming president in modern times has been so pressured to begin governing , in effect , before he is sworn into office .
With that in mind , Mr. Obama and Vice President - elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet on Friday with members of a new economic advisory board .
The group , assembled to offer wide - ranging advice , includes the billionaire investor Warren Buffett ; Mr. Summers and his predecessor as Treasury secretary , Robert E. Rubin ; Paul A. Volcker , a former Federal Reserve chairman ; and Eric E. Schmidt , the chief executive of Google .
Image Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , shown with Barack Obama during the campaign , has accepted an offer to become White House chief of staff .

Part 1 of analysis
Anyone who watched the horrific Gilad Shalit display at the recent Hamas rally realized that the movement ’s government in the Gaza Strip is no less than a monster .
The infantile creativity that was broadcasted from there , which marked the dark continuation of the live “ elimination ” of the “ Zionist ” Mickey Mouse and Maya the Bee by Hamas ’ holy warriors , reflects the worldview of this “ government . ”
In June of last year , Hamas “ fighters ” threw their Fatah rivals from the 10th floor of a building , while firing at their heads .
If and when our troops are forced to enter Gaza , someone will have to remind Condoleezza Rice and George W. Bush that we simply object to the “ Western - style democracy ” that these fighters sought to establish in the Gaza Strip via free elections .
The lull may indeed be extended , yet even if that should happen , the all - out clash will come sooner or later , because the “ Hamas government ” in Gaza is has no hope of reforming .
The 250 square kilometers of the Strip saw the emergence of a giant monster a long time ago ; a sort of horrifying creature that combines religious fanaticism , terrorism , and crime .
This creature needs to be fought in every way possible and eliminated .
However , the Egyptian mediators , who also fear this monster , are pressing Israel to accept its conditions for a lull :
An end to targeted eliminations in the territories and the opening of Gaza crossings in exchange for an end to the Qassam rocket fire .
The violation of the agreement by the “ Hamas government ” via the firing of 300 rockets at Israeli communities is accepted as part of the rules of the game .
Therefore , why would n’t Hamas find it convenient to continue such lull ?
Its hands are not tied , and its struggle against the “ Zionist enemy ” continues successfully ; who needs more than that ?
The truth is that Defense Minister Ehud Barak is also interested in seeing the lull continue , even at the price of its occasional violation by Hamas , because in face of the dilemma that has been created , a military operation is his last resort .
However , we must admit that Barak must also take into account the “ obstacle course ” which the IDF may encounter in case he decides to embark on a large - scale operation .
We are not only talking about the expected casualty toll , the concern for Gilad Shalit ’s wellbeing , and the financial burden on the economy .
Security officials have realized a long time ago that the time of “ luxury ” operations has passed .
Today , any operation would have to take into a count all sorts of constraints , including legal considerations , the power of the media , international pressure , and the objections of our soldiers ’ families .
Part 2 of analysis , which will focus on constraints faced by Israel in respect to Gaza operation , to be published Tuesday evening
So , I have a confession and a suggestion .
The confession : I go into restaurants these days , look around at the tables often still crowded with young people , and I have this urge to go from table to table and say : “ You do n’t know me , but I have to tell you that you should n’t be here .
You should be saving your money .
You should be home eating tuna fish .
This financial crisis is so far from over .
We are just at the end of the beginning .
Please , wrap up that steak in a doggy bag and go home . ”
Now you know why I do n’t get invited out for dinner much these days .
If I had my druthers right now we would convene a special session of Congress , amend the Constitution and move up the inauguration from Jan. 20 to Thanksgiving Day .
Forget the inaugural balls ; we ca n’t afford them .
Forget the grandstands ; we do n’t need them .
Just get me a Supreme Court justice and a Bible , and let ’s swear in Barack Obama right now  by choice  with the same haste we did  by necessity  with L.B.J. in the back of Air Force One .
Unfortunately , it would take too long for a majority of states to ratify such an amendment .
What we can do now , though , said the Congressional scholar Norman Ornstein , co-author of “ The Broken Branch , ” is “ ask President Bush to appoint Tim Geithner , Barack Obama ’s proposed Treasury secretary , immediately . ”
Make him a Bush appointment and let him take over next week .
This is not a knock on Hank Paulson .
It ’s simply that we ca n’t afford two months of transition where the markets do n’t know who is in charge or where we ’re going .
At the same time , Congress should remain in permanent session to pass any needed legislation .
This is the real “ Code Red . ”
As one banker remarked to me : “ We finally found the W.M.D. ”
They were buried in our own backyard  subprime mortgages and all the derivatives attached to them .
Seventy - five years ago , Prohibition ended .
Just 13 years after launching an extraordinary experiment in social reform , the nation recognized that the battle against " intoxicating liquors " had failed .
Organized crime had exploded .
Civil rights had been weakened .
And an enormous number of ordinary Americans had become " criminals " as they found ways to evade , and profit from the evasion of , this hopeless law .
We 're about a decade into our own hopeless war of prohibition , this one against " peer - to - peer piracy . "
The copyright industry has used every legal means within its reach ( and some that may not be so legal ) to stop Internet " pirates " from " sharing " copyrighted content without permission .
These " copyright wars " — what the late Jack Valenti , former head of the Motion Picture Association of America , called his own " terrorist war " in which apparently the " terrorists " are our kids — have consumed an ever growing amount of legal resources .
The Recording Industry Association of America alone has sued tens of thousands of individuals .
These suits allege millions of dollars in damages .
And schools across the nation have adopted strict policies to block activity that the Supreme Court in 2005 declared presumptively illegal .
I do not support peer - to - peer " piracy . "
In my books Free Culture and Remix , I condemn explicitly and repeatedly such uses as wrong .
And in the hundreds of talks I have given on this subject , I plead with kids not to use technologies in ways that give others a justification for wrecking the Internet .
But though I believe kids should not use the Internet to violate others ' rights , I oppose these failed copyright wars :
We have not reduced the amount of peer - to - peer file sharing .
To the contrary , it has only increased .
Nor have artists earned additional revenues from this battle — settlements do n't go to the artists but to the lawyers .
Instead , the single certain consequence from this battle has been one our government is strangely oblivious to : its rendering a generation criminal .
A concerted campaign by rights holders , politicians , school administrators , and increasingly parents has convinced kids that their behavior violates the law .
But that law breaking continues .
We call our kids crooks ; after a while , they believe it .
And like black marketeers in Soviet Russia , they live life getting comfortable with the idea that what seems " obvious " and " reasonable " to them is a crime .
They get used to being criminal .
This fact is deeply corrosive .
As with Prohibition , it is profoundly corrupting .
And over time , it will only weaken our kids ' respect for the law .
Old lessons .
It is time we recall what the nation learned 75 years ago :
The remedy to a failed war is not to wage an ever more violent war ; it is to sue for peace .
Rather than continuing to sue to stop what no lawyer could ever stop , Congress needs to consider the scores of proposals that have been advanced by some of the best scholars in the nation to legalize this sharing while enabling other ways to compensate artists .
These include a voluntary collective license , allowing individuals to file share for a low , fixed rate ; a more expansive " noncommercial use levy " that would be imposed on commercial entities benefiting from peer - to - peer file sharing , to help compensate artists ; or most expansive of all , that copyright give up regulating the distribution of copies and instead compensate artists based upon the estimated frequency by which their works are consumed .
These and a host of other ideas all raise different advantages and disadvantages — but are better than criminalizing a generation .
The failure of Prohibition taught social reformers something important about regulatory humility :
Too often liberals and conservatives alike simply assume that a law will achieve what the law seeks to achieve .
Too rarely do they work out just how .
Humility teaches us to rein in the law where it is doing no good , if only to protect it where it does good or where it is necessary .
Copyright law 's extremism is not necessary .
We can achieve the objectives of copyright law — compensating artists — without criminalizing a generation .
We need to start doing that , now .

Smoking MacBook reported
An individual in the United Kingdom has reported a potential MacBook safety hazard after being awoken by the sound of fire alarms that were triggered by smoke emitting from the back of the device , according to Sevenmac .
The user had been reportedly using MacBook to watch a DVD , with the lid open and video output routed to an external display .
Photographs show smoke residue above the cooling vent , on the desk and covering the MacBook logo below the screen .
Despite the smoke , the 2.16 GHz MacBook continued to function properly and smcFanControl did not indicate any errors .
The problems appeared to be internal and unrelated to the battery , although the device is currently being inspected by Apple .
Manufacturing issues forced the computer - maker to recall over 1.8 million batteries in 2006 , while isolated MacBook fires continued into 2007 .

RENOKENONGO , Indonesia 
Her children insist , so every week or two Lilik Kamina takes them back to their abandoned village to look at the mud .
“ Hey , Mom , there ’s our house , there ’s the mango tree , ” she said they shout .
But there is nothing to see , only an ocean of mud that has buried this village and a dozen more over the past two - and - a - half years .
The mud erupted here during exploratory drilling for natural gas , and it has grown to be one of the largest mud volcanoes ever to have affected a populated area .
Unlike other disasters that torment Indonesia  earthquakes , volcanoes , tsunamis  this one continues with no end in sight , and experts say the flow of mud could go on for many years or decades .
The steaming mud keeps bubbling up , spreading across the countryside , driving people from their homes , burying fields and factories .
It has forced the relocation of roads , bridges , a railway line and a major gas pipeline .

Report : Taliban now encircle Kabul John Byrne
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Taliban now have presence in 3/4 of country The Taliban now have a presence in nearly three - quarters of Afghanistan , and are beginning to encircle its capital , Kabul , according to a new thinktank report .
According to the report , the Taliban hold a permanent presence in 72 percent of Afghanistan , though Hamid Karzai's Afghan government says the figures " are n't credible . "
The Paris - based International Council on Security and Development , which has offices in Afghanistan , says that Taliban fighters have advanced from the south of the country and now carry out regular attacks in the west and northwest .
In many places in the south , they hold power normally associated with a government , the Council says .
" While the international community 's prospects in Afghanistan have never been bleaker , the Taliban has been experiencing a renaissance that has gained momentum since 2005 , " the report said .
" The West is in genuine danger of losing Afghanistan . "
President - elect Barack Obama says he 'll deploy tens of thousands of troops to the war - riddled country , which served as one of the US - Soviet battlegrounds during the cold war .
America has had a troubled history in the poor , mountainous nation , where they once supported Osama Bin Laden against the Russians .
Currently , the US has 34,000 boots on the ground .
The Pentagon plans 20,000 replacement troops for 2009 .
While the Taliban were in power , Afghanistan 's poppy crop -- which is used to make heroin -- was effectively wiped out .
The country now supplies most of Europe 's opium .
A former prison inmate has been arrested and charged with hacking the facility 's computer network , stealing personal details of more than 1,100 prison employees and making them available to fellow inmates .
Francis G. Janosko , 42 , gained access to the names , addresses , dates of birth , social security numbers and telephone numbers of employees working for the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts , according to an indictment unsealed Wednesday in US District Court in Boston .
Using a thin client that was connected to a prison server , the prisoner was able to access an employee database by exploiting a bug in legal research software made available to inmates .
Once he obtained the personal information of the employees , he made it accessible to other inmates .
Janosko also managed to obtain the username and password to a prison management program , and to access the internet to download videos and digital photographs of prison employees , inmates and aerial shots of the prison .
The accused hacking took place between October 2006 and February 2007 .
" Although the legal research computer server was connected through the prison 's network to the internet solely so that it could obtain updates to its Windows operating system , the legal research server was configured to disallow access to the worldwide web , " the indictment stated .
Computer use was limited to legal research only ; use of the internet was forbidden .
Janosko is charged with one count each of aggravated identity theft and intentional damage to a protected computer .
If convicted , he faces a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison and a fine of $ 250,000 .
He could also be forced to pay unspecified restitution .
According to The Boston Globe , Janosko was arrested in 2005 on child pornography charges after investigators discovered nude photos of children on his cellphone .
It was the third time he faced such charges , The Globe reported .
He was listed as a Level 3 , or high - risk , sex offender in Massachusetts in 2005 . ®
OTTAWA–The RCMP is scrutinizing its stun guns in response to a new analysis that found some Tasers pack more of a shock than the manufacturer promises , raising questions about their safety .
A scientific review commissioned by the CBC and French - language Radio - Canada concluded that four out of 41 guns tested actually discharged more electrical current than Taser International says is possible .
In some of the test firings the police weapons delivered 50 per cent more current .
The examination was conducted by an American lab , National Technical Systems , using X26 model Tasers from seven police departments in the U.S. eager to see how the guns fared .
The police services agreed to participate on condition of anonymity .
University of Montreal engineer Pierre Savard , who designed the testing procedure based on Taser International 's own guidelines , found the results troubling .
Savard studies heart rhythms and how they are affected by electrical stimulation .
He says since police officers are trained to aim the Taser at the chest for the best chance of a hit , the increase in current could be highly dangerous under certain circumstances .
" When you combine an increased current intensity with a dart that falls right over the heart for somebody who has cardio- vascular disease or other conditions , such as using drugs for example , it can all add up to a fatal issue . "
Two other experts consulted by CBC , engineer Stephane Masse of the Toronto University Health Network , and engineer Roger Barr at Duke University in North Carolina , agreed with Savard 's lab analysis .
The Taser X26 is widely used by the RCMP and many other police forces across North America .
The four Tasers that malfunctioned were amongst the oldest , manufactured prior to 2005 .
Savard wants police to stop using these older guns altogether until they have been tested to find out why so many stray from the manufacturer 's specifications .
In a written response to the CBC , Taser International acknowledges the results show four of the devices displayed anomalies .
Magne Nerheim , Taser vice - president of research and development , suggests because the unusual behaviour appears in the first moments of firing it is a sign that the guns may not have been spark - tested regularly as Taser recommends to police officers .
But a Taser International testing protocol obtained by CBC makes no mention of a spark - test .
Nerheim also says the results are n't " relevant from a medical safety perspective . "
In a statement , the company added , " The results from the testing are generally consistent with the specifications provided by Taser International and which would be expected from such tests . "
Savard and the other scientists say they stand by their analysis .
CBC and Radio - Canada say their study is the largest independent lab test of Tasers to date .
Savard agreed to take part out of concern no one was verifying the claims of Arizona - based Taser International .

At a recent policing conference , RCMP Commissioner William Elliott told the CBC that in response to the broadcaster 's findings the force was pulling Tasers out of its inventory for examination .
``We are gathering up samples from each of our divisions , every province and every territory , and we will have them tested . "
On Thursday , the RCMP said preliminary findings indicated the Tasers tested at an Ottawa lab were operating within the manufacturer 's specifications .
However , the Mounties did not share details of its tests with the CBC .
The force is awaiting final lab results .
A report commissioned by the RCMP earlier this year said national standards , more resources and better co-ordination are needed to ensure officers are properly trained to use Taser stun guns .
The report said the Mounties did not get enough input from medical and mental health experts about the weapon 's impact on people .
More than 20 people in Canada have died after being hit with a Taser .
Taser International insists the devices cannot be blamed for deaths .
However , medical officials have cited the guns as contributing factors in some cases .
Amnesty International Canada has repeatedly urged a temporary halt to Taser use pending an independent , in - depth study of potential risks .
RCMP complaints commission chairman Paul Kennedy has called on the force to restrict Taser use to major threats where a person is combative or risks serious harm to themselves or others .
Kennedy wants tighter controls on a powerful and painful weapon the Mounties have drawn from their holsters more than 4,000 times since its introduction in 2001 .

" Please pray for him not to suffer from this accident , " a distraught Dong Yun Yoon told reporters gathered near the site of Monday 's crash of an F / A - 18D jet in San Diego 's University City community .
" He is one of our treasures for the country , " Yoon said in accented English punctuated by long pauses while he tried to maintain his composure .
" I do n't blame him .
I do n't have any hard feelings .
I know he did everything he could , " said Yoon , flanked by members of San Diego 's Korean community , relatives and members from the family 's church .
Watch Yoon discuss relatives ' death »
Authorities said four people died when the jet crashed into the Yoon family 's house while the pilot was trying to reach nearby Marine Corps Air Station Miramar .
Another unoccupied house also was destroyed .
Yoon named the victims as his infant daughter Rachel , who was born less than two months ago ; his 15 - month - old daughter Grace ; his wife , Young Mi Yoon , 36 ; and her 60 - year - old mother , Suk Im Kim , who he said had come to the United States from Korea recently to help take care of the children .
Fighting back tears , he said of his daughters : " I can not believe that they are not here right now . "
" I know there are many people who have experienced more terrible things , " Yoon said .
" But , please , tell me how to do it .
I do n't know what to do . "
Marine Corps authorities said the pilot , whose name was not released , was hospitalized after he parachuted from the jet , and an investigation into the cause of the crash has been launched .

The jet had just performed landing training on a Navy aircraft carrier before the pilot reported having trouble , according to the Marine Corps .
Authorities described the jet as disabled .
Three bodies -- those of two adults and an infant -- were recovered hours after the crash on Monday .
The fourth body -- that of a child -- was recovered Tuesday , as firefighters sifted through the rubble of the Yoon house .
Authorities said they did not expect to find any other victims of the crash .
The area 's congressman , Rep. Duncan Hunter , said after a briefing from the Marine Corps that a power failure was the likely cause of the crash , not any structural problem with the aircraft .
" At this time , my deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by this incident , especially those who lost loved ones , " Hunter , the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , said in a statement from his office .
Yoon 's minister , Daniel Shin , told reporters the Yoon family had moved into the house a little more than a month ago .
He said Yoon came to the United States in 1989 and had since become a naturalized citizen .
Yoon works as manager of " a variety store -- a store where they sell a variety of things , " Shin said .
Yoon 's wife came to the United States about four years ago , Shin said .
Yoon spoke softly when he talked about his wife .
" It was God 's blessing that I met her about four years ago .
She was a lovely wife and mother , " he said .
His voice fading , he added : " She loves me and babies .
I just miss her so much . "
The Marine Corps said Tuesday it would take " a minimum of five to seven working days " to clean up the crash site .
San Diego resident Ian Lerner said he was heading to lunch at a shopping center about a half - mile from the neighborhood of about 20 homes when he saw the jet flying low .
" It was , oh , gosh , maybe a couple of hundred feet off the ground .
And it was quiet ; I think the engine was off , " Lerner said .

" Then all of a sudden , we saw the canopy of the jet explode and go up , and then we saw the pilot blast out of the plane and the parachute open , " Lerner said .

Another witness said the jet was flying at a low altitude and " just spiraled , right out of [ the movie ] ' Top Gun . ' "
A photograph taken at the crash site showed the pilot , after ejection , sitting on the front lawn , making a call on his cell phone before he was taken to a hospital .

The pilot was the only occupant of the two - seat aircraft , according to the Marine Corps .
The Union - Tribune spoke with Steve Diamond , a retired naval aviator who said he found the pilot in a tree behind a house .
He told the paper he helped the man , who Diamond said was a lieutenant in his 20s , down from the tree .
See satellite photo showing crash site , airfield »
The pilot told him that after he lost power in one engine , it was decided he would try to get the jet to Miramar on the single working engine , Diamond told the paper .
The pilot was in communication with military air traffic controllers before the jet crashed about two miles from the airfield , the Federal Aviation Administration said .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the pilot ejected moments before the crash and landed in a tree .
Jason Widmer said he talked to the pilot , who said he had tried to steer the jet from the homes and into a brushy canyon .
" He was pretty shook up and pretty concerned if he had killed anyone , " Widmer told San Diego 6 .
" He had seen his bird go into a house . "
A retired general , a pilot who has flown for 40 years and more than 270 missions in Vietnam , said the decision to eject is up to the pilot .
F/ A - 18D planes are very dependable , but any aircraft is subject to error .
That model has two engines , and it can operate with one engine .
But if one engine malfunctions , it 's possible that a blade can break off and fly into the other engine , causing it to malfunction , too .
If both engines are inoperable and the plane descends below 10,000 feet , it 's likely the pilot will soon lose control .
To eject , a pilot pulls a ring - like lever .
The jet 's canopy is propelled off the aircraft , quickly followed by the pilot in an ejection seat .
A pilot can opt to manually activate his parachute , but if he does n't , the parachute will open on a timer .
The plane would crash randomly once the pilot is no longer in control .

Inside a house in the neighborhood , Robert Johnson sat in his living room with his daughter , Heather Certain , and her 2 - year - old son , Nicholas , according to the Union - Tribune .
They heard the explosion and then saw a giant fireball in the picture window facing their front yard , the newspaper reported .
They ran out of the house .

Top 10 ' Yuppie ' Health Conditions Doctors may swear an illness is real , but some conditions still meet skepticism .
Dec. 17 , 2008  --
Some conditions just can't seem to get society 's respect .
When chronic fatigue syndrome first came on to the scene , it was ridiculed as the " yuppie flu . "
Other pooh - poohed conditions got their negative associations by proxy -- " tennis elbow " became associated with country club snobbery .
Irritable bowel syndrome , already embarrassing , was a perfect comedic tool for sensitive characters like Ben Stiller 's portrayal of the uptight Reuben Feffer in " Along Came Polly . "
Even after doctors find a genetic link , a blood test or a treatment , a number of conditions still get stuck with negative labels like " yuppie . "
Below is a list of 10 of the most besmirched conditions patients wish would be taken more seriously .
Wheat Allergy or Celiac Disease or Gluten Allergy
The plethora of health - nut " gluten - free " foods available makes it simultaneously easier for people to explain celiac disease and difficult for them to be taken seriously .
" Gluten - free now seems to be a fad diet , " said Elaine Monarch , executive director of the Celiac Disease Foundation in Studio City , Calif. , who added she 's seen projections that gluten - free products will generate a billion dollars in food sales in the next few years .
Monarch said in 2004 the National Institutes of Health convened a consensus conference about celiac disease .
The doctors estimated that 97 percent of people who have it have not been diagnosed , and that one out of 133 people likely had the condition .
" What they acknowledged was that the disease is much more prevalent than anyone thought before , " Monarch said .
However , when Monarch was first suffering from symptoms of celiac disease , the public had hardly heard of gluten - free , never mind celiac disease .
" I was anemic , and everyone said , 'oh , you 're female , maybe you had your period . '
Or , 'oh , you have red hair . '
That has nothing to do with it , " she said .
Aside from anemia , celiac disease has a hodge - podge of symptoms -- from bloating , to vomiting , to constipation , to canker sores and in some cases infertility -- that are caused directly or indirectly by a genetic inability to digest a protein in wheat .
Doctors started drawing the connection between wheat and intestinal problems after the end of World War II , according to Dr. Alessio Fasano , director of the Center for Celiac Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore .
Fasano said that during WWII , when bread was made with potato flour in many parts of Europe , doctors noticed that many of their patients ' intestinal symptoms stopped .
Then after the war , all the symptoms came back when people started making wheat flour again .
Since then doctors have found a blood test for celiac disease and evidence of damage to the small intestine .
" The fact that we know the trigger is tremendous , " Fasano said .
" Celiac disease is the only autoimmune disease for which we have a treatment . "

Celiac disease is caused by a combination of genetic disposition and an environmental trigger , similar to diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis .
But unlike those conditions , Fasano said he thinks celiac disease is less respected .
" If you have a condition that you do n't die from , but it affects this part of your life so much , then it is important :
You do n't want to travel , you do n't to go out with your friends , you do n't want to go off to college , " Fasano said .
" It deserves all the respect that we give to the other diseases that we spend so much time and money on , " he said .
' Yuppie Flu ' or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
Chronic fatigue syndrome , also once known as " the yuppie flu , " took years to gain a credible reputation , or even a name and diagnosis criteria .
Someone with chronic fatigue syndrome primarily feels a profound tiredness that is n't helped by sleeping and can get much worse with physical or mental activity .
Initially , the disease was thought to affect only the upper class -- hence the yuppie connotation -- although they may have only been the first to seek treatment .
Now experts believe it strikes across the whole population .
A major hurdle to gaining recognition was that the syndrome was so poorly understood by doctors .
By 1994 , a group of international doctors convened to define the disease and create standard diagnosis criteria .
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a patient must have severe fatigue for six months or more without another medical explanation and one or more of a whole host of symptoms that include memory problems , sore throat , joint pain , tender lymph nodes , muscle pain and more .
As of now there are no physical signs or lab tests to diagnose the syndrome .
However the CDC estimates that between 1 million and 4 million Americans suffer from the disease .
Epstein- Barr
The Epstein - Barr virus ( or EBV ) turned out to be one of the red herrings for the " yuppie flu . "
Although a clear - cut blood test exists for Epstein - Barr , patients suffer a similar confusing general malaise as those with chronic fatigue syndrome .
According to the CDC , a person with the Epstein - Barr virus may have a sore throat , swollen lymph glands , fatigue and a general ill feeling .
Because the symptoms of EBV and chronic fatigue syndrome are so similar , doctors may first mistake chronic fatigue syndrome for a longstanding EBV infection .
Unlike chronic fatigue , once a patient has an EBV diagnosis , they 're likely to be taken very seriously .
According to the National Institutes of Health , EBV is a prime contributor to mono , also known as mononucleosis or the " kissing disease " because it is highly contagious by saliva transmission even months after symptoms subside .
Most patients with an active EBV infection begin to feel better in a couple of months .
However the virus has been known to cause anemia , ruptured spleens and death in rare cases , according to the NIH .
Social Phobia and Social Anxiety Disorder
Out of many anxiety disorders , experts say those with social anxiety disorder are likely the most affected by a negative reaction to their problem .
" For a long time there were a lot of naysayers saying , 'oh , this is n't a condition , it 's made up , ' " said Jerilyn Ross , a clinical social worker and president and CEO of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America in Silver Spring , Md .
" Because you can't measure it on an X - ray , or a blood test , a lot of people will say things like ' was this made up by the drug companies ? ' " said Ross , who is also the director of the Ross Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders in Washington , D.C .
" That just perpetuates the stigma for those who have it and it perpetuates their fear of getting help , " she said .
Shy is one thing , but the mental health world never really considered social anxiety a full - blown disorder until 1985 when Dr. Michael R. Liebowitz from Columbia University published a review calling " social phobia " a neglected disorder .
" That article really put it on the map , " said Ross .
Before then , Ross said , " Society treated it as , 'oh , it 's really not that big a deal . ' ...
In a woman , it 's ' oh , how cute she blushes . ' "
Ross says because the disorder got full recognition in the 1990s and a lot of press from media and direct - to - consumer advertising , people with what 's now called " social anxiety disorder " felt empowered to seek help .
According to Ross , when one of the estimated 5 million to 10 million people with social anxiety disorder in the United States comes forward to seek treatment , the line between a disorder and " shy " is as clear as day .
" For 30 years they 've never gone into town because they can't talk to anybody , " Ross said .
" Or they may say : ' I dropped out of school , I 'm suicidal , I 've never had a date in my life , I can't go out to a restaurant and I can't call for tickets to a show . ' "
Tennis Elbow
There 's no misnomer about how one can get tennis elbow , but many non -yuppie activities such as using a screwdriver , weaving , yard work or other maintenance work can cause tennis elbow .
According to the Mayo Clinic , the pain of a tennis elbow is similar to the " golfer 's elbow , " except that it occurs on the outside of the elbow instead of the crook of the arm .
Tennis elbow may be inflammation , soreness and / or pain on the outside of the upper arm near the elbow .
According to the NIH , the injury can include a partial tear of a tendon near the elbow as well .
Besides pain near the elbow , signs that you 've got tennis elbow include the inability to hold beverages like a cup of coffee ( a good source for jokes about yuppies ) , forearm weakness and pain that shoots from the elbow to forearm and the back of the hand when the person tries to twist something .
Luckily , most people with tennis elbow can resolve the issue in time by resting the muscle , icing it and learning to play with better tennis technique .
However , according to the Mayo Clinic , about one out of 10 people with the condition will require surgery .
Anxiety vs. Generalized Anxiety Disorder
People with generalized anxiety disorder face many of the same dilemmas attempting to explain their condition to a skeptic as people with social anxiety disorder .
Just as there 's a difference between shy and an " intense paralyzing fear of social performance situations and fear of being negatively valued and judged in those situations , " there 's anxiety and intense worry , and then there 's pathology , Ross said .
Ross likes to use the analogy of a mother suffering from anxiety severe enough to cause insomnia .
On the one hand , Ross said she could see a family where the prime breadwinner has been out of work , the bills are piling up and the children are having problems in school so much so that the mother is losing sleep and it's affecting her health .
Ross said this family might need help with anxiety , but it 's not a disorder .
But , Ross said , take " a young mother where finances are n't really a problem , the parents have secure jobs , they have a great marriage , the kids are doing well , but she 's up worrying every night that they are going to lose their house , or someone 's going to lose their job . "
" They know this is a problem , they know that they 're different from other people , " Ross said .
" They often say : ' I feel as if I just ca n't turn it off . ' "
Although Ross said professionals have begun to diagnose generalized anxiety disorder much more accurately in the last decade , she has seen estimates that as many as three - fourths of people with the disorder have yet to be diagnosed .
Restless Leg Syndrome
Not only does the condition have a vague name , but patients who suffer from restless leg syndrome may have a hard time describing the vague symptoms to other people .
At its essence , restless leg syndrome ( or RLS ) is exactly what it sounds like : the urge to move your legs .
According to the Mayo Clinic , " sometimes the sensations seem to defy description , " but often numbness or burning , crawling , jittery , tingling and aching sensations well up in the legs as the sufferer feels the need to move them .
While medicines can reduce the symptoms , there is no known cause for all RLS , according to the NIH .
Pregnancy can bring on symptoms , as can vices -- caffeine , tobacco and alcohol .
A good way to immediately reduce RLS symptoms is to simply move your legs , stand up or walk around .
However symptoms can become more problematic when people try to sleep .
As RLS gets worse in the evening and nighttime hours , the condition can interfere with sleep , turning a nuisance twitch into serious insomnia and daytime drowsiness .
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
People with irritable bowel syndrome ( or IBS ) have it hard enough dealing with the embarrassing bathroom symptoms , but according to gastroenterologists , they also have to deal with a poorly understood condition that has no quick treatment .
" There 's actually nothing wrong with the physical gut ; it's what we call a functional disorder , " said Fasano , who is also the director of the Mucosal Biology Research Center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
IBS has all the intestinal symptoms of celiac disease and many of the symptoms of Chron 's disease : abdominal pain , diarrhea , constipation , cramps and spasms .
Fasano said it was only in the 1970s that a series of experts got together in Rome and drafted what is known as the " Rome Criteria " for diagnosing IBS .
Research since has uncovered a connection between IBS and the " intestinal pacemaker " responsible for creating the wave contraction of the intestine to digest food .
Have a faulty " intestinal pacemaker , " and a person can have spasms and intense digestive pain .
Other research has uncovered links between IBS and an imbalance of good bacteria in the gut .
Still , Fasano said an IBS diagnosis is often one of exclusion , meaning doctors must run a myriad tests to see whether another cause is behind the IBS symptoms before coming to a conclusion .
" IBS is embarrassing , IBS is not socially acceptable , " said Fasano .
" You may discuss diabetes or cancer , but what is amazing in all this is that IBS and even celiac disease are much more frequent than diabetes . "
According to Fasano , gastroenterologists estimate " IBS affects easily , 20 [ percent ] to 25 percent of the population . "
Seasonal Affective Disorder
There 's absolutely nothing new about the drop in daylight hours during winter months , but researchers in the later half of the 20th century managed to find , name and diagnose a condition related to it : seasonal affective disorder or SAD .
Like many suffering pathologies that are extremes of normal feelings , sufferers of SAD often face explaining why their " cabin fever " or " wintertime blues " is different .
According to the Mayo Clinic , SAD is a type of depression that can seriously affect someone 's life .
Sufferers of SAD show signs of hopelessness , anxiety , depression , oversleeping and difficulty concentrating .
SAD sufferers may also crave food , particularly starchy or sugary food .
Since researchers noted the cause may be a lack of sunlight , it was quite easy to come up with a treatment : light therapy .
According to the Mayo Clinic , people afflicted with SAD may find some relief in a special form of light therapy after a consultation with a mental health therapist .
Fibromyalgia
Much like chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia is a condition associated with a myriad symptoms that once confounded doctors .
People with fibromyalgia feel fatigue , muscle pain at specific " tender points , " headaches , insomnia , morning stiffness and memory problems .
" I think one of the reasons why people have skepticism about it , is because it 's been very hard to pinpoint what causes it , " said Dr. Roger Chou , an associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland .
Chou said the term fibromyalgia was coined in the 1970s .
Ever since , doctors have theorized that the condition may be caused by a single underlying infection , as is the case in Lyme disease , or by an autoimmune disorder or a muscle disorder .
" None of that stuff has panned out , " Chou said .
Although pharmaceutical companies have recently marketed treatments for fibromyalgia , Chou said the medication only helps some pain symptoms .
" It can be a really devastating disease , " Chou said .
" It can be so severe , that people can't get out of bed . "
" Clinicians do n't like to feel helpless , and we do feel like that with this condition , " he said .

Cold &
Flu season is here !
Visit the ABCNews.com OnCall + Cold & Flu Center to get all your questions answered about these nasty viruses .
A writer at The Washington Post says the answer is yes :
First , it is n’t the 1950s anymore .
As religion scholar Will Herberg noted in his influential 1955 essay “ Protestant - Catholic - Jew , ” at that time 68 percent of Americans were Protestant , 23 percent Catholic , and 4 percent Jewish .
( The remaining 5 percent expressed no religious preference . )
“ Not to be a Catholic , a Protestant , or a Jew today is , for increasing numbers of American people , not to be anything . ”
According to a recent Pew report , those figures have declined to 51 , 23 and 2 .
The remaining 20 + percent express plenty of preferences , including Mormon , Muslim , Buddhist , Hindu , Atheist and Agnostic .
Not to be a Catholic , a Protestant , or a Jew today is , for increasing numbers of American people , to be something else just as worthy of citizenship .
Second , the greatest threat to American freedom is no longer godless communism but “ godly ” terrorism — people who pledge their allegiance to God .
Docherty noted that even Stalin ’s Soviet Union could claim to be “ one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . ”
Today , even a Taliban - led Afghanistan could claim to be “ one nation , under God . ”
In his 1954 sermon , Docherty argued that Judeo - Christian America was engaged in “ mortal combat against modern , secularized , godless humanity . ”
Today , pluralistic America is engaged in mortal combat against anti-modern , fundamentalist , religionized humanity .
It is n’t our belief in God that makes us different .
It ’s our belief in the liberties ( religious and other ) enshrined in the Constitution .
The American creed is faith in liberty for all , not the religion of most .
On some level , Waters is absolutely correct but he misses the most important reason why claiming that the United States is a “ nation , under God ” is inappropriate .
It was expressed by America ’s Third President :
Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man & his god , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , thus building a wall of separation between church and state .
[ Congress thus inhibited from acts respecting religion , and the Executive authorised only to execute their acts , I have refrained from presenting even occasional performances of devotion presented indeed legally where an Executive is the legal head of a national church , but subject here , as religious exercises only to the voluntary regulations and discipline of each respective sect . ]
Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience , I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights , convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties .
America , as Jefferson noted , is not a nation founded on a specific set of religious beliefs , but on the belief in the natural rights of man , from whatever source those rights are derived .
ITALY'S public debt , the world 's third - biggest , equivalent to over 104 % of GDP , is not so much the elephant in the living room as the ogre in the attic .
The fear has long been that it could escape and wreak havoc , not only in Italy but also across the entire euro area .
On December 3rd came what some took to be an ominous rattling of the attic door .
It took the form of an answer by Silvio Berlusconi 's welfare minister , Maurizio Sacconi , to suggestions that he was at odds with the finance minister , Giulio Tremonti , over how much to spend on stimulus measures .
Denying that there was any conflict , he said “ I too am constrained by the public debt .
And I too am worried by the risk of default . ”
Seemingly unaware of the possible effect of his words , he added : “ There is something worse than recession , and that 's state bankruptcy : an improbable , but nevertheless possible , hypothesis . ”
If the Italian Treasury were unable to find buyers for Italian sovereign bonds , said Mr Sacconi , Italy could go the way of Argentina , which defaulted in 2001 .
The sovereign - bond market has certainly become more testing for sellers of debt .
Numerous countries , many with far better credit ratings than Italy , need to raise cash .
But if the yield on Italy 's bonds goes up , the government may end up paying more in interest , and that increases the risk of the budget deficit getting out of hand .
Were this to happen , it would further erode investors ' confidence , prompting them to demand still higher yields .
Amid the outcry that followed Mr Sacconi 's remarks , Mr Tremonti denied that there was any danger of default .
But on the same day he himself confirmed that the risks had grown .
He told a parliamentary committee that the “ sole constraint ” on government spending was no longer the European Union 's Maastricht rules that cap budget deficits , but the limits imposed by the markets .
Indeed , fears have been expressed that the start of what financiers call “ adverse debt dynamics ” can already be discerned in a sharp widening of the spread ( the difference in yields ) between the ten - year German bund and its Italian equivalent .
On December 5th this peaked at 144 basis points — up from a low of 38 basis points at the end of May ( see chart ) .
Yet Brian Coulton of Fitch , a rating agency , points out that this reflects falling German yields ( as investors seek ultra - safe havens ) rather than rising Italian ones .
“ The current yield on Italy 's ten - year bonds is the same as it was at the end of 2007 , ” he notes .
Since the launch of the euro , moreover , Italy 's debt managers have managed to extend the average term of its borrowing to almost seven years , locking in then - prevailing interest rates and ensuring that less of the outstanding debt is subject to abrupt rate increases .
Thanks in part to retrenchment under the previous centre - left government , Italy 's public finances are no longer in the parlous state they were in a few years ago .
In the spring Mr Tremonti rammed through parliament a three - year spending plan that included deep cuts .
That leaves two questions .
One is whether he can make his cuts stick .
The other is what will happen on the revenue side of the ledger .
In a recession tax revenues can be expected to fall .
But how much ?
In part , the answer will depend on the sensitivity of the public accounts to changes in growth .
Tax revenues soared under the centre - left .
But as Mr Coulton points out , it is not clear how much of this increase was structural ( the product of enduring improvements in tax collection ) and how much cyclical ( the result of a temporary upswing in the economy ) .
The other variable is the depth of the recession .
Most forecasters believe that it will be shallower in Italy than in Britain ( though deeper than in France or Germany ) .
But Mr Berlusconi's anti-recession measures have been distinctly modest ( involving extra net spending of only some € 6 billion ) .
And the reason that he withdrew his pledges of more aid was that Mr Tremonti reminded him of the limitations imposed by Italy 's € 1,575 billion of debt .
The ogre is still there , even if for the time being it is safely chained .

Never mind Viacom's $ 1 billion lawsuit against YouTube .
Today , Google 's ( GOOG ) video site is Viacom 's friend , as it looks for support in its battle against Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) , the no. 2 cable provider .
Viacom wants more money for its cable channels , and if it does n't get it , it 's threatening to turn 19 of its channels off for Time Warner subscribers .
" Call Time Warner now , " the commercial begs .
It looks like Viacom did n't upload the video -- the user is named laweekly2 , which seems to be Hollywood columnist Nikki Finke .
But either way , Viacom is benefiting from YouTube 's eyeballs today -- we doubt they 'll ask YouTube to take this one down .

BENTONVILLE , Ark. - Wal - Mart Stores Inc. has signed on to an Army Reserve program in which the company and the Army will work together to recruit and train people interested in serving in the military and working for the giant retailer .
Wal - Mart , the world 's largest private employer , has more than 1.4 million US employees .
An agreement signed yesterday obligates Wal - Mart to interview and consider all qualified , participating soldiers for employment after they complete military occupational specialty training .
When a reserve soldier who works at Wal - Mart is called to service , the company can draw on 1 million or so citizen soldiers to help identify a qualified replacement to work in the soldier 's place .
The arrangement is expected to lower costs of recruiting and training for Wal - Mart .

The best thing about Perl is CPAN .
CPAN is the C omprehensive P erl A rchive N etwork .
In short , it 's where you go to find Perl software .
Perl software is distributed as Perl modules .
There 's nothing particularly special about Perl modules .
They 're written in plain text files which you can load up into your favourite text editor to see how they work .
Perl modules typically have a .pm file extension instead of .pl and they 're usually distributed in zipped bundles that come with a . tar. gz file extension .
Some Perl modules use extensions written in the C programming language .
C works at a lower level than Perl so it typically runs faster and allows module authors to do the kind of things that can't be done in Perl alone .
In order to use any modules with C extensions , you 'll need to have a C compiler installed on your machine .
A compiler is a little like an interpreter , except that it does more work up front ( i.e. when you install a module ) so that it runs faster when you come to use it .
Apple provide a C compiler ( GCC ) as part of the Xcode developer tools .
You can install these from your Mac OSX installation disks , or by downloading from the Apple Developer Connection web site .
You can unpack and install Perl modules manually , but most people these days use the CPAN module to do it for them .
This should already be installed on your Mac .
From the Terminal command line , type sudo cpan to start it running .
The sudo part of the command indicates that you want to run the cpan program as the administrator or " super user " ( sudo stands for s uper u ser do ) .
If you 're not an administrator of the machine you 're using then you 'll have to go and find the administrator and be nice to him or her .
If you are then type your password ( the one you use to login to your Mac ) and hit return .
The first time you run the cpan program it will ask you a bunch of questions so that it can configure itself .
Answer the questions as best you can ( just hit RETURN if you 're not sure ) and then you should be greeted with a cpan [ 1 ] > prompt .
$ sudo cpan ... a few questions later ... cpan [ 1 ] >
Now that CPAN is configured , you can use it to install Perl modules .
Let 's start by installing the DateTime module .
You can probably guess what this module is used for !
cpan [ 1 ] > install DateTime ... lots of output ...
All tests successful .
Files=43 , Tests=3277 , 13 wallclock secs ( 0.51 usr 0.20 sys + 10.70 cusr 0.73 csys = 12.14 CPU ) Result : PASS DROLSKY / DateTime-0.4501.tar.gz /usr / bin/ make test -- OK Running make install Prepending / Users/abw/.cpan/build/DateTime-0.4501 -... blah blah blah ...
Password : enter your password here ... some more output ...
Appending installation info to / System / Library / Perl / 5.8.8 /... blah blah blah ...
DROLSKY / DateTime -0.4501.tar.gz sudo make install -- OK cpan [ 4 ] >
Assuming that all the pre-installation tests pass , the CPAN module will automatically run the sudo make install command to install the module .
At this point sudo will prompt you to enter your password to become the super - user .
If you 're not an administrator of the machine you 're using then you 'll have to go and find the administrator and be nice to him or her .
If the pre-installation tests do n't pass then you have two choices .
Either do n't use the module , or install it anyway and hope for the best .
It 's not uncommon for modules to fail a few minor tests , particularly if the author wrote it on a different platform to yours and did n't account for minor differences in filenames , date formats , locales , or any of the other messy things that make it difficult to write portable code that works everywhere .
You can force install a module if you want to use it regardless of any test failures .
cpan [ 2 ] > force install SomeDodgyModule
If you do encounter problems then please report them ( or see if someone else has already reported them ) at http://rt.cpan.org/.
Eye on the ball
Cricket fans love their stats .
Even the most casual follower can rattle off the batting averages of their favourite players or tell you how many wickets such - and - such a bowler took in the last test .
The most passionate followers can recite each scorecard from this year 's Wisden .
The recent news of the great Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar surpassing West Indian Brian Lara 's record number of test runs has given maths - loving cricket geeks another opportunity to pull out their calculators and Excel spreadsheets .
I 'm openly one of these nuts and did just that .
At the time of writing , Tendulkar had scored 12,027 runs across 247 innings , to overtake Lara 's 11,953 from 232 innings .
After a little investigation , I found that despite his outstanding average of over 54 runs per innings , Tendulkar 's most common score in test cricket is ... zero !
This was quite a shock — the most prolific run-scorer in test cricket has been out for nought ( a duck in cricket parlance ) 14 times , well ahead of his second most common score — which incidentally is the next lowest you can get : one !
Donald Bradman was well known for his high backlift and lengthy forward stride .
This is completely counter - intuitive , so I took this investigation further .
Australian cricketer Sir Donald Bradman is universally regarded as the best batsman ever to have played the game .
His average , an astounding 99.94 , is so far above every other batsman in the history of the game that he is often acclaimed as not only the best cricketer ever , but the best player ever of any sport .
His average is so iconic in Australia that the postcode of the ABC ( the Australian version of the BBC ) is 9994 in every capital city .
If it was n't for the fact that much more test cricket is played nowadays than in the early 1900s , and for World War II interrupting his career for six years , Bradman would have scored many more than the 6996 runs he did score .
So , guess what Bradman 's most common score was ?
That 's right , zero !
Indeed , looking at every innings by the most prolific batsmen in test history from Tendulkar at number 1 to Bradman at number 34 , the most common score is zero — and by quite a long way too .
The following figures show the distribution of scores from these top batsmen — on the horizontal axis you see the number of runs and the vertical axis measures the frequency of dismissals at a particular number of runs .
The first chart shows every score between 0 and 100 , and the second uses five - run wide bins to show scores up to 250 .
The data only include scores where the batsman was dismissed and so does not include not - out scores .
Scores plotted against dismissal frequency .
Scores in bins of five plotted against dismissal frequency .
Model cricket
A closer look at these distributions shows that they very closely fit what is known as an exponential distribution .
An exponential distribution has the form
A straight line fitted to the data .
The blue dots represent observed data and the black line represents the model .
A straight line fitted to the data from the second chart above .
The blue dots represent observed data and the black line represents the model .
In this caseis the probability of being dismissed at scorewithbeing a constant .
A common trick when looking at distributions involving exponentials is to take logarithms of both sides to get
The graph of this function , plottingagainst , is now a straight line with slope .
If the statistical data fits the exponential distribution , then the plot of the logarithm of the frequency of dismissals against the score at which dismissal happened should look roughly like a straight line .
There is a very strong straight line fit in both charts .
Using a standard technique called least - squares regression , we can find the straight line that best fits the data .
We can determine from the coefficient of in the equation of this line , and in our case this gives equal to 0.023 .
The mean of an exponential distribution , a sort of average , is .
In our case this gives a mean of around 43 - the same as we observe in the raw data .
One can make the interesting observation that there is no such thing as the " nervous nineties " : players do not " choke " and get out in the 90s , nervous before scoring a glorious test century , any more than they get out at any other score .
Indeed , you could argue the opposite given the probability troughs at 94 , 98 and in the 190s .
You can also see that the probability of being dismissed for a duck is higher than you might expect for an exponential distribution .
So what ?
Now , so far you might be thinking that all of this is only of passing statistical interest .
So what if cricket scores follow an exponential distribution ?
Well , I 'm glad you asked !
Let 's turn for a second to a different distribution , the geometric distribution .
You will be familiar with this distribution from a simple 50 /50 coin toss .
The geometric distribution describes the number of coin tosses you need before a head ( or tail ) first turns up .
The probability of your first head turning up on your toss is described as
Sachin Tendulkar against Australia in the 2nd test at the SCG in 2008 .
Image by Privatemusings .
whereis the probability of a head turning up on each toss , that is , 0.5 .
The distribution is memory - less , which is one of its key descriptors .
No matter what has gone before , even if you have fluked 100 tails in a row , the probability of a head turning up on the 101st throw is still .
The geometric distribution only works for integer values of , that is , you can only throw a coin 2 , 3 , 100 etc times and not 2.5 times .
The exponential distribution is the continuous equivalent of this distribution , extending it to work for all numbers , not just integers .
Given that cricket batting scores seem to fit a exponential distribution , this means that we can picture cricket batting scores on a geometric distribution with the probability of you being dismissed at scoreas
Can you spot the profound result here ?
Remembering that the geometric distribution is memory - less , you can interpret this as saying that no matter what score you are currently on , you have the same chance of getting out on that score as you do on any other score !
Like a coin toss , the probability of you being dismissed on each score does not depend on what has gone before .
A model which assumes that there is no memory is known as a constant hazard model .
This seems to go against every cricketing manual I have ever read .
Accepted cricketing wisdom says that a batsman is more dangerous when ( s ) he " has the eye in " and has scored 10 or 20 runs .
Our result seems to suggest that , apart from when a batsman is on 0 , you have just as much chance of dismissing him or her on the current score as on any other score .
The next question to ask is , what is the probability of dismissing a batsman on the current score ( that is , what is in the above equation ) ?
The mean of a geometric distribution is
Scores near zero
Knowing that the mean of the exponential distribution is , and transferring this to the geometric distribution , we get Forthis gives .
Therefore , if you were to turn the television on now and find the cricket coverage , the chance that the batsman you are watching gets out on the current score is 2.2 % .
The biggest deviation from the geometric distribution is for scores near zero .
According to our data , the chance of being dismissed for a duck is 6.9 % — around 3 times more than expected for a geometric ( or exponential ) distribution .
But by the time the batsman has scored two or three runs , the geometric distribution starts to fit well .
There is a small peak at four runs , perhaps because you can relatively easily get to four before you become comfortable — it only takes one streaky shot to the boundary .
Whilst you can get to three with one shot , you are more likely to have played a few shots and so may be comparatively more " set " .
The data and the geometric distribution .
The blue dots represent observed data and the black line represents the model .
An analysis of scores near zero has been completed by Brendon J. Brewer from the University of New South Wales in Getting your eye in : A Bayesian analysis of early dismissals in cricket .
Brewer indeed found that batsmen are more vulnerable at the beginning of their innings .
By assuming a constant hazard model , Brewer determined the effective average of a batsman before they have scored — that is , assuming a constant hazard model with probability of dismissal equal to that of their chance of being dismissed for a duck , Brewer determined the mean of this new distribution .
In our data from the best batsmen of all time , dismissal for a duck occurred with a 6.9 % chance .
The mean of a geometric distribution built around this probability is
Conclusions
This means that even though our batsmen have a mean of about 43 , before they 've scored they bat like cricketers with a mean of 13.5 .
Even the best batsmen bat like tail - enders before they get off the mark !
What should we take away from this analysis ?
Beware of the duck .
The conclusion seems to be that there is a very small window in the beginning of a batsman 's innings in which there is a greater chance of dismissal than there ordinarily is .
This makes sense — batsmen take some time to acclimatise to the game conditions .
But this is a small window — once the batsman has scored about three runs , you have the same chance of dismissal whatever the current score .
Interestingly , tiredness does not seem to play a part — the exponential distribution holds well out to 250 runs ( quite a few hours of batting ) .
It should be remembered that this analysis was completed on the top 34 run scorers of all time ( 5953 innings ) and so represents the best ever batsmen .
Lesser batsmen are likely to get low scores , so perhaps this window is slightly wider for them .
But if we turn to the greatest of the great , Bradman , the window is essentially one run .
His effective average before he had scored was a very mediocre nine runs .
After he had scored two runs , this effective average had risen to 69 .
You had to get Bradman out very early !

The data was retrieved from cricinfo during the second test between Australia and India on the 19th of October 2008 ;
Not - out scores were removed from the analysis ;
The exponential distribution does break down a little for scores above 250 as there simply is n't enough data ;

Abu -Hanoud , who was considered a protégé of al - Sharif , escaped the strike but was killed by the IDF a year and a half later .
After the bombing of the prison he met with al - Sharif 's family and notified them of his death .
A year later , during Israel 's ' Operation Defensive Shield ' , al - Sharif 's family reported that he had been killed in the Israeli air strike of 2001 .
They constructed a mourning tent and the PA declared him a martyr .
In November the IDF received intelligence that al - Sharif was still alive and raided the family 's home , demanding his surrender .
The raid prompted a PA investigation , which concluded that he was indeed still alive , and frequented the home of his family .
After al - Sharif 's arrest on Saturday Hamas declared the PA responsible for his well - being .
" The Authority 's gangs arrested al - Sharif in coordination with the IDF and Israeli security , " the group said in a statement .
Hamas claimed Palestinian security officials celebrated the arrest by singing and tooting horns in the streets of Nablus .
The group said the celebration was " a knife in the back of the Palestinian resistance and a service to the Israelis . "
The working day has barely begun in the special wing of Onomichi prison , but the dozens of inmates hunched over rows of desks on a rain - sodden weekday morning are already starting to wilt .
Their jobs hardly constitute hard labour : constructing corrugated casings for lightbulbs , tying lengths of wire to luggage tags and making pairs of knitted slippers .
The silence is broken only when another guard , peaked cap pulled tightly over his eyes , enters the room , salutes and barks a military - style greeting to a colleague .
For these prisoners , the show of authority seems as out of place as the forbidding walls that block the view of the foggy coastline a few miles away .
Few , if any , have the energy to start a riot , let alone attempt to escape .
There may be no hardened yakuza gangsters here , but Onomichi's 70 or so ageing inmates nonetheless represent the biggest challenge facing Japan 's criminal justice system in decades .
While other developed countries debate what to do about youth offenders , Japan is grappling with a different kind of crime wave , and one that demographic trends show can only get worse .
The over 60s are the fastest - growing group of criminals in Japan , which incarcerates its pensioners at a rate far higher than any other country in the industrialised world .
The number of Japanese aged 70 and over charged with crimes trebled between 2000 and 2006 , from 9,478 to 28,892 , according to the national police agency .
Last year elderly men and women were responsible for almost one in seven recorded crimes , compared with one in 25 a decade earlier .
While most were guilty of theft , shoplifting and other petty offences , more than 150 were charged with murder .
For the first time , ageing criminals account for more than 12 % of the total prison population , prompting the government to earmark 8.3 bn yen ( £ 39 m ) this year to build three new prison wards that will house more than 1,000 elderly inmates .
In the years to come , many of Japan 's 74 prisons will end up looking like Onomichi , an ageing prison about 400 miles south - west of Tokyo that first started catering to older prisoners 20 years ago .
The prison , tucked away on a hill overlooking the Seto inland sea , incarcerates just over 300 offenders , 76 of whom are 65 or over .
The average age of the men in the special ward is almost 70 ; the oldest is 89 .
Almost all are serving sentences of one to several years for theft - usually of food from supermarkets - small - time fraud and , in a few cases , possession of drugs .
The most serious offender , a man in his 70s , is serving a 10 - year sentence for murder .
Almost all of Onomichi's elderly inmates have their own cell , a 3.6 - metre room with tatami- mat floor , a TV , a desk , a sink and a toilet .
Their personal effects , mainly books and comics , are stored in locked suitcases whenever they are not in their cells .
Charts on their cell doors stipulate special dietary requirements and medication regimes .
A handrail runs the length of the corridor , and makeshift wheelchair ramps are kept at the entrance to the communal baths .
But the most common condition afflicting these men is loneliness .
Some serve their sentences without seeing a single visitor .
Their relatives are either dead , live too far away or , unable to cope with the shame of having a criminal in their midst , have ceased all contact .
" When one of those inmates dies , the prison discreetly arranges a cremation and sends the ashes to his closest relatives , " Tomohiko Ogawa , the chief warden at Onomichi , says during a tour of the prison .
" When we did a survey of prisoners due to be released , half said they were happy , not because they were regaining their freedom but because they had someone waiting for them on the outside .
Not all of them are so lucky . "
The rise of the superannuated criminal is only partly explained by Japan 's rapidly ageing population .
While the number of Japanese aged 60 and over grew by 17 % between 2000 and 2006 , the number of prisoners in the same age bracket soared by 87 % .
Criminologists blame record levels of poverty among pensioners , the breakdown of the extended family , and a lack of professional help for those with depression and other mental illnesses .
Life on the outside can be unforgiving for elderly men with a criminal record .
" Those without family or friends are worst off , " Ogawa says .
" If they do n't have a guarantor , they can't find a place to live .
If they have nowhere to live they can't get a job .
It 's a vicious circle . "
Instead , the best chance many have of security , decent healthcare and three meals a day is another stint behind bars .
According to a recent justice ministry study , almost two - thirds of Onomichi 's older inmates will walk back through its doors within five years of their release .
" I'm comfortable with prison life , " a 76 - year - old inmate told a Japanese newspaper earlier this year , before the prison banned prisoners from talking to visiting journalists .
" I have clothing , food and housing and I 'm taken care of when I get sick .
Prison life is like a strict nursing home . "
Ogawa admits that Onomichi's 76 prison staff face a daily struggle to reconcile society 's demands for retribution with their duty of care to inmates .
" The prisoners ' health is our biggest worry , and what they are going to do when they get out , " he says .
" But while they are here we have to be seen to enforcing discipline and punishing them for their crimes .
If we did n't , people would rightly ask what their taxes were being spent on . "
The prisoners repay their debt by performing six hours a day of light manual labour , two less than Onomichi 's younger prisoners .
Every few minutes , one of the men lays down his tools and shuffles to a makeshift pharmacy set up in the corner of the room , where the prison doctor dispenses pills that must be washed down on the spot with tiny cups of water .
As many as 80 % of the inmates here have high blood pressure or diabetes .
There is a portable mattress on hand in case anyone feels faint , along with a wheelchair and , placed discreetly behind a desk , boxes of incontinence pads .
Later , in the gymnasium , the noise level rises as the prisoners play table tennis , chat over games of chess or belt out classic karaoke tunes .
Others sit and stare , read sports tabloids or flick through a meagre selection of religious and self - help texts .
One inmate in his late 60s who has seven months of his sentence left folds up his Buddhist newspaper and briefly breaks the prison 's gagging order .
" We are well looked after here , " he says .
And what is he looking forward to most of all once he gets out ?
Seeing his family , perhaps ?
" No ... I can't wait to have a drink and a smoke , " he confides , before a guard appears and he goes back to his newspaper .
Backstory
In 2006 Japan 's prison population stood at about 80,000 , of whom 12 % were at least 60 .
About 1,000 prisoners have difficulty walking , feeding themselves or doing prison work .
Many more have long - term but manageable health conditions .
Of the 46,637 people over 60 convicted in 2006 , just over half were found guilty of shoplifting , followed by 23 % who had committed petty theft .
While the number of charges against juveniles increased by 2 % from 2000 - 04 , there was a 125 % increase among over - 70s .
Last year there were 152 murders by over - 65s , including a 65 - year - old woman who strangled her sick husband after " he repeatedly shouted at me over many years " .
Japan is far ahead of other countries in locking up elderly people .
According to the latest figures available , 2.8 % of prisoners in the UK are in the same age bracket , while in the US 1.8 % of prisoners are over 60 .

I downloaded Microsoft ’s newly released Visual Studio 2010 CTP virtual machine disk image hoping for a few surprises , but I certainly did n’t expect this …
The Visual Studio 2010 CTP is a huge multi-gigabyte VM running Windows Server 2008 .
The first thing I did with it is start up Visual C++ 2010 , create a Win32 console application and run it in the debugger .
I looked at the stack trace and saw the following :
vc10app.exe!wmain( int argc=1 , wchar_t * * argv=0x000d1470 ) Line 8
vc10app.exe!__tmainCRTStartup ()
Line 564 + 0x19 bytes

ntdll.dll!_RtlUserThreadStart(long ( void *) * StartAddress=0x013b1073 , void * Argument=0x7ffdf000 )
Line 2672 + 0 xb bytes
vc10 app is the name of my test console application .
I go over stack traces on a daily basis so the special thing about this one immediately caught my attention .
Notice that the wmain ( ) function of my console application has full debugging information ( as expected for something I wrote ) and the parameter names argc and argv are visible in the stack trace .
Under normal circumstances , only public debugging symbols are available for Microsoft OS components like kernel32 and ntdll .
In this CTP VM , however , the StartAddress and Argument parameters were visible as well .
Public debugging symbols are stripped versions of the original private symbols generated by the build process .
They do not contain parameter information and do not contain the names of local variables in functions .
Note however that for C++ functions , name mangling results in parameter types being visible in public symbols as well .
Normally , when running the debugger in a system configured to use Microsoft ’s public symbols , names for internal functions are visible in stack traces , but the names of arguments and locals never are .
I opened the Modules tab of the Visual Studio debugger to determine where the debugger is picking up these symbols for kernel32 and ntdll .
The debugger was using C:\ppa\symstore as the symbol store .
I opened the C:\ppa directory and saw that a Visual Studio Profiler session for a matrix multiplication application was stored there .
Apparently someone with access to Microsoft ’s internal symbol store ran a profiling session on this matrix multiplication application , perhaps to ensure profiling is functional on the CTP VM .
The private symbols retrieved for the session were persisted in the CTP ’s disk and made their way to the public release .
To ensure my hypothesis was correct , I installed Windbg on the machine , opened ntdll.dll as a crash dump and loaded symbols from the store directory :

The private PDB for ntdll.dll found in this CTP VM image notes how HeapHandle , Flags , Size and ExtraSize are the parameter names for RtlAllocateHeap .
Furthermore , AllocationSize , Interceptor and ExceptionRecord are used as local names in this API .
Private PDBs also feature source information .

Exact matches :

The PDB features references to the source file from the Windows source tree for RtlAllocateHeap and the other APIs .
Additionally , it appears to contain a custom reference to Microsoft ’s internal source control system , Source Depot , presumably to facilitate the debugger retrieving up to date sources automatically when those are not available locally .
It ’s interesting how scattered bits of information in a debugging symbols file provide a fascinating insight into Windows .
Hope you enjoyed the surprise as much as I did …
With his bright sunflowers , searing wheat fields and blazing yellow skies , Vincent van Gogh was fanatic about light .
" Oh ! that beautiful midsummer sun here , " he wrote to the painter Émile Bernard in 1888 from the south of France .
" It beats down on one 's head , and I have n't the slightest doubt that it makes one crazy .
But as I was so to begin with , I only enjoy it . "

Van Gogh was also enthralled with night , as he wrote to his brother Theo that same year : " It often seems to me that the night is much more alive and richly colored than the day ....
The problem of painting night scenes and effects on the spot and actually by night interests me enormously . "
What van Gogh fixed on , by daylight or at night , gave the world many of its most treasured paintings .
His 1888 Sunflowers , says critic Robert Hughes , " remains much the most popular still life in the history of art , the botanical answer to the Mona Lisa . "
And van Gogh 's visionary landscape The Starry Night , done the next year , has long ranked as the most popular painting at New York City 's Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) .
This inspired the museum , in collaboration with Amsterdam 's Van Gogh Museum , to mount the exhibition " Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night " ( through January 5 , 2009 ) .
It will then travel to the Van Gogh Museum ( February 13 - June 7 , 2009 ) .
" The van Gogh we usually think of , that painter of the most audacious , crazy , passionate , frenzied , unleashed bursts of brushwork , may be more evident in his daylight paint­ings , " says MoMA 's curator for the show , Joachim Pissarro , great - grandson of the French Impressionist Camille Pissarro .
" But in paintings such as the Arles café at night , his touch is more restrained and you really see his intelligence at work .
Despite all the mental anguish and depression he experienced , van Gogh never ceased to enjoy an astonishingly clear self - awareness and consciousness of what he was doing . "
In an essay for the exhibition catalog , Pissarro tries to clear up some popular mythology : " Contrary to an enduring misconception of van Gogh as a rough and ready chromomaniac driven by his instincts to render what he saw almost as quickly as he saw it , the artist 's twilight and night scenes are actually elaborate constructions that also call on his vast literary knowledge . "
Van Gogh himself hinted at this in a letter to his sister Wil , written in 1888 as he was painting his first starry night canvas .
He was inspired , he said , by imagery in the poems by Walt Whitman he was reading : " He sees ... under the great starlit vault of heaven a something which after all one can only call God — and eternity in its place above the world . "
It seems that van Gogh never dreamed his paintings would become such fixed stars in the art firmament .
In 1890 , less than two months before he ended his life with a pistol shot , he wrote to a Paris newspaper critic who had praised his work , " It is absolutely certain that I shall never do important things . "
He was then 37 years old , had been painting for less than ten years and had sold next to nothing .
In his last letter to Theo , found on the artist at his death , he had written : " Well , my own work , I am risking my life for it , and my reason has half foundered because of it . "
Like his paintings , van Gogh 's biography has gone into legend .
He was born in 1853 in the Netherlands ; his father was a minister , his uncles , successful art dealers .
He was dismissed while working as a missionary in southwest Belgium for being too zealous and failed as an art salesman by being too honest .
When he took up drawing and painting , his originality offended his teachers .
One student later described the scene at the Antwerp Academy where van Gogh enrolled : " On that day the pupils had to paint two wrestlers , who were posed on the platform , stripped to the waist .
Van Gogh started painting feverishly , furiously , with a rapidity that stupefied his fellow students .
He laid on his paint so thickly that his colors literally dripped from his canvas on to the floor . "
He was promptly kicked out of the class .
But alone in a studio or in the fields , van Gogh 's discipline was as firm as his genius was unruly , and he taught himself all the elements of classical technique with pains­taking thoroughness .
He copied and recopied lessons from a standard academic treatise on drawing until he could draw like the old masters , before letting his own vision loose in paint .
Although he knew he needed the utmost technical skill , he confessed to an artist friend that he aimed to paint with such " expressive force " that people would say , " I have no technique . "
By the early 1880s , Theo , who was four years younger than Vincent , was finding success as a Paris art dealer and had begun supporting his brother with a monthly stipend .
Vincent sent
Theo his astonishing canvases , but Theo could n't sell them .
In the spring of 1889 after receiving a shipment of paintings that included the now - famous Sunflowers , the younger brother tried to reassure the elder : " When we see that the Pissarros , the Gauguins , the Renoirs , the Guillaumins do not sell , one ought to be almost glad of not having the public 's favor , seeing that those who have it now will not have it for­ever , and it is quite possible that times will change very shortly . "
But time was running out .
Growing up in the Brabant , the southern region of the Netherlands , Vincent had absorbed the dark palette of great Dutch painters such as Frans Hals and Rembrandt .
As an art student in Antwerp , he had the opportunity to visit museums , see the work of his contemporaries and frequent cafés and performances .
In March 1886 , he went to join Theo in Paris .
There , having encountered young painters like Toulouse - Lautrec , Gauguin and Signac , as well as older artists such as Pissarro , Degas and Monet , he adopted the brighter colors of modern art .
But with his move to Arles , in the south of France , in February 1888 , the expressive force he'd been searching for at last erupted .
Alone in the sun-drenched fields and gaslit night cafés of Arles , he found his own palette of bright yellows and somber blues , gay geranium oranges and soft lilacs .
His skies became yellow , pink and green , with violet stripes .
He painted feverishly , " quick as lightning , " he boasted .
And then , just as he achieved a new mastery over brush and pigment , he lost control of his life .
In a fit of hallucinations and anguish in December 1888 , he severed part of his ear and delivered it to a prostitute at a local brothel .
Gauguin , who had come to Arles to paint with him , fled to Paris , and van Gogh , after his neighbors petitioned the police , was locked up in a hospital .
From then on , the fits recurred unpredictably , and he spent most of the last two years of his life in asylums , first in Arles and then in Saint - Rémy , painting what he could see through the bars of his window or from the surrounding gardens and fields .
" Life passes like this , " he wrote to Theo from Saint - Rémy in September 1889 , " time does not return , but I am dead set on my work , for just this very reason , that I know the opportunities of working do not return .
Especially in my case , in which a more violent attack may forever destroy my power to paint . "
When the attacks seemed to subside in May 1890 , van Gogh left Saint - Rémy for Auvers - sur - Oise , a small village near Paris where Dr. Paul Gachet , a local physician and friend to many painters , agreed to care for him .
But van Gogh 's paintings proved more successful than the doctor 's treatments .
Among the artist 's last efforts was the tumultuous Wheatfield with Crows , in which dark and light , near and far , joy and anguish , all seem bound together in a frenzy of paint that can only be called apocalyptic .
Van Gogh shot himself soon after painting it and died two days later .
He was buried in a graveyard next to the field .
Theo had been at Vincent 's side as the artist died and , according to Bernard , left the graveyard at Auvers " broken by grief . "
He never recovered .
He barely had time to present a show of Vincent 's paintings in his Paris apartment .
Six months later he , too , died — out of his mind and incoherent in a clinic in Holland , where he had been taken by his wife because of his increasingly violent outbursts .
( One theory holds that both Theo and Vincent , and probably their sister Wil , all suffered from an inherited metabolic disorder that caused their similar physical and mental symptoms . )
He now lies buried next to his brother in Auvers .
Against the backdrop of this poignant biography , the new exhibition of van Gogh 's night pictures at MoMA takes on added significance .
For it was to the night sky , and to the stars , that van Gogh often looked for solace .
The problems of painting night scenes on the spot held more than a technical interest and challenge for him .
When he looked at the night sky , he wrote to Theo in August 1888 , he saw " the mysterious brightness of a pale star in the infinite . "
When you are well , he went on , " you must be able to live on a piece of bread while you are working all day , and have enough strength to smoke and drink your glass in the evening ....
And all the same to feel the stars and the infinite high and clear above you .
Then life is almost enchanted after all . "
Van Gogh saw the night as a period of reflection and meditation after a day of activity , says MoMA curatorial assistant Jennifer Field , one of the organizers of the exhibition .
" It was also this kind of metaphor for the cycle of life .
And he linked this with the changing of the seasons . "
In Arles , in 1888 and 1889 , van Gogh 's paintings took on a mystical , dreamlike quality .
Straight lines became wavy , colors intensified , thick paint became thicker , sometimes squeezed straight onto the canvas from the tube .
Some of these changes were later taken as a sign of his madness , and even van Gogh feared that " some of my pictures certainly show traces of having been painted by a sick man . "
But there was premeditation and technique behind these distortions , as he tried to put a sense of life 's mysteries into paint .
In a letter to Wil , he explained that " the bizarre lines , purposely selected and multiplied , meandering all through the picture , may fail to give the garden a vulgar resemblance , but may present it to our minds as seen in a dream , depicting its character , and at the same time stranger than it is in reality . "
The artist 's focus on the relationship between dreams and reality — and life and death — had a profound meaning for him , as he had confided to Theo in a letter a year before his first crisis in Arles .
" Looking at the stars always makes me dream , as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map .
Why , I ask myself , should n't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France ?
Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen , we take death to reach a star . "
His interest in mixing dreams and reality , observation and imagination , is particularly evident in the night paintings he made in Arles and Saint - Rémy in 1889 and 1890 , in which he not only conquered the difficulties of using color to depict darkness but also went a long way toward capturing the spiritual and symbolic meanings that he saw in the night .
" He lived at night , " says Pissarro .
" He did n't sleep until three or four in the morning .
He wrote , read , drank , went to see friends , spent entire nights in cafés ... or meditated over the very rich associations that he saw in the night .
It was during the night hours that his experiments with imagination and memory went the farthest . "
Van Gogh told
Theo that in depicting the interior of a night café , where he had slept among the night prowlers of Arles , " I have tried to express the terrible passions of humanity by means of red and green . "
He stayed up three consecutive nights to paint the " rotten joint , " he said .
" Everywhere there is a clash and contrast of the most disparate reds and greens in the figures of little sleeping hooligans , in the empty , dreary room ... the blood - red and the yellow - green of the billiard table . "
Van Gogh considered it one of the ugliest paintings he'd made , but also one of the most " real . "
His first painting of the starry sky , The Starry Night over the Rhône ( 1888 ) , was another exercise in contrasting complementary colors ( pairs chosen to heighten each other 's impact ) .
This time , the effect of the painting , with its greenish blue sky , violet - hued town and yellow gas­light , was more romantic .
He wrote
Wil that he had painted it " at night under a gas jet . "
Van Gogh considered his now - iconic
The Starry Night , which he painted from his barred window at Saint - Rémy , a failed attempt at abstraction .
Before leaving Saint - Rémy , he wrote to Émile Bernard : " I have been slaving away on nature the whole year , hardly thinking of impressionism or of this , that and the other .
And yet , once again I let myself go reaching for stars that are too big — a new failure — and I have had enough of it . "
Theo liked the painting but was worried .
He wrote Vincent that " the expression of your thoughts on nature and living creatures shows how strongly you are attached to them .
But how your brain must have labored , and how you have risked everything .... "
Vincent did n't live to know that in his reaching for the stars , he had created a masterpiece .
New Mexico - based painter and printmaker Paul Trachtman wrote about new figurative painters in the October 2007 issue .

What a wonderful political distraction is Senator Barack Hussein Obama .
Perhaps a good part of his attractiveness is that he is in so many ways the complete opposite of George W. Bush .
Yet , what amazes me is how our bipartisan obstacle to true political competition continually creates illusions of change and reform .
Thus it keeps a grip on Americansâ€™ hope for the future , and preempts public support for more profound political change .
Is Obama just another example of how our corrupt political system ingeniously creates candidates to keep hope alive ?
Is the self - professed progressive Obama the real thing ?
Is he something other than a conventional politician ?
I have read many of his speeches and other statements .
I applaud his upbeat rhetoric , but few policy details are given .
Joseph Sobran opined that â€ œthe Democrats are looking for a political messiah , and many of them think theyâ€™ve found one in Illinoisâ€™s junior senator , Barack Obama .
And Obama is , without question , a very charming , intelligent , and impressive young man who is , moreover , catnip to the press corps .â€ 
Cal Thomas made the good point that many Americans look at presidential candidates as political messiahs .
He said Obama â€œcan also play dual roles of messiah figure and one of the Wise Men.â€ 
And he astutely asked : â€ œHave political â€˜messiah figuresâ€™ become false gods ?
â€

In truth , none of the current presidential hopefuls have obtained the political messiah mantle as much as Obama has .
Yet I remain skeptical .
Is he willing to do whatever it takes to become President ?
In our diseased political system , whatever - it - takes - candidacy produces screw - the - public - politics - as - usual .
Here are some things that would truly impress me about Obamaâ€™s uniqueness , and that would support viewing him as something other than just another opportunistic politician â€ “ albeit with a race , good looks , anti-Iraq war , and intelligence advantage .
First and foremost , I would be deeply impressed if Obama soon committed to taking campaign contributions only from individuals and only in small amounts , say no greater than $ 50 .
Because if he raised the huge amount of money necessary for a competitive presidential campaign â€ “ say $ 100 million â€ “ from the usual sources , then he will inevitably become ( assuming he is not already ) corrupted .
Second , his voting record in the Senate shows a strong allegiance to labor and teacher unions , according to data from Project Vote Smart .
These groups can be hugely important sources of big campaign money .
I would like to hear Obama explicitly pronounce policy positions that show he is not a lackey of organized labor .
Third , he has supported the views of the Population Connection , better known by its former name : Zero Population Growth ..
One of its core positions is : â€ œ
The only acceptable solution to the population problem is through expanding educational , advocacy and service efforts that lower birth rates .
â€ 
Additionally , for the United States it advocates â€œefforts to conserve energy and natural resources and improve efficiency , eliminate our â€˜disposable societyâ€™ lifestyle , and use the best possible technology to protect the natural and human environment .
â€ 
I would be impressed if Obama spoke out about the compulsive consumerism hallmarking U.S. culture .
And if he solidly supported higher gasoline taxes and stricter vehicle mileage standards to promote less driving and gasoline use .
Besides favoring abortion rights and backing the interests of Planned Parenthood , what else does he support to cut global population growth ?
Forth , he has demonstrated little support for the policy goals of the National Taxpayers Union , that lobbies for â€ œthe merits of limited government and low taxes , â€ fights corporate welfare and tax advantages for the wealthy , and advocates for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution .
Similarly , his record shows little support for what the Americans for Tax Reform groups advocates .
A core position of this group is : â€ œPoliticians often run for office saying they wo n't raise taxes , but then quickly turn their backs on the taxpayer .
The idea of the Pledge is simple enough :
Make them put their no - new - taxes rhetoric in writing .â€ 
So , this is what I would like to hear from Obama : tell us you are not a free - spending liberal that will easily justify raising taxes to increase funding for social programs .
And that you will fight for a balanced budget constitutional amendment â€ “ in fact , be the first presidential candidate ever to advocate for an Article V convention of state delegates to consider this and other possible amendments !
Fifth , his views on illegal immigration are very consistent with those of the American Immigration Lawyers Association , and opposite to those of groups working to stop the massive influx of illegal immigration .
Has he bought into labor unionâ€™s desire for more members , despite illegals lowering wages for working - class American citizens , just what corporate interests want ?
Does he favor ANY strict measures to stop the invasion of illegal immigrants , including stiffer penalties for illegal employers ?
What would he do to combat the plight of local governments facing high costs from illegal immigrants ?
Obama says â€ œAmerica is a land of big dreamers and big hopes.â€ 
Then please tell us â€ “ exactly and soon â€ “ what are YOUR big dreams and big hopes for America that you intend to pursue if you become President .
Give us details that differentiate you not just from the other presidential candidates , but from all conventional politicians that have lost the trust and confidence of most Americans .
You say â€œwe need the political will .â€ 
For what exactly ?
Not just the big , broad goals , but tell us the â€œhowâ€ â€ “ the policy paths that you will fight for to reach lofty goals .
I donâ€™t care that he has little government and no executive experience , not if he is willing to boldly speak out with specifics about exactly what he would try to accomplish as President .
Cynic though I am , if he really is the Democratic messiah , then as an American I would be very happy .
But I share Cal Thomasâ€™ skepticism : â€ œWhat puzzles me is why so many people put their hopes in politicians , when politicians ( and politics ) repeatedly let them down.â€ 
I want Obama to speak with such clarity that he either earns the messiah label , or makes realists of even his strongest supporters .
We do not need another political false idol , from the left or the right .

You wo n’t find that album here .
What you will find is the Top 50 albums of the year as voted by registered Prefix users ( including staff ) , through our Best Albums of 2008 list feature .
A certain band from Brooklyn , with their opus about the world going down the tubes , captured the most attention , and the other comeback album from a band representing a far - gone musical movement caught your adoration as well .
A guy ’s personal break - up album that he recorded in a shack in Wisconsin in 2006 is here , as well as an idiosyncratic hip - hop masterpiece that asks the philosophical question , “ What ’s a goon to a goblin ? ”
So here it is , the Top 50 Albums of 2008 as voted by you , the Prefix community .
It might not be the perfect list for everyone , but it is certainly the most democratic .
Jefferson , be damned .

Islam Amr Badr died in hospital after being injured ( Photo : Al Masry Alyoum )
An Egyptian court has sentenced a schoolteacher to six years in jail for beating a pupil to death because he had not done his homework .
Maths teacher Haitham Nabeel Abdelhamid , 23 , took Islam Amr Badr outside the classroom and hit him violently in the stomach .
The 11 - year - old boy fainted and later died in hospital of heart failure in the city of Alexandria .
The court was told the boy had four broken ribs .
Abdelhamid was convicted of manslaughter .
He said he only meant to discipline the pupil and did not mean to hurt anyone .
The teacher 's lawyer was quoted as saying in court : " Hitting [ a child ] is not banned in schools and my client did not break the law . "
National outrage
Observers say the case has been seen as a shocking reminder of the failings of Egypt 's state education system .
The incident , at Saad Othman Primary School on the outskirts of Alexandria in October , caused national outrage .
Islam 's father , Amr Badr Ibrahim , said others should have stood trial with the teacher .
" The problem is the teaching and the teachers because they cannot find good teachers , " he said .
" The minister of education should be the first person to be accused - how can he agree to let such a young man teach children ? "
In the state education system , young , inexperienced and under - resourced teachers often struggle to control classes of 60 to 100 children .
The Egyptian government says it is bringing in education reforms - including new teacher testing .
It is also trying to tackle violence in schools and has issued new statements on the prohibition of corporal punishment .
Paris Hilton and Benji Madden Are Just On a Break

I 'm still in love with him . "
If anyone could get to the bottom ofand 's break up it's .
Today the heiress was on Ryan 's radio show KIIS - FM and put a stop to the rumors that she dumped Benji .
As for the reason behind the split , she said that they are both extremely busy with work and travel .
Neither one dumped the other , the decision was mutual between " two adults . "
Hilton said that the two talk daily and have even seen each other .
One has to wonder if the recent run in that she had with her ex-boyfriend Stavros Niarchos had anything to do with the split ?
She said it was a " chance encounter " and that they simply had a quick chat .

The BNP said the list was published maliciously
A list showing the full contact details of British National Party activists has been published online .
The BNP says the list , which includes home phone numbers and e-mail addresses , dates from 2007 and some people are no longer members .
BNP deputy leader Simon Darby called it " an underhand political attack " , saying an ex-employee was to blame .
Party leader Nick Griffin has complained to Dyfed Powys Police , who are investigating .
Mr Griffin said he was disappointed by the leak .
He said : " We 'll be asking the police to investigate .
" Having spent a lot of money to secure our members ' privacy we are disappointed that it 's been breached .
" They know it 's been in the hands of someone anti-BNP for a considerable length of time . "
Mr Darby said the publication could lead to identity theft and endanger children named in the list .
He believes it was posted on Monday night by an ex-employee who had used it to send out party information to members .
Earlier this year the party obtained an injunction from the High Court in Manchester banning any publication of the list .
The anti-immigration party has won council seats in recent years , and took a London Assembly seat in May .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Allergan Inc , the maker of Botox , said on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its eyelash - thickening drug Latisse .
A model has her make - up applied backstage before the Kisa Spring / Summer 2008 collection show during London Fashion Week September 19 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Luke MacGregor
Latisse is designed to treat a condition known as hypotrichosis of the eyelashes , which means a person does not have enough eyelashes .
The active ingredient in Latisse is bimatroprost , the same ingredient that is in Allergan ’s glaucoma treatment Lumigan .
Patients taking Lumigan found a side effect of the drug to be eyelash growth , prompting Allergan to study it for the new use .
Latisse is a once - daily prescription treatment that is applied to the base of the upper eyelash with a sterile , single - use - per - eye disposable applicator .
Once treatment is stopped , eyelashes will gradually return to where they were prior to treatment .
Allergan said it estimates global peak sales of Latisse solution could top $ 500 million a year .
Gary Nachman , an analyst at Leerink Swann , said that while approval was expected , “ in this cautious environment , every approval through the FDA should be viewed positively . ”
Latisse is the first prescription product for lengthening eyelashes , making sales forecasting a little difficult .
Larry Biegelsen , an analyst at Wachovia , said he agrees with the company ’s forecast of more than $ 500 million .
However , “ we think the initial uptake will be muted due to the economic situation . ”
Biegelsen forecasts sales of $ 30 million in 2009 , growing to $ 310 million in 2012 .
Leerink Swann ’s Nachman said he expects the drug to generate sales of $ 20 million in 2009 , growing to $ 80 million in 2012 .
“ We believe the opportunity for Latisse could be much larger , but we still need to do more work on this largely unpioneered market , ” he said .
Latisse is a structural prostaglandin analog , a lipid compound derived from fatty acids designed to bind to prostaglandin receptors .
These receptors are present in hair and are thought to be involved in the development and regrowth of the hair follicle .
Side effects of Latisse can include eye redness , itchy eyes and a darkening of the eyelid skin .
Though not reported in clinical studies , Allergan said Latisse may also cause the colored part of the eye to become browner , a condition that might be permanent .
Allergan said it expects to launch the product in the first quarter of 2009 .
Allergan ’s shares rose 1.1 percent to $ 36.85 on the New York Stock Exchange .

The armed conflict in Sudan causes a considerable damage to the environment by chopping trees and reducing farming lands , reported Reuters .
According to information presented in thepeople inhabiting theregion were forced to cut down forest lands in order to supply materials for building industry which prospered during the crisis .
The conflict broke out on the basis of tribal discrepancies in 2003 on the territory of a poor and arid region .
The cause of war lied in the fact the Arabs moved further to the South in search of water and oppressed black Africans whose main occupation was farming .
As a result , the Sudan Liberation Movement together with the Justice and Equality Movement raised a revolt against the government claiming that it ignored the Darfur region favoring the Arab tribes .
In response to these actions a militia group , the Janjaweed , consisting of Arabs and being controlled by the Sudanese government started air bombardment killing thousands of people and destroying villages .
However , the government denied any connection to the Janjaweed .
Local authorities even say that the conflict has been puffed up by news media and foreign states .
It ’s worth mentioning that the crisis is still in progress affecting civilians living in camps and the environment .
As the United Nations reported , local forests became extremely thin forcing people to travel long distances searching for wood .
Clive Bates , UNEP 's Sudan country director , said that environmental protection in Darfur should become a matter of paramount importance .
He also added that it was necessary to plant more trees and implement different technologies in the field of power resources and construction .
According to the UNEP report , the amount of wood used in the biggest towns of the region such as El Fasher , El Geneina and Nyala has increased since the beginning of the conflict .
It was also mentioned that the number of lumber mills and brick kilns rose considerably to provide construction materials for accommodation and peacekeeping bases required for U.N. personnel .
Each year 52,000 trees are burnt for brick - making , which is a threat to ecological balance .
" The brick kilns are occupying and in many cases destroying valuable agricultural land by digging up clay soils around towns , " said the report .
The report entitled ' Destitution , distortion and deforestation ' said that the majority of farmers , who had to leave their lands because of the conflict , started regarding timber trade as the only way to make a living .
It should be mentioned that more than 2.5 million people were displaced according to the data provided by international experts .
They found shelter in special camps placed around the main towns under the auspices of major humanitarian organizations .
As it was mentioned in the UNEP report , the growth of urban population caused an expansion of demand for fuel wood .
Militias and soldiers under control of government made their profit from selling different kinds of hardwood trees such as mahogany .
Kunduwa forest in Nyala was completely destroyed although it was possible to prevent its destruction .

Hamilton celebrates a quite incredible late turnaround at Interlagos McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton became the youngest world champion in Formula One history by the skin of his teeth after a thrilling Brazilian Grand Prix .
The 23 - year - old Englishman 's title rival Felipe Massa won the race in his Ferrari but Hamilton grabbed the fifth place he needed at the last corner .
A late - race rain shower looked to have cost Hamilton the title when he dropped to sixth after a stop for wet tyres .
But he passed Toyota 's Timo Glock as they entered the pit straight .
Renault 's Fernando Alonso , the previous youngest champion , was second ahead of Massa 's team - mate Kimi Raikkonen and Toro Rosso 's Sebastian Vettel .
Hamilton 's success buries the ghosts of last year , when after a remarkable debut season he let slip a massive lead in the final two races and Raikkonen sneaked in to win the title .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Ultimately , there were no similar mistakes this time around - but as he entered the final lap Hamilton was not going to win the title .
He - like Massa - had stopped to change to wet tyres as the rain fell in the closing laps .
But while the Brazilian held on to his lead , Hamilton dropped to fifth place behind Glock - who stayed on dry tyres .
Hamilton then lost that position - which was the minimum he needed if Massa won - when he was passed at the start of the penultimate lap by Vettel .
I thought do I have it ?
Do I have it ?
And when they told me I was ecstatic
Lewis Hamilton Hamilton tried hard to get back past the German , but he could not get close enough to him and he would have thought he had lost the title until he came to the last two corners of the lap .
There , Glock - who had started the final lap 18 seconds ahead of Hamilton - was struggling badly on the now - slick track and the McLaren slipped past the Toyota as it accelerated up the hill towards the finish line .
" It 's pretty impossible to put into words , " Hamilton said .
" I thought do I have it ?
Do I have it ?
And when they told me I was ecstatic . "
It was heartbreaking for Massa , whose family were celebrating what they thought was his success for a few seconds until they realised what had happened .
" It was an emotional day for me .
You get here and you 've almost done everything perfect but we saw Lewis passing Glock again and that mixed emotion .
" Unfortunately we missed [ out ] by one point but that 's racing .
" We need to be proud of our race and our championship .
It 's one more day of our life when I will learn a lot but for sure I 'm very emotional . "
Massa could not hold back the tears as he realised he had lost out at the death
His only consolation was that his victory helped secure the constructors ' title for Ferrari .
The thrilling climax was a stark contrast to the rest of the race , which Hamilton had approached with the caution he felt was required to avoid mistakes .
The 23 - year - old - watched from the sidelines by his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger , singer with the Pussycat Dolls - went into the race knowing he only had to finish fifth even if Massa won his home event .
That luxury showed in the way in which he and his McLaren team approached the Grand Prix .
A shower of rain five minutes before the scheduled start introduced a random element that was exactly what Hamilton did not need .
It caused a five - minute delay and shaped the entire race .
The heavy shower doused the track in the area of the pits and some of the corners , but other areas remained dry .

And with the sun shining as the race started , it was only a matter of time before drivers started to pit for dry tyres .
Hamilton and McLaren played it safe , leaving it as late as they could before coming in to change tyres .
Hamilton stopped a lap later than Massa on lap 11 - and two laps after Vettel and Alonso .
McLaren 's decision was the right one in that it limited their risk , but it was not the best in terms of absolute pace .
Vettel and Alonso 's early stops vaulted them up into second and third places behind Massa .
Hamilton , by contrast , was demoted from fourth to sixth behind Massa , Vettel , Alonso , Raikkonen and the Force India of Giancarlo Fisichella , who had changed to dry tyres as early as lap three .
606 : DEBATE
Well done Hamilton , especially after what happened last year
Happy_Fox McLaren were confident the required result was always within their grasp .
But that was reckoning without the unfolding drama ahead .
Hamilton did not pass Fisichella until lap 18 , out - braking him in a brave move at the first corner on the still - slippery track .
That put Hamilton into the fifth place he needed , and he was promoted to fourth by the three - stop strategy chosen by Toro Rosso for Vettel in contrast to the two stops of the other leading teams .

Hamilton was only a couple of seconds ahead of Vettel by the time the Toro Rosso had made its stop and he had to up his pace to hold his rival off .
And a late shower increased the anxiety for Hamilton as he sought to close out the championship .
Hamilton stopped for wet tyres on lap 66 - a decision that could have cost him the title .
It dropped him to fifth place behind Glock , with Vettel right behind him .
Vettel pushed Hamilton hard and passed him with two laps to go , leading to the nail - biting finish .
Scot David Coulthard 's final race ended at the first corner after he was knocked into a spin by Williams 's Nico Rosberg , and was hit by the other Williams of Kazuki Nakajima .

Arne Duncan , the Chicago schools superintendent known for taking tough steps to improve schools while maintaining respectful relations with teachers and their unions , is President - elect Barack Obama ’s choice as secretary of education , Democratic officials said Monday .
Mr. Duncan , a 44 - year - old Harvard graduate , has raised achievement in the nation ’s third - largest school district and often faced the ticklish challenge of shuttering failing schools and replacing ineffective teachers , usually with improved results .
He represents a compromise choice in the debate that has divided Democrats in recent months over the proper course for public - school policy after the Bush years .
In June , rival nationwide groups of educators circulated competing educational manifestos , with one group espousing a get - tough policy based on pushing teachers and administrators harder to raise achievement , and another arguing that schools alone could not close the racial achievement gap and urging new investments in school - based health clinics and other social programs to help poor students learn .

However , studies of the effect of some of these drugs on cognitive function in healthy people have shown mixed results .

� Oops , We Meant $ 7 TRILLION !�
What Hank and Ben Are Up to and How They Plan to Pay for It All
� We make money the old fashioned way . �
We print it .�
- Art Rolnick , Chief Economist for the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank
The $ 700 billion that was arm - twisted from Congress by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in October was evidently just the camel�s nose under the tent . �
According to a November 24 Bloomberg report , the Paulson / Bernanke team is now prepared to pay $ 7.76 trillion to rescue the financial system . [ 1 ] �
Prepared to pay how ? �
Congress has not raised its debt ceiling to anywhere near that level ; but the approval of Congress , which originally voted down the controversial $ 700 billion bailout , is apparently no longer necessary . �
The door has been opened , and the Treasury Secretary and Fed Chairman feel they can now pledge whatever they want . �
Perhaps they are inching up a zero at a time just to see what the public�s tolerance is for unrepayable debt .�
The new sum � $ 7.76 trillion � represents $ 25,000 for every citizen in the country , or half the value of everything produced in the nation last year ; yet it�s not clear that a mere half of our net worth will rescue the financial system . �
One bankrupt bank after another has been bailed out with public money , in a futile effort to prevent a collapse of a massive multi-trillion dollar derivatives pyramid created by the banks . [ 2 ] �
But according to the Comptroller of the Currency , U.S. commercial banks now carry over $ 180 trillion in derivatives on their books . �
The public is liable to be bankrupted before this mess is resolved . �
On top of the $ 700 billion initially extorted from Congress , an additional $ 2 trillion in loans and commitments has already been made by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury . �
Yet that wall of money has not kept the imperiled banks from collapsing .�
Citigroup was one of the nine lucky recipients of Paulson�s largesse in October , when he set out to recapitalize the banks by trading dollars for shares .�
The bank received $ 25 billion from the Treasury ; yet this handout was insufficient to keep its stock from dropping below $ 4 a share . �
Citigroup was then bailed out by the Treasury to the tune of another $ 20 billion , along with a commitment to guarantee $ 306 billion in toxic assets on its books . �
That equals half the $ 700 billion bailout , just for one bank ; yet Citigroup�s books , which sport derivative bets of $ 37 trillion , won�t look much better than before .� �
Meanwhile , commentators are scratching their heads over where the money is supposed to come from to pay for all this .�
Congress hasn�t approved these multi-trillion dollar sums , and the Federal Reserve doesn�t show them on its books .�
Some clues to this mystery came on November 25 , when according to The New York Times :
� In the first of two new actions . . . , the Treasury and the Fed said they would create a $ 200 billion program to lend money against securities backed by car loans , student loans , credit card debt and even small - business loans . �
The Treasury would contribute $ 20 billion to the so - called Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility and assume responsibility for any losses up to $ 20 billion .
The Federal Reserve would lend the new entity as much as $ 180 billion . �
The new facility would then lend money at low rates to companies that post collateral based on securities backed by consumer debt or business loans . �[ 3 ]
It appears that the $ 20 billion in Treasury money will be serving as the �reserves� to create $ 200 billion in credit on the books of the Fed and its network of banks . �
Ten to one is the reserve requirement established by the Federal Reserve for private bank lending under the � fractional reserve� system . �
The New York Fed has now deleted its earlier discussion of this process from its website , but as it explained the money - creating process in 2004 :
� Reserve requirements . . . are computed as percentages of deposits that banks must hold as vault cash or on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank .
. . .
As of June 2004 , the reserve requirement was 10 % on transaction deposits [ deposits immediately available to depositors ] .
. . .
If the reserve requirement is 10 % , for example , a bank that receives a $ 100 deposit may lend out $ 90 of that deposit . �
If the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the $ 90 , the bank receiving that deposit can lend out $ 81 . �
As the process continues , the banking system can expand the initial deposit of $ 100 into a maximum of $ 1,000 of money ( $ 100+$ 90+81+$72.90 + . . . = $ 1,000 ) . �[ 4 ]
In a revealing booklet called � Modern Money Mechanics , � the Chicago Federal Reserve detailed how fractional reserve lending allows money to �expand .��
The booklet is now out of print , perhaps because it revealed too much ; but it is still available on the Internet . �
On page 11 of the booklet is a helpful chart ( above ) , which shows that the original deposit is not actually �lent � but remains in the bank throughout the expansion process .�
What is lent is an additional sum created on the bank�s books valued at 90 percent of the original deposit . �
Then another sum is lent that is 90 percent of the second deposit , and so forth , until the total sum generated is 10 times the original deposit , with tidy sums collected in interest at each step along the way .
The November 25 New York Times article continued :
� The Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , made it clear that the new lending facility was just a �starting point� and could be expanded to many other kinds of debt , like commercial mortgage - backed securities .
. . .
It was the first time that the Fed and the Treasury have stepped in to finance consumer debt .
The $ 200 billion program comes close to being a government bank . �
A government bank that makes credit available to all qualified borrowers is not a bad idea .�
It would seem to be a more useful idea than manipulating interest rates , the conventional tool used by the Federal Reserve to regulate the money supply .�
When Paul Volcker raised interest rates to 20 % in 1980 , he bankrupted much of the Third World ; and when Alan Greenspan lowered the short - term interest rate to 1 % in 2001 , he precipitated the housing and derivatives bubbles that are bankrupting the U.S. today .�
A government - owned bank that put credit into the economy in an open , accountable and impartial way could be just what the doctor ordered .�
The problem is , the Federal Reserve is n�t government - owned ( it is owned by a consortium of private banks [ 5 ] ) ; and it is not distributing the public credit openly and impartially .�
The Fed has kept the recipients of its largesse largely secret ( something Bloomberg News is currently suing about under the Freedom of Information Act [ 6 ] ) .�
However , it is clearly favoring its banking cronies over consumers . �
Note that the �consumer debt� the Fed is now supposedly financing does not consist of loans directly to consumers .�
The loans are to lenders holding consumer debt ( �companies that post collateral based on securities backed by consumer debt or business loans� ) .�
Like with subprime mortgages , lenders have pushed credit cards and student loans onto anyone who would take them , because the lenders had no intention of keeping those risky loans on their books . �
They intended to package them up as �securities � and sell them to investors .�
But the investors are catching onto this scam and are no longer buying ; so the Fed is stepping in to underwrite the debt , advancing �credit� created on its books with accounting entries . �
When these loans are not paid back , we the taxpayers pick up the tab , either directly or through the �hidden tax� of inflation . �
The benefit goes to the lenders , who get off scot - free for their risky ventures , while the people bear the risk and pick up the losses . �
If these investments are too risky for investors , they should also be too risky for the �government bank .��
We don�t need more consumer debt to keep the economy going .�
We need more wages and salaries , and that means more jobs . �
Rather than propping up the �finance� industry ( the business of money making money ) , the Fed should be furnishing low - interest loans directly to businesses , state and local governments and other qualified members of the producing economy .��
Watching the Paulson / Bernanke bailout scenario unfold is a bit like watching the end of the Charlton Heston movie El Cid , where the Spaniards prop up their dead general on his horse and charge the Moors , giving the illusion that the champion is still alive and leading them . �
In this case , what they are propping up are not national heroes but banking pretenders who are not only unnecessary but have established their incompetence at managing the banking business .�

Politics - Federal Picking a Prime Minister : A Parliamentary Primer By Ryan McGreal
Published December 02 , 2008
We will use all legal means to resist this undemocratic seizure of power .
-- Prime Minister Stephen Harper
With the Liberals and NDP agreeing to a coalition with the support of the Bloc Quebecois and planning a motion of no confidence this coming Monday , Prime Minister Stephen Harper has responded by calling the coalition an " illegitimate government " and claiming that it would be " a catastrophe , for our democracy , our unity and our economy , especially at a time of global instability . "
( Now Harper cares about " unity " ? )
Members of the Conservative Party have been seen wearing buttons that read , " No to the coup " .
The government has stated that it is considering every option to prevent the " coup " , and may even ask the Governor General to prorogue ( suspend ) Parliament until it releases its 2009 budget in late January .
The Conservative Party 's claim that the Liberal - NDP plan to wrest control of the government from the Conservative Party is somehow " undemocratic " certainly has some currency among Canadians who are sympathetic - or at least confused about parliamentary procedure .
But surely Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Canada 's premiere policy wonk , knows our parliamentary system better than that .
After all , his skillful handling of parliamentary process over the past years has been nothing short of brilliant - his recent catastrophic over - reach notwithstanding .
Prime Ministers are Appointed
The simple fact is that strictly speaking , Stephen Harper was not elected Prime Minister in the recent federal election , all casual claims to the contrary .
It is a long tradition among political commentators and voters alike to equate a party winning the most seats in Parliament with that party winning the election , and most of the time the equation is true enough .
In practical terms , it is also approximate to the American system , in which voters actually choose their President as well as their Congressional representatives .
However , it is in the rare edge cases that this approximation breaks down - edge cases like the situation in Ottawa today .
What really happens in a Parliamentary system is this : the federal election is an aggregation of 308 individual constituency ( riding ) elections , and the House of Commons is comprised of the 308 candidates who won their respective ridings .
You did not vote for the Prime Minister .
In fact , unless you lived in the riding of Calgary Southwest during the election , Stephen Harper 's name did not appear anywhere on your ballot .
Rather , the Prime Minister is appointed by the Governor General , who picks the Member of Parliament with the confidence of the House of Commons , which means the Prime Minister is able to get a majority of MPs to support his or her legislative agenda .
Motions of Confidence and No Confidence
The government in a Parliamentary system refers to the Prime Minister and his or her appointed Cabinet of Ministers , who decide the country 's legislative agenda and oversee the various federal ministries .
The government can continue to govern as long as it enjoys the confidence of the House of Commons .
The formal way that the House of Commons reaffirms its confidence in the Prime Minister is by voting in favour of a motion of confidence , a motion that the MPs still have confidence in the leadership of the Prime Minister .
Alternately , the House can show its confidence by rejecting a motion of no confidence .
Again , in practical terms the member who is most likely to hold the confidence of the house is the leader of the party of which the largest number of MPs are members , simply because the members of a political party are expected to vote along party lines on confidence motions or risk expulsion from the party .
If one party has a clear majority of seats in the House of Commons , the leader of that party clearly has the most legitimate claim to the confidence of the House , and it's a no - brainer that the G - G will appoint him or her as the Prime Minister .
It 's critical to understand the litmus test for being appointed Prime Minister : not being the leader of the party with the most seats , but rather being the Member who has the confidence of the House .
Minority Governments are Unstable
In most elections , the leader of the winnnig party is the Member who has the confidence of the house .
That 's why we 're usually safe to speak about elections as if this or that leader " won " the election .
( This is the sense in which Harper claims that the coalition would be " undemocratic " . )
However , the situation changes when no single party wins more than half the total seats in the House of Commons .
In that case , it is no longer guaranteed that the leader of the party with the most seats has the confidence of the House .
This is why so - called minority governments are inherently unstable : because the opposition parties collectively make up more than half the seats in the House , they have enough votes to reject a motion of confidence or pass a motion of no confidence .
Normally when this happens , the Governor General dissolves Parliament and calls a general election .
( In the 2008 election , it was actually Harper who declared that the House of Commons had become " dysfunctional " and asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and call an election . )
New Prime Minister , No Election
But the Governor General has another option : if another Member can credibly claim the confidence of the House of Commons , the the Governor General can dismiss the existing Prime Minister and appoint a new Prime Minister without calling an election .
By signing a coalition agreement with the NDP as a partner and the Bloc Quebecois as a supporter , the Liberals are attempting to demonstrate that their leader , Stéphane Dion , has the confidence of the House , since the Liberals , NDP and Bloc together control more than half the seats in the House .
( The coalition agreement commits the parties to a two - and - a - half year accord . )
This coming Monday , the opposition parties plan to introduce a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Stephen Harper and ask Governor General Michaëlle Jean to give Dion and his cabinet an opportunity to govern with the confidence of the House .
If Jean decides to give the coalition this opportunity , Dion will be Prime Minister until May , when the Liberal Party chooses a new leader .
The coalition cabinet will have 18 Ministers from the Liberals and six Ministers from the NDP .
Highly Irregular
This is definitely not standard operating procedure in Parliamentary politics .
In fact , the last time something similar happened in Canada - and the only time it has happened since Confederation in 1867 - was the " Union Government " of 1917 - 20 , when several Liberal and independent Members joined a coalition with the Conservative Party , led by Prime Minister Robert Borden , to support his controversial conscription policy during World War I .
Unlike today , the Union Government coalition actually ran as such during the 1917 federal election and won .
If the Bloc - supported Liberal - NDP coalition takes over the government next Monday , it will be the first time in Canadian history that a coalition has taken over mid-Parliament .
As a result , it carries a tinge of illegitimacy , which Harper is exploiting in a PR campaign that has less than a week to pull out all the stops .
This is especially true given the results of the the last election .
It seems bizarre that the unpopular Liberal leader , Stéphane Dion , could become the Prime Minister after his poor standing among votes .
Harper Overplayed His Hand
Harper has no one but himself to blame for this bizarre state of affairs .
Quite simply , by reverting to the worst partisanship after promising cooperation and rushing to crush his opposition rather than responding to the financial crisis , Harper has lost the confidence of the House of Commons .
Granted , he has backtracked on some elements of the plan - albeit temporarily - but his proposed response to the financial crisis runs directly contrary to what a majority of Members want to see .
By making his divisive plan a confidence motion , Harper has forced the opposition parties into a corner and left them with only two alternatives :
Quietly assent to a plan they oppose ; or
Declare no confidence in Harper and ask the Governor General for a chance to govern .
Harper gambled that the opposition would choose the former option , especially given that the Liberal Party is debt - ridden from the recent election and effectively leaderless , given that Dion is a lame duck who has already announced that he will step down as leader this coming May .
It probably seemed like a safe assumption .
After all , Harper governed like he had a majority for the past three years , counting on the Liberals to abstain from confidence motions or to hold their noses and vote along with him .
However , he seems to have gone too far this time , and provoked a backlash that may well cost him his government .
If you 're worried that the latter option still sounds undemocratic , consider that the opposition parties command more than half the seats in the House of Commons and represent more than half of the popular vote .
Even in commonsense terms , the coalition has more democratic legitimacy than the Conservative government .
As for why the opposition parties waited until after an unpopular election to get together ... that 's an essay for another day .

Company Invents Recyclable Paper Bottle
December 3rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I loathe plastic water bottles , but for some reason many otherwise rational people seem to love them .
Fortunately , a company called Brandimage may save the day and reduce plastic waste with their paper bottle .
The 100 percent recyclable bottle recently received the prestigious International Design Excellence Award .
In addition to being food - safe , the bottles stack and are re-sealable .
While it is n’t on sale yet , the 360 Paper Bottle might just cut into the 60 million plastic bottles thrown away each day in the US .

A boozy marinade may be healthy Marinating a steak in red wine or beer can cut down the number of cancer - causing agents produced when it is fried or grilled , research suggests .
Meat cooked in this way contains relatively high levels of cancer - causing compounds called heterocyclic amines ( HAs ) .
But Portuguese researchers found that using a beer or red wine marinade before cooking cut HA levels in steak .
Details of the research are highlighted in New Scientist magazine .
It may seem appetising to marinate steak in beer or wine , but this will have a minimal impact
Dr Kat Arney
Cancer Research UK
However , experts said the effect on health was likely to be minimal .
The high temperatures associated with frying and grilling convert the natural sugars and amino acids found in meat into HAs .
Previous research has shown that an olive oil , lemon juice and garlic marinade cut HA levels in chicken by as much as 90 % .
The latest research , by a team at the University of Porto and published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , focused on the effect of a marinade beer or red wine marinade .
They found six hours of marinating in beer or red wine - based sauce cut levels of two types of HA by up to 90 % compared with unmarinated steak .
Beer was more efficient at reducing levels of a third type of HA , cutting levels significantly in four hours , while wine took six hours to achieve a similar effect .
Sugars
The researchers believe the key could be water - retaining sugars found in beer and wine .
These sugars - which are more abundant in beer than wine - may block the movement of water - soluble molecules within the steak to the surface , where high heat converts them into HAs .
The researchers also found that tasters preferred the smell , taste and appearance of beer - marinated steak .
Scientists have found 17 different HAs resulting from the high temperature cooking of meat .
One study showed a strong link between stomach cancer and consumption of cooked meats .
People who preferred their beef medium - well or well done were more than three times more likely to suffer stomach cancer as those who ate rare or medium - rare beef .
Other research has suggested an association between eating fried , grilled or barbecued meats and an increased risk of bowel , pancreatic and breast cancer .
Dr Kat Arney , senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " We know that regularly eating large amounts of red or processed meat increases your cancer risk .
" It may seem appetising to marinate steak in beer or wine , but this will have a minimal impact on the effect of the meat on your cancer risk and the best way to reduce your risk of cancer from eating red and processed meat is to eat less of it overall .
" Cancer Research UK recommends that a healthy diet should include plenty of fibre , fruit and vegetables and limited amounts of red meat and alcohol . "

As Bush makes a crude joke about a “ size 10 shoe , ” Muntader al - Zaidi can be heard screaming in the background .
The corporate media , of course , will not show you the entire video .
Earlier today , the Roads to Iraq blog posted the following :
Iraqi TV al - Sharqiya just reported on the news that al - Zaidi is transferred to Camp Cropper prison [ the Airport prison , managed by the American forces ] .
The TV Channel announced that Al - Zaidi is in a difficult condition , with broken ribs and signs of tortures on his thighs .
Also he can not move his right arm .
Camp Cropper is the holding facility for “ security detainees ” operated by the United States Army near Baghdad International Airport after Abu Ghraib was closed down for obvious reasons .
The Red Cross has documented severe living conditions , harsh treatment by guards , and poor medical care at Camp Cropper .

In two weeks , I 'll celebrate my eighth anniversary writing this column .
And if I do any ruminating during my 15 - second celebration , I 'll recognize that one thing still has n't changed : there 's still no single technical level of writing that makes everybody happy .
I still get complaints from total newbies , who are bewildered by terms like " smartphone " and " plasma TV . "
And I still get bashed by the gearheads , who find the column not nearly technical enough .
I think a lot about the technical level of the column .
Over the years , I 've adopted a number of tricks that are designed to communicate technical points without losing the novices -- and one of them is avoiding jargon .
Why tech writers use so much jargon , I do n't know .
Maybe it 's self - aggrandizement ; they want to lord their knowledge over everybody else .
Maybe it 's laziness ; they can't be bothered to fish for a plain - English word .
Maybe it 's just habit ; they spend all day talking shop with other nerds , so they slip into technospeak when they write for larger audiences .

African Americans are especially at risk in the auto crisis
by Robert E. Scott and Christian Dorsey , with research assistance from Emily Garr and Jin Dai
The motor vehicle and parts industry , a sector of the economy that has been particularly welcoming to African Americans , is becoming a shrinking island of prosperity .
The share of black workers ( 14.2 % ) in automotive industries is much higher than their overall share of the labor force ( 11.2 % ) , as shown in this Figure .
Approximately 118,000 African Americans worked in the auto industry in November 2008 , down from 137,000 in December 2007 when the recession began .
1
African Americans earn much higher wages in auto industry jobs than in other parts of the economy , and the loss of these solid , middle - class jobs would be a devastating blow .
Hourly wages for African Americans in the motor vehicle industry averaged $ 17.08 ( excluding fringe benefits ) in 2007 , versus economy - wide average wages for African American of $ 15.44 per hour .
2 African Americans have been particularly hard hit in this recession .
The unemployment rate for blacks increased to 11.2 % in November , an increase of 2.8 percentage points over the last year , as shown in today ’s EPI Jobs Picture .
The consequences of an auto industry collapse — which could eliminate up to 3.3 million U.S. jobs , as shown in the Briefing Paper When Giants Fall — would be nothing less than catastrophic for African Americans .

( CNN ) -- Blanche Danick may be 86 years old , but she 's pretty hip .
She keeps up with all the latest health news , and a while back , she called her daughter wanting to know whether she should start taking the herb ginkgo biloba .
She 'd heard it might stave off Alzheimer 's disease .
" I told her not to bother , that it would n't make much of a difference , " says her daughter , Edythe London , a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of California , Los Angeles .
" On the basis of what I 've read , I do n't think it staves off dementia . "
London 's advice makes a lot of sense , according to a study out this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Ginkgo is a top - selling herb and has been hailed by some as a memory - booster , but the new University of Pittsburgh study found it did n't help prevent Alzheimer 's or other forms of dementia in more than 3,000 elderly study subjects .
Ginkgo manufacturers say this is n't the first -- or the last -- word on the herb .
" There is a significant body of scientific and clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of ginkgo extract for both cognitive function and improved circulation , " said Mark Blumenthal , executive director of the American Botanical Council .
London 's still skeptical .
" But I do tell my mother there are other things she can do , " says London , who 's studied the brain and aging .
" I tell her to go out and do things and see people every day and be active . "
Studies have shown that physical exercise , the kind that keeps the heart healthy , also keeps the brain healthy , according to the National Institutes of Health 's Cognitive and Emotional Health Project .

People are like rats , London says .
" If you put a rat in a cage by itself , it wo n't do well on cognitive tests .
But if you give it toys and put other rats in its cage , they 're going to be smarter rats . "
In addition to playing with toys and hanging out with your fellow rats , here are five other tips for keeping your memory sharp .
London says they help work on memory centers of the brain , including the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus , identified in the diagram above .
1. Antioxidants
London makes sure her mother takes vitamins A , C , and E .
They 're antioxidants , which prevent cell damage and are believed by some to slow down diseases of aging .
" There are studies that suggest antioxidants might prevent dementia , " she says .
2 . Fish oil supplements
Dr. Gary Small , director of the UCLA Center on Aging , says aging brains show signs of inflammation , and fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties .
3. Phosphatidylserine supplements
Phosphatidylserine is a lipid found naturally in the body .
Small says he's not 100 percent convinced these supplements will help stave off dementia , but they 're worth a try .
" If I start having memory problems when I get older , I 'll give them a trial run and see if they help , " says Small , author of the new book " iBrain : Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind . "
4. Curry
Small , who 's 57 , says that as he gets older , he might also try eating more foods with curry in them .
" Some studies in Singapore show that those who ate curry once a week had better memory scores , " he said .
5. Cross -training your brain
" Our brains can be made stronger through exercise , " says Andrew Carle , assistant professor of in the department of health administration and policy at George Mason University .
" In the same way physical exercise can delay many of the effects of aging on the body , there 's some evidence cognitive exercise can at least delay the onset of Alzheimer 's . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Alzheimer 's disease

But Carle says it 's not enough to do just one kind of brain exercise .
" Doing a crossword puzzle every day is good , but it 's the equivalent of doing only pushups -- your arms will get strong , but not the rest of your body . "
He recommends doing other activities in addition , such as computing numbers in your head instead of using a calculator , or using one of the " brain gym " computer games designed to enhance brain function .
As for London , who 's 60 , she thinks her best bet at staving off dementia does n't come in a bottle , or on a dinner plate , or in a computer game .
" I 'm going to keep working on my research , and surround myself with young people , and do a lot of exercise , " she says .
" I 'm going to be a happy old lady .
That in and of itself is going to do a lot of good for my brain . "

Ja.NET is a port of Java 1.5 SE to the .NET platform .
The compiler is based on the Eclipse JDT , which has been modified to generate IL as well as Java Byte Code .
Java traditionally compiles each class into a separate file , but this creates an unacceptable overhead for .
NET .
To address this , a tool based on Cecil is used to create larger assemblies much in the same way Jar files are created for Java .
In order to get a head - start on library support , the Ja.NET JDK is based on the open source project Apache Harmony .
Dave Tillman writes ,
One thing that attracted me to Harmony , as opposed to the OpenJDK , is the libraries in Harmony are already organized nicely into modules .
For example , you ’ll find a LUNI module which stands for Lang - Util - Net - Io , a NIO module , etc. BTW , as a side note , I actually began working with OpenJDK and actually have a running version of that as well on my machine , but chose to switch to Harmony a while back .
When we talked to Dave , he gave InfoQ some more details on what that entails ,
At this point the Ja.NET SE project is solely focused on Java SE .
Providing a Java 5 JDK for .
NET .
Before moving higher up the stack ( Java EE ) , I think we need to get SE done , and done right .
All of the Java 5 SE libraries are included in the distribution , BUT , not all of them are fully functional .
You see I 'm basing the work on several upstream projects ( see my lateset blog for some details - www.janetdev.org).
The biggest is the Apache Harmony project .
Harmony has developed code for most all ( 99.x % ) of Java 5 SE class libraries , including Swing , AWT , etc .
They also have Java ME and Java 6 code as well .
The Ja.NET SE class libraries are derived from the Harmony code , and today I build all of the code from Harmony into assembies for .NET and include them in the distribution .
BUT not all of the work of modifing the class library code to tie it into cooresponding .
NET / CLR services has been completed at this point .
For example , the work to tie Swing and AWT into WPF has not been done ... that 's why I 'm looking for contributors ;-) .
To do this , a person would have to take the Swing / AWT code base that is already provided by Harmony , rip it appart and add calls to the WPF API 's at the appropriate places in the code .
All of the Harmony Swing / AWT code already compiles to .NET assemblies , it just is n't hooked into WPF yet .
So , what is there .
Well , enough of the core libraries ( reflection , concurrency , class loading , io , nio charsets , etc. ) are there that the Ja.NET SE tools ( compiler , assembly merger , run on .NET .
Also , I 've got enough there that JUnit 4.3/4.5 , Xerces 2.8 , Ant 1.7.0 are working on .NET without any code changes .
And , of course I 'm adding more and more daily ! :-)
Ja.NET currently runs on both Microsoft's CLR and Novell 's Mono platform .
Congressional Democrats are eyeing a way to reverse Bush administration midnight regulations that Barack Obama otherwise could n’t undo .
Dems eye midnight regulations reversal
Today kicks off a new focus by Politico ’s Lobbying team on four issues : the economy ; defense and security ; energy and the environment ; and health care .
Each Tuesday until the Inauguration , we ’ll have the latest news on policy and personnel , with more special coverage planned next year .
Congressional Democrats are eyeing a little - known , Clinton - era law as a way to reverse Bush administration midnight regulations — even ones that have already taken effect .
It ’s a move that would undermine the White House ’s attempt to finalize its energy and environmental regulations by November so that Barack Obama could n’t undo them after he ’s sworn in as the 44th president on Jan. 20 .
Advertisement
“ Fortunately , [ the White House ] made a mistake , ” said a top Senate Democratic aide .
Last May , White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten instructed federal agency heads to make sure any new regulations were finalized by Nov. 1 .
The memo did n’t spell it out , but the thinking behind the directive was obvious .
As Myron Ebell of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute put it : “ We ’re not going to make the same mistakes the Clinton administration did . ”
President Bill Clinton finalized regulations within 60 days of the 2001 inauguration , meaning Bush could come in and easily reverse them .
It could take Obama years to undo climate rules finalized more than 60 days before he takes office — the advantage the White House sought by getting them done by Nov. 1 .
But that strategy does n’t account for the Congressional Review Act of 1996 .
The law contains a clause determining that any regulation finalized within 60 legislative days of congressional adjournment is considered to have been legally finalized on the 15th legislative day of the new Congress , likely sometime in February .
Congress then has 60 days to review it and reverse it with a joint resolution that ca n’t be filibustered in the Senate .
In other words , any regulation finalized in the last half - year of the Bush administration could be wiped out with a simple party - line vote in the Democrat - controlled Congress .
A senior aide on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , which is chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , was familiar with the CRA , acknowledging that it is an option the committee is considering .
House Global Warming Committee Chairman Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) is also looking at it .
“ On egregious rule - makings that would have a detrimental effect on energy and environmental policy , [ the CRA ] speeds up the process for rescinding the bad rule , ” said Markey spokesman Eben Burnham - Snyder .
“ It ’s something Markey is seriously looking into . ”
Congress last used the CRA in 2001 to overturn a Clinton administration rule that set new requirements for ergonomic work spaces .
Targets of the CRA may include a rule to allow federal agencies to determine on their own whether their policies will threaten endangered species , rather than requiring them to go through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for approval .
Regulations opening land in the West to oil shale development and mountaintop removal could also be on the block .
“ We are not rushing regulations through at the last minute .
We are simply continuing our responsibility of governing until the end of the president ’s term , ” said White House spokesman Carlton Carroll .
“ As for the Congressional Review Act , ” he said , “ Congress has tools they can use now to overturn regulations , just as they do at all other times , but that does n’t discourage us from continuing our responsibility to govern . ”
Aides to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said that a decision has yet to be made regarding the strategy for dealing with Bush administration regulations .
Even though the CRA ca n’t be filibustered , legislative lifting is generally more difficult than executive action .
“ There ’s a lot that the president can do using his executive authority without waiting for congressional action , and I think we ’ll see the president do that , ” John Podesta , who is helping direct Obama ’s transition team , said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Jerry Brito , a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , closely follows midnight regulations .
He said he would advise the Obama administration to package all of the regulations it wants overturned into one large vehicle to be voted up or down .
“ That would solve the collective - action problem , and it solves the pet - project problem .
It would sort of limit special pleading , ” he said , noting that each new regulation benefits someone specific who will fight hard to keep it .
Lumping them together dissipates that energy .
The environmental lobby would cheer such a move .
“ It seems like everyone in the world wants to throw themselves in front of this bus , ” said Sierra Club lobbyist Dave Hamilton , who added that the organization supports any attempt to derail the Bush rules .
“ You just [ think ] , ‘ Have n’t you done enough ? ’ ”
“ If these rules are overturned , the benefits for the environment are potentially significant , ” said Rick Melberth , director of regulatory policy at OMB Watch , a liberal regulatory watchdog group .
The process could also mean bad news for some businesses , which were hoping that key rules might be beneficial .
“ Congress has a historic opportunity to adopt a bipartisan , practical energy policy that would strengthen the security of the United States and its citizens , ” said Karen Harbert , executive vice president with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s Institute for 21st Century Energy .
“ At the end of the day , ” she added , “ lawmakers have a responsibility to lead the nation to a more secure energy future with a comprehensive , commonsense approach , rather than resorting to shortsighted , half - measures of the past . ”
The new president could still overturn rules through the regulatory process , but those rules would be subject to new investigation and comment periods , which could take years to finish .
If Obama is able to overturn a sizable number of Bush ’s midnight regulations , he would be the first president in recent memory to succeed at such an effort , Brito said .
Clinton managed to repeal 9 percent of President George H.W. Bush ’s regulations and amend 48 percent of them .
The rest remained in place .
President Bush managed to repeal only 3 percent of Clinton ’s regulations and amend 15 percent , Brito said .
Though the Competitive Enterprise Institute ’s Ebell leans more toward President Bush ’s more hands - off approach to regulation , he insists that he ’s supportive of congressional review — since , under the Constitution , Congress is supposed to be the body that makes the laws .
“ This might be the first time I ’ve supported Ed Markey on anything , ” he said .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story contained an incorrect timeline .
Brazil has turned to tech as a way to stem rampant logging in its Amazonian rainforests , but instead of logging less wood , " creative " logging companies simply hired hackers to make their permits look legal .
Deforestation is n't usually thought of as a technical issue , but the Brazilian state of Pará has launched an online system for issuing permits to logging companies .
The system tracks their total output and simply refuses to issues more permits , which are checked when the wood is hauled out in trucks .
According to Greenpeace , though , corruption was widespread .
A Brazilian federal prosecutor is set to announce today that more than 107 companies hired hackers to game the permit site in order to generate more permits for timber removal .
The government will seek a US $ 833 million fine for the behavior .

It 's not as though these companies were in other way model corporate citizens ; the hacker hirings appear to be part and parcel of their approach to business .
Prosecutor Daniel Avelino said that " almost half of the companies involved in this scam have other lawsuits pending for environmental crimes or the use of slave labor , among other things . "
A Greenpeace worker in Brazil notes that the same computer system is used in other Brazilian states , so more arrests could be coming .
" We 've pointed out before that this method of controlling the transport of timber was subject to fraud , " he said .
" And this is only the tip of the iceberg , because the same computer system is also used in two other Brazilian states . "
Cracking down on illegal timber operations is a full - time job in Brazil .
Two weeks ago , Reuters carried a story about how government forces moved into Pará and shut down several sawmills after local residents went on a rampage and ransacked the local environmental office .
The mob was upset that 105,900 cubic feet of illegally harvested wood had just been seized , so they stormed the office , stole the trucks containing the wood , and " used a tractor to break down the entrance of the hotel where the government agents stayed . "
Recent reports from the Brazilian government shows that deforestation continues to spread in the Amazon .
In the last year , more than 4,800 square miles have been logged .
To address the problem , technology alone wo n't work .
That 's why , increasingly , Brazil has also turned to armed patrols .
Its " Arc of Fire " program , launched in February and described in the New York Times in April , relies on men with guns to do inspections of logging sites , issue fines , and impound material .
It 's high tech meets low tech in the battle on illegal logging , but Brazil 's numbers this year indicate that it remains an uphill battle .
Philips has hoped to boost its GoGear portable audio player line with the , a unique player built expressly to tie in with a phone .
The device is designed to be wearable as a fashion item and to serve as a Bluetooth headset ; the LUXE not only pairs wirelessly with a phone to warn of incoming calls but carries dual microphones of its own to answer the call with active noise canceling .
A one - line display shows incoming calls without having to fetch the phone from a pocket .
In its core role , the LUXE holds 2GB of music and carries an FM tuner to pick up radio ; the absence of a large display gives the small device about 10 hours of audio playback .
Philips offers its own in - house audio enhancement technology to clean up audio compression artifacts .
The jewel - like outside of the player comes in red , silver and a likely future chromed shell , all of which help keep the player discreet when not in immediate use .
Prices are set at the equivalent of about $ 94 US for the new GoGear ’s launch in Singapore for November , with other southeast Asian countries receiving it afterwards .
No mention has been made of a North American release ; Philips regularly sells some of its players in the region .

Enjoy playing a little World of Warcraft from time to time ?
If you 're hunting for a job , do n't mention it in an interview .
One jobseeker mentioned WoW to a recruiter , and was told to keep a lid on it :
Via gaming site F13.net :
I met with a recruiter recently ( online media industry ) and in conversation I happened to mention I 'd spent way too much time in the early 2000s playing online games ...
He replied that employers specifically instruct him not to send them World of Warcraft players .
He said there is a belief that WoW players cannot give 100 % because their focus is elsewhere , their sleeping patterns are often not great , etc .
I mentioned that some people have written about MMOG leadership experience as a career positive or a way to learn project management skills , and he shook his head .
He has been specifically asked to avoid WoW players .
Unfair bigotry ?
Nope .
In the replies , other Warcraft players largely agreed WoW addicts tend to make bad employees .

Amidst all of the Fuzzy Numbers offered up , there are two that I trust implicitly because they cannot be gamed , massaged , seasonally adjusted , imputed , or hedonically inflated .
They are taxes and gaming revenues .
Today there were a couple of mind - blowing numbers .
Think about these next two articles as if you were a government budget official trying to make plans or a social scientist attempting to assess the current social mood .
California November revenue $ 1.3 billion below estimate
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) – California ’s general fund revenues in November were $ 1.3 billion , or 18.5 percent , below expectations , suggesting the government of the most populous U.S. state could run out of money as early as February , State Controller John Chiang said on Tuesday .
The government of California , the world ’s eighth - largest economy , must contend with a $ 28 billion combined shortfall for the remainder of its current fiscal year and its next fiscal year , which runs from July .
Nevada casino win down 22.3 percent in October
CARSON CITY , Nev. ( AP ) — Nevada casinos had a record slump of 22.3 percent in winnings during October as gamblers worried about a worsening economy backed off from betting , the state Gaming Control Board reported Wednesday .
The resorts won $ 905 million in October , resulting in the largest percentage decline since the board began producing monthly reports in the early 1980s .
It was the 10th straight month of slumps compared with the same period a year earlier , the Control Board said .
In CA , the quote of the day was from State Controller John Chiang , who said , " November blew away even the most pessimistic estimates . "
While I think it ’s helpful to use these record breaking slumps to frame the current problem , it ’s also important to keep in mind that they are being compared to a dizzying height that was also record breaking .
The harder they come , the harder they fall .
Nonetheless , these are the unfudged numbers and they come from ( 1 ) the largest and most prosperous state in the union ( which would be the world ’s eighth largest economy if it were sovereign ) and ( 2 ) an industry that has proven bullet - proof in every prior recession on the books .
Together they indicate that yr/yr our larger economy is down somewhere in the vicinity of 20 % in activity .
This matches my back - of - the - envelope calculations based on automobile and housing sales .
I raise this because the gap between our official GDP , which is hedonically adjusted and imputed to the tune of approximately 35 % over actual cash activity , and the real economy , is large and growing larger .
This gap will magnify the impact of servicing both past and new debt .
In essence , the difference between a 20 % real world fall off in activity and a still - official " 1% - 2 % GDP decline " represents a gap between reality and our official statistics .
Let ’s call it the illusion gap .
My wish for the state budget officials of CA , and every other state , is for them to understand that relying on the official GDP numbers is a dangerous ( foolish ? ) proposition .
I am sincerely sorry for the troubles and the pain they are now about to experience as they attempt to balance the books .
I hope that they learn from this and find ways to apply more independent thought and common sense to their future projections .
In the meantime , my personal belief is that more benefit lies in what can be divined from the tax revenue and gambling data than in anything that comes from the Federal data sets .
But , of course , at the bottom of it all , there is no combination of new growth , new borrowing , and cheap money that can possibly fix the mess we ’re in .
That would require understanding that our money system is both internally and externally flawed .
That is , our money system has a math problem related to its dependence on exponential debt- creation and a real - world problem due to the fact that it is based on infinite growth .
And that ’s the largest illusion gap of them all .
Whistleblower : FBI lawyers knew warrantless taps were ' probably illegal '
RAW STORY

The former FBI agent who blew the whistle on the Bush administration 's decision to circumvent the law in order to warrantlessly eavesdrop on Americans decided to go to the press after a senior government lawyer tried to steer him away from questioning the " probably illegal " surveillance program .

This week the IronRuby team moved their source repository over to GitHub , with the layout now reflecting the structure they maintain internally .
I just wanted to cover how I downloaded and built IronRuby on a Windows Vista machine – LinuxMac users will need to build via Mono .
The first task is to download the code , as such you will need a git client , at the moment the best client I have found is msysgit .
msysgit installs both a GUI and command line , to download the source code I simply used the command line .
Executing the following command within the directory where you want the code to be stored , for me this was E:IronRubyGit .
git clone git://github.com/ironruby/ironruby.git
The next task is to build the project , if you have MRI ( Matz ’s ruby ) you can use the rake compile command , this will compile everything for you .
If you do n’t have MRI installed , you can build the Ruby.sln file using Visual Studio 2008 or the C# compiler ( csc ) .
E:IronRubyGitironrubymerlinmainLanguagesRuby>rake compile
( in E:/IronRubyGit/ironruby / merlin / main / Languages / Ruby )
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
dlr_core
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
rake aborted !
No such file or directory – e:ironrubygitironrubymerlinmainlanguagesrubysrcmicrosoft.scripting.core
( See full trace by running task with –trace )
However , I was greeted with a error message saying it was unable to find a file or directory .
Luckily , the IronRuby mailing list is a great resource , and it turns out I needed to set the MERLIN_ROOT environment variable .
E:IronRubyGitironrubymerlinmainLanguagesRuby>set MERLIN_ROOT=e:ironrubygitironrubymerlinmain
As a side note , merlin was the original codename for the IronPython team , which now includes IronRuby and the DLR ( see John Lam ’s post )
After solving this , I hit another error regarding tf.exe , the Team Foundation Source Control command line , being missing .
Cannot find tf .exe on system path .
The build script ( rake ) does a check to see if everything is configured correctly for IronRuby development , however tf is n’t required for building and actually only required internally within the team .
The check for tf .exe is made within E:IronRubyGitironrubymerlinmainLanguagesRubyrakemisc.rake , search for the string and simply remove it from the array .
commands += [ ‘ tf.exe ’ , ‘ svn.exe ’ ] if IronRuby.is_merlin ?
Run rake compile again and IronRuby should happily build with the assemblies being built to ‘ E:IronRubyGitironrubymerlinmainbindebug ’
However , after launching ir.exe ( the IronRuby REPL ) , I was unable to reference rubygems .
After a bit of investigating , turns out the $ LOAD_PATHS where incorrect .
These paths are set within ir.exe.config , all you need to do is replace the following part of the path ExternalLanguagesRubyRuby - 1.8.6libruby with => externallanguagesrubyredist - libsruby .
It ’s used three times , after replacing the values I could happily use IronRuby .
Hope this helps !
Seriously sad news .
The First Lady of Star Trek , Majel Barrett - Roddenberry , has passed away .
She played Nurse Chapel on the original series , Lwaxana Troi ( Deanna Troi ’s crazy mother ) on Next Generation , the voice of the starship computer on EVERY Star Trek series … and most importantly she was the love of Gene Roddenberry ’s life ( the creator of Star Trek ) .
Here is an article about her passing at trekmovie.com .
This really bums me out .
She was a real hoot on the Next Generation series and a super - nice lady in person .
I was surprised at how much this affected me .
After all , it ’s just a TV show and it ’s not like I really knew the lady .
However , everything I ’ve ever heard about her was positive and complimentary .
Combine how nice she was with how long I ’ve been a fan of the Star Trek franchise , and you ca n’t help but to be bothered by her passing .
I was just reading a Peter David “ Star Trek : New Frontier ” book this weekend .
If you did n’t know , there is a character based upon Majel Barrett - Roddenberry in the “ New Frontier ” novels .
I always felt that those novels were a little better for having her character in them .
In my mind , all computers should sound exactly like Majel Barrett - Roddenberry … and I ’m going to continue to feel that way .
Rest in peace , Majel .
JON Stewart ’s “ fake newscast ” is posting very genuine ratings .
“ The Daily Show ” scored its most - watched week ever last week , averaging nearly 2 million viewers a night on Comedy Central .
That ’s up 28 percent over its year - to - date average – and a strong indication that people are beginning to turn to comedy shows for an insight into this dramatic and confusing presidential campaign .
Among the guests last week was former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who sat for a two - part interview .
The 2 - million - a- night average puts Stewart nearly on par with the “ serious ” cable news political pundits .
It was the show ’s first week of original shows since it hit the road to cover the Democratic and GOP conventions in Denver and St. Paul .
Stewart has been able to make plenty of hay with the current political climate and the mess on Wall Street .
Stewart and Comedy Central stablemate Stephen Colbert ( “ The Colbert Report “ ) will combine for a live , Election Night broadcast , anchored by both comics and airing at 10 p.m .

Press Release
International Men ’s Day – 19 November , 2008
Bharat is a hard - working young man who jumped through hoops to make a successful career as a scientist .
He was raised to believe that a good man puts women and children first , protects and provides for his family , respects women , and endures pain and sacrifice without heaving a sigh .
Unfortunately , he never realized that a good man is also more often at the receiving end of abuse , until he himself became a victim of spousal violence and witnessed societal apathy towards men like him .
To add to his woes , he also became victim of IPC Section 498A , a law which gave undue credibility to his wife , and treated him as guilty until proven innocent .
He was arrested and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit , he had to witness his parents and siblings being jailed for no fault of theirs , he lost his job , he suffered enormous pain due to separation from his child , and with no ray of hope in sight , he ended his life at a tender age of 28 .
News of his death in local dailies read “ a scientist ends his life due to financial problems ” .
This is the story of just one of the thousands of men in India , whose thankless lives wither away every year just when they are ready to blossom .
Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau show that in the years 2005 and 2006 alone , nearly twice as many married men ( 52,483 in year 2005 and 55,452 in year 2006 ) , compared to married women ( 28,186 in year 2005 and 29,869 in year 2006 ) , committed suicide unable to withstand verbal , emotional , economic and physical abuse and legal harassment .
Save Family Foundation ( SFF ) and its sibling organizations adopted 19 November as International Men ’s Day to recognize and honor men ; our fathers , brothers , partners , sons , male friends and colleagues ; for the numerous services they render and the innumerable sacrifices they make to ensure the health and well - being of the family , society and the country .
On this occasion , SFF would also like to review the present status of men in the society and highlight the need to accord men the privileges and protections that they rightly deserve as fellow humans .
The Government of India collects 82 % of its tax revenue from men , but not a single rupee has been allocated in the name of men ’s welfare in the country ’s budget in the last 60 years .
On the contrary , men are being subjected to severe discrimination under law and their basic human rights are being violated every day in the name of more and more legal provisions that claim to empower and protect women .
Thousands of men are becoming victims of “ legal terrorism ” unleashed by the misuse of Indian Penal Code Section 498A , Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act , adultery laws , laws against rape and sexual harassment , and even divorce , maintenance and child custody laws .
The Universal Declaration of Human rights states that “ all are equal before the law , and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law ” .
Article 14 of the Indian Constitution declares that “ The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India . ”
However , the Government of India has not made any provisions to protect men against any form of domestic abuse or harassment at the work place .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights also proclaims that “ everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law . ”
However , women - protection laws in India presume that the accused man is guilty until proven innocent , thus violating the presumption of innocence and the principles of fair trial guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India , in addition to defying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
SFF has been working hard to sensitize the public to these serious issues , and to urge the Government to take appropriate measures to alleviate men ’s woes in the present times .
As part of these efforts , India celebrated International Men ’s Day for the first time on 19 November , 2007 , under the aegis of SFF and related organizations .
Owing to SFF ’s campaign to build a consensus on the celebration of International Men ’s Day across the world , Australia is joining hands with India this year .
In observance of International Men ’s Day , 2008 , SFF is organizing a demonstration at Jantar Mantar , Delhi , on 19 November , 2008 , from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. , to voice our concerns to the public , media , law - makers and the Government of India .
Our sentiments will be echoed in cities across India including Mumbai , Kolkata , Nagpur , Lucknow , Bangalore and Hyderabad through the activities of various local chapters and NGOs working towards family harmony and gender equality .
On this occasion , we demand the Government of India to institute a “ Ministry for Men ’s Welfare ” to cater to men ’s needs in the changing society .
In addition , we demand the Government of India to :
• End the “ legal terrorism ” perpetrated through the misuse of anti-male , anti-family laws .
Specifically , Section 498A of IPC should be made bailable .
It should also be made non-cognizable to prevent arrests of innocent citizens based on mere complaints unsubstantiated by evidence or investigation .
• Make civil and criminal laws applicable to men and women equally .
Specifically , provisions of IPC 498A , Domestic Violence
Act , adultery laws , laws against rape and sexual harassment , family laws ( divorce , maintenance and child custody ) should be made gender - neutral .
• Pass directives to resolve all marital disputes under civil law .
• Make provisions to punish those who abuse the judicial process irrespective of gender .
Specifically , heavy penalties should be imposed on people misusing IPC 498A and Domestic Violence Act as weapons for settling personal scores in marital disputes .
• Grant joint custody of children to both spouses upon dissolution of marriage .
We request members of the print and electronic media to show solidarity by joining us in large numbers and providing unprecedented coverage for this event .
Entrepreneurs build their business within the context of an environment which they sometimes may not be able to control .

The report suggested Obama wanted his advisers to get his permission before engaging in private conversations with outsiders .
Longtime Obama family friend Eric Whitaker seemed to follow this .
Obama 's five rules of scandal response
Tuesday 's report from the transition , detailing contacts between members of Obama 's inner circle and embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and concluding that " nothing at all inappropriate " was discussed , wo n't be the final word on the subject — but it did provide some telling insight into the way the White House 's new occupant will operate .
Here are five rules of Obama scandal - management based on his team 's handling of its first post-election crisis .
Advertisement
1 - Be transparent , to an extent
Obama 's internal review was entirely voluntary and intended to demonstrate that his team had nothing to hide , and was committed to its pledge to run " the most open and transparent transition in history . "
But after announcing the review , his team declined to reveal who would conduct it , who would be interviewed or whether the resulting release would include any transition e-mails or records to support its conclusions .
The review itself answered just one of those questions — we now know that White House Counsel Greg Craig led the review , which did n't include any documentation of what materials it went over — but it raised others , among them :
Why did Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett communicate with Craig through her lawyer , whom the report does not name ; how many conversations did incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel have with Blagojevich ; and why was Obama himself interviewed by prosecutors ?
The report says Emanuel urged Blagojevich to tap Jarrett for the Senate seat during " one or two telephone calls . "
But in the next paragraph , it refers to " those early conversations with the governor , " and in a conference call unveiling the report , Craig said Emanuel " had a couple of conversations with the governor . "
Equally unclear is what exactly was reviewed in the report that concludes that nothing inappropriate occurs , and whether there were any transition e-mails or other records covering the Senate seat selection process .
" We asked each individual who we thought might have had some contact or some communication that would be meaningful " to reconstruct " any contacts or communications , and that would include checking cell phone records or e-mails , and we inquired about that , " Craig said .
He added that " we 've got the information that is required , " and said he did n't know of any written communications .
Also , the report revealed that prosecutors interviewed Obama , and did so after he had publicly declared he had been unaware of Blagojevich ’s alleged plot to sell off the Senate seat Obama had vacated after winning the presidency , raising questions about why they took the unusual step of interviewing the president - elect , what they asked him and whether he was under oath .
2 - Do n't let the news cycle dictate response
Freed from the rapid fire back - and - forth of the campaign , Obama , a stickler for preparation , resorted to his methodical instincts in trying to create order amidst the swirling scandal .
But in taking his time , he 's let the story linger into a third week .
After drawing criticism for a listless initial response the day Blagojevich was arrested and accused of trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by the president - elect , Obama went a step further the next day by calling on the governor to resign .
On the third day of the story , he announced the internal review .
By the next week he acknowledged frustration over not being able to clear up inaccuracies about the case .
Still , Obama resisted the temptation to spout off and stuck to the original plan :
He would allow a written report to speak for him .
When the transition released the five - page review Tuesday , the day before Christmas Eve , Obama was far removed from the action as he relaxed in Hawaii with his family .
The physical distance served the same purpose as the report itself , separating Obama from the swirl of scandal
3 - No freelancing
The report suggested Obama wants his advisers to get his permission before even ostensibly private conservations with outsiders .
Longtime Obama family friend Eric Whitaker seemed to follow this rule when he was approached by Blagojevich deputy Louanner Peters asking who could speak for Obama 's preferences for the Senate seat .
" Dr. Whitaker said he would find out , " according to the report .
After Whitaker was told by Obama that " no one was authorized to speak for him on the matter , " the report states Whitaker " relayed that information to Deputy Governor Peters " and " had no other contacts with anyone from the governor 's office . "
On the other side of that ledger was Emanuel , a much newer member of Obama 's inner circle , who broke the rule by calling Blagojevich and recommending he tap Jarrett for the seat .
" He did so before learning -- in further conversations with the president - elect -- that the president - elect had ruled out communicating a preference for any one candidate , " according to the report .
Later , when Emanuel chatted with Blagojevich's then - chief of staff , the report indicates it was " with the authorization of the president - elect . "
4 - Aides take hits to protect the boss
Twice in handling the Blagojevich scandal , top Obama lieutenants were singled out for botching the message .
The report makes clear that Emanuel was the only person in Obama 's transition who had any contact with Blagojevich about filling the Senate seat and that his contact was n't authorized by Obama .
And Obama political guru David Axelrod made a public mea culpa after his boss contradicted a statement from an interview he gave last month , before the governor 's arrest .
In it , Axelrod unambiguously described a conversation between Obama and Blagojevich about filling the seat , saying , " I know he 's talked to the governor and there are a whole range of names , many of which have surfaced , and I think he has a fondness for a lot of them . "
But after Obama declared he had n't spoken to Blagojevich , Axelrod issued a statement saying , " I was mistaken when I told an interviewer last month that the president - elect has spoken directly to Governor Blagojevich about the Senate vacancy . "
5 – Shy away from even justified fights
It seems only logical that Obama would want a say in picking his successor in the Senate , since the next junior senator from Illinois will represent the president - elect ’s home and could be an important congressional ally .
But Obama , whose penchant for avoiding tough stands on controversial issues frustrated opponents trying to land a clear shot in the presidential race , also steered clear of the Senate - seat derby , according to the report and Craig ’s teleconference .
Craig said Obama “ was not engaging on this in any personal way and had no interest in dictating the result of the selection process . ”
The report says Obama talked with his top aides about a range of prospective Senators , but never winnowed down the group , dispatching Emanuel to relay a list of acceptable candidates to Blagojevich ’s office .
And according to the report , Obama was ambivalent about the Senate aspirations of Jarrett , contradicting the widely reported claim that she was his top choice for the Senate seat .
Rather , the report says , Obama ’s “ preference ( was ) that Valerie Jarrett work with him in the White House . "
But it also states he made clear " he would neither stand in her way if she wanted to pursue the Senate seat nor actively seek to have her or any other particular candidate appointed to the vacancy . "
To the extent that the report succeeds in its goal of establishing the distance between Obama and Blagojevich , it necessarily raises the question :
Why was the president - elect and leader of the Democratic party playing no role in a key appointment to national office being made in his home state , and by a Democratic governor ?
De cat came back — thought she were a goner ,
But de cat came back for it would n't stay away .
— Lyrics from " The Cat Came Back , " a song written by Harry S. Miller in 1893 .
It 's a story that tugs at the heartstrings of all pet devotees : A cat given up for lost in 1995 has come home .
As first reported by The Press Democrat , a gray and brown - tinged kitty with round , golden eyes named George was reunited with his Santa Rosa , Calif. , owners last week after animal control officers tracked them down by scanning a microchip with identifying info implanted under the animal 's skin .
( See slideshow of George . )
Frank Walburg says his boy , George , now nearly 17 , was but a shadow of his former self when found — weighing a paltry 6.3 pounds ( 2.9 kilograms ) , less than half the nearly 14 pounds ( 6.4 kilograms ) he weighed the day he vanished over 13 years ago .
He was also sick , suffering from a respiratory infection as well as toxoplasmosis , a parasitic disease characterized by lethargy and weight loss , which can be successfully treated with antibiotics .
" He used to be like a heater on wheels , " Walburg chuckles about his beloved feline friend , " like a lion in both appearance and walk , " his wife , Melinda Merman , wrote on her Web site .
Still , Walburg told the San Francisco Chronicle " there was no ambiguity that he was the same dude , no doubt about it . "
George disappeared on June 23 , 1995 , back when Bill Clinton was president and Whitewater was in the headlines .
Walburg says that he and Merman spent weeks scouring the neighborhood for him .
They visited Sonoma County 's five animal shelters every other day for six months , posted missing cat signs , sent flyers to and called every veterinary clinic in the area and offered a hefty $ 500 reward for his return .
Alas , as days turned into weeks and weeks into months and months into years , Walburg says their hopes of finding George faded , " but we never stopped thinking about him . "
" It was hard not knowing what might have happened to him , " Walburg told ScientificAmerican.com , pausing to control his emotions .
" We would imagine that he was just around the corner or trapped somewhere — and we would go and check . "
And so one can only imagine how he and Merman felt last week when they received a call from Sonoma County Animal Care and Control : George was there , the message said .
" We did n't know what to expect , we did n't know if he was dead or alive , because they also pick up animals on the road that have been killed , " Walburg says , noting that he and Merman cried the entire 20 - minute trip to claim him .
When they arrived at the county shelter , George was in medical isolation .
" The routine practice is to scan for a chip and , if there is n't one , to make a determination on the spot " about an animal 's fate , he says .
" George was grossly sick , way underweight , he had watery eyes , was lethargic , not eating ; there is zero doubt that since his health was so bad , they would not have been able to adopt him out to anyone and he would have been euthanized if it were n't for the microchip . "
" He 's home because of his microchip , '' Walburg says , noting that his wife , then a volunteer at the Humane Society ( and now at Forgotten Felines , which spays and neuters feral cats and provides food for them until their natural deaths ) , insisted that George and his three littermates be micro-chipped when they adopted them in 1992 .
At that time , the technology was new and mostly used on dogs .
U.S. animal microchip manufacturer AVID Identification Systems , Inc. , based in southern California , filed for a patent on the technology in 1985 ; the first chips were implanted into companion animals in 1989 , according to Mary Metzner , AVID 's shelter operations representative ( who trains animal control officers and shelter personnel on how to properly implant and use the system ) .
She says the rice - size radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) device is activated with a handheld scanner ; the radio frequency used is 125 kilohertz .
Microchips are generally implanted under the skin over the shoulder blades in dogs and cats .
Each one contains an identification number unique to that animal ; every microchip sold is automatically registered ( to the vet who purchases it ) in PETtrac , AVID 's national recovery data base , according to Metzner .
She says private veterinary clinics on average charge from $ 60 to $ 100 , and shelters from $ 20 to $ 30 ( and often much less ) to implant a microchip and register a pet for its lifetime .
The chip is encapsulated in biocompatible glass ( the type used in pacemakers , stents and other medical devices ) and has been tested to last for at least 75 years , according to Metzner , who adds that AVID has sold more than 25 million microchips .
Among other brands distributed in the U.S. : resQ , HomeAgain and 24PetWatch .
Some studies in the 1990s found that tumors formed in mice and rats in tissue around where the microchips were placed .
But Metzner said further testing has produced no evidence of a link between cancer risk and the devices , which are only activated when scanned — and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 2004 found the process safe enough to be used in animals and humans .
AVID , when contacted by Sonoma County Animal Care and Control , traced the device in George to Northtown Animal Hospital in Santa Rosa .
Walburg says they were lucky their vet had their number , which had been changed since the chip was implanted and registered .
In some cases , there is a more direct relationship with pet owners , who can change chip ID registration contact info online .
" Our sole purpose is to bring animals home .
So it 's a wonderful feeling to know that the system works , " Metzner says about George 's long - awaited homecoming .
" It 's a miracle .
We get over 1,000 calls a day of people finding pets and reuniting them with families . "
She says this is one of — if not the — longest period between a pet 's loss and recovery ever recorded .
Among other success stories : a cat that had been missing from Los Angeles for a decade , found in Texas several years ago , and a dog missing from Panama , Fla. , who was found six years later in Ohio .
" There 's no way this reunion after 13 and a half years would have happened without the microchip , " Walburg stresses , urging all pet owners to chip their charges and anyone who finds a stray to take it to the nearest shelter or animal hospital to have it scanned for one .
He also believes that vets should routinely scan their animal patients to make sure the humans bringing them in are their rightful owners , noting that they might have found George sooner had that been done .
" It 's a very reasonable amount of money for something that potentially can help bring your pets home if they lose their collar .
But even if your pet is micro-chipped , it 's still important to have a visible collar and tag on that animal with the owner 's name on it to get it home immediately , " says Stephanie Shain , director of outreach at The Humane Society of the United States in Washington , D.C .
" It 's pretty amazing , " she adds about the George 's homecoming .
" If you 're on the fence of whether you should or should n't get [ a microchip ] , this would probably put a lot of people in the ' yes ' column who were n't there before . "
Walburg says that George was found at a mobile home park about 3.5 miles ( 5.5 kilometers ) from their home , where he was turned over to animal control by the manager .
George was one of four kittens born to a feral cat that the Walburgs adopted .
( They also took in their mom , who they had spayed . )
Sadly , George 's two brothers ( twin Ira and Klaus ) died two years ago from an intestinal disorder .
But sister Grace is still alive ( though Walburg reports she was more interested in George 's special kibble than in seeing her long - lost brother when they were reunited ) and George now has three new foster siblings —
Foxy , Sam and Spook .
Walburg , a computer consultant and amateur winemaker who names some varieties after his cats ( each bottle is labeled with a photo of its namesake ; George will grace the next one ) , says that he and Merman are nursing George back to health , feeding him dabs of baby food mixed with chicken broth that he initially licked from a spoon and their fingers ( but is now eating from a dish ) and giving him antibiotics to clear up the toxoplasmosis .
( See video . )
He says the cat spends most of his time in the guest room — which has been set aside for him — and that he 's slowly but surely regaining his old vim and vigor – and has gained 3.5 ounces ( 99 grams ) since he came home .
( See video of George on the mend . )
About a year after George went missing , Melinda Merman wrote a " Letter to George " on her Web site in which she waxed poetic about his personality quirks , how he loved peanut butter and to bat at towels — and hated the rain .
And how he always waited at the foot of their bed for them to wake up in the morning .
" There are so many things I miss now that you 're gone , " she wrote .
" In fact , do you remember where you slept at night ?
On top of the bathroom towel cupboard .
Remember your towel up there ?
Well it 's still there .
I have cleaned the top of the cupboard , but your towel is just as you left it .
We will always wonder what happened to you .
And we 'll always hope you come home . "
On November 5 , 2008 , she updated her blog : " George was found and returned to us .
We are so thrilled to have him back in the family . "
A New York newspaper stole the Empire State Building in an attempt to expose a loophole in the city 's legal system , it revealed today .
In what it described as " one of the biggest heists in American history " , the New York Daily News stole the two billion dollar ( £ 1.35 billion ) 102 - storey Art Deco skyscraper in the heart of Manhattan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The newspaper , which listed original King Kong star Fay Wray as a witness in the documents , made a fake £ 20 notary stamp which shared a name with bank robber Willie Sutton , and filed paperwork with the city to transfer the deed to the property .
Just 90 minutes later , the agency rubber - stamped the transfer of the Manhattan landmark from Empire State Land Associates to the newspaper 's fake company , Nelots Properties LLC .
Nelots reads " stolen " backwards .
The stunt , which the newspaper splashed under the headline Skycaper , comes after a series of deed fraud cases in the city - and in the UK .
Brooklyn assistant district attorney Richard Farrell , who is prosecuting several of the cases , told the newspaper : " Crooks go where the money is .
That 's why Willie Sutton robbed banks , and this is the new bank robbery .
" Once you have the deed , it 's easy to obtain a mortgage . "
The system , run by the office of the city register , does not require clerks to verify the information - a feature the newspaper described as " a gaping loophole in the city 's system for recording deeds , mortgages and other transactions " .
Unlike the thieves , the News did not obtain a mortgage on the Empire State Building and simply returned the property to its rightful owners yesterday , less than 24 hours after the fake deed was filed .
In October , a forensic accountant with Navigant Consulting claimed mortgage lenders could have up to £ 17 billion of fraudulent loans on their books in the UK .

Paul Doxey and other experts told Channel 4
News there had been a boom in fake applications over recent years , involving the purchase of as many as 60,000 properties .
And in July , the Financial Services Authority announced tough new measures to try to curb soaring numbers of mortgage fraud cases .
The plans included tightening its surveillance of lenders and brokers and sharing intelligence with other law enforcers and regulators , including the National Fraud Strategic Authority .
The announcement came after two men and a woman were jailed that month for their part in a sophisticated mortgage fraud which made them more than £ 1 million .
Two men and a woman posing as potential buyers copied homeowners ' details and then used the information to alter title deeds and secure massive mortgages on the properties .
Mohammed Urfan Al Haq , Shazad Hussain Aslam , both 27 , and 23 - year - old Sandeep Kaur were involved in a scam to fraudulently obtain the title deeds to a number of properties in the West Midlands and the North of England .
Once the deeds were obtained , loans were taken out using the properties as security .
The loans were later cashed in and laundered into gold bullion .
But police were alerted about their activities and Al Haq and Kaur were jailed for four years , and Aslam for five years , for money laundering and fraud charges by a judge at Birmingham Crown Court .
In Keanu Reeves ’s new movie , The Day the Earth Stood Still , he plays the stone - faced representative of an alien race planning on destroying the planet — perfect casting for an actor famous for his otherworldly impassiveness .
Ha-ha , you might say , Keanu Reeves is playing another role where he does n’t have to emote .
But those who joke about Keanu and his immobile face have n’t been paying attention .
Authorities have blamed a faulty onboard computer system for last week 's mid-flight incident on a Qantas flight to Perth .
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( ATSB ) said incorrect information from the faulty computer triggered a series of alarms and then prompted the Airbus A330's flight control computers to put the jet into a 197 - metre nosedive .
At least 51 passengers and crew were hurt , many suffering broken bones and spinal injuries , when the plane carrying 313 people from Singapore to Perth climbed suddenly before plunging downwards on October 7 .
The plane was cruising at 37,000 feet when a fault in the air data inertial reference system caused the autopilot to disconnect .
But even with the autopilot off , the plane 's flight control computers still command key controls in order to protect the jet from dangerous conditions , such as stalling , the ATSB said .
" About two minutes after the initial fault , ( the air data inertial reference unit ) generated very high , random and incorrect values for the aircraft 's angle of attack , " the ATSB said in a statement .
" These very high , random and incorrect values of the angle attack led to the flight control computers commanding a nose - down aircraft movement , which resulted in the aircraft pitching down to a maximum of about 8.5 degrees . "
The pilots quickly regained control of the jet , issued a mayday emergency call and requested an emergency landing at the Learmonth air force base in remote Western Australia where passengers received medical treatment .
" The crew 's timely response led to the recovery of the aircraft trajectory within seconds .
During the recovery the maximum altitude loss was 650 foot , " the ATSB said .
The plane 's French - based manufacturer has issued an advisory on the problem and will also issue special operational engineering bulletins to airlines that fly A330s and A340s fitted with the same air data computer , the ATSB said .
Passengers on board the jet described being slammed up against the ceiling when the plane dived suddenly as objects were hurled around the cabin .
The inside of the plane suffered significant damage including smashed panels .
Qantas has described last week 's incident involving flight QF72 as a " sudden change in altitude " but said it would cooperate fully with the ATSB .
The incident was the fourth involving Qantas planes in two - and - a - half months .
On July 25 , an exploding oxygen bottle punched a huge hole in the side of a Qantas Boeing 747-400 during a flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne , forcing an emergency landing in the Philippines .
No one was injured in the mid-air drama .
Just three days later , a Qantas Boeing 737-800 returned to Adelaide after a landing gear door failed to retract .
In early August a Boeing 767 bound for Manila turned back to Sydney after developing a hydraulic fluid leak .

Thousands of DNA samples from innocent people are currently retained Two British men should not have had their DNA and fingerprints retained by police , the European Court of Human Rights has ruled .
The men's information was held by South Yorkshire Police , although neither was convicted of any offence .
The judgement could have major implications on how DNA records are stored in the UK 's national database .
The judges said keeping the information " could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society " .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she was " disappointed " by the European Court of Human Rights ' decision .
The database may now have to be scaled back following the unanimous judgement by 17 senior judges from across Europe .
Under present laws , the DNA profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England , Wales and Northern Ireland are kept on the database , regardless of whether they are charged or convicted .
Discriminatory
The details of about 4.5 m people are held and one in five of them does not have a current criminal record .
Both men were awarded £ 36,400 ( 42,000 Euros ) in costs , less the money already paid in legal aid .
The existing law will remain in place while we carefully consider the judgement
Jacqui Smith , Home Secretary
Send us your comments DNA ruling resonates in UK
The court found that the police 's actions were in violation of Article 8 - the right to respect for private and family life - of the European Convention on Human Rights .
It also said it was " struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention in England and Wales " .
The judges ruled the retention of the men's DNA " failed to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests , " and that the UK government " had overstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this regard " .
The court also ruled " the retention in question constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicants ' right to respect for private life and could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society " .
' Privacy protection '
The home secretary said : " DNA and fingerprinting is vital to the fight against crime , providing the police with more than 3,500 matches a month .
" The government mounted a robust defence before the court and I strongly believe DNA and fingerprints play an invaluable role in fighting crime and bringing people to justice .
" The existing law will remain in place while we carefully consider the judgement . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Solicitor Peter Mahy , who represented the men , said that the decision will have far - reaching implications .
" It will be very interesting to see how the UK government respond .
" The government should now start destroying the DNA records of those people who are currently on the DNA database and who are innocent of any crime . "
Human rights group Liberty said it welcomed the court 's decision .
Director Shami Chakrabarti said : " This is one of the most strongly worded judgements that Liberty has ever seen from the Court of Human Rights .
" That court has used human rights principles and common sense to deliver the privacy protection of innocent people that the British government has shamefully failed to deliver . "
' Invasion of privacy ' Phil Booth , of the NO2ID group , which campaigns against identity cards , said : " ' This is a victory for liberty and privacy .
" Though these judgements are always complicated and slow in coming , it is a vindication of what privacy campaigners have said all along .
" The principle that we need to follow is simple - when charges are dropped suspect samples are destroyed .
No charge , no DNA . "
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports on the ethical questions raised by recent advances in biological and medical research .
Its director , Hugh Whittall , said : " We agree wholeheartedly with this ruling .
The DNA of innocent people should not be kept by police .
" People feel it is an invasion of their privacy , and there is no evidence that removing from the DNA database people who have not been charged or convicted will lead to serious crimes going undetected .
" The government now has an obligation to bring its own policies into line . "
Rights breach claim
One of the men who sought the ruling in Strasbourg , Michael Marper , 45 , was arrested in 2001 .
He was charged with harassing his partner but the case was later dropped .
He had no previous convictions .
The other man - a teenager identified as " S " - was arrested and charged with attempted robbery but later acquitted .
In both cases the police refused to destroy fingerprints and DNA samples taken when the men were taken in to custody .
The men went to the European Court of Human Rights after their cases were thrown out by the House of Lords .
They argued that retaining their DNA profiles is discriminatory and breaches their right to a private life .
The government claims the DNA profile from people who are not convicted may sometimes be linked to later offences , so storing the details on the database is a proportionate response to tackling crime .
Scotland already destroys DNA samples taken during criminal investigations from people who are not charged or who are later acquitted of alleged offences .
The Home Office has already set up a " contingency planning group " to look into the potential implications arising from a ruling in favour of the men .

In a major boost to Southern California ’s aerospace industry , a Hawthorne start - up founded by an Internet entrepreneur has been awarded a NASA contract potentially worth $ 3.1 billion to lift supplies to the International Space Station .
Space Exploration Technologies , also known as SpaceX , beat out aerospace behemoths Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. for the contract to build rockets that would replace the space shuttle when it is slated for retirement in 2010 .
The commercial contract , the first of its kind for the space agency , marks a huge milestone for the small company , which was founded by Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk and only recently successfully launched a rocket after three attempts .
Musk made a fortune from the sale of Internet payment company PayPal Inc. , which he co-founded , and has spent about $ 100 million of his own money to develop rockets that cost a fraction of the going rate for spacecraft launchers .

The contract also returns a significant space program to Southern California , the birthplace of the Apollo spacecraft and the space shuttle .
“ Could n’t ask for a better Christmas present , for sure , ” said Musk , who was vacationing in Boulder , Colo . , on Wednesday .
“ It certainly is good news in these tough economic times . ”
Musk said the contract would entail hundreds of new jobs in Hawthorne where the company builds rockets and has about 400 employees .
Founded in 2002 , the company has been adding about 20 employees a month this year .
The hiring pace is now likely to pick up .
The initial contract is valued at $ 1.6 billion for 12 flights to resupply the space station , with the total potential worth rising to $ 3.1 billion with follow - up missions , the company said .
The first resupply mission is slated for late 2010 .

The SpaceX contract was one of two awarded by NASA and marks the first time that the agency will rely on private firms to assume almost all the responsibilities and costs of not only developing and building the rockets but also shipping cargo to the space station .
A second contract for eight flights was awarded to rocket maker Orbital Sciences Corp. in Dulles , Va .
Under the new “ commercial resupply services ” program , NASA pays the companies for each mission .
It will pay SpaceX , for instance , about $ 133 million for each flight , rather than spending about $ 400 million to $ 500 million to launch the space shuttle on its own .
In addition to the Falcon 9 launch vehicle , SpaceX is developing a cargo capsule that could eventually carry seven astronauts .
NASA is retiring the space shuttle and has been looking for replacements in the aftermath of two shuttle disasters , most recently in 2003 when Columbia broke up during reentry , killing all seven astronauts on board .

The contract “ represents a new way of doing business for NASA , ” said Bob Russo , vice president of Launchspace Inc. , a rocket industry research and consulting firm .
“ If successful , it is almost a certainty that NASA will expand its support for using such services in space station activities . ”
But it is also a major risk for the space agency , said John Pike , a space policy analyst for GlobalSecurity.org .
NASA is not only relying on two small rocket companies to keep supplies flowing to the space station ; it ’s also hoping the companies can develop the rocket and the cargo vehicle in months -- not the years it has typically taken for other NASA programs .
“ The task is significantly bigger than anything either company has ever done , ” Pike said .

“ All of these things strike me as significant challenges for even the biggest aerospace companies . ”
If SpaceX ca n’t launch the rockets in time , the space station could be in jeopardy , Russo said .
NASA does n’t plan to have a permanent replacement for the space shuttle until the next decade .
And if SpaceX or Orbital is late , the U.S. will have to rely on Russian space vehicles .
“ This is undoubtedly a major boost to SpaceX ’s credibility and bottom line , ” Russo said .
He added that relations with the Russians were strained , which could lead to discontinued supply missions to the space station .
“ SpaceX ’s role could be crucial to the station ’s survival . ”

After being lectured for 20 years about the superiority of the free market , officials in Latin America see no small irony in efforts to bail out the U.S. banking system .
Latin America has several reasons to worry about the U.S. economic meltdown .
Ecuador , for instance , fears the possible loss of duty - free export markets for its coffee , fish and flowers .
People here are also worried the crisis will cut into the $ 2 billion sent home annually by Ecuadoreans living in the U.S. , and wonder whether their use of the dollar as the national currency , a move made in 2000 to cure inflation , still makes sense .
But there is an undercurrent of schadenfreude at America ’s pain .
Commentator Boaventura de Sousa Santos scolded the United States for its “ ironhanded evangelizing ” about free markets , privatization and deregulation .
Advertisement
“ Millions were thrown into unemployment , lost their land and labor rights and had to emigrate , ” the Portuguese - born Santos wrote .
The comments resonated in Ecuador , a country where 15 % of the population has fled to the U.S. and Europe looking for better lives .
In an interview , Quito - based historian and publisher Abdon Ubidia said Americans now can appreciate why many South American countries have swung to the left -- they saw the future and were n’t buying it .
Tighter credit and falling commodity prices are starting to hurt the region .
But analysts in Chile and Brazil reminded readers that their nations have emerged stronger from past crises .

Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner derided the argument that the market would solve everything .
“ What it has produced is the largest state intervention in memory , ” she said last week .
“ We are seeing how the First World collapses . ”

First of all , I want to thank everyone for their emails , phone calls , faxes and telegrams , asking if I was still alive over the past few months .
The answer is yes , and I 'm also very well rested .
The truth of the matter is two - fold , and while I wo n't bore you with the details , I will tell you it was a combination of " being burnt out " and " trying something new in life " .
If you want all the details , you can email me , but I think there are more important things to talk about .
Like .... Are the Pammies coming back ?
Was Chris Berman really honored by the NFL Hall of Fame ?
And , what the hell is a Bloguin ?
In order , yes ..... yes ..... and the people that are going to help me keep this site going in the direction that it was intended to .
I started the site back in 2006 as an open forum of sorts .
A place where people could bitch and moan about whatever network / announcer they disagreed with / could n't stand , as well as a hub of information on hirings / firings , schedules , etc .
For months , I tried to spot post , without much avail , and even hired other writers for the site .
Nothing worked out until Bloguin stepped in and " righted the ship " .
They have lined up some great writers , overhauled the layout of the site ( beautifully I may add ) and are even keeping little ole ' me around to post every so often .
All in all , it was the perfect match to keep the ( slightly delayed ) ball rolling in the way in which it was intended .
I hope that you will at least give them / us a shot , and continue to comment on posts and The Pammies .
Awful Announcing will be a fun ( and updated ) place again ..... mark my words !
Thank you all for your patronage , and I will see you tomorrow for Day One of The Pammies !!!

This year 's Butler vs. Duke National Title Game was one of the NCAA 's highest watched championship games ever and will be one of the most watched sporting events this year reaching nearly 50 million viewers in the US .
For play by play announcer , Jim Nantz , it was just another bullet point in an illustrious 20 year career leading NCAA Tournament coverage for CBS .
But for Clark Kellogg , in just his second year as CBS 's lead color commentator , the classic title game was a jumping off point for a very exciting offseason .
In addition to losing ( maybe intentionally ) to President Obama in a game of HORSE / POTUS , Kellogg received some clarity about his future as CBS partnered with Turner Sports to successfully outbid ESPN and others to retain the rights to the to the NCAA Tournament .
In June , Kellogg who also serves as a commentator for the Pacers , would add a executive role with team as VP of Player Relations .
To round out an interesting offseason , Kellogg added another role to his expanding presence in sports as Capital One announced yesterday that he 'll be an initial member of their advisory board for the newly formed Capital One Cup , a high profile competition among collegiate athletic departments .
How a site named Awful Announcing gets 20 minutes with someone as high profile as Clark Kellogg is somewhat of an enigma although a lot of the thanks goes to Don Povia from HHR and Blogs with Balls .
After the jump are some of the highlights from the interview before we got off track and started asking him about movies like Tin Cup and Happy Gilmore .
On the Move from Studio Analyst to Lead Color Commentator :
It was something I aspired to do .
Billy Packer had done a bang - up job in that role for north of three decades and he's an icon as an analyst in not just basketball but any sport .
Doing a national championship game for 30 years is unprecedented and something I do n't think will be duplicated again .
Even though my role in the studio was terrific and I gained a comfort level there , I was hoping that at some point I 'd be considered for the role as you do n't get a lot of chances to call one of the premier sporting events and I was just hoping to be in a position to be considered .
I am extremely grateful and thankful that it happened a couple of years ago .
I do n't know if I can go for as long as Billy did , but I hope to stay in the seat for a few more years and it was a nice promotion and it was something that I hoped would find its way into my life .
On Former Athletes Seemingly Getting more Media Jobs and Ascending to more High Profile Media Jobs Compared to Previous Generations of Athletes :
I think its a positive thing .
I mean the analyst role is uniquely suited for former coaches and former players because of the perspective and experience that they have .
They understand what goes on behind the scenes so those guys are your best potential candidates .
Also with all the media platforms out there , athletes are aspiring to join the media earlier and more often so a lot of players are seeing their contemporaries or players they know make the transition and they say " That 's something I would like to do " .
They begin to pursue it , plan for it , and prepare themselves as there are a lot more opportunities compared to 20 years ago .
The play by play role however I think is probably better suited for someone who has done a lot more things in broadcasting and are for people who are aspiring to move in that direction .
Significance of The New Capital One Cup to College Athletics :
It 's a new prestige program rewarding athletic programs for their cumulative on field performance across multiple men's and women 's sports .
There will be 13 women's and 13 men's sports that division 1 programs can compete in for an opportunity to win the Capital One Cup .
It will be a cumulative scoring system from the fall sports , winter sports and through the spring sports with the winner of the Capital One Cup not only receiving a trophy but also $ 200,000 in funding for graduate scholarships for student athletes for both the men's and women 's program winner .
It 's the most comprehensive rewards program in existence and I am thrilled to be a part of the advisory team .
I think it 's a great way to not only put a spotlight on tremendous athletic achievement but also tying in the funding of graduate level scholarships for student athletes .
Special K's thoughts on Blogosphere Rock Star Gus Johnson and his role at CBS :
I am a big time fan .
Matter of a fact one of the few negatives about moving away from the studio is that I do n't get to work with him as much .
I get to work with Verne Lundquist and later on in the season with Jim Nantz and we have tremendous play by play guys at CBS .
Both Verne and Jim are not only good at what they do but are good people to be around and fun to be around .
But I do miss not working with Gus as much as I did when I was in the studio .
I think Gus is fantastic and that he has a terrific basketball voice because of knowledge of the game , his natural enthusiasm , and his uniqueness on how he combines his excitement and passion with terrific calls .
I 've heard this from countless people around the country as they love him doing NCAA games .
I think he 's a tremendous fan , play by play guy , and that his rhythm is hand in glove the style for basketball .
He has a nice understanding for pace , flow , his excitement rises as the game goes from possession to possession .
He just has as really intuitive sense for calling basketball that appeals to fans and makes him a lot of fun to work with .
On New CBS Contract Allowing All Games to be Broadcast Nationally and Games Including Finals Being Split Between CBS and Turner Sports Properties :
We 're all really happy and proud that the NCAA wants to continue its relationship with CBS .
It 's been a 20 year relationship of televising the National Title game and we 're thrilled that 's going to continue .
To have a partner like Turner Sports is a win win for us , the NCAA , and the fans .
Having all of the games nationally televised on CBS and our cable partners is definitely great for the fans .
I do n't know how long I 'll be on the train , but it feels good that CBS owns the tracks to a key sports property .
Moving from 65 Sports Team Tournament To 68 Teams and Avoiding the 96 Team Tournament :
Change can always be uncomfortable especially with all the speculation that was out there about what was possible .
Initially I was totally opposed when the winds started to blow over a year ago .
As I heard more and more reasons why expansion might be good , I became more open to it .
I was n't really for any type of structure of expansion but I was open to it .
As we go from 65 to 68 , I am comfortable with that change .
Where we go from here I do n't know but the addition of some more teams and a few games is good and I am on board .
I am not going to speculate on what the final resting place is going to be if it grows again , but I 'll deal with that change down the road .
I think it was a positive move and one that was well thought out .
Thoughts on New Role with Pacers :
My new role as Vice President of Player Relations which is basically overseeing the player development area which includes programming to help them be champions on and off the court in terms of community involvement and education programs for them .
I 'm really trying to mentor them through the demands and challenges that NBA players face .
Particularly with the Pacers , with so many players being young players being under 25 years old that did n't graduate from college and now are rushed into the limelight and lifestyle of being a NBA player .
It 's something they have dreamed about but then navigating that successfully is really a challenge even for the most seasoned player that shows up .
It 's just a demanding environment .
My job is to try to help those guys grow up as professionals on and off the court and adapt to that environment .
Verne Lundquist 's Appearance in Happy Gilmore vs. Jim Nantz 's Appearance in Tin cup :
Ha , that 's a tough one , but I 'd lean towards Verne in Happy Gilmore .
That appearance is unique and iconic and I 've seen a lot of signs around the country when I travel with Verne that reference so I am going to give the nod to him .

The man was butchered .
At least get your money back , bro .
Reminds me of the Seinfeld episode " The Barber . "
And since Reali asked , I 'd say my " level of concern " is high to quite high .

Admit it , you may not love the Jets , but you ’re loving this season of Hard Knocks .
The locker room access .
Rex Ryan ’s awful eating habits and worse language .
Antonio Cromartie ’s gaggle of kids .
Darrelle Revis .
HBO could put out an hour episode a day and still not cover everything surrounding this team .
They ’ve got more storylines than a mid-day soap opera .
Now three episodes in , we ’re closer than ever to the start of the season .
But what have we really learned about the Jets ?
Here are 10 Things …
1. If Mark Sanchez Really Is The Difference Between The Jets Going To The Super Bowl Or Not , They Probably Should n’t Pack Their Bags Just Yet : Look , I ’m not ragging on Sanchez here , if only because most quarterbacks take a step back in their second year in the league .
There ’s a reason Marty Schottenheimer said in Episode 2 “ If you get a second year quarterback to perform at his rookie level , that ’s when you know you ’ve made progress . ”
At the same time , is it just me , or does Sanchez seem kind of immature ?
You know , like when his quarterbacks coach came in and said , “ You know what you ’re almost ready to do , ” and Sanchez replied , “ Stop sucking . ”
Sorry Mark , but that was a little too “ 11 - year - old girl who got a C on her reading test ” for my taste .
As his coach said , you ’re an NFL quarterback Mark , time to start acting like it .
Regardless , this has been my biggest contention with the Jets all preseason , what do they do if Sanchez is n’t ready ?
It ’s not like he lit the world on fire last year , and unless someone gives him a blow torch and some gasoline , I do n’t think he ’s going to do it in 2010 either .
Also , is this really a guy you can see keeping everyone calm when the going gets tough ?
Is he going to be able to keep Santonio Holmes , LT , Braylon Edwards and everybody else in line when they ’re not getting touches ?
I ’m not really sure he ’s that guy yet .
And until he is , the Jets are n’t going to the Super Bowl .
2. Speaking of Sanchez , His Backup Apparently Is n’t A Big Fan Either : Umm , it ’s not that Mark Brunell is jealous , bitter or hostile toward his younger counterpart .
If anything , he ’s been a good mentor from what we ’ve seen ( “ His do n’t blame the arrow , blame the Indian , ” speech was straight out of my grandma ’s playbook from the 1940’s .
All he needed was a bowl of tapioca pudding while saying it ) .
No Brunell ’s beef is different , but actually just like yours or mine : Brunell is n’t a big fan of Sanchez for the simple fact that his 18 - year - old daughter ( Just five years younger than Sanchez ) , has the hots for the Jets starting QB .
Brunell even went on the record a few episodes ago and told Sanchez , “ You ’re not meeting her . ”
And quite honestly , who could blame Brunell ?
The NFL already has one gray - bearded , 40 - year - old quarterback that recently became a first time grandfather , one Brett Favre .
Brunell certainly does n’t want to be No. 2 .
3. The Most Surprisingly Compelling Character So Far Has Been Special Teams Coach Mike Westhoff : First off , the dude is a cancer survivor , which already makes him cooler than you or I .
But beyond that , it ’s Westhoff's , “ I do n’t care who the hell you are , if you ca n’t play get the hell off my football field , ” Herman Boone approach to the game that makes him so fun to follow .
It ’s also led to some killer one liner ’s too .
Here are a few of my favorites :
Westhoff on tight end Matt Mulligan ’s excuse for his subpar play : “ I do n’t give a shit if you ’ve got the triple f*** ing Asian flu , ” you ’ve got to play better .
Westhoff on underachieving wide receiver David Clowney , “ We ’ve been talking about David Clowney ’s potential since … I do n’t know …
When Bush was President . ”
And finally his take on rookie cornerback Donovan Warren , “ Donny , that was a good tackle you made in that drill .
If you ’d have played like that last year , maybe Michigan would ’ve won some damn games ! ”
4. The Most Surprisingly Compelling Scene Of The Season Came At The Rookie Talent Show , Where Brian Jackson Won , “ King Ugly ” : What ’s King Ugly , you ask ?
Well it ’s a team vote on the three ugliest rookies in camp .
Everyone donates a few bucks , and as Rex Ryan explained , “ The third place winner gets 75 percent of the pot .
The second place winner gets 25 percent .
The first place winner gets nothing … because he ’s so damn ugly he does n’t deserve it . ”
Well then .
( Also , do n’t you wish we handed out “ King Ugly , ” Awards on every team , and in every league ?
This year ’s King Ugly competition took a surprising turn , when rookie offensive lineman Vladimir Duccasse was so ugly that he won both the second and third place prizes .
( And believe me when I say , that dude is UGLY .
If Shrek had a 6 ’ 5 , 325 lb. brother who played in the NFL , it ’d have definitely been Duccasse ) .
Meanwhile , the first prize went to cornerback Brian Jackson , not so much for his looks , but just simply because everybody on the team loathes him .
If you do n’t believe me , check out the scene where the defensive veterans get pissed off at Jackson , tie him to the goal post , paste Icy Hot all over his body , then dump two buckets of Gatorade on his face .
Funny scene .
Unless you ’re Jackson of course .
5 . The Guy With The Coolest Name On The Team Has To Be… : 6 ’8 Defensive End Ropati Pitoitua .
You thought I was going to say D’Brickishaw Ferguson , did n’t you ?
6. LaDainian Tomlinson May Have Had The Most Unnecessarily Exuberant Touchdown Celebration I ’ve Ever Seen :
In Episode 2 , when he jumped over the pile for a meaningless score , then slammed the ball down like he ’d just clinched a Super Bowl win or something .
Wow .
LT , my man , we get it .
You ’ve got a chip on your shoulder because of the way things ended in San Diego .
We ’re on your side .
But it ’s August 18 , not December 18 .
You ’re going against the second string in practice , not the first string of the Patriots .
Deep breaths buddy , deep breaths .
Honestly , the whole scene reminded me of when one of my buddies ends an especially long dry spell , with an especially ugly girl , and acts like he just banged Scarlett Johansson .
We know you ’ve been there before .
Act like it .
7. The Tony Dungy - Rex Ryan Controversy Is The Stupidest Storyline Of The Show : Look , I like Dungy .
He ’s a good man and a good family man from all accounts .
He won a Super Bowl , which is obviously better than anything I ’ll ever do in my life .
But , the fact that he criticized Ryan for swearing too much on Hard Knocks , might be the single stupidest thing I ’ve ever heard .
As my high school football coach used to say , football is n’t a contact sport .
It ’s a collision sport .
A game where guys recklessly throw their bodies into and through one another , for sixty minutes a week , four months a year .
So if Ryan needs to drop a few F - Bombs to get his point across , is it really that big of a deal ?
This is a profession where guys are paid to inflict pain on their opponents .
Where broken bones and torn and ACL ’s are hazards of the job .
Where up until a few years ago , people treated concussions like paper cuts .
In context , are a few F - Bombs that bad ?
Besides , the show is n’t on ABC Family .
It ’s on HBO .
If the language does n’t please you Mr. Dungy , do n’t watch .
It ’s really that simple .
I 'm on Rex 's side on this one .
8. Joe McKnight Might Be The Least Likeable Guy On This Team :
Or at least that ’s how the producers of the show want us to think of him .
This guy puked in minicamp , failed a conditioning test , and really seems about as indifferent as a stoned 10th grader stuck in algebra class .
Bart Scott even summed him up by saying that McKnight was frustrated because he was “ Taking a pay cut , ” by leaving USC for the Jets.
Zing .
I suppose we probably should have known things were bad with McKnight when Santonio Holmes had to calm him down and become his voice of reason .
When Santonio Holmes has to talk sense into you , that ’s a pretty good sign that things are n’t going well .
9. Forget The Players , The Scariest Guy On The Jets Is Defensive Coordinator Mike Pettine : I mentioned it in my
All I ’m saying is this :
If Pettine tries to trade one of his backup linebackers for a carton of cigarettes next episode , I ’m alerting the authorities .
10 . Antonio Cromartie Needs A Vasectomy : I ’m not really going to touch too much on this .
If only because everyone and their mother ’s have already cracked wise on Cromartie , and I do n’t feel the need to pile on the poor guy ( Ok , that ’s a lie .
I ’m just not going to get too much into it , because I ’m a week late , and everyone ’s already used up all the good jokes .
Damn . ) .
On a serious note though , how dumb is this guy ?
What ’s he got now , seven kids in five states ?
Eight kids in six ?
I ca n’t keep track , but then again
Also , please Antonio , do n’t try and tell us that the producers made you look bad .
They did n’t .
You ’ve got eight kids with six women or whatever .
You made you look bad !
Instead of blaming others , should n’t you have started wearing a condom after your second or third kid …of 2007 ?
How are the producers at fault , when you have worse safe sex habits than the entire cast of Teenage Mom ?
On a separate note , after all Cromartie ’s baby momma ’s suck dry his NFL riches ( my guess is that if the Jets do win the Super Bowl this year , we ’ll be seeing Cromartie ’s championship ring on eBay sometime in 2017 ) , he could probably make a nice second career out of donating sperm .
Think about it , if you were a single woman in her 40 ’s desperately trying to have a kid , would n’t Cromartie be your go to guy ?
Would n’t you be tracking him down , wining and dining him , then handing him a six - year - old copy of Playboy and a plastic cup ?
Would n’t you simply go into your doctor ’s office and pay whatever it took to get the “ Cromartie Special ? ”
Maybe he should hold off on that vasectomy after all .

My opinion is probably mostly in line with Richard Deitsch , who commends ATH for tackling the issue , but , next to ignoring it altogether , definitely did so in the safest way possible .

Concluding that nearly everybody is exposed to a mix of chemicals that could be damaging male reproductive health , a national panel of scientists on Thursday advised the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to shift its focus and group them together when judging how much of a danger they pose .
The committee , assembled by the National Academy of Sciences , looked specifically at phthalates , controversial compounds widely found in consumer products .
Phthalates soften plastic to make vinyl for toys , building materials , medical devices and other items , and they also are used in fragrances and other beauty products .
The recommendation to combine the compounds when analyzing their threats to human health would mark a critical change in EPA strategy .
It would likely lower the total amount of phthalates the agency considers safe for people and ultimately could lead to strict regulations on their use .
By analyzing each chemical individually , the EPA underestimates the health risks of phthalates , the committee reported .
In human bodies , phthalates combine , amplifying the effects on male reproduction .
By only doing one , we underestimate the risk , " said Deborah Cory - Slechta , a professor of environmental medicine at University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry who chaired the National Research Council 's phthalates committee .
The recommendations could have far - reaching implications beyond phthalates , transforming how the EPA determines to what degree people will be exposed to a variety of chemicals and pollutants .
The committee said other compounds , such as pesticides , also linked to effects on male hormones should be grouped with phthalates in the EPA 's risk analysis .
" A focus solely on phthalates to the exclusion of other antiandrogens would be artificial and could seriously underestimate cumulative risk , " the report says .
EPA scientists asked the National Academy of Sciences for advice on how to assess phthalates because they know many have the same effects .
Peter Preuss , director of the EPA 's National Center for Environmental Assessment , said his " best guess " is that the agency will conduct the recommended cumulative assessment for phthalates .
But he said his staff just received the 160 - page report and it must first analyze the technical details of how the committee says to proceed .
" The Academy said very clearly that they think there is sufficient information to do this , so that is our next step , " Preuss said .
" There are many chemicals that act by many different mechanisms but the final result is a series of impacts on the developing male reproductive system , " he said .
" The Academy said these things are important — focus on the endpoint , the [ health ] effect , and work from that .
They are trying to simplify this process . "
Going even further , the scientists urged the EPA to consider broadening all its assessments to include cumulative effects of compounds with the same health effects .
That , for example , might lead to combined analysis of compounds that affect the brain , female reproduction , lung cancer , or heart disease .
The report bolsters a relatively new scientific argument that cumulative exposure to chemicals and pollutants should be considered when setting safe doses for each .
Many environmental groups and public health experts have urged EPA to conduct risk assessments that combine chemicals , so they welcomed the committee 's findings .
Shanna Swan , director of the University of Rochester 's Center for Reproductive Epidemiology and one of the leading scientific experts on phthalates , called the cumulative approach " the crucial next step " in addressing environmental chemicals that disrupt hormones .
" It is extremely important to conduct cumulative risk assessments to protect public health , " said Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana , acting assistant professor of pediatrics at University of Washington .
" Unlike in scientific experiments , humans are exposed to multiple chemicals everyday , " she said , so combining the chemicals " can help identify how these multiple exposures could be leading to health outcomes in the general population . "
Swan and Sathyanarayana were not on the panel , but both have studied phthalates .
Sathyanarayana 's research linked babies ’ phthalates to baby lotions , powders and shampoos .
Swan and her colleagues reported in 2005 that the chemicals were associated with signs of feminized genitalia in newborn boys .
Tests conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nearly all people , even newborns , carry traces of numerous phthalates in their bodies .
Fetuses , infants and children are considered most at risk .
Europe and the United States have restricted phthalates in toys and other children 's products , and the EU has banned some in cosmetics .
But a variety of phthalates are still in a host of consumer products .
A child may ingest phthalates through chewing on a rubber duck , an infant may be exposed from intravenous tubes in neonatal wards , and a fetus may absorb them through his mother 's use of perfumes , lotions , nail polishes and other cosmetics .
Industry groups have argued that there is insufficient evidence to group phthalates together .
But the panel of 13 scientists disagreed .
" Our committee concludes that there are common adverse effects " for many phthalates and " we believe that EPA should go ahead and conduct a cumulative risk assessment , " Cory - Slechta said .
She said the scientists found sufficient data , primarily from laboratory animal tests , to justify the new approach for phthalates immediately .
" There is a growing body of literature , particularly in rats , showing effects of phthalates on development of the male reproductive system , " she said .
Several types of phthalates mimic or block testosterone and other androgens , which are the sex hormones that guide formation of testicles , sperm and other parts of the male reproductive system .
In animal tests , exposure leads to infertility , malformed penises and abnormal testicles , which scientists call the " phthalate syndrome . "
In the past , EPA has done cumulative risk assessments when substances were structurally similar in their chemical makeup or acted in the same way .
But the committee says the EPA should instead group compounds according to " what they ultimately do " — the effects on human health , Cory - Slechta said .
The American Chemistry Council , representing industries that produce phthalates , said Thursday that it has " some reservations about how to conduct the cumulative risk assessment on substances " that do not act in the same way .
" This is remarkably ambitious and could be problematic for EPA considering that this essentially could result in a study without limits , financially or otherwise , " said Chris Bryant , managing director of the group 's Chemical Products & Technology Division .
" Congress has asked the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct a cumulative risk assessment on phthalates and there is a question as to whether a simultaneous EPA study would be redundant , " he assed .
The chemical industry also wonders how this would be reconciled with another National Academy report earlier this month that advised EPA to more strongly focus its risk assessments for chemicals .
Cory - Slechta agreed that a cumulative assessment would mean a " real paradigm change for EPA " and " might prove somewhat challenging for them . "
One obstacle for EPA scientists is that not all phthalates have the exact same effects or the same potency .
" EPA certainly has been moving in the direction of cumulative risk assessment , largely for chemicals structurally similar and ones that act in a similar way .
This is the next step -- focusing on adverse outcomes , " she said .
" This committee believed very strongly that the conceptual approach should be broadly applicable " to other chemicals , too , she added .
For instance , EPA could evaluate the risk of combined exposures to lead , mercury , and polychlorinated biphenyls — all of which can damage developing brains and reduce children 's IQs , the committee said .
" The question is do we have enough data on the individual chemicals to put into an assessment like this .
For something like phthalates , the answer is definitively yes , " Sathyanarayana said .
But , she added , " for other chemicals that have not been researched as extensively , it may be difficult to find specific information for let 's say , fetal effects , and this point is highlighted in the [ committee 's ] summary . "
One example where EPA does not have enough data to combine all the compounds is nanoparticles , which used in sunscreens and a variety of consumer products , she said .
The EPA 's Preuss acknowledged that " there clearly will be challenges to applying this to chemicals beyond the phthalates , " even when looking at just male reproduction .
His staff will have to resolve questions about how much scientific evidence is needed before including a chemical .
" We sort of have a role in the agency of doing the difficult assessments , " he said .
" Fitting something in like this with the current staffing we have is one of the challenges , clearly . "
Sathyanarayana agreed with the committee 's recommendation to group chemicals together according to what they do to the body , not just how they do it .
" I think it is very important , " she said .
" This shift in focus could lead to a much better assessment of how mixtures affect the development of adverse health outcomes . "
Beyond male reproductive health , the committee 's report raises interesting questions about how Preuss ' staff should determine a safe amount of many chemicals , including a long list of air pollutants that can cause the same respiratory and cardiovascular damage .
" I 'm sure there will be a huge amount of discussion following up on this report about how broadly we can apply the principles they recommend , " Preuss said .
" I think it will be quite interesting and controversial . "

Zimbabwe cuts water supplies to capital
People throughout the city were carrying containers searching for water , while others have resorted to digging shallow wells in their yards in the hope of finding water .
by Staff Writers
Harare ( AFP ) Dec 1 , 2008
Zimbabwe has cut water supplies to the nation 's capital Harare , state media reported Monday , leaving most of the city dry as authorities struggle to contain a cholera epidemic .
Since the Zimbabwe National Water Authority ( Zinwa ) had failed to find chemicals to treat the water supply , the state - run utility on Sunday stopped pumping water in the capital , the government mouthpiece Herald newspaper said .
" Most parts of Harare -- including the city centre -- did not get water yesterday amid claims by Zinwa staff that the authority had stopped pumping after it ran out of one of the essential chemicals , " the Herald reported .
Residents in Harare 's populous sister city of Chitungwiza told AFP that their taps had also run dry .
People throughout the city were carrying containers searching for water , while others have resorted to digging shallow wells in their yards in the hope of finding water .
Some government offices have closed down due to the lack of water and sanitation in the buildings .
The city has suffered water cuts for years , prompting wealthier residents to install deep wells or cisterns .
But the city - wide cut appeared aimed at stopping the flow of untreated water around Harare , which is at the epicentre of the cholera epidemic .
Cholera is a highly contagious , but treatable disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting that can kill a patient within hours .
The government says that 425 people have died of cholera across the country and a total of 11,071 suspected cases had been reported since the current outbreak began in August .
The Woolworths Group company is a descendant of the original F.W.Woolworth chain that begain in the U.S. in 1879 .
It opened its first store in Liverpool , England in 1909 and in 1982 there was a split with the British Chain taking its side .
Woolworths Group has been operaing at a loss for years .
It had a debt estimated at $ 580 Million .
As time passed and in came the recession as well a low show of consumer 's , and also no offer 's were coming for a buy out , it had to leave everything behind and close it all up .
After 99 Years of being in business , Woolworths , one of the biggest and most known brand in the Britain as well as in U.S. has told that it would be going out of business .
The 99 Years had been really great for them , but the sad news was about closing it when no one offered enough cash to buy it out .
Eventually they had to close it down .
As the closure of its 807 stores would come , some 27,000 employees would be losing their jobs over the Christmas Holidays .
Employees were heard as saying that this would be the most miserable Christmas they would ever have and most probably welcoming the New Year being unemployed .
Along with the Employees , many devoted customers were disheartened .
Everyone went sad about this .
Thousands of shoppers were seen in Woolworths stores for the last time bargains they could get and wanted to bid it farewell .
A shopper said , " Its terrible .
It 's iconic in England .
I find it so depressing .
People have grown up seeing the store . "
Britons have lost an old friend , the one who was running around for a long while and had families come together .
The first 200 stores will close up on Saturday , December 27 2008 , another 200 on December 30 2008 and the further remaining by January 5 2009 , which will make the giant sleep .
Some 50 Million new stock will be rushed to the stores which includes , DVD 's and CD's .
Goods have been placed on 20 to 60 percent and it will be increased as the count down comes near .
On the other hand Deloitte said some retailers have shown interest in buying some 300 Woolworths stores .
The Joint Administrator Neville Khan said : " We are now moving to the closing down sale period .
It is a very difficult situation for a lot of people , particularly the staff , and we are trying to deal with it in a sensitive way as possible . "
It also revealed on the other hand that most jobs would be saved as Deloitte would pass the emloyees to the buyers of its 300 stores .
Mr. Khan has also revealed that the Trademark of Woolworths would be sold , lets see what its ' Worth It ' brand , value .
Woolworths has seen tremendous sales in the recent weeks on annoucing its closure and putting discounts forward .
Shopper 's have made a come back to the stores who had lost contact with the brand for decades .

“ THE big question is : do you want to end this conflict or just tamp it down ?
The arguments for the first are self - evident .
Palestine fouls up our diplomacy : Israel is thrown at us whenever we ask Muslim allies for help .
Unsolved , this conflict generates wars .
The last administration was tripped up by the Israel - Hizbullah war in 2006 .
Another round in Lebanon — or a small war in Gaza , or a big one between Israel and Iran or Syria — is possible at any time .
But the argument for just tamping down is also strong .
Presidents who go for the whole package waste their time and fail .
Jimmy Carter got peace with Egypt but nothing for the Palestinians .
Hillary will tell you Bill spent more time on this than anything else in foreign policy , but he failed too .
His excuse is that Arafat suckered him ( “ Do n't you ever trust that son of a bitch , ” was his parting advice to Colin Powell ) , but now that Arafat 's dead the Palestinians have two addresses instead of one .
The Europeans tell us that Hamas can live with a two - state deal , despite its spiel about destroying Israel .
But if we talk to Hamas we knock the legs from under Mahmoud Abbas .
For now he 's still our Joe and the Palestinians ' president .
As for Israel , Ehud Olmert was a cooing dove compared to Binyamin Netanyahu , who looks like winning the election in February .
He plays annoyingly well on the Hill and pushes the line that Abbas can't deliver and that Hamas is a terror front for Iran ( which , by the way , he wants us to bomb ) .
Even if you decide against going the whole hog , you 'll lose nothing by saying forcefully before Israel votes that we want a two - state solution with a shared Jerusalem and little modification of the pre-1967 line .
Spell out the percentages .
Netanyahu might as well know he wo n't get another free pass to jerk us around on settlements .
Then , honour satisfied , you could decide to put the full package to one side and try something more modest , like peeling Syria from Iran by dangling the Golan Heights .
Israel 's own security people want a Syria deal .
If you want to get a settlement with the Palestinians too , we must start early and allow time .
If Hillary is too grand to shuttle , appoint an envoy reporting to you to ( 1 ) make our Arab friends wangle Hamas back into a Palestinian unity government ; and ( 2 ) get international buy - in to an “ Obama plan ” .
This will in fact consist of the “ parameters ” Bill Clinton drew up in 2000 and are the nearest you 'll get to a sellable compromise .
Hillary must help you sell this in New York as well as Riyadh .
Only then should you step in to close the deal — after figuring out what mix of heat and reassurance to apply to the Israelis .
They 're the ones who have to give up something real . ”

UN Calls For End To Israeli Blockade Of Gaza Strip
UN human rights chief calls for end to Israeli blockade of Gaza Strip
18 November 2008 – The top United Nations human rights official called today for an immediate end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip , which she said contravened international law and had deprived those living there of their most basic human rights for months .
“ By function of this blockade , 1.5 million Palestinian men , women and children have been forcibly deprived of their most basic human rights for months , ” said Navi Pillay , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights .
“ This is in direct contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law .
It must end now , ” she said .
Ms. Pillay called on the Israeli authorities to facilitate the urgent passage of essential humanitarian goods into Gaza , including food , medical supplies and fuel , to allow the immediate restoration of electricity , water and other essential services , and to lift restrictions on the movement of civilians for medical , educational and religious purposes .
“ Decisive steps must be taken to preserve the dignity and basic welfare of the civilian population , more than half of which are children , ” she said .
Ms. Pillay welcomed the decision by Israel to allow a limited number of trucks to enter Gaza on 17 November , but recalled its obligation to refrain from all measures that contravene international law .
“ Only a full lifting of the blockade followed by a strong humanitarian response will be adequate to relieve the massive humanitarian suffering evident in Gaza today , ” she said .
The High Commissioner also appealed for a complete cessation of Israeli air strikes and incursions , and of rocket fire by Palestinian groups .

In what was the best speech given by any of the early speakers so far , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) energized and enthralled the Democratic Convention with his call to action in support of the Democratic ticket .
“ Fellow Democrats , are you ready for November ?
Its Election Day 2008 and we Democrats are giving America a wake up call .
Wake up , America !
In 2001 , the oil companies and the war contractors seized the country and added four trillion dollars to the national debt .
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs ; trillions of dollars for an unwarranted war paid for with borrowed money ; tens of millions of dollars in cash and weapons disappeared into thin air at the cost of the lives of our troops and innocent Iraqis .
Meanwhile , with the U.S. helping to rebuild infrastructure in Iraq and Afghanistan , “ there is no money to rebuild bridges in America , ” Kucinich said .
“ Millions of Americans have lost their jobs , their homes , their health care , their pensions .
Trillions of dollars for an unnecessary war paid with borrowed money .
Tens of billions of dollars in cash and weapons disappeared into thin air , at the cost of the lives of our troops and innocent Iraqis , while all the president ’s oilmen are maneuvering to grab Iraq ’s oil .
Borrowed money to bomb bridges in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
No money to rebuild bridges in America .
Money to start a hot war with Iran .
Now we have another cold war with Russia , while the American economy has become a game of Russian roulette . ”
Kucinich continued .

It was his liberal call to arms , which made this speech so special , “ The insurance companies took over health care .
Wake up , America !
The pharmaceutical companies took over drug prices .
Wake up , America !
The speculators took over Wall Street .
Wake up , America !
We went into Iraq for oil , and now they want to drill more … into your wallet .
Wake up America .
This administration can tap our phones but they ca n’t tap our creative spirit .
They can open our mail but they ca n’t open economic opportunities .
They can track our every move but they lost track of the economy . ”
Kucinich put this in terms that every American should understand , “ Wake up , America .
This is not a call for you to take a new direction from right to left .
This is call for you to go from down to up .
Up with the rights of workers .
Up with wages .
Up with fair trade .
Up with creating millions of good paying jobs , rebuilding our bridges , ports and water systems .
Up with creating millions of sustainable energy jobs to lower the cost of energy , lower carbon emissions and protect the environment .
Up with health care for all .
Up with education for all .
Up with home ownership .
Up with guaranteed retirement benefits .
Up with peace .
Up with prosperity .
Up with the Democratic Party .
Up with Obama - Biden . ”
Democrats have been dying for some red meat attacks against the Republicans and Kucinich delivered them by the bushel .
If Democrats wanted to fire up their base , they should have put Kucinich on in prime time .
When given the airtime Dennis often delivers an argument that if full of passion and reminds Democrats about the good that their party is capable of doing .
If Hillary Clinton is able to provide half of the zest that Dennis Kucinich did , she will have had a great night .

The drug violence that has left nearly 4,000 people dead this year in Mexico is spreading deep into the United States , leaving a trail of slayings , kidnappings and other crimes in at least 195 cities as far afield as Atlanta , Boston , Seattle and Honolulu , according to federal authorities .
The involvement of the top four Mexican drug - trafficking organizations in distribution and money - laundering on U.S. soil has brought a war once dismissed as a foreign affair to the doorstep of local communities .
Residents of the quiet Beaver Hills subdivision in Lilburn , Ga. , an Atlanta suburb , awoke to the trans - border crime wave in July , when a brigade of well - armored federal and state police officers surrounded a two - story colonial home at 755 East Fork Shady Drive , ordered neighbors to lock their doors and flushed out three men described as members of a Mexican drug cartel .
One was captured after he tried to slip down a storm drain .
Another was caught in the ivy in Pete Bogerds backyard .
He lives two doors up and is president of the neighborhood association .
 It blew us away ,  Bogerd said .
 I did nt know we had that many cops . 
A short while later , police hauled out a 31 - year - old from the Dominican Republic who for nearly a week had been chained and tortured inside the basement , allegedly for not paying a $ 300,000 drug debt .
In the months after , several dozen suspects have been charged with moving drugs and money for Mexican traffickers through Atlanta , which has emerged as an important hub for thriving narcotics markets in the eastern United States .
Few regions of the nation have been immune  even Anchorage reported activity by the Tijuana drug cartel led by the Arellano Felix family , according to federal law enforcement agencies .
In suburban San Diego , six men believed to be part of a rogue faction of the Arellano Felix organization have been accused in connection with as many as a dozen murders and 20 kidnappings over a three - year span .
Last month , three armed men disguised as police officers broke into a Las Vegas home , tied up a woman and her boyfriend and abducted the womans 6 - year - old boy .
Authorities said the men were tied to a Mexican drug smuggling operation and were trying to recoup proceeds allegedly stolen by the childs grandfather .
The boy , Cole Puffinburger , was found unharmed three days later .
Federal authorities have charged his grandfather , Clemons Fred Tinnemeyer , with racketeering , after he allegedly mailed $ 60,000 , believed to be drug proceeds , from Mississippi to Nevada .
Police continue to search for the kidnappers .
In September , authorities announced that 175 alleged members of Mexicos Gulf cartel had been rounded up across the country and abroad .
Of those , 43 had been active in the Atlanta area , they said .
The arrests were part of Project Reckoning , an 18 - month investigation that tracked criminal activity in the U.S. by the Mexican cartels .
All told , Project Reckoning authorities have arrested 507 people and seized more than $ 60 million in cash , 16,000 kilograms of cocaine , half a ton of methamphetamine , 19 pounds of heroin and 51 pounds of marijuana .
Last month federal authorities in Atlanta announced indictments against 41 people they said were trafficking drugs and laundering money for Mexican cartels .
Among those netted in Operation Pay Cut were a former deputy sheriff from Texas who was stopped on a Georgia highway with nearly $ 1 million in cash in his pickup .
The footprints of Mexican smuggling operations are on all but two states , Vermont and West Virginia , according to federal reports .
Mexican organizations affiliated with the so - called Federation were identified in 82 cities , mostly in the Southwest , according to an April report by the National Drug Intelligence Center , an arm of the Department of Justice .
Elements of the Juarez cartel were identified in at least 44 cities , from West Texas to Minneapolis .
Gulf cartel affiliates were operating in at least 43 cities from South Texas to Buffalo , N.Y .
And the Tijuana cartel , active in at least 20 U.S. cities , is extending its network from San Diego to Seattle and Anchorage .
Many cities showed evidence of multiple cartels , according to the report , which was based on federal , state and local law enforcement reporting .
The extent and depth of cartel activity was not specified , but the Drug Enforcement Administration told Congress two years ago that it believed Mexican - based trafficking organizations now have command and control over the drug trade and are starting to show the hallmarks of organized crime , such as organizing into distinct cells with subordinate cells that operate throughout the United States . 
The Congressional Research Service last year reported that in the U.S. the cartels maintain some level of coordination and cooperation among their various operating areas , moving labor and materials to the various sites , even across the country as needed . 
Chuck Miller , an NDIC spokesman , said it remained difficult to determine why and how the cartels chose specific urban regions .
 It could be one of them may know someone in one part of the country , and have established routes for up there ,  Miller said .
 It could be geographic locations that are operating in Mexico or adjacent to other areas .
Or there could be affiliations with individuals residing in specific locations . 
A rogue operation
In one case in San Diego , a rogue faction of the Arellano Felix operation moved into Southern California in 2002 , and began kidnapping and shaking down people believed to be working as smugglers and launderers for Mexican traffickers .
Court documents show it operated for several years without attracting concerted action from law enforcement , amassing a fortune that helped pay for equipment that included fake badges and police lights and uniforms .
Officers familiar with the case believe the group , known as Los Palillos , or the Toothpicks , killed a dozen people , committed as many as 20 kidnappings and trafficked methamphetamine to Kansas City , Mo. , to finance its war with the cartel in Tijuana  all from a base in San Diego County .
The group was shut down by authorities last year , when one victims family reported the abduction .
Two of six alleged members went on trial last month .
They face charges related to the kidnapping of Eduardo Gonzalez Tostado , the son of an Ensenada banker .
Gonzalez , 32 , lived in Chula Vista and fit the profile of the Palillos prey : a relatively well - to - do Mexican entrepreneur who had taken refuge over the border .
Gonzalez , a well - known champion Baja California desert off - road racer , testified that he owned a car dealership and a trucking firm in Chula Vista and a seafood restaurant in Tijuana .
Defense attorneys , citing transcripts and FBI interviews , alleged that he had been under federal investigation and that he had smuggled drugs for the cartel , according to court documents .
A Times check found no evidence of businesses operating at the addresses listed on licenses .
Gonzalez testified in a San Diego court that he is not associated with the Arellano Felix cartel and had never kidnapped , smuggled drugs or laundered money .
He could not be contacted for comment .
Gonzalez testified that over eight days , he was handcuffed , blindfolded and shocked with a Taser stun gun while his kidnappers negotiated for a million - dollar ransom .
( Agents confiscated a Taser at the house that matched scars on Gonzalezs back , according to court records . )
FBI agents planted an electronic beacon in the ransom money , which led them to the Chula Vista cul - de-sac , where they freed Gonzalez .
The spare tire case
In tiny Pearsall , Texas , just outside San Antonio , a tow - truck driver was abducted and taken across the border last year by thugs allegedly connected to Mexican drug traffickers .
The men reportedly were angered at the disappearance of drug profits they had hidden in a spare tire of a car the driver had towed from an accident on Interstate 35 , the main thoroughfare from San Antonio to the border city of Laredo .
A federal grand jury in San Antonio indicted five men in April in connection with the international kidnapping .
The indictment said the defendants were offered as much as $ 15,000 to bring the driver to Mexico , court records show .
They lured him to Frio County Regional Park in Pearsall by phoning in a fake request for a tow , then bundled him off to Piedras Negras , where he was tortured and interrogated about the missing spare tire  and held for a week , the indictment alleged .
The assailants phoned his boss and threatened to cut the head off of the driver unless the supervisor brought the missing money to Eagle Pass , Texas , across the Rio Grande from Piedras Negras .
U.S. authorities were alerted , and after intense negotiations , the driver was released at the port of entry in Del Rio , Texas , upriver from Eagle Pass .
The five men were arrested and are to stand trial in San Antonio on Monday .
A toast to St. Death
Cartel members also have pleaded guilty in federal court this year as part of a murder - for - hire and kidnapping ring that stretched from the Rio Grande to North Texas .
Several men and two teenage boys on this side of the border were killed as part of a war that pitted the Gulf cartel against the Sinaloa cartel over the lucrative drug trafficking to North Texas and beyond .
Hit men were paid in drugs and cash to help carry out the slayings , according to court documents .
Police in the U.S. learned about the abductions when the parents of the two boys , the youngest 14 years old , reported them missing .
The investigation ended when one of the accused killers , Gabriel Cardona - Ramirez , also known as  Pelon and  Gaby ,  bragged about how the boys were crying when he slashed them to death with a broken bottle , then poured their blood into a cup for a toast .
 Poom !
The little cup [ drink ] !
Poom !
Cardona - Ramirez boasted on a federal wiretap planted at a cartel hide - out on Orange Blossom Loop in Laredo .
His words were translated into English for U.S. court officials .
 I filled it with blood and poom !
I dedicated it to La Santisima Muerte  St. Death .
Here in Georgia , the case of the man held in the basement on East Fork Shady Drive is indicative of how  these traffickers unleash ruthless forms of violence in order to protect and defend their drugs and cash ,  said Rodney G. Benson , DEA special agent - in - charge in Atlanta .
Jay S. Mortenson , also a DEA special agent , said officers surrounded the house after the hostages wife phoned them from Rhode Island .
She said cartel members came up with a ruse to have him bring the title of a newly purchased vehicle to Georgia , and when he arrived in July they abducted him over a $ 300,000 drug debt .
When officers burst inside they found the husband , Oscar Reynoso , in the basement , chained at his ankles .
His mouth was gagged with black tape .
Unbound , Reynoso began talking .
Mortenson said he told officers he delivered the title to the cartel members at a Waffle House restaurant in Duluth , Ga. , and then was driven to East Fork Shady Drive .
Taken into the kitchen , he was surrounded ; one of the assailants pointed him out as  the thief who stole the money . 
Three men who tried to flee the house during the raid face criminal charges in connection with the abduction and extortion scheme .
In addition , Reynoso was charged with distributing cocaine , after he admitted he had dealt drugs and owed the money to the cartel , Mortenson said .
The home at 755 East Fork Shady Drive was vacant because the owners had moved and could not find a buyer .
Today it stands as a reminder to Beaver Hills residents of how far the drug wars in Mexico have come .
 I hope we dont have anything more like this ,  said Barbara Park , who lives across the street in a cul - de-sac .
 It was pretty scary , and we have a nice neighborhood . 

If people do n't buy cars , there is no amount of bailout that will save the millions of US jobs in and related to car manufacturing .
If they 're not making cars , the manufacturers wo n't recall workers or order from their suppliers .
It 's as simple as that .
But there 's a pretty simple solution as well .
The US government should order a complete replacement for its vehicle fleet to be delivered over the next four years .
The new vehicles must be either plugin electric hybrid , pure electric , or possibly natural gas .
Obviously retooling both at the manufacturers and suppliers is required to deliver this order so the government should be willing to prepay a significant part of it as it does for new weapons systems .
That gets money into the system fast and creates / saves jobs almost immediately .
It lets the suppliers retool as well as the final assemblers .
Ideally all auto companies ought to be able to bid .
Maybe we only offer prepayment when there is a certain percentage American content although I hate be even that protectionist .
Certainly the companies with Japanese names that build cars using American labor in the US ought to be on an equal footing with Detroit .
American jobs are American jobs whether unionized or not .
Some infrastructure money needs to go into recharging stations .
Good project to be doing as well .
Also the electric grid needs work .
The objective is not to assure that no auto company goes bankrupt ; the objective IS to keep Americans working on making America a better place .
The manufacturers and their suppliers that win the bids to supply the US government with a green , fuel - efficient fleet , will then be well - positioned and retooled so that they can sell these products to the rest of us and the rest of the world once we start buying cars again .
If we simply shovel money into the weakest companies like Chrysler and GM , we 'll have to also bail out relatively strong Ford to keep it from being disadvantaged .
If we subsidize our car industry , the rest of the world will respond with competitive subsidies .
The net effect will be something less than zero , especially if no one is buying cars .
But , if the rest of the governments emulate us and order new green fleets for themselves , the world 'll be a better place .
Yes We Can is a debate over whether Americans can build cars to meet this goal is here .
A related post suggesting the government put money in the bottom of the car market by buying and junking cars over 10 years is here .
As the vampire flick * Twilight * tops the U.S. charts and opens in Britain , female viewers are swooning over the impossible romance between mortal and immortal .
But many of their male companions will be pondering the age - old question : " Just what kind of hardware do I need to take down that sucker ? "
Exactly how you kill a vampireis the subject of much learned debate .
According to folklore it may require decapitation , burning , or the placing of communion wafer in the mouth .
However , a wooden stake driven through the heart is favored in many Eastern European traditions .
Staking by hand is a perilous business , but maybe all you need are wooden bullets .
Such bullets do exist , and were around during World War II .
Here one soldier describes finding some German bullets :
I found the wooden bullets in this mat on the floor of the foxhole .
The 7 mm slug was bright purple made of some hardwood ... [ It ] was designed to split into splinters and go in every direction as it passes through the body .
It creates a wound that could not be operated on and left the man to slowly die of pain .
But in spite of many gruesome tales like this about both German and Japanese forces , the truth is rather different ; the bullets were actually training rounds .
These days , wooden bullets are used for re-enactments using Gatling guns .
While they could be used to shoot someone — much like the 5.56 mm PVC training ammunition used by the Israelis as a less - lethal weapon for crowd control — they do n't seem very effective .
A load of splinters is no substitute for a stake , and you do n’t want to get this one wrong .
What you need is something a bit more solid , like the original baton rounds made of teak , used by the British in Hong Kong .
( 1958 or 1967 , depending on which source you use . )
A modern version , fired from a 40 mm grenade launcher , spits out three wooden batons —
short cylinders like hockey pucks .
Replace them with a single baton , sharpened to a point , and you have something that might do the job .
( Note : it might be smart to use a multishot grenade launcher like the six - round M32 MGL , as bloodsuckers are fast and might not let you reload if you miss with the first one . )
Or , if you want to go really high - tech , you might work with vampires ' vulnerability to daylight .
Some people assert that this is down to the ultraviolet content ; in which case you might like a ultraviolet laser weapon , such as the Veiling Glare Laser I wrote about awhile back .
When ultraviolet light strikes the it causes the lens to fluoresce , producing a glare right in your eyeball that makes it impossible to see anything .
The idea was that it is safer than other lasers which go through to the retina , and it 's impossible to see the direction of the laser .
( The veiling glare laser has either been canceled or just become secret , it has not been heard of lately . )
Taking this idea even further was a project related to Nanohmic 's electronic flash - bang grenade .
Rather than pyrotechnics , this uses LEDs to produce the flash — an early project involved using UV LEDs to create a veiling glare effects .
Unfortunately the power levels were not high enough .
But it would still be quite a handy anti-vampire weapon .
On the other hand , if it 's brightness , rather than UV , which makes sunshine deadly , then you could arm yourself with a Maxa Beam .
It 's a handheld searchlight , popular with the military , which delivers an impressive 7.5 million candlepower .
That should be enough to vaporize the undead from a few hundred meters away … turning twilight into daylight , so to speak .
Any other suggestions of useful military hardware for vampire - slaying are , as usual , welcome .

The surprise pick represents the addition of yet another heavyweight to the Obama Cabinet .
Rumsfeld critic to head VA
CHICAGO — Retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki will be named as Barack Obama 's Secretary of Veterans ' Affairs Sunday afternoon in Chicago .
The surprise pick adds yet another heavyweight to the Obama cabinet , and also takes a not - so - subtle slap at President Bush 's original national security team .
Advertisement
Shinseki served as Chief of Staff of the Army and retired a four - star general in 2003 .
Like Obama a native of Hawaii , Shinseki served two combat tours in Vietnam , where he earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart .
Shinseki , who is of Japanese ancestry , becomes the first Asian - American in the new Cabinet .
He rose to prominence — and become something of a hero to the anti-war left — after he clashed with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz personally and professionally , especially on the Iraq war .
Shortly before the end of his term as Chief of Staff in 2003 , Shinseki told a congressional committee that post - war Iraq would require hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops .
Both Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz publicly scoffed at the estimate — a rare public rebuff to one of the nation 's most senior generals .
When Shinseki retired , no senior civilians from the Pentagon showed at his ceremony .
Iraq war critics later said it was Shinseki , not Rumsfeld , who turned out to be right about the need for more troops after U.S. forces suffered heavy losses in the post - war insurgency .
In an interview to air tomorrow , Obama praised Shinseki 's judgement on the war .
" He was right , " Obama told NBC's Tom Brokaw in a " Meet the Press " interview taped here Saturday , excerpts of which were released tonight by the network .
Obama also cited his shared his Hawaiian roots with Shinseki .
" I grew up in Hawaii , as he did , " the president - elect noted .
" My grandfather is in the Punch Bowl National Cemetery .
When I reflect on the sacrifices that have been made by our veterans and , I think about how so many veterans around the country are struggling even more than those who have not served — higher unemployment rates , higher homeless rates , higher substance abuse rates , medical care that is inadequate — it breaks my heart , and I think that General Shinseki is exactly the right person who is going to be able to make sure that we honor our troops when they come home . "
Shinseki served on active - duty for 38 years , graduating from West Point in 1965 and rising through the officer ranks until he became Vice Chief of Staff and then ultimately Chief of Staff in 1999 .
Krugman seems particularly proud of a piece he wrote a decade ago .
His new remake , Hangover Theorists , is as wrong now as it was then .
Let 's take a look .
The hangover theory , which I wrote about a decade ago , is still out there .
The basic idea is that a recession , even a depression , is somehow a necessary thing , part of the process of “ adapting the structure of production . ”
We have to get those people who were pounding nails in Nevada into other places and occupation , which is why unemployment has to be high in the housing bubble states for a while .
The trouble with this theory , as I pointed out way back when , is twofold :
1 . It does n’t explain why there is n’t mass unemployment when bubbles are growing as well as shrinking — why did n’t we need high unemployment elsewhere to get those people into the nail - pounding - in - Nevada business ?
2 . It does n’t explain why recessions reduce unemployment across the board , not just in industries that were bloated by a bubble .
One striking fact , which I ’ve already written about , is that the current slump is affecting some non-housing - bubble states as or more severely as the epicenters of the bubble .
Here ’s a convenient table from the BLS , ranking states by the rise in unemployment over the past year .
Unemployment is up everywhere .
And while the centers of the bubble , Florida and California , are high in the rankings , so are Georgia , Alabama , and the Carolinas .
So the liquidationists are still with us .
2 . It does n’t explain why recessions reduce unemployment across the board , not just in industries that were bloated by a bubble .

Ideas So Simple , Only Academic Wonks Cannot Understand
From the " Linux - everywhere " files :
Startup Linux networking vendor Vyatta is set to announce a new hardware appliance on December 9th .
The new device will add more power to Vyatta 's lineup of networking products that they are targetting competitively against Cisco and other proprietary vendors .
The Vyatta 2502 will be a step up from the existing 2501 appliance which only has 512 MB RAM and 80 GB Hard Disk storage .
The new 2502 in contrast will have two 250 GB SATA drives and 1 GB of RAM .
Vyatta is powering the devices with a dual - core 2.2 GHz processor .
Vyatta has been offering a Linux based router software platform since 2006 .
Earlier this year they upgraded their platform to version 4 of their routing platform .
Vyatta Community version 5 is currently in Beta .
Using Linux and open source technology for networking gear is n't a unique proposition .
In fact networking giant Cisco is one of the leading contributors to Linux kernel development ( at least according to a recent Linux Foundation report ) .
Vyatta and its marketing man Dan Roberts however argue that Vyatta offers a better cost proposition .
Cisco is the world 's largest networking vendor for a number of reasons including its large sales force .
I suspect that though Vyatta will make some inroads , Cisco does n't need to be too worried .
Then again the networking equipment market is a massive one and there is certainly room for many players .
As the economy continues to meltdown it sure will be interesting to see how this all plays out .
In this tutorial we will create a cool virtual duct tape effect using the texturizer and layer styles tools .
Step 1
Open a new document in Photoshop , mine is 540 x 300 at 72 ppi .
Create a new layer by pressing the new layer icon at the bottom of the layers palette , it ’s the one next to the little trash can that looks like a piece of paper with a corner folded back .
( * note : If your layers palette is n’t visible , choose Window > Layers from the main menu . )
Double click on the layer name and rename it " Tape " .
Select the Rectangular Marquee tool by pressing the M key , and drag out a nice tape sized selection on the stage .
Step 2
From the Tools bar click on the Foreground Swatch and change the color to # 949494 and click OK .
Now fill the selection you ’ve made with the new gray foreground color by pressing Option - Delete ( PC : Alt - Backspace ) then press Command - D ( PC : Ctrl - D ) to deselect .
Step 3
Next lets add some color variation to the tape by adding some noise .
First press the D key to reset the foreground and background colors to black and white , then choose Filter > Noise > Add Noise from the main menu .
Set the Amount to 6 % and make sure that Uniform and Monochromatic are checked then click OK .
Step 4
Now lets add some texture to the " Tape " layer by selecting Filter > Texture >
Texturizer from the main menu .
This will bring up the Texturizer interface where you will add the following settings : Texture : Canvas , Scaling : 85 % , Relief : 4 and Light to Top Left then click OK .
This effect is a little too harsh however so lets go ahead and choose Edit > Fade Texturizer from the main menu and enter 50 % and click OK .
Step 5
Things are looking good , but we ’re still shy of the duct tape texture we ’re shooting for , so we are going to add a layer style to the " Text " layer by either double clicking to the right of the layer ’s name or by right clicking ( Mac : Control - Click ) on the layer and choose Blending Options which will bring up the Layer Style dialog box .
Click on Bevel and Emboss in the right hand column and enter the following settings then continue to the next step without clicking OK .
Step 6
In the Bevel and Emboss section click on the Texture option .
By clicking on the Pattern area you can bring up the pattern picker , then by clicking on the right facing arrow in the top right corner choose Patterns from the menu , this will add these swatches to the texture picker .
The pattern we ’re looking for is called Tiles - Smooth ( * note : it looks like a grid as shown in the following graphic ) .
Set the Scale to around 15 % and the Depth to +250 , click the Invert checkbox and click OK .
Step 7
With the Lasso tool selected from the Tools bar by pressing the L key , make a selection along the right hand edge of the tape so it looks like it ’s been torn off and press Delete ( PC : Backspace ) , then repeat on the left edge .
( * note : You can use the Burn and Dodge tools from the Tools bar set to a low opacity around 30 % along the torn edges to give the effect of lifting edges . )
Step 8
We all know that tape , especially duct tape never goes down without a few wrinkles and bubbles , so lets make some of those now .
Add a new layer by clicking the New Layer icon at the bottom of the layers palette just like we did before and name it " Bubbles " .
Pull up the Layer Styles dialog by double clicking on the layer thumbnail .
In the Blending Options section change the Opacity to 50 % and the Fill Opacity to 0 % .
Next click on the Bevel and Emboss section and change the Depth value to 140 % and down at the bottom change the Highlight Opacity to 100 % and the Shadow Opacity to 70 % .
When you click OK you will notice that nothing visible has happened to the layer , this is because the layer is still empty so there is nothing for the layer style to effect .
Step 9
With the lasso tool selected by pressing the L key draw the first wrinkle onto the tape then press Command - Delete ( PC : Ctrl - Delete ) to fill the selection with the foreground color which should still be set to black .
( * note : Because we lowered the Fill Opacity in the layer ’s Blending Options to 0 % no color will actually show up here , so all you will see is the Bevel and Emboss effect . )
Step 10
Now go ahead and repeat step 9 until you are happy with your wrinkles and bubbles .
Do n’t worry about letting your wrinkles extend beyond the tape area , we will solve that problem in the next step .
( * note : You could also use a small diameter round brush to draw in your wrinkles and bubbles to add a varied effect . )
Step 11
Lets solve the problem of the extending bubbles by choosing Layer > Create Clipping Mask from the main menu .
By creating a clipping mask we are telling Photoshop to only show the areas of the " Bubble " layer that are overlapping the " Tape " layer .
Step 12
In my final example I added some black text on a new layer above the " Bubbles " layer and changed the layer blend mode to Overlay to get the effect of writing on the tape and a cardboard background .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) The Neem Tree ( Azadirachta indica ) is an incredible plant that has been declared the " Tree of the 21st century " by the United Nations .
Also known as the Margosa and native to the Indian subcontinent , it has been revered for centuries in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine .
Ancient Hindu manuscripts contain chapters on medicinal plants to have near one 's house and the Neem tree is highly recommended .
The seeds , bark and leaves contain compounds with proven antiseptic , antiviral , anti-pyretic , anti-inflammatory , anti-ulcer and anti-fungal uses .
The entire tree can be used medicinally to treat a whole lot of ailments - probably why it is affectionately known as " the village pharmacy " .
Neem is also used cosmetically and in toiletries .
In India , Neem sprigs are boiled , and the water is then used as a hair wash .
Neem hair treatment clears scalp infections and dandruff and stimulates both the growth and texture of the hair and rids the scalp of nits , dry itchy scalp and excessive oiliness .
It is very effective in clearing up fungal infections like athletes foot , ringworm and Candida .
One of it 's most useful properties is its remarkable powers for controlling insects .
The leaves are used in libraries and in government and university documents to protect against insect damage .
The chemical azadirachitin is the main ingredient for fighting insects and pests and has been found to be up to 90 % effective .
This chemical is present in the wood , leaves and seeds and works by disrupting the life cycle of the insect as well as repelling them .
Neem is not an instant killer like we 've become accustomed to with chemical pesticides .
It works differently and more slowly , so some gardeners may question its usefulness .
Neem repells insects and acts as an anti-feedant so an insect would rather starve to death than eat a Neem treated plant .
If they do eat the plant , the Neem acts as a contraceptive and the insects do not mate or lay eggs so their life - cycle is broken .
Insects must feed on plant tissues to be affected so Neem - treated plants are safe for beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies .
Neem oil makes an effective insect repellent for the home .
To get rid of mosquitoes , flies and crawling insects from your house , make a strong tea made by boiling the leaves and twigs for 20 minutes in enough water to cover them ( alternatively use 1 teaspoon pure neem oil to 1 cup of water ) , place in a spray bottle and then spray all around .
Use of Neem in agriculture for pest control could significantly reduce the load of poisonous chemicals in the environment .
There are many cases of toxication by chemical pesticides which cause serious health hazards to farm workers .
Then there 's the negative impact from the chemical pesticides seeping into ground water and being absorbed by the crops for human consumption .
Neem is biodegradable and breaks down easily and quickly , it is also non-toxic to mammals , birds and earthworms .
If you are trying to help stop the destruction to the earth then Neem oil is a good natural pesticide to keep in your garden shed .

RENO , Nev. , Dec. 1 ( UPI ) --
Authorities in Nevada say an increasing number of domestic horses are being abandoned by their owners because of the worsening economy .
The horses are being turned loose to fend for themselves , but lack of survival skills and often end up being killed by predators , hit by cars or dying of starvation , said Darrell Peterson , a brand inspector for the Nevada Department of Agriculture .
Advertisement
Abandoned domestic horses have little chance of being adopted by wild bands of horses and often are attacked by them , said Peterson , noting he has picked up six domestic horses in recent months .
" It 's not very often that you find a domestic that is not being torn up or kicked out of the herd , " Peterson told the Reno ( Nev. ) Gazette - Journal .
Unclaimed domestic horses are sold at livestock auctions and face two options : becoming saddle horses again or being sold to slaughter houses in Mexico or Canada , he said , noting it is illegal to abandon a domestic horse and carries a fine of as much as $ 1,000 .
Creating a rogue CA certificate
We have identified a vulnerability in the Internet Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) used to issue digital certificates for secure websites .
As a proof of concept we executed a practical attack scenario and successfully created a rogue Certification Authority ( CA ) certificate trusted by all common web browsers .
This certificate allows us to impersonate any website on the Internet , including banking and e-commerce sites secured using the HTTPS protocol .
Our attack takes advantage of a weakness in the MD5 cryptographic hash function that allows the construction of different messages with the same MD5 hash .
This is known as an MD5 " collision " .
Previous work on MD5 collisions between 2004 and 2007 showed that the use of this hash function in digital signatures can lead to theoretical attack scenarios .
Our current work proves that at least one attack scenario can be exploited in practice , thus exposing the security infrastructure of the web to realistic threats .
This successful proof of concept shows that the certificate validation performed by browsers can be subverted and malicious attackers might be able to monitor or tamper with data sent to secure websites .
Banking and e-commerce sites are particularly at risk because of the high value of the information secured with HTTPS on those sites .
With a rogue CA certificate , attackers would be able to execute practically undetectable phishing attacks against such sites .
The infrastructure of Certification Authorities is meant to prevent exactly this type of attack .
Our work shows that known weaknesses in the MD5 hash function can be exploited in realistic attack , due to the fact that even after years of warnings about the lack of security of MD5 , some root CAs are still using this broken hash function .

The Forgotten Sidekick
It ’s been a frustrating year for us Sidekick users .
It seems like every television show , periodical , and man in the street is raving about the amazing world - changing capabilities of the iPhone ( and , to a lesser extent , the Google Phone ) .
How having a device that can conveniently surf the Web , answer email , run third - party applications and fit in your pocket is as big a technological breakthrough as hovercars .
Which is infuriating to those of us who have been using a superior device for the past five years .
From the very first demo of the iPhone , it was obvious it was a knockoff of the Sidekick .
The UI demo Steve Jobs did — calling two people and then merging the calls — is the exact same demo I ’d given to all my friends to show off the incredible UI polish and attention to detail by the Sidekick developers .
Sure , there were some differences — most notably that Apple ’s artists had prettied up the iPhone UI as compared to the 8 - bit basement wackos who drew up the Sidekick ’s — but it was clear that this was an evolutionary change , not the revolutionary leap everyone made it out to be .
And , when I bought an iPhone , it became clear it was n’t even an improvement .
The touch - keyboard made it impossible to type anything at length ( I regularly composed whole articles on my Sidekick ) , the lack of multitasking made it impossible to queue up articles in the Web browser and read them on the subway ( I read several books on the Sidekick ) , instant messages were n’t even supported , and the swipe - to - scroll method quickly grew tiresome .
Within a couple weeks , I sold the phone to a friend ( although not before getting an outrageous roaming bill from AT&T because the iPhone could n’t keep its mouth shut ) .
For those two weeks , though , I was repeatedly stopped and gawked at by well - dressed people in airports and trains .
They all wanted to know “ Is that the iPhone ? ” and “ How is it ? ”
By contrast , those people , when they saw me using the Sidekick , assumed it was a videogame device .
But it was n’t as if the Sidekick was unheard of .
As soon as I wandered out of the land of white folks in suits - and - ties , black and latino kids would rush up to me and gab about the Sidekick .
During one trip , a latina middle - schooler stopped me on the sidewalk and asked if I ’d gotten the latest firmware update yet .
“ It has JavaScript support ! ” she enthused .
Browsing the Sidekick user forums bore this out — it was all black and latino schoolchildren .
But , of course , neither minorities nor schoolchildren rule the world , so the Sidekick has been written out of history .
2007 was the first time anyone had thought to give a smartphone a decent UI , or a web browser , or an over - the - air application store .
Well , at least it was the first time anyone thought to tell white people .

Alan , a Ugandan orphan of the HIV / AIDS epidemic ravaging Africa , is attending school at the Nyaka AIDS Orphan School in Michigan .
EAST LANSING , Mich . —
Alan has an almost cherubic face , but like any
13 - year - old , there is an impish twinkle in his eyes .
His throaty
laughter and smile are nearly constant as he sits eating a Cobb salad .
It is difficult to tell that he has endured more tragedy in his short
life than most Americans can dream of .
Alan is an orphan of the HIV / AIDS epidemic that is ravaging Africa .
In his native Uganda , he is considered an orphan because his father
died .
On top of dealing with the stigma of having a father who died as
a result of HIV , he is also suffering from cerebral palsy , which leaves
him unable to walk , and has the tendons in his right hand strung so
tight he ca n’t use his thumb .
He is in Michigan as a guest of his school , the Nyaka AIDS Orphan School ,
to receive surgery in hopes of gaining some use of his right hand .
The
surgery is only the latest benefit the teenager is getting from his
five - year relationship with the school in Uganda .
Nyaka , which operates out of Michigan , has been offering primary
education to “ the most at - need ” youth since 2001 and was authorized by
the Ugandan government in 2003 .
The average class size is 32 , whereas
the average class size for public schools in Uganda is 60 to 120 .
The
students get hours of instruction in math , English and other basic
subjects , as well as free breakfast and lunch .

“ Most of our students are orphans from HIV and AIDS , ” said Chris Singer , communications manager for Nyaka .
“ A lot of our kids live with host families we have identified or
grandmothers or family .
We have almost 300 children and only five are
[ HIV ] positive . ”
The school focuses on HIV / AIDS prevention efforts .
The school ’s choir goes out and sings and puts on skits about HIV .
“ The skits are amazing because they are so in your face .
It ’s very
different than here , ” Singer said .
“ There they have billboards all over
the place . …
“ There are lot of men who prey on young girls , and they call them
sugar daddies , ” said Singer .
“ And they have billboards that say ‘ No
Sugar Daddies . ’”
The messaging from the youth and the government is working .
New
cases are declining , Singer said , noting that the HIV infection rate
has gone from 18 percent to seven percent .
He said this is because the
government uses so - called ABC ’s education on HIV prevention —
Abstinence , Be Faithful and Condoms .
Although it is working , the program limits the country ’s access to
U.S. funds because it is not abstinence - only education .
Nonetheless the
program ’s success has made Uganda a model for fighting HIV , even
without U.S. resources .
“ This disease is a litmus test for our society , and we are failing , ” Singer said .
He says he sees a different response for his work in Africa than he
does for his service as a board member on the Lansing Area AIDS Network
( LAAN ) .
“ I work for this school in Uganda and I get all this attention about how great it is .
Why does n’t LAAN get that attention ? ”
Stigma around the disease remains as dangerous in Africa as it does in the U.S. , Singer added .
Alan said before he began attending Nyaka , he was teased for being
in a wheelchair and for being an AIDS orphan , but not anymore .
Going to
school with others impacted by HIV has helped him connect .
Singer said he thinks it is time for American HIV / AIDS service organizations to work together .
“ I think we can all work together for the same thing , ” Singer said .
“ What bothers me is that there is stigma surrounding it from all
sides .
We all want the same thing .
I do n’t think the kids there are any
more deserving than the kids here …
It is the biggest global injustice
going around .
No matter what side you are on , if you fit in one of
those areas you are suffering from the injustice .
We still have a large
population infected here and nobody cares . ”
This past Friday the L.A .
Zoo unveiled its newest little baby koala .
While this fuzzy little friend was actually born in April , at that time it was only three - fourths of an inch long and immediately climbed into mom 's pouch .
Called a joey , this little boy or girl has been in the pouch ever since .
That is , until last week !
These are the first pics of the little guy out of the pouch with mom .
Baby Koala Debuts at the L.A. ZOO
The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens will unveil the newest member of the Zoo ’s koala family on Friday , December 12 , 2008 at 9:30 a.m. Born on April 3 , 2008 , the newborn koala spent six months developing in the mother ’s pouch .
Baby koalas are commonly referred to as joeys .
When a koala is born , it is just three - fourths of an inch long .
After birth they climb into the mother ’s pouch and stay there for six months .
For the following six months , they are weaned from milk to eucalyptus as they stick their heads out of the pouch to eat partially digested leaves .
After a year , they leave the pouch for good .
Although they are often referred to as a “ koala bear , ” koalas belong to the marsupial family .
Marsupials are mammals whose females typically rear their young in a pouch through early infancy .
Other members of the marsupial family are kangaroos , wallabies , wallaroos , wombats and opossums .
Native to Australia , koalas have a very low metabolic rate requiring them to conserve energy and to sleep between 18 and 20 hours a day .
They spend about three of their five active hours eating a diet that consists entirely of eucalyptus leaves .
Koalas consume 2 ½ pounds of leaves per day and rarely drink water due to the moisture found in eucalyptus leaves .
Take advantage of a great deal to come see the koalas ; now through the first of the year , one child is admitted free with a paid adult !
So parents can bring their children to the Los Angeles Zoo to see the koalas and pay a visit to Santa ’s reindeer while they ’re here !

DECEMBER 4-- This is the Texas home that George W. Bush has purchased for his fast - approaching post - White House years .
The home , on a Dallas cul - de- sac , sits on 1.13 acres and offers 8501 square feet of living space , according to city appraisal records .
The property was purchased for $ 3.07 million in early - October by Robert McCleskey , the president 's accountant , who is listed as trustee on deed records .
Built in 1959 , the home has been improved with a detached garage ( 1150 square feet ) , servants quarters ( 896 square feet ) , and a storage building ( 240 square feet ) .
While the Bush property certainly appears comfortable , it is dwarfed by the 20 - acre estate it abuts .
That sprawling property ( seen here ) is owned by billionaire investor Tom Hicks , who , in 1998 , purchased the Texas Rangers from a partnership in which Bush held a stake ( the deal netted the future president about $ 15 million ) .
Hicks , 62 , was a leading supporter of Rudolph Giuliani 's presidential bid and hosted a fundraiser last year at his home -- reportedly the largest in Dallas - - for the former New York City mayor .

New research shows getting too little vitamin D increases the risk of heart disease and linked to other , well - known heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure , obesity , and diabetes .
Several large studies have shown that people with low vitamin D levels were twice as likely to have a heart attack , stroke , or other heart - related event .
Traditionally associated with bone and muscle weakness , but in recent years a number of studies have shown that low levels of the vitamin may predispose the body to high blood pressure , congestive heart failure , and chronic blood vessel inflammation .
Most of the body 's vitamin D requirements are met by the skin in response to sun exposure .
Other less potent sources of vitamin D include foods such as salmon , sardines , cod liver oil , and vitamin D - fortified foods like milk and some cereals .
Vitamin D can also be obtained through supplements .
However , most people never get enough from the sun and do n’t eat foods high in vitamn D .
So make sure to you find out what your vitamin D levels are and take supplements if needed .
Vitamin D levels can be measured with a blood test that looks at a specific form of vitamin D called 25 - hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) .
The current recommended daily allowance for vitamin D is 200 IU per day but research explains you need to take between 1000 and 2000 IU per day .
This is easy to do , just but vitamin D supplements that are 1000 IU and take two per day .
One in the morning and another at dinner .
Make sure to get Vitamin D3 which is shown to result in longer - lasting effects .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government ’s $ 700 billion bailout fund is unlikely to be enough , with the financial system needing more than $ 1 trillion to get through the crisis , two of Wall Street ’s top dealmakers said on Wednesday .
The global crisis appears to have passed its most intense phase , seen around the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK in September , but financial institutions still face losses in the fourth quarter and early next year as the economy and credit quality deteriorate , said Gary Parr , deputy chairman of investment bank Lazard Ltd LAZ.N .
Parr was speaking on a panel along with H. Rodgin Cohen , chairman of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell , at The Deal ’s M&A Outlook 2009 conference in New York .
“ You saw the problems of the financial services industry start to play over into the broader economy , ” Cohen said .
“ Now , we are going to see the reverse trend , with the broader problems in the broader economy moving back into the financial services industry . ”
Parr said the financial system had run out of a cushion to deal with further losses .
“ The government ’s $ 700 ( billion ) is not enough .
It ’s going to be over a trillion , ” he said .
“ It has to come from somewhere .
And indeed in the last three months around the world , the primary source of capital for the financial services industry was the government . ”
Cohen added that private equity could be another potential source of capital -- although relatively smaller -- for the sector , but an unwillingness to change the approach to letting that happen had held buyout shops back .
“ It is a source of frustration to a number of people , including me , that we ca n’t get it right so that private equity can really be a major investor in financial services companies , particularly depositories , ” Cohen said .
The U.S. Federal Reserve recently relaxed bank ownership rules but private equity executives have said it did not go far enough .
Parr and Cohen , both veteran dealmakers in the financial sector , were involved in several major financial institutions deals during the crisis -- including the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 's 8306.T investment in Morgan Stanley MS.N .
Cohen said that among the developments of the last few months , the failure of Lehman was “ of all the events , probably the single most significant . ”
“ This was the first time all creditors were going to be at risk in any financial services company , ” Cohen said .
FIGHT ANOTHER DAY
Parr said , “ We may have crossed the inflection point of the most intense crisis . ”
But he warned of more losses to come .
“ Inevitably there will be losses in the financial services sector for the next couple of quarters , ” he said .
Cohen said the crisis was likely to lead toward a single regulator , as there is an effort to ensure financial institutions that compete with regulated entities are also regulated .
The U.S. Federal Reserve is that logical regulator , he said .
Over the coming months , the priority of financial institutions should be to start working through some issues , such as finding ways of funding , recapitalization and strengthening balance sheets , Parr said .
“ I frankly do n’t think strategic positioning is the priority for major financial institutions , ” Parr said .
“ The priority of the next 12 - 18 months is to live to fight another day . ”
“ The Pareto principle … states that , for many events , roughly 80 % of the effects come from 20 % of the causes . ”
– Pareto Principle
While this makes a great sound bite , it ’s hard to pin down exactly where the Pareto Principle should be applied – and where it should n’t .
The definition is loose enough ( “ for many events ” ) that it can be – and frequently is - applied to whatever situation a writer or speaker desires .
As with many “ facts ” , it ’s easy for “ experts ” to trot it out as common knowledge , without providing any demonstration of how it relates to the case under discussion .
If you ’re trying to streamline your work - day and boost your income , you might have come across authors telling you “ facts ” like these :
20 % of your clients pay 80 % of your income .
20 % of your output produces 80 % of your income .
20 % of your time produces 80 % of your income .
Whenever you see the Pareto principle cited , ask yourself “ Is this true ? ” I ’d argue that , “ for many events ” , it just is n’t – do n’t believe everything you read .
Examine your own history of similar situations to see if the 80/20 rule is contradicted by your experience – in my freelance work , I ’ve often seen instances where the Pareto principle does n’t hold .
I ’ll give you the figures for each of these three claims in turn , so you can see how the clients / output / time to income ratio works for me .
80 % of income from 20 % of clients ?
In my freelance writing , I currently have the following clients :
Client A pays me $ 420 / month ( blog )
Client B pays me $ 400 / month ( blog )
Client C pays me $ 80 / month ( blog )
Client D pays me $ 40 / month ( blog )
Client E pays me $ 284 / month ( magazine article )
Total monthly income from freelance writing : approx $ 1,224 .
So , does the Pareto principle hold true for my freelance writing ?
Does 80 % of my income come from 20 % of my clients ?
There are indeed 3 main clients out of the 5 which make up 90 % of my income from freelance writing , and just based on this information , we might conclude that we see the Pareto principle at work here .
If we accept the advice that we should focus our efforts on the clients that provide the most income and fire the rest , it may appear that I should focus my efforts on clients A , B and E and fire C and D .
This analysis however misses some important details : client C and D require me to produce less , take up correspondingly less time , and may be in a position to take extra work from me in future .
Dropping the two of them because some expert told me “ the Pareto principle says so ” would be a bad idea , and close the door on potential future income .
It is possible , however , that even if Pareto should n’t be applied on a client level , perhaps some of the freelance work I do is more lucrative than the rest .
80 % of income from 20 % of output ?
If I divide up my monthly writing income by what I ’m paid per piece , the figures also appear , at first , to come close to fitting the 80/20 rule :
My four blog clients pay an average of $ 40 per article , and I ’m writing a total of 23 blog articles per month .
I do have one “ big ” client , though , where my pay per article is seven times my average pay for a regular blog article : my magazine client , who pays $ 284 per article .
This means that 5 % of my writing outputs produces 23 % of my income .
This definitely comes closer to what the Pareto principle predicts – especially as many people say that the 80/20 figures can be adjusted to suit .
The easy conclusion to draw from this analysis is if I could write five magazine articles per month , I could replace my other income streams entirely .
But now , I have n’t taken into account the fact that the magazine article takes at least four times as long to research and write as a blog article .
Nor have I accounted for the time spent in acquiring new magazine clients ( I sent out a lot of queries a month or two ago , and did n’t manage to get a single article commission ) .
Why chase new clients you ask , why not just write more articles for the client you already have ?
My current magazine client does n’t want five times as many articles from me .
Pareto might hold true on the surface , but looking at just the outputs ignores the time factor : how long I spend researching and writing each piece , how long I spend on administration , and the amount of time required to acquire the client .
It further ignores market considerations ( how many articles I can sell to one publication ) .
As the above discussion shows , just looking at outputs is misleading because such an analysis ignores the amount of time spent to produce each output .
This then leads to the following question – if we are saying the Pareto principle is misapplied when judging solely by the quantity of writing outputs produced , does it hold for time to produce those outputs instead ?
80 % of income from 20 % of time ?
So perhaps I should be looking at whether I can produce 80 % of my income in just 20 % of my working day .
Is 80 % of my time wasted , and does the other 20 % of my time produce most of my income ?
Unfortunately , the answer here is again a clear “ no ” .
I kept a detailed time log for a couple of weeks last month , and found that I averaged :
40 minutes to write a post ( pay varies slightly from $ 35 to $ 50 per post , but the time spent varied correspondingly )
5 - 10 minutes to edit each post
5 - 20 minutes to format , upload and “ administrate ” each post ( includes tasks like HTML code , finding images , answering comments , emails )
The figures were fairly consistent across the different blogs , and though some activities do not directly produce income ( such as answering comments ) , I consider them a part of the job of producing a blog post , and further recognize that good communication with a blog editor and readers is a point in my favor when an editor is considering keeping me on .
Of course , some of my day was spent in activities like checking and answering emails and reading RSS feeds , but these sorts of tasks typically take up 20 – 30 % of my work day – not 80 % .
On the whole , based on these three examples , the Pareto principle does not hold true , in any meaningful way , for my freelancing .
Why Pareto Does n’t Work For Effective People
The Pareto principle often gets cited as a convenient shorthand for cutting down on time - wasting activity , spending , or unproven marketing , and for focusing on what ’s truly important .
This is good advice , but it does n’t need to be tied to particular numbers .
It ’s also not very useful if you ’re already working effectively .
For example , if you ’ve outsourced your time - consuming administrative tasks in order to focus on what you can excel at , then you ’ll probably find that 20 % of your work time produces 20 % of your income and 80 % of your work time produces 80 % of your income … which you ca n’t improve on !
In cases when a system ( and that system could just be “ you going about your workday ” ) is working effectively , it could be actively harmful to start trying to obsessively tweak it .
If you start searching for that mythical 20 % that should be delivering 80 % of your results , then you might find yourself cutting out activities which are actually essential to your success .
Some of these may seem insignificant if you ’re just looking at how much money is coming in , but are important in the long - term :
Effective support for customers – it may cost you time / money but builds up repeat business and good word - of - mouth marketing .
Good support will help to keep your churn rate down and avoid losing customers .
– it may cost you time / money but builds up repeat business and good word - of - mouth marketing .
Good support will help to keep your churn rate down and avoid customers .
Taking the time to be friendly and helpful towards clients – maybe sending holiday or birthday greetings , forwarding them articles they would find interesting , and providing a professional opinion when asked .
In situations where a client can choose from multiple equally competent service providers , this sort of relationship often makes the difference .
– maybe sending holiday or birthday greetings , forwarding them articles they would find interesting , and providing a professional opinion when asked .
In situations where a client can choose from multiple equally competent service providers , this sort of relationship often makes the difference .
Reading journals , books , blogs and articles in your niche .
While such metawork should not be used as an excuse to avoid real work ( such as writing articles ) , to stay on top in your profession you ’ll need to keep up with the direction the field is taking , and continuously honing your skills .
I ’m sure you can think of dozens more examples .
In certain cases , it ’s very hard to pin down exactly which actions may result in a sale , a new client , or a “ eureka ” moment down the road – so do n’t become focused on optimizing everything at all costs .
[ reddit-me ]
Rather than using the Pareto principle as a hard - and - fast rule , use it as a reminder to take stock once in a while .
Look at what you ’re doing over the course of a day – keeping a time log can help you to do this accurately – and consider where your time is being spent ineffectively .
Your Experience With the Pareto Principle
Do you have a great example of the Pareto principle in action , in your own life or business ?
Did you really discover that 20 % of your clients provided 80 % of your income ?
Or do you find in certain situations you are working effectively enough that Pareto does n’t apply ?

Ed Witten has been called “ the most brilliant physicist of his generation . ”
Some , not content with this accolade , have compared him to Isaac Newton .
Witten is a deeply original and committed theoretical physicist whose primary field of research is string theory , which proposes a “ theory of everything ” wherein the building blocks of the universe are curves , or “ strings , ” formed into loops .
He has been one of the field ’s foremost proponents and most prolific contributors , once telling an interviewer , “ It was very clear that if I did n’t spend my life concentrating on string theory , I would simply be missing my life ’s calling . ”
Witten ’s work has been especially distinguished in its use of advanced mathematics to achieve the kind of unified field theory of the universe that was Einstein ’s dream .
An appreciation by John H. Schwarz , Harold Brown Professor of Theoretical Physics , Caltech
Edward Witten , an extraordinarily creative and dedicated scientist , has had a profound impact on the development of theoretical physics and mathematics for the past 30 years .
He is far and away the most cited and influential contemporary theoretical physicist .
Ever since string theory took off in the mid-1980s , Witten has been a leading figure in its development .
His crucial discoveries include many of the “ dualities ’ ’ that gave rise to the “ second superstring revolution ’’ in the mid-1990s .
String theory requires a great deal of cutting - edge mathematics .
Witten is the leader in using physics insights to advance fundamental mathematics , and vice versa .
In 1987 Michael Green and I coauthored a monograph entitled “ Superstring Theory ’’ with Witten .
We were thrilled that Witten agreed to join us , since we knew that his contributions would greatly improve the final product .
This work , consisting of more than 1,000 pages packed with equations , was completed in nine months .
For Green and me this required dedicating 100 - hour workweeks to the project .
Witten , on the other hand , was able to do his share while completing several major research projects at the same time .
Witten is both deep and fast :
After thinking through the ideas , he can compose an essentially error - free 100 - page manuscript , often describing breakthrough original research , on his computer in a day .
His papers and lectures set a new standard for clarity of exposition .
And he shows no signs of slowing down .
Meet The Men Who Caused the Crash !
Alan Greenspan
Former chairman of The Fed ( Federal Reserve ) from 1987 to the end of 2006 , he was previously referred to as “ The Maestro ” .
So , people used to think he was awesome , but these days he ’s even being singled out as one of those chiefly responsible for the economic crisis , yet he himself protests that he is blameless .
Nevertheless , it was Greenspan that was an important figure in terms of how the economy went ( or was supposed to go ) and he was in charge when things looked like they might turn out the way they did .
Some call him a liar and Greenspan himself has commented that there were flaws in his market ideology .
But the problems with crises such as these is that no one person can shoulder all of the blame for such goings wrong and Greenspan – for better or for worse – has been fingered as one of the culprits behind the problems , as he was in a position of authority and did n’t do enough to prevent it .
Phil Gramm
There are some economists that lay claim that this man ( who was responsible for spearheading the 1999 Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act which was signed by Bill Clinton ) , is responsible for having “ deregulated ” the financial services industry , leading to the subprime mortgage crisis , which is n’t something to be proud of .
Gramm has also been labeled as being “ the single most important reason ” for the financial crisis by a former lawyer for the SEC .
Franklin Raines
Previously the boss of the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) , was another of those responsible for diving into the subprime mortgage market , although not until 2004 , but the damage was still there to be done to the economy .
In the end , it worked out well for him , as he left with a reported $ 240 million in benefits .
However , Raines was then subsequently asked to return some of it , possibly because he could n’t carry it all .
Adam Applegarth
The CEO of Northern Rock from 2001 until the end of 2007 .
It was he who commandeered the bank when it was to become the fifth largest provider of mortgages in Britain ; he then drew significant attention when he subsequently asked for a loan from the Bank of England , which resulted in many , many worried savers queuing up at the bank to withdraw their money , as they feared for its safety .
This was the first time this had ever happened in the UK .
For his “ troubles ” , Applegarth left the bank , but not before receiving a payoff that equates to roughly $ 1.15 million dollars ( £ 760,000 ) .
Charles Prince
Former CEO of Citigroup , Charles “ Chuck ” Prince was responsible for managing the bank ’s foray into subprime mortgages .
However , towards the end of 2007 , when he saw that the good times were coming to an end , Chuck took the hefty burden of resigning all by himself .
Of course , for the effort this took him , he walked away with a $ 38 million payoff in bonuses , shares and the like .
Man runs bank into ground .
Man leaves bank whilst simultaneously rewarding himself millions .
No wonder he was " still dancing " even after the music ended .
Stanley O’Neal
Former boss of bosses at Merrill Lynch , technically ruined the business to the tune of losses of $ 8 billion .
Even a founder ’s son laid the blame squarely on old Stan ’s shoulders .
Stan then announces his retirement , with a compensation package worth $ 161.5 .
It must be nice to run a bank into a wall for fun , all the time playing golf , knowing that you ’d leave with financial security .
You
Naturally , the general public through which all this disappearing money circulates , is to share some of the blame .
Average people , borrowing far beyond their means , some as much as 10 times their salaries are to blame for contributing to the overwhelming tide of debt that ’s sweeping over every which way .
Mortgages brokers even assigned an acronym to these people that they relentlessly lent money to ; people with “ no income , no job , no assets ” were called “ ninjas ” .
The reason the majority of us in the US and the UK are feeling more of the brunt of financial trauma rather than , say , France , Spain or the most of mainland Europe , is because the European Central bank runs a much tighter policy when it comes to monetary matters .
Far tighter than The Fed or the Bank of England , at least .
There ’s also a difference in cultural dispositions when it comes to buying or renting houses .
The people contributing to the financial crisis are those with a disposition to buy ( resulting in mortgages and debt far beyond their ability to pay off ) , whereas those in other countries are more disposed towards renting , thereby keeping financials more readily under control .

Starting a Django Conventions Project and Reference¶
During the last month I have proposed some conventions for Django , mostly in the realm of templates .
In doing so I have looked around for other documented places where conventions are mentioned .
I have n’t found a really good reference for Django conventions .
Brian ’s post was a good example of reusable app conventions , and the Pinax Project is a great reference implementation .
However , I could n’t find any simple reference for regularly used conventions in the Django world .
I do n’t know if this will be useful for people , but I think this goes along the whole convention / pattern ideal .
If we all use a common naming , syntax , and style in places where they can be arbitrary , then we gain a lot of value of being able to understand whats going on in others code .
So I have started a project that hopefully will act as a reference for Django Conventions .
Currently it is pretty sparse , but I think that having that document in any form is a great step .
I ’d love to hear some feedback , and it needs a lot of work , so feel free to email me or leave comments here with your additions and criticisms .
If this idea becomes useful , I would be fully in support of including it in the Django Documentation or something along those lines as well , but I do n’t know how “ official ” this will really be .
For the moment just consider it my hair brained idea of how things should be done :)

Exactly three years ago , November 12 , 2005 , Torrent Freak first saw the light of day .
Since then we have published 1,788 articles , while our readers wrote 88,987 comments .
It 's been a great ride so far , thanks to all of you ...
When the first article was published on TorrentFreak , I never imagined that the blog would be where it is right now .
One of the main purposes of TorrentFreak has always been to cover file - sharing news from the perspective of file - sharers , often to counter the misleading messages that are put into this world by anti-piracy lobbyists .
Initially , I started to write up a few ‘ tips and tricks ’ type articles , complemented by the occasional news item .
Right from the start , Torrent Freak got some decent traffic thanks to the community on Digg.com , which was a real motivator to continue blogging .
Over time , Torrent Freak developed into a more serious news outlet , more and more articles were unique and the quality of writing improved .
As the popularity of BitTorrent grew , so did Torrent Freak ’s traffic , and with that came the opportunity to meet some great characters , including most of the people who run the BitTorrent sites I love to write about .
A few months after TorrentFreak was born , I became we .
Smaran was the first writer to join the blog , and although he stopped contributing in 2006 , he played his part in the evolution of TorrentFreak .
Running a blog like TorrentFreak is an impossible talk for one person , and I was more than happy when Enigmax ( Andy ) joined me in early 2006 .
For almost two years now , Enigmax and I have been running the daily operations at TorrentFreak , and together we spend most of our free time writing articles .
Unlike some people think , TorrentFreak is not a professional operation , that is , Enigmax and I both have full - time jobs aside .
TorrentFreak is a hobby project , and we write because we are passionate about BitTorrent and file - sharing , not because we need to , in a job sense .
Although we would love to , it would be impossible to mention everyone who has contributed to TorrentFreak .
We ’ve had several guest writers and received thousands of tips from readers – they have all contributed to the site in some way or another .
Besides Enigmax and myself , Ben Jones is the third regular on TorrentFreak .
Although he prefers to do research instead of writing , his contributions ca n’t be missed .
At Torrent Freak we do n’t see ourselves as journalists .
We are P2P enthusiasts , who love to document how the Internet , and BitTorrent in particular , is changing how we interact with online media .
We also write extensively on how the world , and the law , reacts to this ( re) evolution .
We write about things that interest us , and hope that others are interested in them too .
We write because it ’s our passion .
Cnet UK did a piece on us today , and Nate Lanxon sums us up nicely : “ The rise of blogging has been fueled less by money , and more by the desire to write about subjects people truly care about .
And in the world of news , that often means writing at ungodly hours , for ungodly hours on end . ”
Of course , we wo n’t stop here and we hope to bring you many more articles in the future .
Even though our time is limited , we aim to publish at least one article each and every day .
In a way our limited time is also a quality check .
It ’s not that hard to publish 4 or 5 articles a day , but if you only have time for one , you ’ll have to make sure it ’s unique , and worth it .
Of course we are always open to contributions from readers , or aspiring bloggers who want to help out .
We have some pretty exciting plans for the future which we will will announce soon , and a redesign is being worked on as well .
Writing for TorrentFreak has been a a great endeavor thus far , most of all thanks to you , our readers
We ’re here to stay , and hope the next three years will be as much fun as the first .

Hitler was the perfect boss : Former maid breaks her silence on the ' charming ' dictator
History has condemned him as the megalomaniac who brought death and misery to millions .
But for one woman , the name Adolf Hitler evokes a smile not a shudder .
She is Rosa Mitterer , who worked as a maid for the Fuhrer at his mountain retreat in Bavaria in the 1930s .
Rosa is 91 and until now has kept a vow of silence about her experiences .
She has chosen to break it after realising she is the last survivor of the circle who served the tyrant in the years before he launched the Second World War .
91 - year - old Rosa Mitterer is the sole survivor of those who served Adolf Hitler in the years before the Second World War
And her verdict on her former master : ' He was a charming man , someone who was only ever nice to me , a great boss to work for .
You can say what you like , but he was a good man to us . '
Rosa 's remembrances of life at the court of the tyrant make gripping reading .
She saw leading Nazis come and go .
Himmler , the evil party secretary ; Bormann , whom she described as a ' dirty pig ' ; and the club - footed , sexually - obsessed propaganda minister Goebbels .
Rosa went into Hitler 's service at the age of 15 in 1932 when she was Rosa Krautenbacher .
Her sister Anni had worked as a cook at Hitler 's Berchtesgaden retreat since the late 1920s .
' She said he needed a housemaid and I would fit the bill , ' Rosa recalled .
' I remember so clearly the first day I spoke to him in the kitchen .
I said I was Anni's sister and that made him smile , because Anni was his favourite .
I only ever knew Hitler as a kindly man who was good to me . '
A photo taken at Rosa 's sister 's wedding , which Hitler attended
His former housekeeper was Geli Raubal , with whom it was rumoured he had a love affair .
' She shot herself in September 1931 and I was told as soon as I went to work for him that he was not to be approached on the anniversary of that day , ' said Rosa .
' My sister and I shared a room that was directly over Hitler 's .
We could hear him crying .'
For a long time she and Anni were the only servants in the home , known as Berghof .
Recalling her first direct request from her master , she said she was drying some porcelain cups when he came down the stairs .
' Hello , ' he said softly .
' Sorry to trouble you , but could you make me some coffee and bring some gingerbread biscuits to my study ? '
Coming into such close proximity to Hitler made her feel faint , she said , but she soon became accustomed to life at Berghof .
' I rose at 6 am every day and put on a red - green dirndl with a white apron .
My first task was to feed his dogs - he had three German shepherds at the beginning called Wolf , Muck and Blondi .
Charmer : Adolf Hitler , ' the perfect boss '
' In those days , Hitler slept in his study .
In it was an iron bed , one wardrobe , one table , two chairs and a shoebox .
It was very modestly furnished .
Beside the bed hung a picture of his mother .'
She added : ' I did n't have to be a Nazi party member or anything .
After a while I relaxed a bit .
Apparently it was Hitler 's orders that Anni and I be taken to church every Sunday because he thought this would be " good for us " .
' Another time he came into the kitchen , saw me and said , " Ahh , I see our little one has grown a little plumper ! " .'
Part of her duties involved sorting out the fan letters and presents that were delivered in their thousands to the house .
' There were cigars , jars of jam , flowers , pictures , ' she recalled .
' We gave most of them away to poorer peasant families nearby on Hitler 's orders . '
Her time in service also allowed her to see at close quarters the woman Hitler kept secret from his people throughout his rule - Eva Braun .
' She was not so pretty close up , ' Rosa recalled .
' Himmler was always there too , thinner than what he looked like in the photos , and Goebbels .
' And Bormann , I did n't like him at all .
He was a dirty pig . '
By the end of 1934 , the house was surrounded by minefields and SS checkpoints .
Rosa said .
' I felt like a prisoner instead of an employee . '
In 1935 she fell in love with local businessman Josef Amorts and handed in her notice .
She was told she could leave immediately ..
' I only met Hitler once more , on December 10 , 1936 , when Anni married Herbert Doehring , manager of the Berghof .
He came to the wedding and was nice to me , saying he missed me . '
Rosa married in 1939 and had three daughters .
She later remarried .
A great - grandmother , she now lives in Munich .
After the war she had to confront the reality of the man for whom she had worked so willingly .
And in particular the reality of the Holocaust .
' That he had ordered such terrible things , I just could n't believe it , ' she said .
' Even now , I prefer to remember the charming facets of his personality . '

I 'm on my way to MN to experience the love of the most kind hearted human who is looking for a loyal companion with more love to offer than anyone could ever imagine .
My life was turned upside down until 11/12/08 when MARS saved me in the nick of time .
I was recently stuck in a shelter on death row for 10 days in Florida .
I ended up there all because I saved the life of a woman and her two year old son !
They were approached by a man threatening their lives at knife point while they were leaving a play ground .
I happened to walk right in to this dangerous crime scene , while I was taking a stroll through the neighborhood without my parents .
I knew that I had to act quickly and protect them so I charged toward him with all my might yelling at him in my scariest voice and he took off the other direction .
I was afraid that he was going to hurt them so I did what any guy would do witnessing that kind of a dangerous situation .
I was so proud of myself for doing such a good deed , everyone kept telling me how good of a boy I was for springing into action it felt amazing to be so appreciated by everyone who surrounded me at that moment .
After the coward ran away I jumped in the back seat of her car and waited for the police to come and make sure this woman and her little boy were going to be safe .
Then instead of her taking me home with her , she sent me with animal control .
I could not believe it I was stuck in jail for being a hero , this was really confusing because I thought only bad guys go to jail not hero's .
The lady I protected told the police that if my owners never came back to claim me that she would adopt me herself , but I never saw her again .
I thought she would keep her word and she failed me , I was so crushed by her false promises to me .
She even told the police that she felt like I was her guardian angel .
Once again I was confused by this as well because angels are supposed to be special right ?
In North Korea , The Punishment is Always Death
There are very few positive things one can say about the North Korean communist regime .
For years they have lashed out at their neighbors , openly defied any request made of them , and worst of all they basically imprisoned all of their people with the fear of death .
Shin Dong Hyuk , who grew up in one of North Korea ’s worst prison camps , is one of the few have have broken North Korean law and lived to tell of it .
The interview Shin Dong Hyuk gave upon successfully escaping the prison camp is truly chilling and one of the darkest looks into North Korea I have ever read .
The one thing that is a constant through everything you will read about North Korea , is that the punishment for breaking any rule , is almost always death .
“ Resistance is simply unthinkable . ”
Here are the 10 rules of the prison camp , as translated from Shin Dong Hyuk :
Camp Rules : The 10 Commandments
1 . Do not attempt to escape .
The punishment is death .
2 . Never gather in groups of over three people or move around without the guard ’s authorization .
The punishment for unauthorized movement is death .
3 . Do not steal .
If one steals or possesses weapons , the punishment is death .
The punishment for failure to report the theft or possession of weapons is death .
4 . Obey your guards .
If one rebels or hits a guard , the punishment is death .
5 . If you see outsiders , or suspicious - looking people , report them immediately .
The punishment for abetting in the hiding of outsiders is death .
6 . Keep an eye on your fellow prisoners and report inappropriate behavior without delay .
One should criticize others for inappropriate behavior , and also conduct thorough self - criticism in revolutionary ideology class .
7. Fulfill your assigned duties .
The punishment for rebelling against one ’s duties is death .
8. Men and women may not be together outside the workplace .
The punishment for unauthorized physical contact between a man and a woman is death .
9. Admit and confess your wrongdoings .
The punishment for disobedience and refusal to repent is death .
10 .
The punishment for violating camp laws and rules is death .
Google actually hosted an education conversation about North Korea that included Shin Dong Hyuk .
It is very long , but really worth the watch .
You can jump to around 20 minutes to get right to the interview with Shin .
( Youtube has been acting up so you can view the video on Youtube if it says unavailable above . )
The sadest part is around 26 minutes when they ask him to talk about his torture .
So painful is the memory he cannot openly speak about it without reading it from his own writings .

Demonstrators signed petitions calling for a referendum on independence
Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in the Basque region of Spain , demanding the right to a referendum on independence .
The regional government had originally planned to hold a vote on Saturday , but the proposal was declared illegal by Spain 's Supreme Court .
Organisers say 20,000 people joined rallies in six Basque towns .
In another sign of protest against the court 's ruling , there were explosions at two Basque railway stations .
The governing Basque Nationalist Party had hoped to consult the electorate on Saturday on negotiations towards a full referendum on independence within two years .
But last month , Spain 's Supreme Court declared the plan unconstitutional .
During Saturday 's march , police had to separate Basque nationalist demonstrators from a rival rally by a far - right party - which proclaimed that Spain would never be divided .
Overnight , there was a very different protest in the form of explosions at two Basque railway stations .
Petrol bombs
Shortly after midnight , a small bomb brought down the ceiling of a ticket hall in the town of Berriz .
Two hours later , petrol bombs were hurled at ticket machines in the nearby town of Amorebieta .
There were no injuries .
Speaking at the EU - Asia summit in Beijing , the Spanish Prime Minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , condemned the attacks and said terrorists would be punished .
Police are investigating whether the bombings were the work of the armed separatist group ETA or young nationalist sympathisers .
Mr Zapatero has portrayed the proposed referendum as political manoeuvring ahead of regional elections next March .
But in a newspaper interview , the head of the regional government - Juan Jose Ibarretxe - said Madrid had shown an arrogant disregard for the rights of the Basque people .
Robert Mugabe has said the West was plotting to use cholera to invade
The cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe which has left hundreds dead was caused by the UK , an ally of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said .
Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu described the outbreak as a " genocidal onslaught on the people of Zimbabwe by the British " .
On Thursday , Mr Mugabe said the spread of cholera had been halted .
But aid workers warned that the situation was worsening and the outbreak could last for months .
In his comments to media in Harare , Mr Ndlovu likened the appearance of cholera in Zimbabwe to a " serious biological chemical weapon " used by the British .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Mugabe has already accused Western powers of plotting to use cholera as an excuse to invade and overthrow him .
Earlier on Friday a senior South African Anglican bishop said that Mr Mugabe should be seen as a " 21st Century Hitler " .
Bishop of Pretoria Joe Seoka called on churches to pray for his removal , the South African Press Association reports .
His comments came as the US ambassador to Zimbabwe warned that the country was turning into a " failed state " .
We need to commit ourselves to assist the refugees from Zimbabwe ... remembering that the one we call our Lord and Saviour was a refugee in Egypt , fleeing the Mugabe of that period , King Herod
Bishop Joe Seoka
Zimbabwe cholera is over - Mugabe Africa press split on ousting Mugabe Failing Zimbabwe : Special report The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) says the outbreak has not been contained and the death toll has increased to some 792 people , the AFP news agency reports .
The WHO has warned that the total number of cases could reach 60,000 unless the epidemic was stopped .
US ambassador James McGee blamed the outbreak on Zimbabwe 's political crisis and the failed economic policies of its government .
He told reporters in Washington that hospitals in Harare remained closed , there was no rubbish collection and people were drinking from sewers .
See detailed map of cholera - affected areas " The situation is truly grim .
One man and his cronies - Robert Mugabe - are holding this country hostage , " Mr McGee said , AP news agency reports .
Bishop Seoka said that Mr Mugabe was a " person seemingly without conscience or remorse , and a murderer " .
Cholera has spread because of Zimbabwe 's failing health system " I believe it is now an opportune moment for all the church leaders to follow the retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Archbishop of York , Dr John Sentamu , to call on God to cause the removal Mugabe from the office of the President of Zimbabwe , " he said , calling for the prayers to be held next Tuesday .
" The church in South Africa has done this before with the apartheid regime and there is no doubt that God will hear our prayers even today . "
Several African and Western leaders have recently said it was time for Mr Mugabe to step down .
Kenya's Prime Minister Raila Odinga said African countries should force him from power .
But the African Union has rejected such calls , saying a solution to Zimbabwe 's problems must come from the power - sharing talks .
Bishop Seoka asked South Africans to show patience to Zimbabweans who have fled their homeland .
An estimated three million Zimbabweans are living in South Africa , and thousands cross over the border illegally every day .
More recently , hundreds have sought medical treatment because Zimbabwe 's health service and water supply infrastructure have virtually collapsed .

• If you dont want too much competition from other SEOs , choose your keywords precisely .
For example , Instead of keyowrd Loan choose keywords like Bank Loan , Equity Loan , Student Loan , Home Loan etc .
Order of keyword also matter for search engines .
Search engine treats Loan Equity and Equity Loan as different keywords .
• Best seo practice is to get at least one of your primary keywords in domain or sub domain name of your website .
You can use hyphens ( - ) to separate multiple keywords .
For example : seo-service , seo - guidelines , free - seo each cover two keyords .
• Get your second or third keywords in your directory name and filename .
For example http://www.hiddentricks.com/seo/free-tips.html is best for keyword ?
free seo tips ? , ? seo hidden tricks ?
or " free seo tricks "
• Keep your webpage free from any syntax error , declare document type at the beginning and validate your HTML and CSS because search engine don?t like pages with too many errors .
• Give a short Title in of your page in 3 - 9 words ( 60 - 80 characters ) maximum in length containing your primary keyword .
Remember it will be displayed in search results so choose wisely .
• Try to include your most important keyword phrases in heading tags on your page if you can but keep in mind it should not be exactly same as title of your page .
You can use ( H1 H2 H3 ) tag for specifying anything important .
To reduce size of heading use CSS .
• Specify Meta keywords in heading of document .
Limit it to 15 to 20 words .
Although not all the search engines give importance but there is no harm doing it .
Search engine like Yahoo still give it importance .
• Write Your Meta Description tag attractive containing keywords because it will appear on the search engine result pages .
• Use text for navigation menu instead of using images or Java scripts .
• Try to include your most important keyword in hyperlinked text and text and text that immediately precedes or follows the hyperlink .
Do not use same keyword always use synonyms at few places .
Jusk like instead of seo , I have use search engine optimization at many places on this page .
The flash diet : Taking photos of meals helps slimmers lose weight
Flash diet : A study found people who kept a photographic record of everything they ate lost weight
You 've heard of the crash diet - now here comes the flash diet .
A study has shown that slimmers who take photographs of their meals stick more carefully to their diet than others .
By having pictorial evidence of how they have been feeding themselves , dieters have a guilt trip about the quality and quantity of what they are eating .
These photo diaries also make it easy to keep a tab on the number of calories consumed , scientists say .
Many food experts argue that food diaries - where daily consumption is recorded in a notebook - help to stop overeating and snacking .
They are thought to work by shaming the dieting diarist into eating less .
However , keeping the diary is a time - consuming chore many put off until hours after eating .
Now a team of American scientists have compared traditional food diaries with snapshots .
They asked 43 dieters to record what they ate over one week in words and in pictures , New Scientist magazine reports today .
When the researchers quizzed the volunteers , the photo diaries were a far more effective and accurate record of daily calories and a far more powerful disincentive to overeat .
One volunteer told the researchers : ' I had to think more carefully about what I was going to eat because I had to take a picture of it .
' I was less likely to have a jumbo bag of M&Ms .
It curbed my choices .
It did n't alter them completely but who wants to take a photo of a jumbo bag of M&Ms ? '
Another volunteer said the photo diaries actually improved the quality of his diet .
' I noticed that there were n't too many greens in my diet , which means I should try to eat more vegetables and fruits . '
By contrast , the written diaries were usually completed long after each meal and did not provide as powerful a reminder of the size and quality of meals and snacks .
' Overall , the participants demonstrated greater awareness of their diet when viewing the photographs than when reflecting on their written notes , ' the researchers said .
Dr Lydia Zepeda , who led the study at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , said : ' Nutritionists see diaries as recording tools .
Now they should explore the role of photo diaries as intervention tools . '
During the study , the volunteers used disposable cameras .
But the researchers , who published their findings in the International Journal of Consumer Studies , said digital cameras would give more immediate results .
They added that since digital cameras are a feature on most mobile phones , this method of recording a diet is even more accessible .
Past studies have shown that dieters who make a note of what they eat lose three times as much weight as those who simply try to eat more healthily .
In one study at the University of Pennsylvania , dieters were given a weight - loss plan , told to exercise for 30 minutes every day and monitored for a year .
Those who kept a faithful note lost around 16lb to 18lb .
But those who did not keep a diary lost only 6 lb on average .
The UK is suffering from an obesity epidemic , with the most overweight population in Europe .
Almost a quarter of British adults are classed as obese .
If the trend continues , it is thought a third of adults and a fifth of children will be obese by 2010 .
The problem , anyway , is n't the cost of credit but the availability .
Credit wo n't become more available until the banks trust each other and the inter - bank market reboots .
That wo n't happen until the banks are forced to reveal their potential sub - prime losses – as this column has often argued .
Lower rates just delay that " day of reckoning " – by giving the banks more hope they can get away without " full disclosure " .
Let me paint a picture for you — there ’s a young developer , sitting in his parents ’ basement , hacking away at his latest masterpiece .
He has built it from scratch and is proud of how he ’s handled the backend to frontend integration .
Sitting back in his chair , he smiles and prepares his application to be deployed to the world ; two hundred files , for a simple forum .
Obviously , something just is n’t right here .
There ’s something that was missing in his development process that you just ca n’t get if you ’re going it alone .
The PHP manual is great for finding out the order of arguments for function calls , but it ’s not the best when you need tips on the best way to handle things .
Rewind back to the beginning of the project and let ’s envision the same scenario with one additional key element : the PHP community .
If you look beyond the surface , you ’ll see this diverse group of people populating most of the major PHP resources out there .
All our lone developer would have to do to see some of the errors of his ways is to simply ask , in an online forum , about a design decision that has stumped him .
He ’d get feedback from other developers all around the world .
IRC channels are a great place to seek advice or some real - time troubleshooting with other developers .
Lots of people are more than happy to offer advice on application design , which is something our isolated developer could have used .
The community does n’t stop in forums and chat rooms , though .
Once our friend has found out why having thirty include files in each page is a bad idea , he has a nugget of knowledge that he can turn around and share with others .
Taking in ideas and information from the PHP community is great , but what can really help you flourish and thrive is giving back .
You ’re not only helping someone else , but you might also learn something new in the process .
Every developer has things they specialize in , certain technologies that they have some additional experience in , and being there to help with those bits of knowledge at the right place and right time can make things a lot easier for someone who is just now getting there .
The more you interact , the more you get to know people around you and around the world .
You ’ll form new relationships , and you might even be able to meet up with your new friends at local user groups or at conferences ( which attract people from all over the world ) .
Having these communities around you can provide a valuable asset , not just in your development work , but also in your every day learning and growth .
Sure , sitting around talking about code at a user group meeting is fun , but there ’s only so much of that kind of fun to go around .
The real community building happens in the after - hours stuff .
Getting the whole group out for beers and maybe some pool helps people loosen up and share more of themselves , and can drop some of the stuffy atmosphere that can be present at formal group meetings .
Want to be able to give back in a way that ’s a bit more permanent but still personal at the same time ?
Start up a blog and stick with it .
Some PHP developers use their blogs to make announcements about releases for software they ’re working on , and others use them to talk about hidden gems they ’ve discovered along the way to help other developers .
Either way , blogging can provide a window into you and your development that other PHP developers can follow .
They can get to know you through your posts and mark you down as a resource to approach when they need help .
Blogging also lets you reach out to the community , ask for ideas and suggestions , and offer up some of your own in the process .
Some developers have even used their blogs to respond to articles on other sites that might be spreading misinformation .
So , what ’s the fate of our lonely developer hacking away on his application , now with the support of the community ?
The possibility of an improved application that adheres to best practices , is leaner and cleaner , and properly supports PHP 5 .
The moral ?
Do n’t develop in the dark ; get out there and meet people .
Programming is not just about how many lines you ’ve written and what sort of fun tricks you ’ve managed to employ .
It ’s about getting out there and sharing with fellow developers and making the connections and friendships that could save you down the line .
" It is important that the fire service attracts more women and ethnic minorities so that it can work more effectively in partnership with local authorities and other organisations to meet the needs of local people . "
I thought this product was amusing .
It 's a cane that has a button on top that extends a stabber meant to chip ice ... but of course it could be used for other things ...
I think Gregory House from House ( TV show for those of you living in a cave ) would be cool with this .
If you click on the " show store " button you will see a cool video on using canes in martial arts .
Additionally here is some VERY cool technology from www.toldya.com

FICTION
DANGEROUS LAUGHTER
Thirteen Stories
By Steven Millhauser .
Alfred A. Knopf , $ 24 .
In his first collection in five years , a master fabulist in the tradition of Poe and Nabo­kov invents spookily plausible parallel universes in which the deepest human emotions and yearnings are transformed into their monstrous opposites .
Millhauser is especially attuned to the purgatory of adolescence .
In the title story , teenagers attend sinister “ laugh parties ” ; in another , a mysteriously afflicted girl hides in the darkness of her attic bedroom .
Time and again these parables revive the possibility that “ under this world there is another , waiting to be born . ” ( Excerpt )
A MERCY
By Toni Morrison .
Alfred A. Knopf , $ 23.95 .
The fate of a slave child abandoned by her mother animates this allusive novel — part Faulknerian puzzle , part dream - song — about orphaned women who form an eccentric household in late - 17th - century America .
Morrison ’s farmers and rum traders , masters and slaves , indentured whites and captive Native Americans live side by side , often in violent conflict , in a lawless , ripe American Eden that is both a haven and a prison — an emerging nation whose identity is rooted equally in Old World superstitions and New World appetites and fears .
( First Chapter )
NETHERLAND
By Joseph O’Neill .
Pantheon Books , $ 23.95 .
O’Neill ’s seductive ode to New York — a city that even in bad times stubbornly clings to its belief “ in its salvific worth ” — is narrated by a Dutch financier whose privileged Manhattan existence is upended by the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
When his wife departs for London with their small son , he stays behind , finding camaraderie in the unexpectedly buoyant world of immigrant cricket players , most of them West Indians and South Asians , including an entrepreneur with Gatsby - size aspirations .

In the race to make the lithium - ion batteries that will run the electric cars of the future , the United States is losing to Asian countries , and start - ups and big companies need to band together to build a lithium - ion battery industry in the United States , says Jim Greenberger .
Mr. Greenberger , a lawyer specializing in clean technology , organized a new alliance of lithium - ion battery makers made up of 14 big companies , like 3 M , and start - ups , like ActaCell .
“ The great age of automobiles lies ahead of us , not behind us , ” said Mr. Greenberger , who heads the clean - tech practice at the law firm Reed Smith and advises clean - technology venture capital firms and start - ups .
The group , called the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture , took a page from the chip industry ’s playbook .
It is modeled after Sematech , which in the 1980s raised $ 990 million in federal grants and private investment to keep semiconductor manufacturing in the United States .
The alliance plans to introduce a proposal in Congress in January to raise $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion for lithium - ion battery manufacturing in the United States .
The ultimate goal , according to Mr. Greenberger : “ We ’re going to start to be able to manufacture cars in the United States again , on a basis that ’s competitive with the Asians . ”
Lithium-ion batteries , besides eliminating the need for petroleum , are three times as efficient as internal combustion engines in typical cars , Mr. Greenberger said .
Furthermore , they can be charged by alternative sources of energy like wind or solar .
Several large companies , including General Electric and Sanyo , which was just bought by Panasonic , have been working on lithium - ion batteries .
Many start - up companies have recently emerged , too , including Imara , which we wrote about last week .
The future of these batteries will depend on start - ups “ because it ’s a start - up industry , ” Mr. Greenberger said .
“ We are five years behind Asians in our ability to manufacture the cells . ”
The United States has the technology to develop lithium - ion batteries , he said .
The two biggest challenges the industry faces , though , are building prototypes to simulate new batteries and then building the factories required to manufacture the batteries .
“ We ’re really good on theory and basic science , ” he said .
“ It ’s putting that theory into production where we ’re falling down . ”
One reason is that no major United States auto manufacturer is yet buying lithium - ion batteries for electric cars , so there is not enough money to build prototypes and factories .
Yet car manufacturing will eventually move where the batteries are made , he said .
“ If we ’re dependent on Asia , transportation and even defense will gravitate there . ”
The initiative will require United States companies to shift their individualistic way of thinking and could fail if certain companies try to strike out on their own and raise money from their state representatives instead of going after a pool of government money for all lithium - ion battery makers , Mr. Greenberger warned .
“ We ’re trying through the alliance to come up with a way and mechanism to work on an industrywide basis rather than everyone off for themselves , ” he said .
Otherwise , each company “ will be crushed in turn by the Panasonics of the world . ”
A new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California shows that the ballot measure banning gay marriage in California received its strongest support from Republicans and evangelical Christians .
The poll was taken after the Nov. 4 elections and found that despite the heated debate over Prop. 8 , opinions in California about gay marriage have not changed very much .
" When voters are asked the separate question of whether they favor or oppose same - sex marriage , they are divided , with 47 percent in favor , 48 percent opposed , and 5 percent unsure , " according to the PPIC poll results statement .
" [ It 's ] a result consistent with responses in the October PPIC preelection survey . "
The PPIC survey , which received funding from the James Irvine Foundation , polled 2,003 California voters , who were contacted by phone November 5 – 16 , 2008 .
The poll has a margin of error of 2 % , perhaps more for subgroups surveyed .
Among the findings :
-- Evangelical or born - again Christians ( 85 % ) were far more likely than others ( 42 % ) to vote yes .
-- Three in four Republicans ( 77 % ) voted yes , two in three Democrats ( 65 % ) voted no , and independents were more closely divided ( 52 % yes , 48 % no ) .
-- Voters without a college degree ( 62 % ) were far more likely than college graduates ( 43 % ) to vote yes .
While there has been much made about the strong support for Prop. 8 among African Americans , the sample size for blacks was too small in this poll to report separately .

“ We want to tell children , ‘ You ’ve got a difference , but not a disease , ’ ” he said .
“ Michael Phelps is one of any thousands of examples of mega- successful people , C.E.O.s and brain surgeons and famous writers , inventors and entrepreneurs , who have A.D.H.D. ”
Other experts , however , say that while such success stories can be inspiring , parents need to know that their children face real risks .
Research shows that children with attention deficit have different brain patterns from other children , and that they are more likely to drop out of school , be involved in car accidents and use illicit drugs .
“ This reframing A.D.H.D. as a gift , personally I do n’t think it ’s helpful , ” said Natalie Knochenhauer , founder of A.D.H.D. Aware , an advocacy group in Doylestown , Pa .
“ You ca n’t have a disability that needs to be accommodated in the classroom , and also have this special gift .
There are a lot of people out there  not only do their kids not have gifts , but their kids are really struggling . ”
Ms. Knochenhauer , who has four children with the disorder , says they too were inspired by the astonishing performance of Mr. Phelps in Beijing .
But she added , “ I would argue that Michael Phelps is a great swimmer with A.D.H.D. , but he ’s not a great swimmer because he has A.D.H.D. ”
Dr. Koplewicz , of N.Y.U. , agreed .
“ There are lots of children in the world who have chronic illnesses or disorders like diabetes , allergies or dyslexia who accomplish great things in spite of the fact that they have these disorders , ” he said .
“ I worry when we say A.D.H.D. is a gift , that this minimizes how real it is . ”
Michael Phelps ’s mother , Deborah Phelps , says she has spoken openly about her son ’s diagnosis because she wants other parents to seek out resources and support .
Her son stopped taking A.D.H.D. medication at age 10 .
But today , Ms. Phelps is a national spokeswoman for McNeil Pediatrics , which makes the attention - deficit drug Concerta .
( Dr. Hallowell and Ms. Knochenhauer have also consulted for McNeil ; Dr. Koplewicz has no industry ties . )

WASHINGTON , Dec. 15 ( UPI ) --
The giant German electronics producer Siemens AG was fined a record $ 450 million Monday after pleading guilty to U.S. bribery charges , federal officials said .
Matthew Friedrich , acting assistant U.S. attorney general who announced the fine , said Siemens and three subsidiaries admitted they violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act , which makes it illegal to bribe a foreign official to get business .
Advertisement
" From the 1990s through 2007 , Siemens engaged in a systematic and
widespread effort to make and to hide hundreds of millions of dollars
in bribe payments across the globe , " Friedrich said at a news conference in Washington .
" These efforts by Siemens executives included using off - the - books slush fund accounts and shell companies to facilitate bribes ; making false entries on the company 's books and records by , for example , falsely recording bribes as consulting fees ; by accumulating profit reserves as a liability on company books and then using these funds to facilitate bribe payments .
" More than $ 800 million in bribes were paid by Siemens and various of its entities over the course of 2001 to 2007 . "
In return for the illegal payments , Friedrich said , Siemens received billions of dollars ' worth of government contracts .
The Justice Department official cited contracts with Venezuela , Bangladesh and Argentina as examples .
Siemens pleaded guilty to one count and the three subsidiaries also entered guilty pleas .
In addition to the fines , Siemens will retain an independent monitor for a period of four years and will continue to implement enhanced controls .
" These penalties are strong medicine , " Friedrich said , " but they are commensurate with the conduct at issue here , which can only be described as egregious . "
Interview Questions : Two Bowling Balls
This post is the first in a series I 'm calling " interview questions , " where I discuss interview questions I 've been handed in my time out here in the Bay Area .
Since I 'm an engineer by trade most of the questions relate directly to technical topics .
I 'll also cover general interview strategies and advice — probably by serving myself up as an example of what not to do in an interview .
I know people keep a repertoire of interview questions at hand , so I 'm not going to name names when discussing the questions .
Anyhow , let 's get started !
The Question
You 're standing in front of a 100 story building with two identical bowling balls .
You 've been tasked with testing the bowling balls ' resilience .
The building has a stairwell with a window at each story from which you can ( conveniently ) drop bowling balls .
To test the bowling balls you need to find the first floor at which they break .
It might be the 100th floor or it might be the 50th floor , but if it breaks somewhere in the middle you know it will break at every floor above .
Devise an algorithm which guarantees you 'll find the first floor at which one of your bowling balls will break .
You 're graded on your algorithm 's worst - case running time .
Warning : Stop reading here if you 're not interested in seeing any of my solutions !
A Few Preliminaries
The original problem stated that the building had 100 floors , but it may as well have N floors .
Using N rather than 100 will make it easier to quantify the performance of the algorithm , so that 's what I 'm going to do .
Solution 1 : The Naïve Solution
Ok , there 's one blindingly obvious solution : take one of the bowling balls and drop it from every floor , starting from the first .
At worst this will take N tries , where N is the number of stories on the building .
Interview Advice : :
In an actual interview situation do n't be afraid to say the obvious solution , even if you know there 's a better one .
Problem solving is iterative and your answer should be , too .
Solution 2 : Two Bowling Balls
We know the first solution is probably sub-optimal because it does n't make use of both bowling balls .
To give us some ideas let 's just pick a floor , say the 50th floor , and drop one of the balls — we has nothing to lose since we know we can do it with only one .
If our building is 100 floors and we dropped one of the balls from the 50th floor one of two thing will happen : the ball will either break or it wo n't .
If it breaks then we know the floor we 're looking for is somewhere between floors 1 - 49 .
If it does n't then we know it 's somewhere between floors 51 - 100 .
In either case we 've halved the size of the search space and now need at most N/2 ( or 50 ) tries .
But 50 was arbitrary .
What about other numbers ?
What happens if we drop the ball on the third floor ?
If it breaks then we can use the second ball to test floors 1 - 2 , taking at most 3 tries .
If it does n't break then we try the same experiment again , dropping the ball from another floor .
Here 's one possible strategy : pick a number S and call it the skip number .
We drop one ball every S floors until it breaks on the kth try .
We then use the second ball to try every floor between floors ( k - 1 ) * S and k*S .
As an example , let N=100 and S=4 .
We 'd try floors 4,8,12,16 , ... with one bowling ball until it breaks .
Let 's say it breaks on the 60th floor .
Since it did n't break on the 56th floor we know the culprit is somewhere on floor 57 , 58 , 59 , and we can use the second ball to test those floor one at a time using the naÃ¯ve strategy .
What is the best skip size ?
Obviously S=100 is n't ideal since that is equivalent to the naÃ¯ve strategy , as is S=1 .
But we know both S=50 and S=4 are better , so there must be an optimal strategy somewhere between .
To find this strategy let L( S ) be the number of drops requires in the worst - case scenario for a skip number of S .
If you work it out you 'll get
We want to minimize this function .
Bringing back our high school calculus , the derivative of L( S ) is
Setting the derivative equal to zero implies
For N=100 this gives an optima skip of S=10 .
If N is n't a perfect square you 'll have to work out which skip gives the " correct " solution .
Solution 3 : You can do better ...
At this point in the interview you 're probably pretty happy with yourself .
The above took you a few minutes to work out , perhaps with some prodding by the interviewer .
But then you hear that dreaded question , " Can you do any better ? "
The interviewer is n't a jackass , though , and gives you a hint .
He points out that it seems like we should be able to find a solution that works equally well irrespective of where the bad floor is .
That is , it should take the same number of turns if its on the 100th floor as it would if it were on a lower floor .
We have a baseline for ourselves .
For N=100 and S=10 we know we can do it in at most 19 turns .
This can act as a sort of counter — if we beat this number at every step we 've come up with a strictly better algorithm .
So , at every step , we want to be able to find the floor in question in no more than 18 steps .
Let 's start by dropping the first ball on the 18th floor .
If it breaks we can test floors 1 - 17 with the second ball , taking at most 18 turns .
If it does n't break , we 've used up one of our turns , leaving us with 17 turns left .
So , the next floor we should test is 18+17 , or the 35th floor .
If it breaks we can test floors 19 - 35 , taking at most 18 turns .
We can continue this way , shrinking the step size by one each time .
Now we know we can do it in at least 18 steps .
But why not 17 ?
If we repeat the above steps , starting with a counter of 17 rather than 18 , we get an algorithm that takes at most 16 steps .
Then , using 16 as a counter , we get an algorithm that takes at most 15 steps .
We can't do this forever , since there 's no possible algorithm that takes at most one step .
So where is the end of the line ?
The problem is that for this algorithm to work the first ball needs to be able to skip one fewer each time and still cover all 100 floors .
If we set our counter to C that means we must have 1+2 +...+C > 100 .
Here 's the math :
Using the quadratic formula to find the exact solution and then taking into account the fact that we want an integer solution gives
as the worst possible case for our third strategy .
L( 100 ) = 14 , which checks out .
That 's the best solution I know , and it was the best solution the interviewer knew , too .
Can you do any better ?
After The Interview
This was one of a few questions I was asked by one of four interviewers .
I worked through the problem above , basically as it was written out , albeit with more digressions .
How did the interview wind up going ?
I was n't offered a job .
At least I got a good interview question out of it , though .
Airbrushing , the process of manipulating a photograph to hide flaws and create a better image , is nothing new .
In fact , photo manipulation has been around for a long time .
One of the earliest manipulated photos is a famous image of President Lincoln — in reality , a composite of Lincoln ’s head on another politician ’s body .
Politicians always have interfered with images , wielding their power to rewrite history , purge opponents from pictures and promote their own agenda .
How funny that today it ’s used to make stars flawless , more glamorous , thinner and less like us ( i.e. , human ) .
Airbrushing has gone from the crude use of the digital wand — with images like that of Oprah in 1989 ’s TV Guide when her head was fused with another actress ’s body ( available at the same site as the Lincoln photo ) — to a more sophisticated , though not always subtle art of trimming waistlines , enhancing body parts and removing wrinkles and blemishes , among other “ improvements . ”
Even though all images are airbrushed to some extent , some are manipulated more dramatically than others .
Take Jessica Simpson on the cover of this September ’s Elle , whose hips were , unfortunately and not so subtly , chopped off .
Several weeks ago , December ’s Vanity Fair featured a racy spread with Kate Winslet and received some flak when the photos were suspected of extensive airbrushing .
Some publications even had retouching experts play detectives — picking apart the photos to identify specific touch - ups .
Even though Winslet ’s rep denied everything but minor , standard retouching to her face , in The First Post , one airbrushing specialist listed a litany of touch - ups done to her entire face and body .
Last week , the latest Parade magazine cover also was criticized for alleged airbrushing .
The Daily Mail declared , “ Surely there ’s no denying Kate Winslet ’s been airbrushed for THIS magazine cover ! ” also writing that she had “ fallen victim to a heavy - handed airbrush . ”
Today , it appears , more and more starlets are becoming victims of heavy - handed airbrushing .
In fact , I ’d be shocked to see a photo that was n’t retouched .
Even feel - good magazines like Redbook — whose tag line is “ Love Your Life ” and whose target audience consists mainly of mature married women — observe the art of airbrushing .
Below are the original and retouched photos of Faith Hill .
Magazines that target a younger , more impressionable demographic also employ airbrushing .
Several months ago , Seventeen thinned the face of Gossip Girl actress Blake Lively , who barely resembles herself on the cover .
She appropriately wears Hollywood ’s signature hollow cheeks , slightly sunken - in eyes and svelte face .
Why this photo required so much airbrushing is puzzling .
Is it really necessary to airbrush the covers of magazines geared toward tweens and teens ?
For the most part , adult women are aware that magazines are airbrushed ( though sometimes it ’s ambiguous what changes were made ) but that does n’t stop us from feeling bad or trying to aspire to these images .
What happens to kids when they view these covers ?
One columnist believes airbrushing is what separates celebs from mere mortals like us .
She explains that with Botox and breast implants  once reserved for the rich and famous  coming into the mainstream , stars have nothing but airbrushing to lift them well above the masses .
“ Extreme airbrushing is just a way to create more distance between themselves and a public for whom getting Botox or a breast enlargement is no longer a biggie . ”
Whatever the magazines ’ motives for airbrushing — satisfying demanding publicists , advertisers or their own vision — the reality is that retouching is here to stay and many of us still buy ( and buy into ) these magazines .
As a long - time subscriber of Marie Claire and YM before that , I used to get so excited waiting for my subscriptions to arrive in the mail so I could gobble up every page .
But after spending years reading recycled articles on diet , weight - loss and workouts and seeing flawless photos in magazines that purport to make us feel great about ourselves , I let my subscriptions run out .
If the goal of magazines is to serve us , the readers , why are n’t they trying to do a better job of it ?
Oftentimes , magazines defend their retouching decisions by saying that these airbrushed photos are just images or fantasy , but I ’m not sure why family - friendly Redbook and geared - toward - young - readers Seventeen need to feign perfection when they ’re promoting loving your life .
Presumably , it ’s tough to love your life when magazines are selling perfection and pushing a standard that does n’t even exist .
But should we really be up in arms about airbrushed photos or just accept it , roll our eyes and move on ?
After all , it ’s so commonplace today that we can even do it with the click of a mouse on our personal computers .
In a society where we ’re constantly working on our weight , distressed about going to holiday parties because we fear that we ’ll feast on everything in sight , aspiring to look forever - young , allowing our daughters to get nipped and tucked and seeing thongs and other inappropriate clothing marketed to young girls , I ’m not so sure that a fake photo is that harmless .
Research already has found that sexualized images of girls and young women in advertising , merchandise and media can have damaging effects .
Simply scroll through scores of MySpace accounts showcasing young teens in provocative photos , and you ’ll see the effects of magazine images .
An airbrushed picture is n’t to blame for all of society ’s woes , but by lying and deceiving the public it certainly adds fuel to an already - raging fire .
The Art of Airbrushing
Judge Elizabeth Halverson permanently removed from bench
The Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline issued an order today that permanently removes Judge Elizabeth Halverson from the bench .
Judge Halverson was suspended from the bench in July 2007 .
She lost a recent bid for re-election in the August primary election .
She faced a disciplinary hearing in August on charges of misconduct .
After two weeks of hearings in August , the commission heard a dozen complaints , including that the judge was accused of sleeping on the bench and treating her staff like servants .
“ Some judges are in office for an entire career and do not accumulate the type of dismal professional history that the record in this case establishes , ” said the commission , in an order signed by its chairman Greg Ferraro .
The commission found her guilty on counts of sleeping during hearings , making improper contact with jurors ; mistreating her staff , improperly hiring two bodyguards and making improper and misleading statements to the press .
The commission said there was sufficient evidence to show Halverson slept during portions of two criminal and one civil trial .
“ What makes this series of three occasions more serious is that Judge Halverson fell asleep in front of juries who were already empanelled for trial under her supervision and she did so within months of taking office , not years after having presided over hundreds of trials , ” said the commission .
And the 28 - page decision said Halverson did not take any steps to cure the problem .
Halverson , elected in 2006 , was cleared on eight counts .
The commission said a judge should never have contact with a jury , especially a deliberating jury except through limited exception .
The first instance was not willful but a result of her inexperience .
The second contact was willful .
“ Eating or chatting with a deliberating jury and answering their law - related and case - related questions … is so fundamentally wrong that even a first - year law clerk should know better …. ” the commission said .
What makes this egregious is that the judge shifted the blame to attorneys “ by making unethical contact with the media , ” the decision said .
Halverson removed bailiff Johnnie Jordan Jr. , and brought in two individuals who were unlicensed to serve as bodyguards .
The commission found there was no reason for Halverson to hire two men when all the other judges in the district only had a bailiff .
The commission said , “ She willfully and foolishly utilized the power of her office to actively undermine wholly valid and unburdensome security measures … ”
Halverson mistreated her staff , berated them with foul language and required her bailiff to massage her feet , neck and shoulders .
In April 2007 , Chief Judge Kathy Hardcastle called a meeting to talk about complaints being made by the staff of Halverson .
There were three other judges present including Judge Stewart Bell .
The commission found that Halverson went to the newspapers and made false statements about what happened in the session .
Halverson accused Judge Bell of yelling at her and the other judges of screaming or throwing their hands in the air during the meeting .
“ The import of the charge is that Judge Halverson knowingly lied to a reporter , albeit about a serious administrative matter , and in doing so she essentially accused three well - respected judges of misbehaving , ” said the commission .
Halverson was trying to demonstrate there was a conspiracy against her , said the decision .
Halverson was found guilty of requiring Judge Hardcastle to go through an attorney to communicate with her .
She would not cooperate with Court Administrator Chuck Short .
And she called the police to report that “ unauthorized personnel ” were attempting to get into her chambers when it was Short who was authorized to be in the office .
“ The evidence is overwhelming that shortly after Judge Halverson was elected and took office in January 2007 her behavior and her failure to cooperate with other judges and court officials led to substantial problems ” for the judicial system in Clark County , said the discipline commission .
“ The damage resulting from her antics and willful misconduct will be felt by the judicial system for a significant future period of time , ” said the commission .
The judge had continued to receive a $ 130,000 annual salary during the suspension .
With her removal , Judge Halverson can never serve on the judicial bench again .
Then on Sept. 4 Judge Halverson called Metro Police and said she was attacked by her husband wielding a frying pan .
Officer arrived at the Halverson home in the 4100 block of Oxnard Circle near Tropicana Avenue and U.S. 95 .
It took 100 staples to close the wounds to the judge 's scalp and head .
Police broke through a security gate .
Edward Halverson , the judge 's husband , opened the front door , shirtless and wearing green camouflage shorts .
He had blood on the shorts , and his arms and legs , and had smears of blood on his back , a police report said .
Edward Halverson has been charged with attempted murder with a deadly weapon and is awaiting trial .
UPDATE Dec 15 , 2008 : Please see Tanta :
In Memoriam for photos , remembrances , links to Tanta 's writing , Tanta 's charities and stories about her .
My dear friend and co-blogger Doris “ Tanta ” Dungey passed away early this morning .
I would like to express my deepest condolences to her family and friends .
Photo : Tanta in 2004 ( from her sister Cathy ) .
The blogger Tanta , an influential voice on the mortgage collapse , died Sunday morning in Columbus , Ohio .
Tanta , who wrote for Calculated Risk , a finance and economics blog , was a pseudonym for Doris Dungey , 47 , who until recently had lived in Upper Marlboro , Md .
The cause of death was ovarian cancer , her sister , Cathy Stickelmaier , said .
...
Tanta used her extensive knowledge of the loan industry to comment , castigate and above all instruct .
Her fans ranged from the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman , an Op - Ed columnist for The New York Times who cited her in his blog , to analysts at the Federal Reserve , who cited her in a paper on “ Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit . ”
She wrote under a pseudonym because she hoped some day to go back to work in the mortgage industry , and the increasing renown of Tanta in that world might have precluded that .
Tanta was Ms. Dungey ’s longtime family nickname , Ms. Stickelmaier said .
I still have n’t gotten over the fact that there ’s a “ capital management ” group out there having named itself “ Cerberus ” .
Those of you who were not asleep in Miss Buttkicker ’s Intro to Western Civ will recognize Cerberus ; the rest of you may have picked up the mythological fix from its reprise as “ Fluffy ” in the first Harry Potter novel .
Wherever you get your culture , Cerberus is the three - headed dog who guards the gates of Hell .
It takes three heads to do that of course , because it ’s never clear , in theology or finance , whether the idea is to keep the righteous from falling into the pit or the demons from escaping out of it ( the third head is busy meeting with the regulators ) .
An “ UberNerd ” is someone who is compelled to understand how things work in grim detail , even if the things in question are tedious in the extreme … ”
“ Tanta is one of the best financial writers in the world , and explains complex ideas with wit and great clarity . "
“ The great thing about this age of blogs is the way people who really know something about a subject can quickly weigh in , without being filtered through Authority . ”
Several point raised in this section were first raised in a 20 February 2007 post on the blog http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/ entitled “ Mortgage Servicing for Ubernerds . ”
From David Streitfeld at the NY Times : Doris Dungey , Prescient Finance Blogger , Dies at 47 From CR to Tanta ’s many readers , fans and internet friends : Tanta enjoyed writing for you , chatting with many of you in the comments , and corresponding with you via email .
She told me several times over the last few months how much she enjoyed discussing current events with you .
Tanta worked as a mortgage banker for 20 years , and we started chatting in early 2005 about the housing bubble and the changes in lending practices .
In 2006 , Tanta was diagnosed with late stage cancer , and she took an extended medical leave while undergoing treatment .
At that time I approached her about writing for this blog , and she declined for a simple reason – her prognosis was grim and she did n’t expect to live very long .
To her surprise , after aggressive treatment , her health started to improve and she accepted my invitation .
When she chose an email address , it reflected her surprise : tanta_vive ... Tanta Lives !
Armed with a literary background and extensive knowledge of the mortgage industry , Tanta wrote about current events with deep insight and wit .
Here is the introduction to one of her posts in 2006 : Let Slip the Dogs of Hell Tanta wrote a number of posts detailing the inner workings of the mortgage industry .
These posts covered a wide range of topics , from mortgage servicing , to everything you want to know about mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) , to reverse mortgages .
She called these posts “ The Compleat UberNerd ” and in typical fashion she noted : Tanta liked to ferret out the details .
She was inquisitive and had a passion for getting the story right .
Sometimes she would n’t post for a few days , not because she was n’t feeling well , but because she was reading through volumes of court rulings , or industry data , to get the facts correct .
She respected her readers , and people noticed .
Felix Salmon at Condé Nast Portfolio.com , wrote on Nov 7 , 2007 wrote : Paul Krugman at the NY Times complemented Tanta several times , recently writing Even researchers at the Federal Reserve referenced Tanta ’s work : From Adam Ashcraft and Til Schuermann : Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit , credit on page 13 : Tanta was also extremely funny .
She introduced the Muddled Index ( MMI ) and Excel Art featuring the Mortgage Pig , and she was the originator of a number of phrases in use today , like “ We ’re all subprime now !
” This is a very sad day and I know many of you are in shock .
Tanta was our teacher .
She generously shared her knowledge with all of us .
I doubt she knew how many lives she touched ; her insights , spirit and passion lives on in her writings – and in all of you .
Tanta Vive !
It 's been confirmed than police have been shooting at students in Palaio Faliro , a southern suburb of Athens , a writer in the city reports , amid claims that both police and right - wing groups have been on the attack .
As rioting continues in the streets , with hundreds of people clashing with police outside the Greek parliament and more being held off while they try to surge in from outside the area , an on - the - ground writer gives his impressions of the evening :
" Daytime in Athens was relatively calm .
High school students attacked , once again , the riot police units outside the parliament on Syntagma Square .
Eksarhia , through which we walked during the day , resembled a battlefield in limbo : burnt cars blocking off its main streets ; Stournari Ave( running alongside university grounds ) is completely smashed up , barricades constantly burning across it .
" Most groups have retreated in the universities ( NTUA and the University of Economics ) .
Assemblies were held there during the day , to plan out the next few days .
However – a group of up to 400 people is still in the southern suburb of Palaio Faliro , where Alexis ’ funeral * was held this morning .
They are quite literally rioting their way into the city centre .
There , it is assumed that they will try to join either the occupations of the NTUA or the University of Economics .
" The breaking news is that the police have shot at least ten times at demonstrators in Palaio Faliro .
Meanwhile , at the University of Economics , while at least four units of the riot police are encircling the campus and trying to push the demonstrators inside .
" A beautiful slogan is echoing across the city : “ ο λα ό ς θα πεί την τελε υ ταία λέξη / αυτές οι νύχτε ς είναι του αλέξη ” - “ the people will have the last word / these are Alexis ’ nights ” . "
Another commentator on the libcom forums meanwhile suggests that rioting which happened near the funeral procession may have been provoked by police .
He said : " Today the state decided to forcibly start repressing the mobilisations , violent or not .
They crashed the peaceful demos of the students in Athens .
They threw tear gas into the graveyard during the funeral process -- a riot started immediately , with all sorts of people joining in .
" Whole blocks remain without public lights ( scary ! ) so that the police can act freely , undercover cops in swarms , ' bait ' operations etc .
More policemen faced with rioters have responded by firing ( real firearms , not plastic bullets ) into the air for intimidation .
" The police are attacking everywhere .
In the city of Patras they were joined by right wing people - not only neo - nazis but ' normal ' right wing people , acting in gangs using stones and sticks .
All the university occupations are holding .
" The prime minister has declared that : " In these critical times , there 's a clear challenge : we have to shield the democracy against the extremist groups ' violence .
Right now , national unity is our common duty ...
All those who engage in violent acts and vandalism are enemies of democracy . "
" Tonight there have been riots in various areas of Athens and other cities .
In Athens anarchists , students and many immigrants from africa , the middle east and the balkans have been fighting together .
Perhaps fewer are involved than yesterday , but they are more determined .
The immigrants in particular fight fiercely .
Looting is very widespread and some 50 immigrants have been snatched by the police .
As expected , all sorts of semi-illegal activities have broken out in the ' anomy ' zones , like in the history books . "
The government has vowed to crack down on the rioters .
But with the general strike tomorrow against government austerity programmes and attacks on pensions and tens of thousands of angry workers on the streets aggressive police action could lead to serious repercussions for the state .
Quotes from occupiedlondon.org and the libcom forums
* Alexis Grigoropoulos , the 15 - year - old whose death at police hands sparked the riots .
His funeral drew some 3,000 mourners .
A coroner 's report has shown he was shot in the chest , and two policemen have been arrested .
Do n't you sometimes wish that you could tell your guests to leave ?
Maybe it's not that they bore you , you 're just not in the mood for company .
Well , look at this crazy doormat ....
Designers Sam & Jude , founders of SUCK UK , created a very clever Come In Go Away mat .
Yes , it says Come In from one side and Go Away from the other .
This design is called an " ambigram , " a graphic image that can be read exactly the same way upside - down or read completely differently upside - down .
There are three uses for the Come In Go Away ambigram doormat :
1 . To welcome your guests :
2 . To turn away all potential guests and other intruders
and ...
3 . To communicate to your guest that he has overstayed his welcome .
In this case , you bring the mat into the house and , in the Go Away position , you place it discreetly in front of your guest 's chair .
When the guest sees the mat , and is surprised at your indelicacy , you say indignantly that you have no idea how it got there ... your dog Sheldon must have brought it in .
Then shyly smile and say , " Sorry about that . "
And , looking at your watch , say , " It is getting rather late though . "
Try this out and let me know how it works !
In the meantime , I should let you know that the Come In Go Away doormat is made of 100 % pure and natural coconut husk that really cleans the b.s. off your shoes .
And the mat is available from Nigel 's Eco Store in the UK and from Amazon.com in the U.S .

WASHINGTON  American and Indian authorities said Tuesday that there was now little doubt that militants inside Pakistan had directed the terrorist attacks in Mumbai .
Indian officials said they had identified three or four masterminds of the deadly assault , stepping up pressure on Pakistan to act against the perpetrators of one of the worst terrorist attacks in India ’s history .
The emerging consensus came as the Bush administration increased its diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions between India and Pakistan over the attacks , dispatching the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen , to the region .
He is to join Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday morning .
Both officials are expected to issue stern warnings to the government of Pakistan to crack down on militant groups in Pakistan near its borders with Indian - administered Kashmir and with Afghanistan , top American aides said .
Two senior American officials said Tuesday that the United States had warned India in mid-October of possible terrorist attacks against “ touristy areas frequented by Westerners ” in Mumbai , but that the information was not specific .
Nonetheless , the officials said , the warning echoed other general alerts this year by India ’s intelligence agency , raising questions about the adequacy of India ’s counterterrorism measures .
Details of the attack planners also became clearer on Tuesday .
The only gunman captured by the police told his interrogators that one of the main plotters was a fugitive known to Indian authorities : Yusuf Muzammil , a leader of the Pakistani militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba , according to a senior Indian police official and a Western official .
The group , though officially banned and once focused primarily on Indian claims to disputed Kashmir , maintains its leadership in Pakistan and is believed to have moved its militant networks to Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
Mr. Muzammil , who is the right - hand man to Zaki- ur - Rehman Lakvhi , the operational commander of the group , talked by satellite phone to the attackers from Pakistan when the gunmen were in the Taj and Oberoi hotels , the Western official said .
The attackers also used the cellphones of people they killed to call back to Mr. Muzammil somewhere in Pakistan , the official said .
The mounting evidence increased the pressure on the United States to find a way to resolve the tensions between Pakistan and India , two nuclear - armed neighbors .
The officials said there was still no evidence that Pakistan ’s government had a hand in the operation , although investigators were still searching for clues of outside support for the terrorists .
“ There ’s very little doubt that L.-e. - T. is responsible , but beyond that we need to learn more , ” said a senior American official , who was briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity , citing its continuing nature .
Indian officials sidestepped questions on the prospects of a military standoff and obliquely suggested that New Delhi may suspend peace talks with Pakistan , under way for nearly five years .
The Indian foreign minister , Pranab Mukherjee , said he could not comment on military options available to his government , except to say that “ every sovereign country has its right to protect its territorial integrity . ”
Senior Bush administration officials sought to tamp down tensions .
“ It ’s important for there to be restraint on both sides and  but it ’s also important to find out who was responsible , ” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told reporters at the Pentagon .
Fresh information about the attacks , which hit two luxury hotels , a train station and other targets and killed 173 people , spilled forward Tuesday , even as the Indian police acknowledged that it would take longer to get to the bottom of the gunmen ’s identities .
The 10 heavily armed young men had all been trained by former army officers , the Mumbai police chief , Hassan Gafoor , told reporters .
Though he refused to specify , the implication was that the army officers were Pakistani .
The attackers came on a three - day journey by sea from Karachi , he said .
The one suspect in custody said he was from Pakistan , and the authorities were verifying the identities of nine others who were killed .
Though the suspect in their custody has given no more than aliases for his nine partners , the Mumbai police insisted that all were Pakistanis .
And all had been trained at the same place , the authorities said , and were on a suicide mission .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
In a legal blow to the tobacco industry , the U.S. Supreme Court held Monday that federal labeling laws do not protect marketers of what are called " light " cigarettes from being sued under state antifraud statutes for false advertising .
The 5 - 4 ruling in Altria Group v. Good means that a group of Maine consumers can go ahead with a state lawsuit against Altria that charges the company with deceptive advertising of its light brands .
At issue were federal rules about cigarette labeling and advertising , which Altria claimed preempted state laws .
A federal district court initially agreed with Altria only to be later overturned on appeal .
The high court made no ruling on the merits of the case , merely allowing it to proceed .
Writing for the majority , Justice John Paul Stevens said that the federal " Labeling Act does not preempt state - law claims like respondents ' that are predicated on the duty not to deceive , " and also held that the Federal Trade Commission 's " various decisions with respect to statements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly preempt respondents ' claim . "
Still , he added , " respondents still must prove that petitioners ' use of ' light ' and ' lowered tar ' descriptors in fact violated the state deceptive - practices statute , but neither the Labeling Act 's preemption provision nor the FTC 's actions in this field prevent a jury from considering that claim . "
Stevens was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Stephen Breyer .
Justice Clarence Thomas , joined in dissent by Chief Justice John Roberts , Antonin Scalia Samuel Alito , wrote that the majority misread precedent and that the ruling could well " have the perverse effect of increasing the nonuniformity of state regulation of cigarette advertising , " a problem that Congress intended to remedy with the Labeling Act .
" While we had hoped for a dismissal based upon federal preemption , it is important to note that the Supreme Court made no finding of liability , " wrote Murray Garnick , Altria 's associate general counsel , in a response .
" We continue to view these cases as manageable , and the company will assert many of the strong defenses used successfully in the past to defend against this very type of case . "
Ed Sweda , senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University School of Law , said that the opinion " gives the green light to the victims of the tobacco industry 's ' light ' cigarette scam to have their case heard before a jury of their peers . "
It is a " victory for consumers who were deliberately deceived by an industry that came within one vote today of getting an absolute shield of immunity for decades of wrongdoing . "
Although she has been gone from the competitive scene for a while , her return would be intriguing .
No U.S. woman has dominated nationally or internationally the past few years ,
Cohen , 24 , placed fourth at Salt Lake City in 2002 .
She was the leader after the short program in Turin but performed a flawed free skate and was passed by Japan 's Shizuka Arakawa .
" I like the challenge .
I think it 's something I can do , " she said by phone Wednesday .
" I just do n't want to rush myself into anything and just really take my time and train and see where I can get . "
Orange County - bred figure skater Sasha Cohen , the silver medalist at the 2006 Turin Games , said she will announce next summer whether she will try to make the U.S. team for the 2010 Winter Games .
and most have struggled to deal with injuries and growth spurts .
If Cohen can approach or equal her former balletic grace and smooth artistry , the competition at the 2010 U.S. championships could be very interesting .
" Right now I 'm in the process of training and seeing where my skill level is at , " she said , adding that she has worked with different coaches and has skated in Lake Arrowhead but has n't chosen a coach for Olympic - level preparation .
" I have n't really trained since the last time around .
And I 'll take all that into consideration and see if I think that I can do it and be competitive . "
After Cohen left the competitive scene she stayed busy pursuing an acting career and skating in shows .
She has put acting on hold -- " I realized you can only do one thing well at once and although I loved acting , my skating suffered a lot when I was taking time away from it , " she said -- and is gearing up for the Stars on Ice tour .
The cross-country tour begins later this month in Spokane , Wash . , and will stop locally at the Honda Center on Jan. 31 and at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario on Feb .

Cohen will perform two solos and three group numbers in the show , as well as a smaller , transitional solo .
" They 're really trying to show how we went from being competitive athletes to being performers and entertainers and how we 've trained , " she said .
" We 're trying to show that although we try to make it look easy it 's a sport and a challenge and we work very hard at it . "
She said can still do all the triple jumps she performed as an Olympic - track skater and usually does two in her show routines .
She 'd have to do more than that to earn an Olympic berth or challenge for a medal in Vancouver , and she knows it .
" It 's just a matter of getting strong enough to do triple - triples and do not just do them but do them in a way that is competitive in the way skating has envisioned , " she said .
She also said she has followed the Grand Prix series this season .
" It 's interesting to see how it goes and how the points get laid out , " she said .
" It is about jumping but it 's also about components and the spins and the footwork and getting the best choreographer to show your strength .
" I do miss the challenge and that intensity of competition when I 've been going back and watching . "

Chiropractic is a controversial health - care system that has been legalized throughout the United States and in several other countries .
In the United States in 1984 , roughly 10.7 million people made 163 million office visits to 30,000 chiropractors [ 1 ] .
More than three fourths of the states require insurance companies to include chiropractic services in health and accident policies .
The federal government pays for limited chiropractic services under Medicare , Medicaid , and its vocational rehabilitation program , and the Internal Revenue Service allows a medical deduction for chiropractic services .
Chiropractors cite such facts as evidence of “ recognition . ”
However , these are merely business statistics and legal arrangements that have nothing to do with chiropractic ’s scientific validity .
Although it has existed for nearly 100 years , the chiropractic health - care system has failed to meet the most fundamental standards applied to medical practices : to clearly define itself and to establish a science - based scope of practice .
More disturbing is the fact that chiropractic has made no contribution to the worldwide body of knowledge shared by the health sciences and continues to isolate itself from the mainstream of the health - care community .
Spinal Manipulative Therapy ( SMT )
An estimated 80 % of adults will experience a severe bout with back pain and dysfunction at some time in their life .
There is substantial evidence that spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) has value in relieving back pain and improving the range of impaired spinal motion at least temporarily .
Although SMT is probably no more effective than other modalities in the long term , it appears to offer faster relief in about one third of patients [ 2 - 4 ]
Further , because SMT involves the laying on of hands , a technique widely employed throughout history by folk and faith healers , it enhances suggestibility and the placebo effect [ 5,6 ] .
Many people like SMT because of the direct contact it involves and the subjective relief it brings .
Charles DuVall , Sr. , D.C. , reports that SMT can become addictive [ 7 ] .
Chiropractic is commonly thought to be synonymous with SMT .
In reality , SMT ’s history goes back at least to Hippocrates ( 400 B.C. ) , while chiropractic ’s roots go back less than 100 years .
Folk healers ( “ bonesetters ” ) and early osteopaths used SMT as a panacea .
Today SMT is employed by medical specialists ( physiatrists , orthopedists , sports medicine practitioners ) , osteopathic physicians , physical therapists , and athletic trainers , as well as by chiropractors .
A survey of back - pain sufferers revealed that physiatrists are the most effective at treating back problems [ 8 ] .
Physiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in rehabilitation .
Formerly they were called doctors of physical medicine .
But physiatrists are few in number and can be difficult to find .
( They often practice in connection with Veterans Administration hospitals . )
Some hospitals now have back treatment centers that emphasize strengthening weak stomach musculature ( a major cause of back problems ) and improving the flexibility of the back .
Many of these centers offer SMT either by a physical therapist or a chiropractor .
Chiropractors are the SMT practitioners most accessible to the public , and 85 % of people who patronize them do so for neuromusculoskeletal problems [ 1 ] .
Chiropractors point with pride to selected worker ’s compensation studies that show that chiropractic care got workers back on the job sooner and for less cost than did medical care .
But these studies were not scientifically controlled for the severity of the injuries , and not all workmen ’s compensation studies have been favorable to chiropractic .
Nonetheless , the studies do suggest that chiropractors can play a useful role in treating workers with musculoskeletal problems .
Chiropractic ’s Unique Theory
Chiropractic ’s uniqueness lies not in its use of SMT , but in its theoretical reason for doing so .
just as prescientific osteopathy found its justification in the “ rule of the artery ” ( the belief that manipulation improved circulation by reducing muscle spasms ) , chiropractic is based upon the “ rule of the nerve ” ( the belief that SMT has important effects upon “ nerve flow ” ) .
The word chiropractic literally means “ done by hand . ”
The term was adopted by chiropractic ’s founder , Daniel David Palmer .
Palmer was a layman with an intense interest in metaphysical health philosophies such as magnetic healing ( Mesmer ’s “ animal magnetism ” ) , phrenology , and spiritualism .
In 1895 , he claimed to have restored the hearing of a nearly deaf janitor by manipulating the man ’s spine .
Obsessed with uncovering “ the primary cause of disease , ” Palmer theorized that “ 95 percent of all disease ” was caused by spinal “ subluxations ” ( partial dislocations ) and the rest by “ luxated bones elsewhere in the body . ”
Palmer speculated that subluxations impinged upon spinal nerves , impeding their function , and that this led to disease .
He taught that medical diagnosis was unnecessary , that one need only correct the subluxations to liberate the body ’s own natural healing forces .
He disdained physicians for treating only symptoms , alleging that , in contrast , his system corrected the cause of disease .
Palmer did not employ the term subluxation in its medical sense , but with a metaphysical , pantheistic meaning .
He believed that the subluxations interfered with the body ’s expression , of the “ Universal Intelligence ” ( God ) , which Palmer dubbed the “ Innate Intelligence . ” ( soul , spirit , or spark of life ) . [ 9 ]
Palmer ’s notion of having discovered a way to manipulate metaphysical life force is sometimes referred to as his “ biotheology . ”
Scientific Shortcomings
Chiropractors commonly claim that their isolation from the health science mainstream results from organized medicine ’s opposition .
Chiropractic propagandists have made much of a 1987 court decision that found the American Medical Association and others guilty of illegally boycotting chiropractors .
But the Wilk case did not uncover any secret conspiracy by doctors to destroy chiropractic .
It merely examined whether or not the AMA ’s ethical prohibition against voluntary professional association with nonscientific healthcare providers violated the Sherman Antitrust Act .
On August 27 , 1987 , District judge Susan Getzendanner decided that it did .
She stated in her decision , however , that the AMA ’s ethical prohibition was not economically motivated , but was based upon the AMA ’s belief that chiropractic care was did not serve the best interest of patients [ 10 ]
Palmer can be forgiven for his nineteenth - century misconceptions , but his followers cannot be excused for failing to avail themselves of the scientific advances of the twentieth century to test chiropractic theory and practice .
In fact , chiropractors have never defined a subluxation in measurable terms , nor shown that it even exists .
Despite the ability of neurophysiologists to measure nerve impulses , chiropractors have not shown that impinging a spinal nerve alters an impulse beyond the zone of impingement , nor have they shown that disrupting a nerve impulse produces disease .
Yale University anatomist Edmund Crelin , Ph.D. , demonstrated that only a disabling spinal injury could produce the impingement that Palmer posited as the basis for chiropractic [ 11 ] .
But laboratory failings do not daunt chiropractors .
They argue that no one fully understands the mechanisms of many effective medical procedures .
As clinicians they feel capable of detecting subluxations subjectively , even if objective methods for doing so are lacking .
However , chiropractors have yet to pass a test of interexaminer reliability .
Studies of the ability of two or more chiropractors to find the same subluxation (s ) on either the same x-ray film or in the same patients have demonstrated that chiropractors cannot even agree among themselves about what specific conditions need treatment [ 12 - 16 ] .
In the mid-1960s , an official delegation of chiropractic representatives , including a radiologist of their own choosing , failed to identify a single subluxation on a series of 20 x -ray films that had been submitted for insurance reimbursement to the National Association of Letter Carriers [ 14 ] .
In 1972 , the Medicare law was amended to include chiropractic care for “ subluxations demonstrated by x-rays to exist . ”
A 1986 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that many payments for chiropractors do not meet this legal requirement [ 17 ] .
The fact that the federal government does not enforce the rules it has established for chiropractors raises the question of a double standard .
Is there one standard for science - based medicine and another for nonscientific practitioners with political savvy ?
Chiropractors not only find subluxations as elusive as the mythical unicorn , but they also disagree wildly about how to go about treating them .
Some believe that each vertebral level corresponds to a specific disorder .
Others believe that it is necessary to manipulate only the seven cervical vertebrae to effect a cure .
“ Hole - in - one ” ( their term ) practitioners believe that it is necessary to adjust only the atlas ( topmost ) vertebra .
Basic sacral chiropractors agree that only one vertebra needs to be adjusted , but rather than the topmost , it is the sacrum , located at the bottom of the spine .
Still another group adjusts both the atlas and sacral vertebrae .
Others adjust the entire spine in a shotgun approach , while another group measures leg lengths in order to level up the spine .
No scientific criteria have been applied to resolve these conditions .
Anyone visiting a number of chiropractors will be confronted with a bewildering variety of pseudoscientific diagnostic procedures .
In 1981 Mark Brown , a reporter for the Quad City Times , spent five months visiting chiropractors in the Davenport , Iowa , area ( the birthplace of chiropractic ) .
Diagnostic methods included placing a potato on his chest and pressing down on his arm ( applied kinesiology ) , projecting lines on his back to read body contours ( Moire contour analysis ) , reading the iris and comparing markings with a chart ( iridology ) , measuring leg lengths for unevenness ( one chiropractor said Brown ’s right leg was shorter , another said his left leg was shorter ) , measuring skin surface temperature differences , and palpation [ 16 ] .
Other dubious diagnostic methods used by some chiropractors include pendulum divining , electroacupuncture , reflexology , hair analysis , herbal crystallization analysis , computerized “ nutritional deficiency ” questionnaires , a cytotoxic food allergy test , and the Reams urine and saliva test .
Chiropractors also employ a wide variety of pseudomedical therapies .
Magnetic therapy ( placing magnets on the body ) , homeopathy , herbology , colonics , colored - light therapy , megavitamin therapy , radionics ( black box devices ) , bilateral nasal specifics ( inserting a balloon in the nose and inflating it ) , and cranial manipulation are but a few of the unfounded therapies employed by various chiropractors .
A 1988 trade survey found that 74 % of chiropractors in the United States use nutrition supplements in their practices [ 18 ] .
Many prescribe and sell these directly to patients — a practice that is generally regarded as unethical in the medical profession .
Chiropractors promote themselves as “ drugless practitioners , ” capitalizing on the restrictions against the use of drugs or surgery that lawmakers have placed upon them .
The word drug has several definitions .
Included are : articles listed in several recognized official United States pharmacopoeias ; articles intended for use in the diagnosis , cure , mitigation , treatment , or prevention of disease in man or animals ; articles ( other than food ) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body [ 19 ] .
In 1987 the supreme court of Georgia ruled that because chiropractors were licensed as drugless practitioners , they could not prescribe dietary supplements for the prevention or treatment of any condition .
Not long afterward , the legislature reacted to chiropractic lobbying by passing a law permitting chiropractors to recommend dietary supplements to their patients , but not to prescribe them as drugs .
The use of x-rays by chiropractors is a related issue .
Chiropractors often expose the whole body trunk to x-ray radiation .
Since radiation effects are cumulative , exposing patients to radiation always involves a serious benefit - risk evaluation .
Chiropractors often justify their use of X - rays as a means of screening patients for serious disease , but a recent probability study by a chiropractic radiologist reveals that full - spine x-rays are twice as likely to induce cancer as to discover it in a patient [ 20 ] .
One thing chiropractors excel at is satisfying their patients .
Patients rank them above medical doctors in the concern exhibited about their problems , understanding their concerns , amount of time spent listening to a description of their pain , information provided about the cause of their pain , making them feel welcome , and other factors related to the art of fulfilling human needs [ 21,22 ] .
Although it is important for physicians to differentiate between mere patient satis , faction and true clinical effectiveness , it seems that they could learnsomething from chiropractors about meeting the emotional needs of suffering patients .
Factions in Chiropractic
Only a minority of today ’s chiropractors adhere to Palmer ’s “ one - cause - one - cure ” theory , but most still believe that subluxations exist and may play an important role in the cause and treatment of diseases .
Chiropractors who wish to be considered full - fledged physicians consider limiting the value of SMT merely to relieving pain and improving function as an affront .
Practitioners who limit their practices to analyzing the spine and correcting subluxations are called “ straight ” chiropractors .
Those who believe that they are affecting Palmer ’s biotheological “ Innate Life Force ” are often called “ superstraights . ”
The straights label chiropractors who do more than SMT “ mixers , ” because they mix other modalities .
These various chiropractic factions have been at odds with each other throughout nearly all of chiropractic ’s existence .
Each claims to be the true chiropractors and labels the others as cultists or “ pseudomedical doctors . ”
The strife between these factions has been fought out in courts and state legislatures and remains unresolved to this day .
Often the straight / mixer dichotomy is wrongly suggested as a useful criterion for separating rational from irrational practitioners .
In fact , either type can be irrational .
Straights may be cultists who overuse SMT , applying it to conditions for which it offers no benefit .
And mixers have a propensity for espousing pseudomedical fads and are probably the major sources of nonsensical modalities in the health - care marketplace .
Both straights and mixers have traditionally opposed scientifically based public health measures such as immunization , fluoridation , pasteurization of milk , modern food technology , prescription drugs , and surgery .
The Reformers
Among the newer factions are several reform groups .
One group publishes the Journal of Manipulative and Physiologic Therapeutics , which is indexed by Index Medicus .
They publish results of tests of various modalities , and they publish articles dealing with chiropractic ’s scientific inadequacies .
They hope to reform chiropractic quietly from within .
A more outspoken group , the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine ( NACM ) , is composed of chiropractors who use only SMT and treat only functional back disorders that are not disease - related .
NACM believes that chiropractic pseudomedicine and cultism are too well entrenched , and that the moral responsibility for public well - being is too serious to merely hope and patiently wait for self - reform .
NACM members publicly renounce the subluxation theory and other forms of chiropractic pseudomedicine .
They do not present chiropractic as an alternative to regular medicine , but offer their skills as SMT specialists in cooperation with mainstream medicine .
Reformers have a difficult time because they find themselves ostracized by the chiropractic guild for breaking ranks and openly criticizing chiropractic , but they may have difficulty being accepted by regular medical practitioners .
These reformers , particularly NACM ’s leaders , exhibit rare , selfless courage .
The first outspoken reformer , Samuel Homola , D.C. , published his observations in 1963 in Bonesetting , Chiropractic , and Cultism , which is posted on this Web site . ]
The dilemma reformers face is that chiropractors do not perform any service or deal with any condition not covered by some other health profession .
State laws that enable them to practice either specifically mention the subluxation theory or describe it as the basis for chiropractic as an entity .
Renouncing chiropractic ’s theoretical basis would eliminate its justification for existing as a separate profession .
Reformers acknowledge that they offer mainly the specialized skill of SMT .
They believe that SMT is underutilized and that a substantial market exists for their skills .
Although other health professionals can legally perform SMT or treat functional back disorders , most do not .
To become skilled at SMT requires more time and effort than most physicians or physical therapists are willing to invest , especially when they feel that they may achieve the same clinical results over the long term with less demanding modalities .
Consumer Guidelines
The SMT skill of chiropractors varies among individual practitioners .
Chiropractic is a cottage industry without an arena that permits critical peer review like that hospitals provide for medical doctors .
When evaluating a chiropractor ’s claims , it is useful to ask him or her what diseases chiropractic adjustments cannot benefit .
A rational practitioner will readily admit to great limitations in treating anything other than musculoskeletal problems .
A less rational chiropractor may answer by dodging the question with a response such as “ I treat only people who have spines , ” or “ I do n’t treat diseases ; I treat people . ”
Such answers avoid the question and / or represent a belief in the subluxation theory .
There is no agency that can tell how good an individual chiropractor is as a spinal manipulative therapist .
Consumers must generally rely upon the practitioner ’s local reputation .
When choosing a chiropractor , consumers should exercise great caution and consider the following guidelines .
1 . Have the problem evaluated by a medical doctor first .
Have underlying serious illnesses ruled out before deciding that the problem is neuromusculoskeletal .
Heart disease , cancer , kidney dis ’ ease , and other serious problems that need prompt medical care may manifest themselves as back pain and dysfunction .
Do n’t allow an overzealous , inadequately trained chiropractor to keep you from prompt diagnosis and care .
If the chiropractor recommends X - rays , have them done by a radiologist .
2 . If you decide to try SMT , inform your doctor .
Ask if there is any reason you should not have SMT ( osteoporosis is one common contraindication ) .
if not , ask for his or her help in locating the most skillful practitioner in the area ( physiatrist , physical therapist , chiropractor , etc. ) .
Some doctors feel that SMT has n’t been scientifically proven effective , but most are willing to go along with a patient who wishes to give it a try .
3 . Remember that the main value of SMT lies in the rapidity of the relief it provides .
If you have not experienced significant relief within three weeks , discontinue SMT .
Do not submit to long - term care .
Do not sign a contract .
And do not accept the idea of preventive chiropractic care .
Education about how to prevent back problems by safe lifting techniques , proper exercise , and ergogenics ( analyzing and redesigning the workplace to avoid injuries ) is valuable .
4. Avoid practitioners who :
Appear overconfident or cultist in their zeal for chiropractic care
Disparage regular medicine as jealously antichiropractic
Criticize prescription drugs or surgery in an ideological manner
Attack immunization , fluoridation , pasteurization , or other public health practices
X -ray all of their patients , or routinely use full - spine x-rays .
Use scare tactics such as claiming that the failure to undergo chiropractic care could lead to serious problems in the future
Sell herbs or dietary supplements
Perform colonic irrigations .
These have no medical value and can be dangerous [ 23 ] .
Claim that subluxations exist and that their correction is important .
5. Children should not be treated by chiropractors .
There are no childhood conditions that chiropractors are better qualified than physicians to treat .

4 . Burn a hole in your pocket , Crown Casino Melbourne
You ’ll need to whip out your credit card if you ’re gonna enjoy Australia ’s largest casino .
Players will find all the usual roulette and blackjack tables , but the Crown Casino is also a major venue for international performers .
It ’s a plush affair that ’s open 24 hours and has around 25 restaurants and 11 bars .
5. Swim at Lake McKenzie , Fraser Island
Fraser Island is the world ’s largest sand island and undoubtedly the most amazing spot on the island is Lake McKenzie — a serene , crystal - clear , blue lake with soft sandy beach surrounded by forest .
And what makes this beautiful tropical spot even more mesmerizing is its location – the lake is perched 100 m above sea level , deep in the sand dunes .
6. Wine Tour Through The Hunter Valley
Two hours north of Sydney lies Australia ’s oldest wine growing region , renowned for its Semillon and dotted with over one hundred wineries .
One of the best ways to discover the vineyards and olive groves of the Hunter Valley is to join a tour .
Kick back , enjoy the view and the tastes of each vineyard sip - by - sip .
7. Climb The Sydney Harbour Bridge
Scaling the 134 meters up Sydney ’s iconic Harbour Bridge might not be physically demanding , but you ’re not doing it for the exercise .
Safely tethered to the bridge at all times , climbers get a spectacular view of Sydney Harbour , the Opera House , and the city in all its beauty , a view most Aussies have never seen .
8. Brave the Waves at Bondi Beach
Australia has many beaches , but among the thousands , this half - mile stretch is the most famous .
Located a short commute from Sydney ’s central business district , nestled among the urban sprawl , it ’s no wonder Bondi gets so busy .
In summertime , as many as 25,000 locals and tourists can invade the silver sands hoping to get a tan , learn to surf or just people watch .
It ’s not without drama ; swimmers get into trouble , children go missing , sharks interrupt beach life as they cruise the lineup ; and the odd fight erupts on the beach between drunks .
Some people will like Bondi ; others will be disappointed .
If you 're like me , you see business ideas everywhere .
Here are three of my latest brainstorms , which you may have for free , and if you start them , I will gladly be your first customer :
Open an indoor bicycle parking lot in lower Manhattan , where people can keep their bikes safe and dry .
For bonus points , offer gold memberships with showers and fresh towels .
Make a power strip with a built - in Ethernet hub that clips onto the back of a desk .
That way when you bring a laptop into work or need to charge your cell phone , you can plug it in without crawling on the floor .
Hotels catering to business travelers have something like this , but it 's always custom - wired by electricians .
Be the Dell ( NASDAQ : DELL ) of high - end office furniture .
Reduce the lead times on nice cubicles and partitions from 12 weeks to two .
All three of these ideas came from needing something and failing to find it in the marketplace .
I do n't have time to do any of them , so , like I said , if you could , that 'd be great .
' K .
Thanks !
Another idea I had was a little bit closer to my heart .
I wanted to launch a website to which programmers could go to ask highly technical questions about highly technical topics and get solutions from other programmers .
" How do you multiply two 64 - bit numbers in x86 assembler ? " you could ask , and your peers , acting mainly out of the goodness of their hearts , would write up an answer .
That sounds like an easy request , right ?
Does n't that website already exist ?
There must be millions of them !
Well , yes .
There is a lot of competition .
But it all struck me as stunningly flawed .
I had a couple of ideas about how to make a more useful website .
For example , I thought that visitors to the site should be able to vote , giving a thumbs - up or thumbs - down to every proposed answer .
The answer with the most votes would be listed first .
Users would n't have to search through 100 answers , some of which were clearly wrong , because the best answers would rise to the top as other members of the community voted .
( Kind of like Digg -- see this month 's cover story , " Kevin Rose of Digg : The Most Famous Man on the Internet " . )
My other idea was that people should be able to edit one another 's answers .
If someone saw an answer that was mostly right but contained some small bug somewhere , he or she could simply click on an Edit button and type in the correction .
This would work just like Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia in which anyone can edit anything .
Surprisingly , Wikipedia works well : Entries get better and better over time as everybody contributes his or her knowledge .
That was the basic idea : a programming community Q&A site with voting and editing .
But like all my other ideas , nobody around here had any time to do it , so the idea went nowhere .
Then one day this guy named Jeff Atwood called me up .
Like me , Jeff had a blog , on which he mulled various programming topics .
He wrote well , so he was attracting quite a following .
He had begun to put advertisements up here and there , and was making a little bit of pocket change , so he started thinking , Gosh , I can do this for a living .
It sure beat the heck out of his day job working at a California company called Vertigo Software , which is where he was when he called me , asking for advice .
" Hey , I know exactly what you should do ! " I said .
And I told him the idea about the Q&A site with voting and editing .
A site like this would need a lot of smart programmers to ask and answer questions .
Between our two blogs , we felt we could generate the critical mass it would take to make the site work .
Jeff liked the idea , so we decided to make it a joint venture .
We named it Stack Overflow , after a common type of bug that causes software to crash -- plus , the domain name stackoverflow.com happened to be available .
I had no idea if the site would work or exactly how it might make money , and I did n't have a ton of time to put into it .
I have pretty deeply held ideas about how to develop software , but I mostly kept them to myself .
That turned out to be a good thing , because as the organization took shape , nearly all these principles were abandoned .
First , I always insist on vetting programmers very carefully .
Heck , I wrote a whole book about how to make sure you hire only the best programmers .
But I entered into the joint venture agreement with Jeff after meeting him in person just once , for about three minutes , and I never bothered to check if he could write good code .
Second , I 'm a big believer in putting everyone in one office , because I think that face - to - face communication is crucial .
But the people who set up Stack Overflow are scattered geographically : I 'm in New York ; Jeff is in California ; and he manages programmers who live in Oregon , Arkansas , and North Carolina .
Third , I 'm a planner .
I think it 's vital to create short documents , with sketches and diagrams , describing in plain English how software is going to work , before you start to build it .
But the design for Stack Overflow was mapped out in a few phone conversations , and Jeff and his friends just started banging out the code .
Oh , and bug tracking … That 's fourth : I recommend that developers maintain a database of known bugs and planned features .
At my company Fog Creek Software , the flagship product , FogBugz , is designed to do exactly that .
I tried to get Jeff to use FogBugz , but he was too busy writing new code to take me up on the suggestion .
Fifth , I 'm a big believer in testing software before you unleash it on the world .
Testers and quality - assurance engineers are extremely good at finding bugs before your customers run across them .
This new venture did n't really have any testers , although we did have a private beta test that uncovered a few problems .
Sixth , I advocate a fairly simple method of creating software schedules .
At the very least , I think , you have to make a list of all the things you plan to do and how long you think those tasks might take , and only then can you reasonably start work .
Jeff kept telling me , " It 's going to take six to eight weeks . "
I knew there was no chance that would happen , given that Jeff pulled his timeline completely out of thin air , but I humored him .
In reality , it took about twice as long as that , which was n't that bad , but it was still a 100 percent overrun .
In summary , Jeff and I made six major mistakes .
Oddly , though , none of it mattered .
In August , Jeff unveiled the site , and instantly it lit up .
Programmers used the site to pose their technical questions , and more important , they got great answers .
The voting system worked well -- you could see that the answers to a given question were getting sorted with the best at the top of the rankings .
At one point , I decided to test the site by asking a question about some code I was working on .
Before I could type in the whole question , Jeff 's code cleverly pointed out that someone already had asked that exact question and gotten a few answers , and the best answer had already been voted up to the top .
So I did n't even have to finish posting my question to see if the system worked .
As far as I 'm concerned , we 'll measure Stack Overflow 's progress by the number of people who successfully find answers to their questions .
Readers may be snickering : " Hey , Joel , maybe you should measure success by , um , profit ? "
Ha , ha !
And that 's the seventh major mistake I made .
I started a business with the objective of building a big audience , which we would figure out how to monetize later .
Sounds a little like the dot - com bubble , does n't it ?
Not only that , but at the outset we promised the audience that the site would always be free and open to the public , and that we would never add flashing punch - the - monkey ads or pop - up windows .
Of course , I 'm not sure how this will work out .
The good news is that the site costs almost nothing to run .
We 're not going to need big racks of computers ; it turns out that Jeff and his programmers were so good that they built a site that could serve 80,000 visitors a day ( roughly 755,000 page views ) using only one server that costs a few hundred bucks a month .
As for what this all means , I 'm still trying to figure that out .
I abandoned seven long - held principles about business and software engineering , and nothing terrible happened .
Have I been too cautious in the past ?
Perhaps I was willing to be a little reckless because this was just a side project for me and not my main business .
The experience is certainly a useful reminder that it 's OK to throw caution to the wind when you 're building something completely new and have no idea where it 's going to take you .
For his part , Jeff says he did n't want our new venture to feel " like work " -- that if Stack Overflow was n't fun to do , he did n't want to be doing it .
If I had tried to make him play by my rules , I do n't think the project would have come together , at least not as well as it has .
The truth is , the three guys who coded Stack Overflow are great programmers .
They 're smart , and they get things done .
And in the end , that 's what really matters .
Entrepreneurship boils down to the simple fact that a team of really smart people who can get things done are going to get smart , useful things done .

A South Texas grand jury has indicted Vice President Dick Cheney and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on charges related to the alleged abuse of prisoners in Willacy County ’s federal detention centers .
The indictment criticizes Cheney ’s investment in the Vanguard Group , which holds interests in the private prison companies running the federal detention centers .
It accuses Cheney of a conflict of interest and “ at least misdemeanor assaults ” on detainees by working through the prison companies .

Unit 23 : Complementary Therapies for Health and Social Care
NQF Level 3 : BTEC National
Guided learning hours : 60 Unit abstract “ In order to be able to take a holistic view towards medicine and health care , health and social care professionals need to understand the potential range of complementary therapies available and how they may be used in the support of conventional medicine . ”
Well , Goldacre has always said that homeopathy makes the perfect vehicle for teaching how easy it is to be deceived by bad science , so what ’s wrong ?
But wait
“ Learners will consider the benefits of complementary therapies to health and wellbeing , as well as identifying any contraindications and health and safety issues in relation to their use . ”
Then later
“ The holistic approach to illnesses such as cancer could be used as a focus here .
For example , there could be some tutor input to introduce ideas about the role of complementary therapies in the treatment and management of cancer , this being followed up by individual or small group research by learners using both the internet and the services available locally / regionally .
If available , a local homeopathic hospital , for example , would be an interesting place to visit . ”
It ’s true that to get a distinction , you have to “ evaluate the evidence relating to the use of complementary therapies in contemporary society ” , but it is n’t at all clear that this refers to evidence about whether the treatment works .
The really revealing bit comes when you get to the
“ Indicative reading for learners
There are many resources available to support this unit .

This list is truly astonishing .
Almost every one of them can be relied on to produce self - serving inaccurate information about the form of “ therapy ” it exists to promote .
The one obvious exception is the reference to Exeter University ’s academic department of complementary medicine ( and the link to that one is wrong ) .
The Nursing Times should be an exception too , but their articles about CAM are just about always written by people who are committed to it .
It is no consolation that the 2005 version was even worse .
In its classification of ‘ therapies ’ it said “ Pharmaceutically mediated : eg herbalism , homeopathy “ .
Grotesque !
And this is the examinng body !
The Teacher
This particular educational disaster came to my attention when I had a letter from a teacher .
She had been asked to teach this unit , and wanted to know if I could provide any resources for it .
She said that Edexcel had n’t done so .
She asked ” Do you know of any universities that teach CT ’s [ sic ] so I could contact them about useful teaching resources ?. ”
She seemed to think that reliable information about homeopathy could be found from a ‘ university ’ homeopathy teacher .
Not a good sign .
It soon emerged why .
She said .
“ My students are studying BTEC National Health Studies and the link is Edexcel BTEC National Complimentary [ sic ] studies . ”
“ I am a psychotherapist with an MA in Education and Psychology .
I am also trained in massage and shiatsu and have plenty of personal experience of alternative therapy ”
Shiatsu uh ?
It seems the teacher is already committed to placebo medicine .
Nevertheless I spent some time looking for some better teaching material for 16 year - old children .
There is good stuff at Planet
Science , and in some of the pamphlets from Sense about Science , not least their latest , I ’ve got nothing to lose by trying it – A guide to weighing up claims about cures and treatments .
I sent all this stuff to her , and prefaced the material by saying
“ First of all , I should put my cards on the table and say that I am quite appalled by the specification of Unit 23 .
In particular , it has almost no emphasis at all on the one thing that you want to know about any therapy , namely does it work ?
The reference list for reading consists almost entirely of organisations that are trying to sell you various sorts of quackery ,
There is no hint of balance ; furthermore it is all quite incompatible with unit 22 , which IS concerned with evidence . ”
At this point the teacher the teacher came clean too , As always , anyone who disagrees with the assessment ( if any ) of the evidence by a true believer is unmeasured and inflammatory .
“ I have found your responses very unmeasured and inflammatory and I am sorry to say that this prejudicial attitude has meant that I have not found your comments useful . ”
shortly followed by
“ I am not coming from a scientific background , neither is the course claiming to be scientific . ”
That will teach me to spend a couple of hours trying to help a teacher .
What does Edexcel say ?
I wrote to Edexcel ’s science subject advisors with some questions about what was being taught .
The response that I got was not from the science subject advisors but from the Head of Customer support , presumably a PR person .

Dear Professor Colquhoun
Thank you for email communication concerning the complementary therapies unit which is available in our BTEC National in Health and BTEC National in Health and Social Care qualifications .
I have replied on behalf of Stephen Nugus , our science subject advisor , because your questions do not refer to a science qualification .
I would like to answer your questions as directly as possible and then provide some background information relating to the qualifications .
The units and whole qualifications for all awarding bodies are accredited by the regulator , the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority .
The resource reading list is also produced by us to help teachers and learners .
The qualification as a whole is related to the National Occupational Standards for the vocational sectors of Health and Health and social care with consultation taken from the relevant sector skills councils .
As you will be aware many of these complementary therapies are available in care centres and health centres under the NHS and in the private sector .
The aim of BTEC qualifications is to prepare people for work in these particular sectors .
Clearly a critical awareness is encouraged with reference to health and safety and regulation .
There are other units , in some cases compulsory , within the qualification with a scientific approach .
‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ Stephen Harris Head of Customer Support
Aha , so it seems that teaching people to treat sick patients is “ not a science qualification ” .
Just a business qualification perhaps ?.
I have n’t yet managed to reach the people who make these decisions , so I persisted with the PR man .
Here is part of the next letter ( Edexcel ’s reply in italic ) .
19 November I find it quite fascinating that Edexcel regards the treatment of sick patients as not being part of science ( “ do not refer to a science qualification ” ) .
Does that mean Edexcel regard the “ Health ” part of “ Health and Social Care ” as being nothing to do with science , and that it therefore does n’t matter if Health Care is unscientific , or even actively anti-scientific ?
I am sorry if my answer lacked clarity .
My comment , that I had taken your enquiry on behalf of our Science Advisor because this was not a science qualification , was intended to explain why I was replying .
It was not intended as a comment on the relationship between Health and Social Care and science .
At Edexcel we use bureaucratic categories where we align our management of qualifications with officially recognised occupational sectors .
Often we rely on sector bodies such as Sector Skills Councils to endorse or even approve the qualifications we offer .
Those involved in production of our Science qualifications and our
Health and Social care qualifications are , as far as I can ascertain , neither anti-scientific nor non-scientific in their approach ( 4 ) You say “ The qualification as a whole is related to the National Occupational Standards for the vocational sectors of Health and Health and social care with consultation taken from the relevant sector skills councils ” .
Are you aware that the Skills for Health specifications for Alternative medicine were written essentially by the Prince of Wales Foundation ?
When I asked them if they would be writing a competence in talking to trees , they took the question totally seriously !!
( You can see the transcript of the conversation at http://dcscience.net/?p=215 ) .
The qualification was approved by both ‘ Skills for Health ’ and ‘ Skills for Care and Development ’ prior to being accredited by QCA .
It uses the NOS in Health and Social Care as the basis for many of the mandatory units .
The ‘ Complementary Therapies ’ NOS were not used .
This was not a requirement of a ‘ Health and Social Care ’ qualification .
“ Are the NOS in Health and Social Care that you mention the ones listed here ?
http://www.ukstandards.org/Find_Occupational_Standards.aspx?NosFindID=1&ClassificationItemId=174
If so , I can see nothing there about ‘ complementary therapies ’ .
if I have missed it , I ’d be very grateful if you could let me know where it is .
If it is not there , I remain very puzzled about the provenance of Unit 23 , since you say it is not based on Skills for Health . ”
Now we are immediately at sea , struggling under a tidal wave of acronyms for endless overlapping quangos .
In this one short paragraph we have no fewer than four of them .
‘ Skills for Health ’ , ‘ Skills for Care and Development ’ , ‘ Quality and Curriculum Authority ( QCA ) and NOS .
It seems that the specification of unit 23 was written by Edexcel , but Harris ( 25 Nov ) declines to name those responsible
“ When I refer to our “ Health and Social care team ” I mean the mix of Edexcel Staff and the associates we employ on a contract basis as writers , examiners and external verifiers .
The writers are generally recruited from those who are involved in teaching and assessment the subjects in schools and colleges .
The editorial responsibility lies with the Edexcel Staff .
I do not have access to the names of the writers and in any case would not be able to pass on this information .
Specifications indicate the managers responsible for authorising publication ” “ Edexcel takes full responsibility for its ethical position on this and other issues .
However we can not accept responsibility for the opinions expressed in third party materials .
There is a disclaimer to this effect at the beginning of the specification . ”
” You have the correct link to the Health NOS .
These are the standards , which where appropriate , influence our qualifications .
However in the case of Unit 23 I understand that there is no link with the Health NOS .
I do n’t know if the NOS cover the unit 23 content . ”
So , contrary to what I was told at first , neither Skills for Health , nor NOS were involved
Or were they ( see below ) ?
So who does take responsibility ?
Aha that is secret .
And the approval by the QCA is also secret .
“ I cannot provide you with copies of any correspondence between Skills for Health and Edexcel .
We regard this as confidential . “
What does the QCA say ?
The strapline of the QCA is
“ We are committed to building a world - class education and training framework .
We develop and modernise the curriculum , assessments , examinations and qualifications . ”
Referring school children to the Society of Homeopaths for advice seems to be world - class bollocks rather than world - class education .
When this matter was brought to light by Graeme Paton in the Daily Telegraph , he quoted Kathleen Tattersall , CEO of the QCA .
She said
“ The design of these diplomas has met Ofqual ’s high standards .
We will monitor them closely as they are delivered to make sure that learners get a fair deal and that standards are set appropriately . ”
Just the usual vacuous bureaucratic defensive sound - bite there .
So I wrote to Kathleen Tattersall myself with some specific questions .
The letter went on 2nd September 2008 .
Up to today , 26 November , I had only letters saying
“ Thank you for your email of 12 November addressed to Kathleen Tattersall , a response is being prepared which will be forwarded to you shortly . ”
“ Thank you for your email of 25th November addressed to Kathleen Tattersall .
A more detailed response is being prepared which will be sent to you shortly . ”
Here are some of the questions that I asked .
I wrote to Edexcel ’s subject advisors about unit 23 and I was told “ your questions do not refer to a science qualification ” .
This seems to mean that if it comes under the name “ Health Care ” then the care of sick patients is treated as though it were nothing to do with science , That seems to me to be both wrong and dangerous , and I should like to hear your view about that question .
Clearly the fundamental problem here is that the BTEC is intended as a vocational training for careers in alternative medicine , As a body concerned with education , surely you cannot ignore the view of 99 % of scientists and doctors that almost all alternative medicine is fraud .
That does n’t mean that you ca n’t make a living from it , but it surely does create a dilemma for an educational organisation .
What is your view of that dilemma ?
Eventually , on 27th November , I get a reply ( of sorts )
It came not from the Kathleen Tattersall of the QCA but from yet another regulatory body , OfQual , the office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator .
You ’d think that they ’d know the answers , but if they do they are n’t telling , [ download whole letter .
It is very short .
The “ more detailed response ” says nothing .
Ofqual does not take a view on the detailed content of vocational qualifications as that responsibility sits with the relevant Sector Skills Council which represents employers and others involved in the sector .
Ofqual accredits the specifications , submitted by sector - skilled professionals , after ensuring they meet National Occupational Standards .
Ofqual relies on the professional judgement of these sector - skilled professionals to include relevant subjects and develop and enhance the occupational standards in their profession .
The accreditation of this BTEC qualification was supported by both Skills for Health , and Skills for Care and Development , organisations which represent the emerging Sector Qualifications Strategies and comply with the relevant National Occupational Standards Isabel Nisbet Acting Chief Executive
So no further forward .
Every time I ask a question , the buck gets passed to another quango ( or two , or three ) .
This letter , in any case , seems to contradict what Edexcel said about the involvement of Skills for Health ( that ’s the talking to trees outfit ) ,
A nightmare maze of quangos
You may well be wondering what the relationship is between Ofqual and the QCA .
There is an ‘ explanation ’ here .
Ofqual will take over the regulatory responsibilities of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority ( QCA ) , with stronger powers in relation to safeguarding the standards of qualifications and assessment and an explicit remit as a market regulator .
The QCA will evolve into the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency ( QCDA ) : supporting Ministers with advice and undertaking certain design and delivery support functions in relation to the curriculum , qualifications , learning and development in the Early Years Foundation Stage , and National Curriculum and Early Years Foundation Stage assessments .
Notice tha QCA wo n’t be abolished .
There will be yet another quango .
The result of all this regulatory bureaucracy seems to be worse regulation , Exactly the same thing happens with accreditiation of dodgy degrees in universities .
At one time , a proposal for something like Unit 23 would have been shown to any competent science teacher , who would have said ” you must be joking ” and binned it .
Now a few hundred bureaucrats tick their boxes and rubbish gets approved .
There seems to be nobody in any of these quangos with the education to realise that if you want to know the truth about homeopathy , the last person you ask is the Society of Homeopaths or the Prince of Wales .
What next ?
So the mystery remains .
I ca n’t find out who is responsible for the provenance of the appallingly anti-science Unit 23 , and I can’t find out how it got approved .
Neither can I get a straight answer to the obvious question about whether it is OK to encourage vocational qualifications for jobs that are bordering on being fraudulent .
. All I can get is platitudes and bland assurances .
Everything that might be informative is clouded in secrecy .
The Freedom of Information requests are in .
Watch this space .
But do n’t hold your breath .
Follow - up
Here are some attempts to break through the wall of silence .
Edexcel .
I sent them this request .

This lack of public accountability just compounds their appalling inability to distinguish education from miseducation .
International Therapy Examination Council ( ITEC )
Mojo ’s comment , below , draws attention to the Foundation degree in Complementary Therapies offered by Cornwall College , Camborne , Cornwall ( as well as to the fact that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution has been wasting money on ‘ research ’ on homeopathy – write to them ) .
At least the courses are held on the Camborne campus of Cornwall College , not on the Duchy campus ( do we detect the hand of the Quacktitioner Royal in all this nonsense ? ) .
Cornwall College descends to a new level of barminess in its course Crystal Healing VTCT Level 3
“ Who is this course for ?
This course is designed to enhance the skills of the Holistic Therapist .
Crystals may be used on their own in conjunction with other therapies such as Indian Head Massage , Aromatherapy and Reflexology .
Due to the nature of the demands of the holistic programme this course is only suitable for students over the age of 18 . ”
“ What will I be doing on the course ?
Students will study the art of Crystal healing which is an energy based treatment where crystals and gemstones are used to channel and focus various energy frequencies . ”
. VTCT stands for the Vocational Training Charitable Trust .
It is yet another organisation that runs vocational exams , and it is responsible for this particular horror
The crystals are here .
I quote .
Objectives
the use of interpersonal skills with client
how to complement other therapies with crystals
the types and effects of different crystals
uses of crystals including cleansing , energising , configurations
concepts of auras and chakras
This is , of course , pure meaningless nonsense .
Utter bollocks being offered as further education
Cornwall College has many courses run by ITEC .
The College says
“ You will become a professional practitioner with the International Therapy Examination Council ( ITEC ) , study a number of essential modules to give a vocational direction to your study that include : Homeopathy and its application , ”
Who on earth , I hear you cry , are ITEC ?
That brings us to the seventh organisation in the maze of quangos and private companies involved in the miseducation of young people about science and medicine .
It appears , like Edexcel , to be a private company though its web site is very coy about that .
After the foundation degree you can go on to “ a brand new innovative BSc in Complementary Health Studies ( from Sept 2009 ) ”
The ITEC web site says
ITEC qualifications are accredited by the Office of the Qualifications and Examination Regulator ( OFQUAL )
ITEC qualifications are funded in the uk by the on behalf of Department for Innovation , Universities and Skills ( DIUS )
ITEC qualifications have been mapped to the National Occupational Standards , where they exist
Oddly enough , there is no mention of accreditation by a University ( not that that is worth much ) .
So a few more Freedom of Information requests are going off , in an attempt to find out why are kids are being miseducated about science and medicine .
Meanwhile you can judge the effect of all that education in physiology by one of the sample questions for ITEC Unit 4 , reflexology .
The pancreas reflex :
A Extends across both feet
B Is on the right foot only
C Is on the left foot only
D Is between the toes on both feet
Uhuh , they seem to have forgotten the option ‘ none of the above ’ .
Or how about a sample question from ITEC Unit 47 – Stone Therapy Massage
Which organ of the body is associated with the element fire ?
A Heart
B Liver
C Spleen
D Pancreas
Or perhaps this ?
Which incantation makes hot stones work best ?
A Incarcerous
B Avada Kedavra ,
C Dissendium
D Expelliarmus .
( OK I made the last one up , with help from Harry Potter , but it makes just about as much sense as the real ones ) .
And guess what ?
You ca n’t use the Freedom of Information
Act to find out how this preposterous rubbish got into the educational system because ” ITEC is a private organisation therefore does not come under this legislation ” .
The ability to conduct business in secret is a side effect of the privatisation of public education is another reason why it ’s a bad idea .
Ofsted
Ofsted has inspected Cornwall College .
They say “ We inspect and regulate to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people , and in education and skills for learners of all ages . ” .
I can find no mention of this nonsense in their report , so I ’ve asked them .
Ofsted has admitted a spectacular failure in its inspection of child care in the London Borough of Haringey .
Polly Curtis wrote in the Guardian ( 6 Dec 2008 )
“ We failed over Haringey – Ofsted head ” .
It was the front page story .
But of course
Ofsted do n’t take the blame , they say they were supplied with false information ,
That is precisely what happens whenever a committee or quango endorses rubbish .
They look only at the documents sent to them and they do n’t investigate , do n’t engage their brains .
In the case of these courses in utter preposterous rubbish , it seems rather likely that the ultimate source of the misinformation is the Princes ’ Foundation for Integrated Health .
Tha views of the Prince of Wales get passed on to the ludicrous Skills for Health and used as a criterion by all the other organisations , without a moment of critical appraisal intervening at any point .

A link from James Randi has sent the hit rate for this post soaring .
Someone there left are rather nice comment .
“ A quango seems to be a kind of job creation for the otherwise unemployable ‘ educated ‘( degree in alternative navel contemplation ) middle classes who ca n’t be expected to do anything useful like cleaning latines ( the only other thing they seem qualified for ) .
I really hate to think of my taxes paying for this codswollop . ”
HSBC has submitted an application to build an environmentally friendly £ 300 m , 325,000 square metre datacentre in North Yorkshire .
The site , near York , will not only become a key centre for the bank to process banking transactions but will also support the local environment and heat a local swimming pool through the excess heat it produces .
When the datacentre is complete it will be paired with another in Yorkshire it will become the " largest and most important centre facility in the world " , according to HSBC .
HSBC has other datacentre pairings in Hong Kong , Chicago and Mexico City .
" It has not been finalised because we need planning approval and we have to do a business case , " said an HSBC spokesman .
The datacentre will take two years to build and when complete will have 100 staff including IT .
" The building is designed to accommodate future IT job creation . "
The bank said the planned datacentre will be environmentally friendly .
Less than 25 % of the site will be built on , with the rest being used to improve ecological habitats and enhance wildlife .
It is considering using 100 % green tariff electricity as well as an aquifer to provide renewable cooling and exporting waste heat to an adjacent public swimming pool .
Skill composition of migration and the generosity of the welfare state
Alon Cohen , Assaf Razin
Do generous welfare states attract less - skilled immigrants ?
This column says yes , arguing that previous studies , which yielded mixed answers , failed to distinguish between open immigration regimes and those restricting immigration on the basis of skills .
Welfare state generosity is found to have a negative effect on the skill composition of immigrants under the free migration regime .
A number of European nations face a “ demographic disaster ” due to declining fertility .
Might migration solve Europe ’s population problem ?
Countries like Germany need both people and skills :
Germany 's labour market is already facing skill shortages , which will intensify from 2010 when the postwar baby boomers enter retirement .
When that happens , virtually all measures of economic dynamism , from gross domestic product per head to labour productivity , will plummet .
As the working population shrinks and the number of pensioners rises , its welfare state , which dishes out € 700bn a year in benefits to the elderly , the sick and the unemployed , will come under huge strain .
1
But there are also fears that low - skilled immigrants may add to that fiscal burden .
The idea that immigrants are attracted to the welfare state because of its benefits , in the form of social security , education , etc. , is well known .
A generous welfare program serves as a magnet to foreigners ( " welfare migration " ) .
Empirical evidence , addressing internal US migration , is inconclusive .
Some support the welfare migration notion ( Southwick 1981 , Gramlich and Laren 1984 , Blank 1988 , Borjas 1999 , Gelbach 2000 , McKinnish 2005 , 2007 ) ; others find no such evidence ( Walker 1994 , Levine and Zimmerman 1999 ) .
International migration studies also exhibit mixed results .
Pedersen at el. ( 2004 ) find that the tax - revenue - to - GDP ratio is negatively correlated with immigration flows from 129 countries of origin into 27 OECD countries .
Peridy ( 2006 ) , Leblang et al. ( 2007 ) and Warin and Svaton ( 2008 ) find positive effect of welfare - state benefits on immigration , from various countries into OECD countries .
De Giorgi and Pellizzari ( 2006 ) examined the immigration into the EU from outside the EU , finding that immigrants are attracted to welfare , with no significant difference across skill levels .
Docquier et al. ( 2006 ) explored immigration into OECD countries from 184 countries of origin .
They find that low - skilled immigrants are motivated by welfare benefits much more than high - skilled immigrants .
This indicates that even though the volume of immigrants increases with the generosity of the welfare state , their skill composition decreases .
None of these studies , however , distinguishes between the notion of " free migration " and " policy - controlled migration " .
Making such distinction , arguably , could explain the mixed results in the literature .
Free migration means that all individuals can freely move into the host country , reside , work and retire there .
The EU is an example of such regime .
EU members , in general , are obligated ( by international treaties ) to enable free entrance to any individual originated in other EU country .
Policy - controlled migration is exercised between any pair of countries that are not obligated to free migration .
Immigration quotas are such a policy .
Another sort , which becomes increasingly popular , is quality - selection migration policy .
The host country screens out less desirable immigrants .
Immigrants with high skills and education are preferred over immigrants with low skills and education .
Quality - selection immigration policy is well established in Australia , New Zealand and Canada .
The US also adopted such rules in 1990 , as have a growing number of EU countries , including France , Ireland and the UK ( Docquier and Marfouk 2006 ) .
Why is such a distinction of crucial importance ?
In the case of free migration , equilibrium reflects the preferences and constraints of migrants in source countries ( the " supply - side " ) .
In the case of policy - controlled migration the equilibrium reflects the attitudes of policymakers in the host country ( the " demand - side " ) .
In order to examine the effect of welfare on the skill composition of immigrants , one therefore must separate between the " demand - side " ( or more accurately , the " policy - side " ) and the " supply - side " effects , which are , in fact , operating in opposite directions .
Failing to distinguish between these migration regimes may bias estimates of the effect of welfare state generosity on immigrants ’ skill composition .
Theory
Consider first the supply - side effect , which accounts for the motivations of potential migrants in source countries .
Generous benefits of the welfare state may increase the volume of migrants .
However , while low - skilled individuals are attracted to a generous welfare state , high - skilled individuals may be deterred by such benefits .
A low - skilled immigrant opts for the country with generous benefits , as he or she is a net beneficiary of the tax - benefits scheme .
As a net contributor to the tax - benefits scheme , a high - skilled immigrant will likely opt for the country with moderate benefits .
Hence , the skill composition of immigrants , in equilibrium , is adversely affected by the welfare generosity of host countries ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 . Supply side – welfare benefits and immigrants ’ skills
Consider now the determination of immigration policy in the host country – the so - called " demand - side " .
Assume that policymakers represent the interests of their voters .
Generous welfare states require high taxes , imposing a fiscal burden on the high - skilled workers of the host country .
Therefore , the domestic low - and high - skilled voters support the admission of additional immigrants on a skill - selection basis , which mitigates the fiscal burden .
Indeed , although high - skilled workers ’ wages may be depressed by such a policy , domestic low - skilled workers support a maximum admission of high - skilled immigrants .
Therefore , the skill composition of immigrants , in equilibrium , is ( weakly ) positively affected by the welfare generosity of host countries ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 . Demand side – welfare benefits and immigrants ’ skills
Clearly , this simple intuition exhibits opposite effects of the welfare state on the skill composition of immigrants .
Our underlying assumption is that different migration regimes are dominated by different effects .
The " free migration " regime enables each person free entrance to the host country .
Therefore , the political considerations of the host country are irrelevant .
Thus one can expect the considerations of the potential immigrants to dominate .
The " policy - controlled " regime can be construed as determining simple quotas for differently skilled immigrants .
Therefore the considerations of the immigrants are irrelevant .
Thus one can expect the considerations of the host country to dominate .
Consequently , welfare state policy should have a negative effect on the skill composition of immigrants under the free migration regime .
On the other hand , welfare state policy should have a ( weak ) positive effect on the skill composition of immigrants under the policy - controlled regime .
Empirical evidence
We confront the predictions of the theory with cross-sectional data of source - host developed country pairs .
We decompose the data into two groups .
Group
A contains only source - host pairs of countries that allow free mobility of labour between them .
Any kind of discrimination between native - born and immigrants , regarding labour market accessibility and welfare - state benefits eligibility , is prohibited .
These are 16 European countries : Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , UK , Norway and Switzerland .
Group B includes only source - host pairs of countries within which the source country residents cannot freely move , work and get benefits in either of the host countries .
The host countries are the same 16 countries as in group A .
The source countries are 10 developed countries : US , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Israel , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Korea and Singapore .
This decomposition is vital to the identification strategy .
It embodies our threefold identification assumptions :
Immigration within group A is free , which identifies the effect of welfare on the considerations of the potential immigrants ( the " supply - side effect " ) .
Immigration within group B is controlled by policies of the host countries .
This assumption identifies the effect of welfare on the considerations of the host country ( the " demand / policy - side effect " ) .
The decomposition into groups A and B is exogenous to the skill composition of immigrants .
This assumption relies on the fact that this categorising , in fact , reflects the history of the EU establishment , since the post - WWII treaties .
It is safe to assume that these agreements were not signed with regard to the skill composition of their future immigrants .
Hence , the difference between the estimated parameter within group A and group B can also be identified .
We use the international immigration dataset introduced by Docquier and Marfouk ( 2006 ) .
It contains stocks of immigrants by the year 2000 , based on census and register data .
Immigrants are at working age ( 25 + ) , defined as foreign - born , subdivided into three classes of education level : low ( 0 - 8 schooling years ) , medium ( 9 - 12 schooling years ) and high ( 13 + schooling years ) .
Data for welfare - state benefits per capita is based on the OECD 's Analytical Database .
Social benefits encompass all kinds of social public expenditures , in cash or in kind , including old age transfers , incapacity related benefits , health care , unemployment compensations and so on .
The data is PPP - converted to 1990 US dollars .
We use lagged average rates for 1974 - 1990 .
We neutralise any country fixed - effect by using skill differences estimation .
We also neutralise any time - invariant omitted variables , by controlling for past migration stocks ( in 1990 ) .
Our findings match the predictions of the theory .
We observe a negative and significant impact of the welfare - state benefits over the skill composition of immigrants , when estimation is restricted to group A .
We also observe that the effect of welfare is significantly higher in group B , but not significantly different than zero .
These results repeat in several estimations , either with high - versus low - skilled , or , with medium - versus low - skilled .
It is also robust to different specifications of control variables .
The instrumental variables estimation , using legal origin of the host countries as IV , further validates these results .
The distinction between “ free migration ” and “ policy - controlled ” regimes may therefore explain the mixed results of previous studies of immigrants ’ skill composition and the generosity of welfare state benefits .
Welfare can be a migrant magnet , which may be an important consideration for European policymakers addressing their coming demographic and skill shortages .

MN Supremes : Count the Incorrectly Rejected Absentee Ballots
UPDATED 12/19/08 : Franken Currently Leads Count by 251 ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/18/2008 , 9:41 pm PT
[ UPDATED at end of article with today 's ( Friday 's ) latest numbers . ]
As thousands of challenged ballots from both Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) and challenger Al Franken ( D ) are being decided by the bi-partisan state canvassing board in the U.S. Senate race in MN , AP says it 's currently a 2 vote race , out of 2.9 million ballots cast , in favor of Franken .
That said , as all of the challenged ballots are finally counted over the next several days ( and weeks ) , the lead could go back and forth a bit each night .
The Star - Tribune , which puts today 's margin at 5 votes in favor of Coleman , currently projects that Franken will ultimately win by 89 votes ...
How the Strib comes to that final projection is unknown , as the MN Supreme Court ruled today that some 1600 incorrectly rejected absentee ballots --- never counted --- should now be counted .
Those ballots are believed to likely favor Franken if they ever actually get counted .
The Coleman camp had tried to keep that from happening by taking the the matter to the Supremes in a FL 2000 - style gambit to try and stop the counting of ballots .
But the court 's decision to allow the counting , as long as both campaigns and SoS Mark Ritchie agree to standards for ballot inclusion , leaves much room for Coleman to continue attempts at blocking the counting of legitimate votes , cast by legitimate voters improperly disenfranchised .
Both campaigns claimed " victory " from today 's ruling .
Politico reports that " Ritchie , who chairs the five - member Canvassing Board , said Thursday that the board may not finish ruling on disputed ballots until December 30 because of a recent influx of new challenges brought by the Coleman campaign . "
Though the contest is likely to be in dispute even beyond the end of the year .
" Litigation is inevitable , " Carleton College political science professor Steve Schier said .
" If Franken loses – he ’ll argue legitimate votes were not counted .
If Coleman loses , he ’ll argue illegitimate votes were counted . "
All of that said , we 're just happy there 's something to count ... and argue about .

It includes links to their latest numbers and headlines , since we remain on the road , frequently off the grid , and otherwise trying ( but largely failing ) to follow doctor 's orders .
UPDATE 12/19/08 : Following today 's counting of challenged ballots , Franken is now up by 251 votes , though thousands remain to be determined by the state canvassing board .
RAW STORY reports that the Strib 's projection of Franken winning by 89 ( which has now been updated to Franken by 78 ) is based on the paper 's tallies of all of the 6000 or so challenged ballots , but does not include the 1600 previously rejected absentee ballots .

The Republican National Committee is launching a Web video tomorrow raising questions about past ties between Obama and Gov. Rod Blagojevich ( D - Ill . ) .
The two - minute video , titled “ Questions Remain , ” puts pressure on the president - elect to disclose the contacts his transition team has had with Blagojevich .
Obama said this week that he will soon be releasing a full list of conversations that members of his staff had with Blagojevich – but he has not yet done so .
At a press conference earlier this week , Obama said he never personally spoke to the governor about his successor in the Senate – but it now appears that his incoming chief of staff Rahm Emanuel had discussed several names with the governor .
While Obama has never been close with the governor , the video points to several instances where they worked together as a matter of political convenience .
After Blagojevich won the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002 , Obama helped advise his campaign .
( Obama supported one of Blagojevich ’s opponents in the primary . )
And Obama endorsed Blagojevich when he ran for re-election in 2006 – a time when he was already under investigation over hiring and fundraising scandals .
( A Green party candidate took 10 percent of the vote , highlighting Democrats ’ dissatisfaction with him . )

An Egyptian engineering student was sentenced in the United States on Thursday to 15 years imprisonment after pleading guilty to uploading a 12 - minute video to YouTube that demonstrated how to convert a remote - control toy car into a bomb detonator .
In June , Ahmed Abdellatif Sherif Mohamed , 27 , pleaded guilty in a Florida federal court to one count of providing material support to terrorists .
He was a student at the University of South Florida .
South Carolina authorities said they found various bomb - making materials in the vehicle he was driving when he was pulled over last year .
The video , with his voice in Arabic , was discovered during a search of his laptop computer , the authorities said .
In the video , which the authorities said was viewed by the public hundreds of times , shows how to make a remote - control toy car from Walmart into a bomb detonator .
In court documents , ( .pdf ) he said " he intended the technology demonstrated in his audio - video recording to be used against those who fight for the United States . "
He said he considered them and their allies fighting in Arab countries to be " invaders . "
The United States , he said , was a " vile nation . "

The Failures Discovered in Diebold 's Tabulation System Are Even Worse Than Previously Reported ...
... And Never Would Have Been Found Were it Not for the ' Humboldt Transparency Project ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/12/2008 , 1:17 pm PT
Following up on the latest monumental failure by Diebold / Premier --- whose voting system was recently found by a citizens ' transparency project to have lost hundreds of ballots in a single precinct in Humboldt County , CA --- Wired 's Kim Zetter covered the issue earlier this week .
Her article touched on a number of technical issues involved in the failure of the Diebold GEMS central tabulator which , though we had n't noted them in our own coverage , are nonetheless important , even if somewhat down in the weeds , and perhaps most of note to technical election integrity geeks only .
As quoted below in some detail from Zetter 's report , she advances the story by noting :
The problem , which Diebold admits has been in its system for years , likely would n't have been noticed at all were it not for the unique , experimental , citizen - led " Humboldt Transparency Project . "
Even CA 's required 1 % random post-election " audit " would n't have uncovered the problem , since absentee ballots are not included in that audit .
The chances of the problem occurring , which resulted in ballots being deleted without notice by the Diebold GEMS tabulator , are rather high , even if chances of discovery of the error by election officials are very low .
Diebold 's explanation for the failure may or may not be legitimate .
The GEMS internal " audit logs " ( the GEMS system was used in 34 states around the nation last November ) are n't actually audit logs at all , and may not actually note the complete set of events which occurred on the voting system , even if anyone is allowed to review those logs in the first place .
Let 's take a look at the details ...
Thanks to the unique oversight program allowed by Humboldt County 's election chief Carolyn Crnich , the deck of some 200 absentee ballots scanned , but then deleted from the totals without notice by the Diebold / Premier GEMS tabulator , was discovered and the previously - certified results had to be corrected and re-certified .
The special project used open - source software , written locally , and off - the - shelf scanners to scan the same paper ballots that were scanned and tabulated by the Diebold op - scan system .
However , had it not been for that parallel counting project , using alternate hardware and software , the previously - certified results --- which did not include the ballots deleted by Diebold --- would have stood , and the lost ballots would likely never have been found , as Zetter notes :
It 's important to note that Crnich would never have discovered the problem through her standard canvassing procedures --- since the votes were still in the system after the canvas was completed --- nor would she have discovered it while conducting a mandatory manual audit that California counties are required to do .
The audit requires every county to hand - count ballots in 1 percent of randomly chosen precincts in order to compare the totals against digital tallies .
But the audit involves only ballots cast physically at a precinct , not mail - in ballots , which are the ballots that the Premier / Diebold system dropped in Humboldt .
Even if the Humboldt ballots had been precinct - cast ballots , Crnich would not have known they'd been dropped from the system if they were n't cast in a precinct that was included in the 1 percent of precincts that were hand counted .
But while the chances of the problem that occurred in Humboldt are actually very high , the chances of discovering the failure are low , unless the ballots are rescanned or recounted by an alternate system that actually works , like the one created by citizens , for free , on open - source software in Humboldt ...
Premier explained that due to a programming problem , the first " deck " or batch of ballots that is counted by the GEMS software sometimes gets randomly deleted if any subsequent deck is intentionally deleted .
The GEMS system names the first deck of ballots " deck 0 , " with subsequent batches called " deck 1 , " " deck 2 , " etc .
For some reason " deck 0 " is sometimes erased from the system if any other deck is erased .
Since it 's common for officials to intentionally erase a deck in the normal counting process if they 've made an error and want to rescan a deck , the chance that a GEMS system containing this flaw will delete a batch of ballots is pretty high .
The system never provides any indication to election officials when it 's deleting a batch of ballots in this manner .
That last graf , noting that no indication of the error is given to officials , is both troubling and reminiscent of Diebold 's other recent admission that its GEMS central tabulator --- on both the paper ballot systems and touch - screen systems --- routinely drops thousands of ballots when they are uploaded to the central GEMS server , but without giving any indication of that failure to the system administrator , who is left believing that all votes were properly recorded .
Ohio's Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner is currently suing Diebold / Premier over that particular failure , as she and I discussed in an exclusive interview late in the Summer , though no other state --- including California --- is currently suing Diebold / Premier to our knowledge .
That , even though the same GEMS system is currently used in some 34 states around the nation .
With all of this , however , it 's not even certain that the reason Diebold offers for the deletion of those ballots was actually the reason for the deletion , as noted by Zetter :
After examining Humboldt 's database , Premier determined that the " deck 0 " in Humboldt was deleted at some point in between processing decks 131 and 135 , but so far Crnich has been unable to determine what caused the deletion .
She said she did at one point abort deck 132 , instead of deleting it , when she made a mistake with it , but that occurred before election day , and the " deck 0 " batch of ballots was still in the system on November 23rd , after she 'd aborted deck 132 .
She could n't recall deleting any other deck after election night or after the 23rd that might have caused " deck 0 " to disappear in the manner Premier described .
And , as if all of that is not bad enough , as they say on Late - Night TV : But wait !
There 's more !
And , ultimately , it could be the worse flaw of all !
As it turns out , the GEMS system 's internal audit logs , used ( when election officials and / or courts will allow it ) to look back and determine what operations were actually carried out by the system and when , does n't appear to be a real " audit log " at all !
Rather , as Parke Bostrom , one of the Humboldt citizens who worked on the project described it , the audit log is actually a " ' re - imagining ' of what GEMS would like the audit log to be , based on whatever information GEMS happens to remember at the end of the vote counting process . "
The deletion of " deck 0 " was n't the only problem with the GEMS system .
As I mentioned previously , the audit log not only did n't show that " deck 0 " had been deleted , it never showed that the deck existed in the first place .
The system creates a " deck 0 " for each ballot type that is scanned .
This means , the system should have three " deck 0 " entries in the log --- one for vote - by - mail ballots , one for provisional ballots , and one for regular ballots cast at the precinct .
Crnich found that the log did show a " deck 0 " for provisional ballots and precinct - cast ballots but none for vote - by - mail ballots , even though the machine had printed a receipt at the time that an election worker had scanned the ballots into the machine .
In fact , the regular audit log provides no record of any files that were deleted , including deck 132 , which was deleted when Crnich intentionally aborted it .
She said she had to go back to a backup of the log , created before the election , to find any indication that " deck 0 " had ever been created .
Parke Bostrom , one of the Transparency Project volunteers , wrote in a blog post about the issue , " This means the audit log is not truly a ' log ' in the classical computer program sense , but is rather a ' re - imagining ' of what GEMS would like the audit log to be , based on whatever information GEMS happens to remember at the end of the vote counting process . "
Zetter did n't offer the link to Bostrom 's blog post , but it 's right here .
He notes , in addition to the points mentioned by Zetter above , what appears to be a contradiction to her reported information on the other two " deck 0 " batches --- for provisional ballots and for mail - ballot - precincts ( those precincts that are too small and remote to have actual physical precincts , so they are all done as vote - by - mail ) .
While Zetter notes that the other two " deck 0 " batches did show up as having been scanned in the " audit log , " in fact Bostrom notes that they " do not appear in the audit log , but apparently their votes are included in the final report . "
Not sure whether it 's Bostrom or Zetter who has that point correct , and I 've been on the road and out - of - pocket for weeks , so do n't have the time for the moment to find out .
But , suffice it to say , if we 're talking about " audit logs " that are made at the end of the process , instead of concurrently , as events occur , then they are worthless for purposes of auditing , no matter what .
Bostrom adds one other point of note in his blog item which illustrates just how difficult it is to audit the job that Diebold 's GEMS system --- again , it 's used in 34 states !
--- has done in scanning ballots , even if ( and that 's a big " if " ! ) officials and / or courts allow regular citizens to examine the system at all :
To the best of my knowledge , GEMS does not have the capability to export machine readable per precinct / per deck results in an easily analyzable format .
If GEMS had the capability to export machine readable information , it would be a lot easier to audit GEMS ( even without the [ Election Transparency Project software and hardware ] ) .
AS it stands , it is very difficult to notice that decks or precincts have been dropped from the final report due to this serious deficiency in the design of GEMS .
( If GEMS does have such a data export capability , no one has been able to tell me how to use it - not even Premier 's election support specialists . )
As we noted in our Monday coverageof this story , this entire sorry affair reveals yet again the enormous scam behind the entire federal e-voting legislation contained in the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) of 2002 , allocating some $ 3.9 billion for states to hand over to private voting machine corporations like Diebold for their proprietary trade secret - protected voting systems which do n't work .
In the meantime , on the other hand , a handful of citizens in Humboldt County , using fully open source code , developed at no cost to the county , with off - the - shelf commercial scanners , have created a system in a number of months that did a better job of counting ballots than Diebold , even with all of their millions / billions of tax - payer dollars , hundreds of programmers , secret hardware and software , and enormously expensive long - term maintenance contracts .
HAVA also created the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) which was supposed to have served as a " clearinghouse " for voting system problems such as the one that hit Humboldt .
The flaw in Diebold 's system has been known since 2004 , but the EAC failed to notify anybody about it , and has failed to set up any useful clearinghouse system at all , in the 6 years since HAVA was signed into law .
Given all of those failures , every jurisdiction in the country which insists on using optical - scanners should immediately look at moving over to the software and hardware developed by the citizens in Humboldt .
Diebold / Premier should be dumped , sued for fraud , malfeasance , and gross negligence and be put out of business --- at least the elections business --- once and for all .
As to what should happen to the EAC , we 'll leave that for now , for another day ...
Simply put , usability is making your website easy for your visitors to find the information they need when they need it .
A common misconception about usability amongst web companies is that usability is expensive .
Yes , there are multi-national companies that spend thousands of dollars on usability tests and research , but for an everyday company usability is achievable without the knowledge of usability experts or without expensive equipment for testing .
Web designers have an even easier job to do , just by reading usability articles they can accumulate a fairly good knowledge about usability basics and how to implement them on a website .
1. Include a Tagline
A tagline is a statement or a motto that represents a company ’s , or in our case a website ’s , philosophy and mission .
It should be the most obvious element on a website ’s front page and it should clearly describe the website in one phrase .
Statistics show that a website has just 8 seconds to capture a visitor ’s attention for them to browse the site further .
Without a clear tagline a website would have a hard time keeping visitors long enough to browse the inner pages .
2. Implement Site Search
As with taglines , site search is a very important element on a website .
When users are looking for something they typically look for a text field where they can enter their search term .
According to Jacob Nielsen ’s web usability tips , make this search box 27 characters wide in order for the text to be clearly visible and easy to use .
Place the search text field on the top of your web page , because users tend to search a website according to the F pattern , meaning from the top left to the bottom right .
Include a search button and clearly specify the search text , do n’t use text such as Go or Submit , because these expressions tend to mislead your website ’s visitors .
3. Do n’t Use Extensive Graphics
Abusive use of design elements and graphics are always bad for a website , they just mislead the site ’s visitors .
Only design to improve the web page not just to decorate it .
From a usability point of view , less is always more .
4. Use Site maps
Site maps are a relatively new website feature that improves web page navigation and also search engine optimization ( SEO ) .
Site maps in essence are a structural representation of a website ’s pages and architecture .
It can be a document in any form , or a web page that lists the pages on a web site , typically organized in hierarchical fashion .
Recently , search engines like Google , Yahoo and MSN have started offering a Sitemap protocol which is similar to a website ’s site map page , but the data is organized in XML format .
There are Sitemap XML generators that create these documents for a specific URL .
5. Do n’t Break the Workflow
By workflow we mean every operation that a user is doing on a website .
For example filling out a form , registering on a website , browsing categories , archives , etc .
Do n’t break these workflows , let the user cancel any operation .
By not letting the user cancel an operation , we ’re forcing them to finish it even if they do n’t want to .
Not every operation on a website is obvious for users , guide them through the specific workflow by using descriptive tips .
( e.g. when filling out a form ) .
Javascript links usually break the workflow , so it ’s not recommended to use them on your website .
Another mistake is not changing the color of visited links , this results in breaking the navigational design .
Let users know where they ’ve been and where they are on a website .
6. Create Easily Scannable Web Pages
Easy to read web pages plays an important role in maintaining visitors ’ loyalty , keeping them on your site and reading your content .
Usability tests show that the majority of users do n’t read web pages , they scan them , looking for titles , bold , emphasized text or lists .
Eye tracking studies conducted by Jakob Nielsen show that users read content that resembles an F shape , meaning that the reading starts from the upper left of the web page , next it moves down a little starting from the left again .
Nielsen also states the implications of this reading pattern :
Users wo n’t read a web page content word by word , they will extract important paragraphs , bold text , etc .
The first two paragraphs are essential on a web page .
These must contain the most important information that your visitors are looking for .
Sub headings and lists stands out from the regular paragraphs .
Use these elements to notify users on important information .
One important method that we can learn from traditional printed newspapers is that the journalists thought of a catchy headline and a catchy first paragraph to make readers read the whole article .
They organize the content in an inverted pyramid format , just picture an upside down pyramid .
The broad base represents the most important information in the whole article and the narrow tip represents the least important information .
We can use this format to organize web content by putting the most important pieces on top and the least important ones on the bottom , but how do we know which information is important and which is not ?
With the help of news values .
7. Do n’t Design Misleading UI Controls
By user interface ( UI ) controls we mean web page elements , components and widgets that a user can interact with ( e.g. a button , drop - down list ) .
Do n’t design graphic elements that looks like a button , but is not .
We often see text that is underlined and looks like links , but are not clickable .
By not having the action that the users were expecting , they would think that the site is broken and eventually leave .
One other important usability tip regarding UI controls is consistency :
Make sure that your UI controls are consistent .
Yahoo , as the above image shows too , is a good example of consistent UI control design .
Every tab on the page looks and behaves the same , every link is underlined on mouse over , every button looks the same , etc .
8. Give Meaningful Feedback
Meaningful feedback is essential for a website .
This is the communication channel between the site and the users , with the help of feedback we let the users know what ’s going on on the site .
In case of an error on your web page , do n’t just print Error occurred , instead write meaningful error messages which tell the user what went wrong and what actions they can perform from there .
Feedback works in both ways .
When a user fills in a form they are essentially giving you feedback .
Do n’t make the users have to fill in the same information twice .
For example if a user has registered on a website and needs to fill in a form at some point , do n’t ask for their name or any other information that they have already supplied , because these details already exist somewhere in a file or database .
By simply getting these details automatically we are simplifying the whole process .
9. Do Not Overuse Javascript
With the advent of Javascript and the AJAX technique , web designers and developers can create responsive , transparent websites , but as with all new technologies there is a cost .
In our case the cost is browser inconsistency .
Not every user has an up - to - date web browser .
They also might not have Javascript enabled by default .
By using Javascript on a website extensively we block out these users .
Instead use unobtrusive Javascript and graceful degradation .
10 . Avoid CAPTCHAs
CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart .
Even the name sounds complex .
The most general form of CAPTCHA is text embedded in an image and by testing visitors we can separate human users from spam bots .
The problem with CAPTCHAs are that each form of human verification method triggers a complex process in the users ’ brains ( e.g. figuring out the distorted text , adding two numbers , etc ) .
Another problem with CAPTCHAs are the inconsistencies regarding different cultures .
For example Chinese symbols , numerals are different from most western letters and Arabic numerals .
Chinese people have a much harder time using CAPTCHA ‘ enabled ’ online forms .
Summary
Always include a tagline which should be the most obvious element on a web page .
Implement a 27 characters wide site search and place it on top of your website .
Do n’t use extensive graphics and design elements .
Include a site map page and register a sitemap XML document in search engines .
Do n’t break a user ’s workflow .
Allow every action to be canceled if necessary .
Create easily scannable web content and place the most important information on top of your web page .
Do n’t design graphic elements that looks like a button , but is not .
Present meaningful feedback and do n’t forget that feedback works both ways .
Use unobtrusive Javascript and graceful degradation .
Avoid CAPTCHAs , use more usable methods instead .
Do you follow these principles ?

The iPhone Dev Team , best known for its PwnageTool and QuickPwn hack software , has confirmed the completion of the iPhone 3G unlock .
Those interested in jailbreaking their devices are advised not to upgrade to OS 2.2 using iTunes alone .
“ Over the Christmas break some of our members will be talking at the Chaos Computer Club ’s 25C3 Congress , ” a Dev-Team Blog post reads .
“ This talk will be a juicy technical talk relating to iPhone platform and our previous exploits .[...]
We have been working hard on a few other things .
The main one being the 3G unlock codenamed ' yellowsn0w . '
This is now completed and is currently being packaged into a user - friendly application with the simplicity that you see in QuickPwn or BootNeuter . ”
Some facts for visitors of the blog are also listed .
Readers are assumed to be OK with jailbreaks , hence the team 's advice of refraining from updating the iPhone 3 G 's baseband .
Read on for the details :
The target release date for the unlock is New Year ’s Eve 2008 .
This unlock method is available to iPhone 3Gs that have 2.11.07 baseband or earlier , we did warn you .
You can tell what version baseband you have by going to Settings -> General -> About -> Modem Firmware .
The unlock requires a jailbroken 3G iPhone .
It ’ll be installable via Cydia , and so it does n’t matter if you have a Mac or PC .
Please refrain from updating your baseband , regardless of what version you ’re at .
We ’ll have complete directions on New Year ’s Eve .
We ’ll stream a live demo of the unlock before Christmas ( see the update at the end of this post ) .
It has been recently revealed that the newly - released Mac OS X 10.5.6 update keeps Macs from recognizing the iPhone in DFU mode , making it impossible to jailbreak / unlock it using PwnageTool or QuickPwn .
Taking on the DFU Issues in OS X 10.5.6 , the Dev Team explains that “ Lots of users have been experiencing problems with the use of DFU mode after applying yesterday ’s 10.5.6 system update .
We believe this behavior is due to a kernel bug not a specific countermeasure by Apple . ”
The team offers some workarounds , but asks not to be held responsible should anything bad happen .
It 's probably best if you wait until New Year 's Eve to jailbreak your device .
Of course , it 's probably even better to read the text in red and act accordingly .

A single cell may spell danger Cancer researchers may have underestimated the power of some cancers to spread and cause new tumours , say US researchers .
They found just one skin cancer cell was often enough to generate a whole new tumour .
The finding , published in the journal Nature , undermines hopes that only certain types of cancer cell could fuel the spread of the disease .
UK experts said more work was needed to pinpoint exactly how cancer cells work .
We think the underestimation of tumour - causing cells is a general problem in many cancers
Dr Sean Morrison
Howard Hughes Medical Institute
The cancer studied by the team from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the University of Michigan was melanoma , well known for its ability to spread lethally from a single site .
Normally the ability of a single cell to " seed " a new tumour is tested by injecting large quantities into mice with weakened immune systems and counting how many tumours emerge .
The relatively small proportion of tumours supported the view of many scientists that not all cancer cells could trigger a new tumour , and that this ability was confined to a smaller number of specialist " cancer stem cells " .
However , Dr Sean Morrison , who led the latest work , said that this approach was flawed because the mice still had some immunity to these human cancer cells , leading to a significant underestimation of their potency .
One in four First his team injected melanoma cells into mice with even more severely weakened immune systems , and found that 250,000 times as many of them formed tumours .
When single melanoma cells were used , they discovered that roughly one in four of them went on to seed new tumours .
He said : " As far as we know , this is the first time anyone has been able to show that individual cells from human cancers can efficiently form tumours . "
For this reason , identifying and targeting a small subset of these cells just would not work , he said .
" We think the underestimation of tumour - causing cells is a general problem in many cancers , not just specific to melanoma . "
He said that researchers needed to make their tests better to see if their cancers were equally potent .
In addition , his team used a battery of tests , but could find nothing marking out any of the cells as potential " cancer stem cells " .
While this did not disprove their existence , he said , it could mean that some cancers , such as melanomas , were " good old - fashioned cancer " , in which every cell was dangerous .
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK , Ed Yong , said that the idea that tumours grew from a tiny number of " cancer stem cells " was one of the " most interesting " in current research .
" But this study suggests that it may not be true for every type of cancer - in melanoma , a much larger proportion of cancer cells are able to give rise to a new tumour .
" It shows how important it is that we continue to fund research into how cancers develop at a fundamental level . "

Eva Mendes who is in a relationship with producer George Gargurevich — loves the feeling of being looked after by her boyfriends .
She said , “ The flip side to this strong career woman you see is a woman who loves being her man 's woman .
It 's just sexy to belong to a man .
Of course , we do n't belong to anyone but ourselves , but how boring .
There 's a certain part of me that 's like , ' Please take care of me ' .
It 's just a natural thing .
But I 'm not sure if every woman has it . "
Eva , 34 , also said she hates jealous men and would instantly end a relationship if her partner showed any signs of envy .
She added to Esquire magazine , “ Jealousy is the one thing I can't tolerate in a guy . ”
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed Wednesday that Israel 's air assault on Gaza would not end until Hamas militants quit firing rockets into Israeli territory .

" We did not enter this operation in order to end it with the firing still continuing , " Olmert said in a security cabinet meeting , according to a senior government official .
" Hamas broke this cease - fire , " Olmert said .
" If the conditions ripen " and if there is a solution " that promises a better security ... we will consider it , but we are not there yet , " he said , according to the official .
Despite a French proposal for a humanitarian truce , Israel earlier Wednesday decided to continue the operation , saying Israelis must have a " real and sustainable solution , " Olmert spokesman Mark Regev said .
Israeli airstrikes have pounded the territory since Saturday in an effort to halt the firing of rockets into southern Israel .
More than 390 Palestinians have been killed , according to Palestinian medical sources , and some 1,900 people have been wounded , including 400 women and children .
Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya , whose office in Gaza was struck overnight , said Israel needed to " stop attacking and killing our children , women and men . "
" The aggression must stop , the crossings must open and the blockade must be lifted and then we can talk about all other issues , " he said in televised comments Wednesday .
" Then we can start a national dialogue without any preset conditions . "
Israeli sources say four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire .
The Israeli air force carried out about 40 airstrikes Wednesday , and Palestinian militants fired about 70 rockets into Israel , the IDF said .
More than 30 rockets landed in southern Israel on Wednesday , including at least four in Beer Sheva , Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said .
Beer Sheva , about 25 miles away from Gaza , is the farthest that rockets from Gaza have ever landed inside Israel .
" Israel will not accept a ' Strip of Terror ' alongside us , and accordingly Hamas operatives have tasted the flavor of Israel 's response in the last few days , " Israeli President Shimon Peres said .
Watch what may be influencing Israeli decision - making »
The situation in Gaza remains desperate , despite the admission of more than 150 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into the territory on Tuesday , said Karen AbuZayd , the commissioner - general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency .
Watch aid trucks cross the border from Egypt »
" There 's no fuel , there 's no power plant , there 's no electricity working now , " she said .
" Hundreds of families in the Gaza Strip are suffering , not only [ from ] the fear of airstrikes , but also the lack of electricity , lack of water , lack of food supplies , " Saud Abu Ramadan , a freelance journalist who lives in Gaza City , told CNN's " American Morning . "
Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal is ready to stop the fighting in exchange for an end to Israel 's blockade of Gaza , the Russian Foreign Ministry announced .
Mashaal spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday and outlined Hamas ' position on the resumption of the Palestinian reconciliation process , the foreign ministry said .
" Mashaal said in response to [ Lavrov ] that they are ready to end the armed confrontation , but only if these measures are linked to steps intended to remove the Gaza Strip 's blockade , " the ministry said .
While living in self - imposed exile in Damascus , Syria , Mashaal remains the head of Hamas , which controls Gaza .

Earlier Wednesday , the Israeli military warned neighbors of Hamas co-founder Mahmoud al - Zahar to leave because it may bomb the area , the neighbors told CNN .
Al - Zahar was the Palestinian foreign minister under the Hamas - led government before it was dissolved by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 .
Al - Zahar 's son was killed in an Israeli airstrike in January 2008 .
Israel has moved tanks to the outskirts of Gaza and called up at least 2,000 army reservists , sparking fears of a ground incursion into the Palestinian territory .
Watch how Israel is sitting on Gaza 's border »
The Israeli military says it is targeting only Hamas militants .
But the U.N. 's AbuZayd said 20 to 25 percent of the casualties arriving in Gaza hospitals appear to be civilians , and she said the bombardment is not turning the people of the territory against Hamas .
" Hamas is not the one being blamed .
It 's still Israel , America , " she said .

Update : Beta 2 Released !
See the Gaebar Beta 2 announcement .
Here 's my Christmas present for the Google App Engine community : Google App Engine Backup and Restore ( or Gaebar , for short ) .
Gaebar is an easy - to - use , standalone Django application that you can plug in to your existing Google App Engine Django or app- engine - patch - based Django applications on Google App Engine to give them datastore backup and restore functionality .
For a quick overview of Gaebar , watch the screencast , above .
For the impatient , links to the project pages where you can download Gaebar follow .
Downloads
Gaebar is hosted on GitHub .
You can either download archives or clone the repository ( or install Gaebar as a git submodule ) via git .
Alongside the Gaebar project itself are two sample applications — one built on Google App Engine Django and the other on app - engine - patch — that contain the Gaebar functional test suite .
The functional test suite tests every datatype supported by Google App Engine as well as references , Expandos , and ancestor relationships .
Please make sure you read the readme files after downloading the projects for installation and usage instructions .
What you can do with Gaebar
Backup your deployment application 's datastore for safekeeping .
Restore that backup on your local development server for testing with real data during development .
Restore that backup to a different Google App Engine application and use that application as a staging application much in the same way you would use a staging server in traditional development .
( You can , of course , also backup and restore your local development datastore as well as your staging application , etc. )
I 've got a huge datastore , will Gaebar work for me ?
Congratulations on the impressive size of your datastore !
The answer should be " yes ! "
The largest datastore I 've tested it with is the < head > web conference datastore .
The latest backup had 18 , 969 rows from 14 models backed up into 225 code shards .
What 's a staging application ?
A staging application is a new Google App Engine concept made possible by Gaebar .
Basically , if your application is myapp.appspot.com , you can use a separate application ( say , myapp- staging.appspot.com ) in the same way as you would use a staging server in traditional development .
Your staging application can let you try out new features and test with real data without having your users see your changes until you are ready to deploy to your main application .
In fact , it 's a perfect staging environment since it is identical to your deployment environment .
For an example of this , see the screencast .
How Gaebar works
Gaebar backs up the data in your datastore to Python code .
It restores your data by running the generated Python code .
Since a backup is a long running process , and since Google App Engine does n't support long - running processes , Gaebar fakes a long running process by breaking up the backup and restore processes into bite - sized chunks and repeatedly hitting the server via Ajax calls .
By default , Gaebar backs up 5 rows at a time to avoid the short term CPU and 10 - second call duration quotas and splits the generated code into code shards of approx .
300 KB to avoid the 1MB limit on objects .
You can change these defaults in the views .
py file if your app has higher quotas and you want faster backups and restores .
Once a backup of a remote server is complete , Gaebar automatically hits your local development server .
From there on , the local development server makes a series of calls to the remote server to download the backup files ( code shards ) from the remote server .
Once the backup is complete , you will see a new backup folder in gaebar / backups with the contents of your backup .
Here 's an example of some generated backup code from the Google App Engine Django test application ( updated for the upcoming Beta 2 release ) :
import pickle from google .appengine.api.datastore import datastore_types from app1.models import * from app2.models import * def row_0 ( app_name ) : existing_entity = Profile.get(datastore_types.Key.from_path(' Profile ' , 1 , _app=app_name ) ) if existing_entity : existing_entity.delete( ) profile_0 = Profile ( key_name= " id1 " , friends = pickle.loads ('( lp0
.' ) , in_relationship_with = pickle.loads ( ' N. ' ) , full_name = pickle.loads ( ' VPaul Booth
p0
.' ) ) profile_0.put ( ) def row_1 ( app_name ) : existing_entity = Profile.get(datastore_types.Key.from_path(' Profile ' , 2 , _app=app_name ) ) if existing_entity : existing_entity.delete( ) profile_1 = Profile ( key_name= " id2 " , full_name = pickle.loads ( ' VAral Balkan
p0
.' ) , friends = [ datastore_types.Key.from_path(' Profile ' , u'stephalicious ' , _app=app_name ) , datastore_types.Key.from_path(' Profile ' , 'id1 ' , _app=app_name ) ] , in_relationship_with = datastore_types.Key.from_path(' Profile ' , u'stephalicious ' , _app=app_name ) ) profile_1.put ( )
To restore , you simply deploy your application , along with the backup folder , to your deployment environment and hit the Restore button in Gaebar .
( If you have a large datastore both the backup and restore processes will take a long time , especially when restoring to a local development server . )
The restore process simply calls each of the generated row functions and each row function restores a single row into the datastore .
A note on the screencast
When mentioning how to install Gaebar , I left out that you also need to add the URL mapping for Gaebar to your application 's urls .py .
That , along with the rest of the installation instructions are in the readme .
txt file , which I highly recommend that you peruse .
Have your say !
As in all things , my approach to blog posts is that they should evolve over time and your feedback is invaluable in achieving this by helping me fix factual errors , fill in details , and expand the original post .
What do you think of Gaebar ?
Have you run into any issues that need fixing ?
Do you have other suggestions on how to improve it ?
Or do you , perhaps , have a patch to send me that adds Webapp support or some other feature ?
Leave me a comment and let me know !

Broken Arrow Nuclear Weapon Accidents
Has the United States or any other country ever had a plane carrying a nuclear bomb crash ?
Has a nuclear weapon ever been lost ?
- question from Sandy Joulkowski
At least three dozen serious accidents and incidents involving atomic or nuclear weapons have occurred since 1950 .
Many of these cases cost the lives of military personnel , led to the release of radioactive material , or resulted in the loss of the weapon itself .
Most of these weapons fell into the ocean where the nuclear material could not be recovered given the limits of current technology .
It is estimated that over 50 nuclear warheads have been lost in the world 's oceans following aircraft or naval accidents .
Another 26 nuclear reactors from ships and submarines have also been lost or deliberately dumped at sea .

Before explaining these accidents in greater detail , it is helpful to explain how a nuclear accident or incident is categorized .
The US Department of Defense has adopted the following definitions .
Nuclear Weapon Accident :
An unexpected event involving nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons components that results in any of the following .
Accidental or unauthorized launching , firing , or use , by US or allied forces , of a nuclear - capable weapon system that could create the risk of an outbreak of war
Nuclear detonation , non-nuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon or radioactive weapon component , including a fully assembled nuclear weapon , an unassembled nuclear weapon , or radioactive nuclear weapon components
Radioactive contamination
Seizure , theft , or loss of a nuclear weapon component , including jettisoning
Public hazard whether it be actual or implied
An increase in possibility of explosion or radioactive contamination
Errors committed in the assembly , testing , loading or transportation of equipment , and / or the malfunctioning of equipment and material that could lead to an unintentional operation of all or part of the weapon arming and / or firing sequence , or that could lead to a substantial change in yield , or increased dud probability
Any act of God , unfavorable environment , or conditions resulting in damage to the weapon , facility or component
Nucflash :
Any accidental or unauthorized incident involving a possible detonation of a nuclear weapon by US forces that could create the risk of nuclear war .
Broken Arrow :
The accidental or unauthorized detonation , or possible detonation of a nuclear weapon ( other than war risk ) including the non-nuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon ; radioactive contamination ; or seizure , theft , or loss of a nuclear weapon or component ( including jettisoning ) .
Bent Spear :
Any nuclear weapon significant incidents other than accidents or war risk detonations .
Dull Sword :
Any nuclear weapon incident other than significant incidents .
Faded Giant :
Any nuclear reactor or radiological accidents involving equipment used in connection with naval nuclear reactors or other naval nuclear energy devices while such equipment is under the custody of the Navy .
Mk 4 atomic bomb like that lost in 1950
13 February 1950 : While flying a simulated combat mission from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska to Carswell AFB in Texas , a B - 36 Peacemaker bomber experienced engine problems .
The aircraft was carrying a single Mk 4 atomic bomb containing depleted uranium , but the plutonium core required for a fission reaction had been removed .
Ice buildup on the carburetors forced the pilot to shut down three engines and reduced the power output of the remaining three .
As weather conditions continued to worsen , the crew decided to abandon the aircraft .
The unarmed bomb was jettisoned over the Pacific Ocean and its conventional explosives either detonated in mid-air or upon impact with the water .
The plane then turned over a nearby island where the crew bailed out .
Twelve were rescued from the frigid conditions but five were never found .
The B - 36 apparently continued on autopilot for a considerable distance before crashing in northern British Columbia .
The wreck was later located and studied to confirm that no nuclear material remained aboard .
11 April 1950 : All thirteen crewmembers aboard an American B - 29 Superfortress were killed when their plane crashed near Kirtland AFB in New Mexico shortly after takeoff .
The bomber had been carrying an atomic bomb with its nuclear core stored separately and four spare detonators .
The impact of the crash and a massive fire destroyed the outer casing of the bomb , and its high explosives detonated when exposed to burning fuel .
Since the weapon was partially disassembled for safety , there was no chance of an atomic explosion .
All nuclear components were recovered from the accident scene intact and no radiation leak was detected .
13 July 1950 : A B - 50 Superfortress from Biggs AFB in Texas was on a training flight when the bomber pitched nose down and crashed near Lebanon , Ohio .
All sixteen crew were killed .
The conventional high explosives of an onboard atomic weapon detonated on impact , but the plane carried no nuclear capsule .
5 August 1950 : A US Air Force B - 29 carrying an unarmed atomic bomb with no fissile core was taking off from Fairfield - Suisun AFB in California when the bomber experienced several malfunctions .
While attempting an emergency landing , the plane crashed and burst into flames .
The fire set off the bomb 's high explosives killing 19 crewmembers and rescue personnel .
Among the fatalities was Brigadier General Robert Travis , and the base was later renamed in his honor .
10 November 1950 : A B - 50 Superfortress was ferrying a Mk 4 atomic weapon from Canada to a base in the United States when it suffered engine trouble .
Fearing they could not make an emergency landing while carrying the heavy weapon , the crew jettisoned the bomb over the St. Lawrence River off the shore of Quebec .
The weapon was set to self - destruct and detonated in mid-air .
A plutonium core was not installed but the explosion scattered some 100 lb ( 45 kg ) of depleted uranium across the river below .
10 March 1956 : A B - 47 Stratojet of the US Air Force disappeared while carrying the cores of two nuclear weapons in special transport cases .
The aircraft was on a non -stop flight eastward from MacDill Air Force Base in Florida to an overseas base .
Two in - flight refuelings were scheduled along the way .
While the first was completed successfully , the B - 47 never reached the second tanker over the Mediterranean Sea .
The plane presumably went down somewhere over the Mediterranean but no trace of the plane , its crew , or its nuclear payload was ever found despite an extensive search .
B - 47 Stratojet strategic bomber
27 June 1956 : An accident occurred at the NATO air base at Lakenheath , England , when an American B - 47 bomber skidded off the runway and crashed into a storage igloo .
The facility contained three Mk 6 atomic bombs but no nuclear cores .
The weapons were quickly engulfed in flames by burning jet fuel from the B - 47 , but firefighters were able to extinguish the conflagration quickly .
A bomb disposal expert on the scene concluded it was , " ... a miracle that one Mark six with exposed detonators sheared did n't go . "
22 May 1957 : An Air Force B - 36 bomber was ferrying a Mk 17 bomb weighing 42,000 lb ( 19,050 kg ) from Biggs AFB in Texas to Kirtland AFB in New Mexico .
During the landing approach , the bomb broke loose and tore part of the bomb bay doors off the plane as it fell .
Although a retarding parachute deployed , it had little effect because of the plane 's low altitude .
The bomb 's conventional explosives detonated as it impacted in a cow pasture in Albuquerque just south of the base .
The blast completely destroyed the bomb leaving a large crater 12 ft ( 3.6 m ) deep and 25 ft ( 7.6 m ) across .
Debris was scattered over a wide area with some pieces found nearly a mile away .
The weapon 's nuclear capsule was aboard the plane but was carried separately eliminating the possibility of a nuclear detonation .
Low levels of radioactivity were detected but were contained completely within the impact crater .
28 July 1957 : A C - 124 Globemaster II cargo plane of the US Air Force left Dover AFB in Delaware transporting three nuclear weapons and one fissile core stored separately .
Shortly into the flight , the plane lost power to two engines .
The crew determined the plane could not maintain flight with the weight of the cargo and decided to jettison two of the weapons overboard .
The weapons sank off the coast of New Jersey and were never located .
The C - 124 was able to make an emergency landing near Atlantic City with the remaining weapon and nuclear capsule .
11 October 1957 : A B - 47 had just taken off from Homestead AFB in Florida when one of its outrigger tires exploded .
The plane crashed and fire engulfed an atomic weapon and its nuclear core stored in a separate case .
The fire smoldered for about four hours during which two low order detonations of the conventional explosives were observed .
Much of the weapon had been destroyed but the nuclear capsule was recovered intact with no radiation released .
31 January 1958 : The first accident involving a fully operational armed nuclear weapon occurred at a base in Morocco .
A B - 47 was conducting a simulated takeoff when one of its landing gear wheels failed and the plane 's tail struck the ground .
The impact ruptured one of the bomber 's fuel tanks causing a fire .
The onboard bomb was damaged but did not detonate after lying in a smoldering fire for seven hours .
Some radioactive contamination was detected in the immediate vicinity but was cleaned .
5 February 1958 : An Air Force B - 47 Stratojet from Homestead AFB was on a simulated combat mission when the plane collided with an F - 86 Sabre near Savannah , Georgia .
The B - 47 was carrying one Mk 15 hydrogen bomb without its core at the time of the accident .
The plane made three unsuccessful landing attempts at Hunter Air Force Base before the weapon was jettisoned over the Atlantic Ocean to avoid the risk of a high explosive detonation at the base .
The bomb was dropped several miles from the mouth of the Savannah River in Wassaw Sound off Tybee Island .
Though an intensive nine - week search was launched using divers and sonar equipment , the weapon was never found .
Another unsuccessful search was mounted in 2001 , and reports of radiation detected less than a mile from shore led to speculation of the bomb 's discovery in 2004 .
Further investigation concluded the radioactivity was naturally occurring and the weapon remains missing .
Mk 15 hydrogen bomb
11 March 1958 : A B - 47E carrying an unarmed atomic weapon without a fissile core departed Savannah , Georgia , on a routine training flight .
While flying over Florence , South Carolina , the bomb lock failed and the warhead fell onto a house in the suburban neighborhood below .
The impact set off the conventional explosives causing several injuries on the ground .
4 November 1958 : While taking off from Dyess AFB in Texas , a B - 47 bomber of the US Air Force caught fire .
The three crew ejected , although one was killed , and the plane crashed while carrying one atomic weapon .
The conventional explosives were set off by the crash creating a large crater , but all nuclear components were recovered .
26 November 1958 : A B - 47 Stratojet caught fire while on the ground at Chennault AFB in Louisiana .
The conflagration destroyed an onboard weapon releasing some radioactive contamination in the immediate vicinity of the wreckage .
18 January 1959 : An American F - 100 Super Sabre was on the ground conducting a practice alert at a base in the Pacific .
The aircraft was carrying three external fuel tanks and a nuclear weapon without a nuclear capsule .
As the starter button was depressed , the external fuel tanks were accidentally jettisoned causing an explosion .
The fire was put out quickly and no contamination was detected .
6 July 1959 : While taking off from Barksdale AFB in Louisiana , a C - 124 transport carrying one nuclear weapon crashed .
The resulting fire destroyed the weapon but safety devices prevented any nuclear or conventional explosions .
A small amount of radioactive contamination was found directly beneath the weapon .
25 September 1959 : A P - 5M Marlin patrol aircraft of the US Navy was conducting a mission off Whidbey Island , Washington , while carrying one unarmed nuclear depth charge without its fissile core .
The aircraft crashed into Puget Sound and the weapon was never recovered .
12 October 1959 : An American B - 52 Stratofortress had rendezvoused with a KC - 135 Stratotanker near Hardinsberg , Kentucky .
As the B - 52 was being refueled , the two planes collided .
Five of the bomber 's nine crew and all four aboard the tanker were killed .
The B - 52 also carried two unarmed nuclear weapons that were recovered intact with little or no damage .
B - 52 Stratofortress strategic bomber
7 June 1960 : A BOMARC air defense missile in storage at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey was destroyed after a high - pressure helium tank burst .
The blast ruptured the missile 's fuel tanks and ignited a large fire .
Although the warhead was also destroyed , its high explosives did not detonate and contamination was limited to a small area .
24 January 1961 : An Air Force B - 52 was carrying two 20 - megaton Mk 39 hydrogen bombs while on airborne alert over North Carolina .
While flying at an altitude of 10,000 ft ( 3,050 m ) , leaking fuel in the right wing caused a mid-air explosion and a major structural failure .
The wreckage fell to Earth near Goldsboro killing three of eight crew , and the two weapons came free of the plane as it broke apart .
One of the bombs deployed its parachute and landed with minimal damage .
The second , however , struck the ground and broke apart spreading its components over a wide area .
Reports suggest the weapon nearly detonated since five of its six safety devices failed and only a single switch prevented a catastrophe .
The Air Force launched a massive search of the area and recovered the bomb 's plutonium , but most of the thermonuclear stage including highly enriched uranium was never found .
To prevent its accidental discovery at a later date , the service purchased and fenced off the property and monitors it regularly for radiation .
The accident prompted the US to develop improved safeguards to prevent accidental nuclear detonations , and the Soviet Union was encouraged to do likewise .
14 March 1961 : A failure of the pressurization system aboard a B - 52 and lack of fuel forced the crew to abandon the bomber near Yuba City , California .
Two nuclear weapons aboard the plane were torn loose when it struck the ground , but safeguards worked properly and prevented any detonation .
No radioactive contamination was released .
4 June 1962 : The United States attempted its first high - altitude atmospheric nuclear test by placing a nuclear device atop a Thor rocket .
The rocket was launched from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean but the tracking system failed during flight and the rocket had to be destroyed .
The rocket 's nuclear payload is believed to have vaporized before reaching the ocean .
20 June 1962 : A second attempt to detonate a nuclear weapon at high altitudes also failed when the Thor booster rocket shut down prematurely a minute after launch .
The vehicle had to be destroyed at an altitude of about 35,000 ft ( 10,670 m ) above Johnston Atoll .
The nuclear device being tested also fell into the Pacific Ocean and was not recovered , but pieces of debris contaminated by plutonium were found around the island .
Launch of a
Thor booster rocket
10 April 1963 : The USS Thresher ( SSN - 593 ) was an American nuclear - powered attack submarine .
While on a test to its maximum diving depth , an accident occurred that caused the vessel to sink in the Atlantic Ocean about 220 miles ( 355 km ) east of Cape Cod , Massachusetts .
The leading theory is a pipe in the engine room ruptured under the great pressure at its depth causing the nuclear reactor to shut down .
Without power , the Thresher had no ability to surface and continued diving until the increasing water pressure crushed the hull .
It is not believed the submarine was carrying any nuclear weapons at the time of its sinking but the Thresher did take its reactor and 129 men to the ocean floor 8,400 ft ( 2,560 m ) deep .
Later investigation of the wreckage indicated the Thresher had been violently torn apart as it sank but the reactor compartment remained intact .
The accident led to a major program to improve the quality of welding in submarine hulls that has been successful to this day .
13 November 1963 : The US Atomic Energy Commission operated a facility in Medina , Texas , where obsolete nuclear weapons were disassembled .
An explosion in a storage igloo at the site involved 123,000 lb ( 55,800 kg ) of high explosive components causing minor injuries to three employees .
Low levels of radioactive contamination from nuclear components stored in another part of the structure was detected .
13 January 1964 : A B - 52D bomber enroute from Massachusetts to Georgia crashed near Cumberland , Maryland , due to strong turbulence and structural failure .
Only two of the five crewmembers survived .
The plane was carrying two nuclear weapons in a ferry configuration , and these were recovered with minor damage .
21 April 1964 : The United States had launched a Transit - 5 BN - 3 nuclear - powered navigational satellite that failed to reach orbit and burned up over the Indian Ocean .
The satellite 's nuclear reactor partially burned during re-entry releasing small amounts of plutonium into the stratosphere .
The remainder of the reactor fell into the ocean .
Maintaining a Minuteman missile in its silo
5 December 1964 : During maintenance operations at a Minuteman I nuclear missile silo in South Dakota , a retrorocket below the Re-entry Vehicle ( RV ) fired and caused the RV to fall about 75 ft ( 20 m ) to the silo floor .
The RV's arming and fusing system was torn loose removing power , and safety devices prevented any possibility of detonation .
Although the RV was damaged considerably by the fall , no radioactive contamination escaped .
8 December 1964 : A B - 58 Hustler bomber was taxiing into position for takeoff at what became Grissom AFB in Indiana when it slid off the runway and caught fire .
The three crew ejected but one perished due to a hard impact of his escape capsule .
Five nuclear weapons were aboard the plane and several were damaged in the fire .
Contamination was released but confined to the immediate vicinity of the wreckage .
February 1965 : The Soviet icebreaker Lenin suffered a nuclear reactor accident that fatally irradiated 30 crew .
The vessel 's nuclear fuel and other heavily contaminated materials were removed and dumped in Tsivoli Bay in 1967 .
11 October 1965 : Minor contamination occurred when a C - 124 transport caught fire as it was being fueled at Wright - Patterson AFB in Ohio .
The plane was carrying nuclear weapon components but no complete weapons .
The contamination was removed by normal cleaning .
5 December 1965 : The US Navy aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga was returning from a Vietnam deployment to the naval base at Yokusuka , Japan .
While cruising about 70 miles ( 110 km ) from the Ryukyu Islands , an A - 4E Skyhawk attack plane rolled over the side of the ship with its pilot aboard .
The plane was carrying one B - 43 thermonuclear bomb at the time .
The plane , its pilot , and the bomb sank in water 16,000 ft ( 4,875 m ) deep and could not be recovered .
Because of the great pressure at that depth , some have expressed concern that the weapon might have imploded spreading radioactive material , but there is no evidence this occurred .
B - 43 nuclear bomb
17 January 1966 : One of the most embarrassing accidents in the history of nuclear weapons occurred when a B - 52 Stratofortress carrying four B - 28 thermonuclear bombs suffered a mid-air collision with a KC - 135 tanker .
The B - 52 was on airborne alert and conducting a routine air refueling while returning to Seymour Johnson AFB in North Carolina .
The bomber was attempting its third refueling over the village of Palomares , Spain , when the nozzle of the tanker 's boom struck the plane .
The boom ripped open the B - 52 causing it to break into pieces while the KC - 135 's payload of jet fuel exploded , destroying the aircraft and killing its crew of seven .
The debris of the two planes scattered over 100 square miles ( 260 sq km ) .
One of the bomber 's four weapons came down on land with minor damage while a second was lost in the ocean .
This Broken Arrow was later recovered intact after one of the largest search and recovery operations ever mounted .
The three month search required 33 ships and over 3,000 Navy personnel before the weapon was recovered .
While these two weapons suffered little damage , the high explosive casing of the other two bombs detonated upon impacting land spreading low levels of radioactive contamination over Palomares and the surrounding countryside .
Under pressure from the local inhabitants , the US collected and transported 1,400 tons of contaminated soil and vegetation from Spain to the United States for storage .
Early 1967 : Although the date and details remain a mystery , the Soviet icebreaker Lenin suffered a second nuclear reactor accident .
The vessel had to be abandoned for over a year until radiation levels dropped low enough for repairs to be made .
The ship 's three reactors were removed and dumped into the Kara Sea .
Two new reactors were installed and the ship re-entered service in 1970 .
21 January 1968 : An American B - 52 from Plattsburgh AFB in New York was on airborne alert in the Arctic Circle when a fire broke out in the navigator 's compartment .
As the plane approached Thule AFB in Greenland to attempt an emergency landing , it crashed about 7 miles ( 11 km ) southwest of the runway while carrying four nuclear bombs .
The B - 52 burst into flames as it impacted causing the high explosive casing on at least one of the weapons to detonate .
The blast spread radioactive plutonium from the bomb 's inner core about 1,000 ft ( 305 m ) to either side of the wreck .
Due to the intensity of the fire , two of the four bombs fell through the melting ice and sank to the ocean floor .
One of these Broken Arrows was not recovered until 1979 , and the second weapon remains lost on the floor of Baffin Bay .
11 April 1968 : The Soviet Golf II class diesel - powered ballistic missile submarine K - 129 sank over 16,000 ft ( 4,875 m ) deep in the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles northwest of Hawaii .
The entire crew of 98 was lost and the vessel sank with three ballistic nuclear missiles plus two nuclear torpedoes .
The reason for the sinking is unknown , but evidence suggests an explosion in the battery compartment or a missile tube .
In one of the most amazing tales of the Cold War , America 's Central Intelligence Agency launched " Project Azorian " to recover the vessel and its nuclear weapons from the deep seabed .
The CIA secretly funded the construction of a massive ship called the Glomar Explorer that was ostensibly built for undersea mining .
In reality , the vessel carried an enormous crane designed to grapple the Soviet submarine and lift it to the surface for study .
It is unknown how successful the effort was , but the US has admitted to recovering at least a portion of K - 129 .
Glomar Explorer while in service with the CIA
18 May 1968 : An American attempt to launch the spacecraft Nimbus B - 1 failed when the booster rocket had to be destroyed at an altitude of 18.5 miles ( 30 km ) .
The satellite carried two radioisotope generators that fell into the ocean off the California coast .
The nuclear material was recovered intact from a depth of 330 ft ( 100 m ) with no release of radioactivity .
21 May 1968 : The attack submarine USS Scorpion ( SSN - 589 ) was returning to the United States following a three month deployment when the vessel sank in the Atlantic Ocean about 500 miles ( 805 km ) southwest of the Azores .
While details of the sinking remain a mystery , one theory is a battery within one of the submarine 's torpedoes overheated and ignited .
The subsequent fire caused a warhead detonatation and blasted open the torpedo loading hatch at the top of the forward compartment .
A flood of water through this hatch sent the Scorpion over 10,000 ft ( 3,050 m ) deep to the ocean floor .
The vessel broke into two major sections as it sank with the forward hull containing the torpedo room and control spaces located some distance from the aft hull containing the reactor .
The Scorpion was lost with its entire crew of 99 , one nuclear reactor , and two nuclear - tipped torpedoes .
The US Navy continues to monitor the wreck for signs of disturbance and environmental impact but no release of radioactive material has been detected to date .
24 May 1968 : Soviet November class submarine K - 27 was conducting sea trials when the reactor overheated and began spreading radiation through the vessel .
Of those aboard , 10 were killed and another 12 suffered severe radiation sickness .
Never repaired , the contaminated submarine remained in port for over a decade until its reactor compartment was filled with a thick mixture of sealant .
The entire submarine and its still fueled reactors were then scuttled 110 ft ( 35 m ) deep at Stepovoy Bay in the Kara Sea in 1982 .
Proposals exist to raise and dispose of the wreck in hopes of avoiding contamination in such shallow waters .
12 April 1970 : The Soviet November class attack submarine K - 8 sank to a depth of 14,000 ft ( 4270 m ) in the Bay of Biscay about 300 miles ( 480 km ) northwest of Spain .
The vessel suffered a fire that broke out in two aft compartments .
The captain 's order to abandon ship was countermanded and the submarine sank in heavy seas , taking the lives of 52 members of its crew .
K - 8 was powered by two nuclear reactors and possibly carried multiple nuclear torpedoes .
Rumors suggest that shortly before the sinking , K - 8 laid tactical atomic torpedoes in the Bay of Naples for use as mines against the US fleet in case of war .
The vessel was carrying 24 of these torpedoes and only four were found inside the sunken wreck .
It is unknown whether the remainder still lie on the ocean floor near Italy or if the Soviets recovered them at a later date .
Nevertheless , this tale is based largely on information from an Italian investigator named Mario Scaramella whose credibility has since become suspect .
K - 8 had also suffered an earlier reactor accident in 1960 that contaminated the vessel and injured several crewmen .
17 April 1970 : As Apollo 13 returned to Earth following its aborted mission to the Moon , the crew jettisoned a radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) that would have been left on the lunar surface had the landing been successful .
The RTG , containing plutonium , survived re-entry and came to rest in the Tonga Trench at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean where it still remains .
8 September 1977 : The Soviet submarine K - 171 , a Delta I class ballistic missile boat , accidentally jettisoned one of its missiles overboard into the Pacific Ocean near Kamchatka .
Pressure had been building up in the missile launch tube causing the missile and its nuclear warhead to be ejected .
Though initially classified as a Broken Arrow , the warhead was later located and recovered following an intense search .
1978 : A Soviet barge named Nikel was transporting low and medium level radioactive waste products when it sank during a storm sometime in 1978 .
The vessel was lost approximately 20 miles northwest of Kolguyev Island in the Barents Sea and no recovery attempts were made .
24 January 1978 : The Soviet ocean reconnaissance satellite Kosmos 954 fell into the atmosphere and burned up over Canada .
The satellite was powered by a nuclear reactor , but the majority was apparently destroyed in re-entry .
Only small radioactive pieces were recovered .
Titan II missile silo
19 September 1980 : While conducting routine maintenance on a Titan II ballistic missile at a silo in Arkansas , a repairman dropped a heavy wrench that punctured a pressurized fuel tank .
The fuel vapor later ignited killing one and injuring 21 more US Air Force personnel .
The blast also threw the missile 's re-entry vehicle out of the silo , but it was recovered intact with no leak of radiation .
7 February 1983 : A Soviet nuclear - powered reconnaissance satellite called Kosmos 1402 re-entered the atmosphere and burned up over the southern Atlantic Ocean .
It is unknown whether the reactor survived intact , but the remains fell into the ocean about 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) east of Brazil .
June 1983 : Rumors indicate Soviet Victor III class attack submarine K - 324 collided with another submarine , believed to be a Chinese Han class nuclear submarine .
Though never confirmed , the K - 324 crew claimed the Chinese vessel sank with its crew of 70 .
A 1989 Soviet survey reportedly detected high levels of radiation in the vicinity , and obituaries in Chinese newspapers may support the contention of many submarine designers perishing in an accident in 1983 .
24 June 1983 : The Soviet submarine K - 429 , a Charlie class nuclear - powered cruise missile submarine , sank in Savannaya Bay in the Bering Sea killing at least 16 of its 120 crew .
The vessel has been ordered to conduct a submerged torpedo launch even though still undergoing maintenance .
In the haste to put to sea , ventilation systems had not been properly sealed and ballast tank valves were left misaligned .
As the submarine submerged in shallow waters for a test dive , the open ventilation system led to massive flooding in forward compartments .
The captain attempted to resurface the vessel but was foiled by the faults in the ballast tank system .
K - 429 settled to the shallow seabed about 130 ft ( 40 m ) down .
Luckily , most of the crew was still alive and the vessel was equipped with escape capsules to reach the surface .
Two crewmen volunteered to ascend into the frigid Arctic waters and swim ashore to summon help .
Despite being arrested upon reaching the coast , the men were able to bring word of the sinking to naval commanders so a rescue attempt could be launched .
With ships waiting above , the remainder of the crew used the escape capsules to ascend to the surface .
The vessel was salvaged the following August recovering its single reactor and any nuclear weapons aboard .
Though later returned to service , the vessel sank again at its moorings in September 1985 killing additional crewmen .
K-429 was raised once more and finally retired .
6 October 1986 : The Soviet Yankee I class ballistic missile submarine K - 219 was on patrol off the Atlantic coast of the US when a missile tube began leaking .
The incoming water mixed with liquid rocket propellants that had dripped from the missile to create toxic gases .
The buildup of gases resulted in an explosion .
Four crewmen perished while fighting the fires and the rest were forced to evacuate because of the toxic fumes .
As the submarine was being towed back to port , it sank 680 miles ( 1,095 km ) north of Bermuda taking two nuclear reactors and 15 nuclear missiles to the bottom ( one missile tube was empty having been damaged and sealed after a previous leak ) .
Each missile carried two warheads each and it is believed the submarine also held two nuclear torpedoes for a total of 32 nuclear warheads .
K -219 on the surface missing a missile hatch cover following the explosion
20 August 1987 : The Soviet Union lost a radioisotope thermoelectric generator into the Sea of Okhotsk following an " emergency disposal . "
The RTG was never located .
7 April 1989 : K - 278 Komsomolets was a Soviet Mike class attack submarine .
K - 278 was submerged and returning to base when a fire broke out in the aft compartment .
The fire spread forward along wires causing electrical short circuits that shut down the reactor .
As the vessel began to lose buoyancy , the order was given to surface and abandon ship .
Unfortunately , K - 278 sank off the northern coast of Norway killing 42 of the 69 crewmembers .
The submarine carried one nuclear reactor and two torpedoes with nuclear warheads .
Later exploration of the wreck revealed large cracks running the length of the hull , major blowout damage to the forward torpedo compartment , and possible reactor damage .
As radiation levels in the area began to rise and fearing further contamination in these rich fishing waters , Russia made several attempts to hermetically seal K - 278 in a jelly - like material .
The effort was declared successful in 1996 , and monitoring of the wreck since has measured no significant radiation leaks .
Nevertheless , the seal is expected to degrade by 2025 .
16 November 1996 : Mars 96 was a Russian probe launched to study the planet Mars .
Following an unsuccessful burn of a booster rocket stage , the spacecraft fell back into Earth 's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean .
The remains of the vehicle , containing 18 radioisotope thermoelectric generators , landed off the coast of Chile .
8 August 1997 : While flying over the Sea of Okhotsk off the coast of Sakhalin Island , a Russian helicopter was forced to jettison a radioisotope thermoelectric generator it had been transporting .
The RTG was not located despite a search .
12 August 2000 : The Russian submarine K - 141 Kursk , a cruise missile submarine of the Oscar II class , was participating in military exercises in the Barents Sea north of Russia when a massive explosion rocked the vessel .
The blast ruptured the hull sending the Kursk into a terminal dive towards the sea floor 350 ft ( 105 m ) down .
Though 23 of the 118 crewmembers survived the initial sinking , attempts to rescue them failed .
The men perished from lack of oxygen and the vessel had completely flooded by the time divers were able to enter the wreck .
Subsequent investigations concluded the sinking was caused by a fire in the torpedo room .
A torpedo's propellants ignited creating a large fire that soon caused the warheads of other torpedoes to detonate .
The massive explosion ripped open the forward part of the submarine and quickly flooded the forward compartments .
Russia indicated that no nuclear weapons were aboard , and the nuclear reactors were recovered in 2001 when the wreck was raised .
30 August 2003 : K - 159 was an aging Russian November class submarine retired in 1989 .
The vessel had already suffered a radiation accident in 1965 that was never adequately repaired , and the submarine remained laid up with virtually no maintenance for fourteen years .
The hull was in such poor condition that pontoons were welded on to keep K - 159 afloat , but these too were in a poor state and had been made in the 1940s .
During the 1990s , foreign nations donated funds to have 16 abandoned Russian submarines towed to a shipyard for disposal .
As K - 159 was being moved , the submarine encountered a storm that tore the pontoons off .
The boat eventually sank in 780 ft ( 240 m ) of water with the loss of nine crew .
The sunken vessel still carries two nuclear reactors and 1,800 lb ( 800 kg ) of spent fuel .
No radiation leakage has been detected so far , and plans to raise the wreck appear to have been postponed indefinitely .
Wreckage of the Kursk after the submarine was raised
While the accidents described above are among the most serious ever experienced , many others not included here have also resulted in reactor accidents , loss of life , or the spread of radioactive materials .

Users and the admin
So , for as long as I can remember the single most - frequently - asked question about the Django admin has been some variation of “ how do I set a foreign key to User to automatically be filled in with request.user ? ”
And for a while the answer was that you could n’t do that , really ; it was and still is easy to do with a custom form in your own view , but up until a few months back it was n’t really something you could do in the admin .
Now , as of the merge of newforms - admin back before Django 1.0 , you can and it ’s really really easy ; in fact , it ’s even documented .
But still it ’s probably the # 1 most - frequently - asked question about the admin .
So as I ’m stuck in a hotel overnight with nothing better to do ( thanks to the gross incompetence of Delta Airlines ) , consider this my attempt to give the Django community an early Christmas present by walking through the process step - by - step and demonstrating just how trivially simple it is to do this .
And next time you see someone asking how to accomplish this , please point them at this article .
For a free bonus Christmas present , I ’ll also explain another frequently - requested item : how to ensure that people can only see / edit things they “ own ” ( i.e. , that they created ) in the admin .
But first …
A big fat disclaimer : there are lots and lots of potential uses for these types of features .
Many of them are wrong and stupid and you should n’t be trying them .
I say this because a huge number of the proposed use cases for this type of automatic filling - in of users and automatic filtering of objects boil down to “ I ’ve let these people into my admin , but I still do n’t trust them ” .
And that ’s a problem no amount of technology will solve for you : if you ca n’t rely on your site administrators to do the right thing , then they should n’t be your site administrators .
Also , you will occasionally see someone suggest that these features can be obtained by what ’s known as the “ threadlocal hack ” ; this basically involves sticking request.user into a sort of magical globally - available variable , and is a Very Bad Thing to use if you do n’t know what you ’re doing .
It ’s also generally a Very Bad Thing to use even if you do know what you ’re doing , since you ’re probably just doing it because you ’re lazy and do n’t feel like ensuring you pass information around properly .
So if you see someone suggesting that you do this using a “ threadlocal ” , ignore that person .
Now .
Let ’s get to work .
Automatically filling in a user
Consider a weblog , with an Entry model which looks like this :
import datetime from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.db import models class Entry ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField ( max_length = 250 ) slug = models .
SlugField ( ) pub_date = models .
DateTimeField ( default = datetime .
datetime .
now ) author = models .
ForeignKey ( User , related_name = ' entries ' ) summary = models .
TextField ( blank = True ) body = models .
TextField ( ) class Meta : get_latest_by = ' pub_date ' ordering = ( '- pub_date ' , ) verbose_name_plural = ' entries ' def __unicode__ ( self ) : return self .
title def get_absolute_url ( self ) : return " / weblog / %s / %s / " % ( self .
pub_date .
strftime ( " %Y/ %b/ %d " ) , self . slug )
Our first goal is to write a ModelAdmin class for the Entry model , such that each new Entry being saved will automatically fill in the “ author ” field with the User who created the Entry .
We can start by filling out the normal options for the ModelAdmin in the blog application ’s admin.py file :
from django.contrib import admin from blog .
models import Entry class EntryAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : list_display = ( ' title ' , ' pub_date ' , ' author ' ) prepopulated_fields = { ' slug ' : [ ' title ' ] } admin .
site .
register ( Entry , EntryAdmin )
And since we ’re going to automatically fill in the author field , let ’s go ahead and leave it out of the form :
class EntryAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : exclude = ( ' author ' , ) list_display = ( ' title ' , ' pub_date ' , ' author ' ) prepopulated_fields = { ' slug ' : [ ' title ' ] }
All that ’s left now is to override one method on EntryAdmin .
This method is called save_model , and it receives as arguments the current HttpRequest , the object that ’s about to be saved , the form being used to validate its data and a boolean flag indicating whether the object is about to be saved for the first time , or already exists and is being edited .
Since we only need to fill in the author field on creation , we can just look at that flag .
The code ends up looking like this :
def save_model ( self , request , obj , form , change ) : if not change : obj .
author = request .
user obj . save ()
That ’s it : all this method has to do is save the object , and it ’s allowed to do anything it wants prior to saving .
And since it receives the HttpRequest as an argument , it has access to request.user and can fill that in on the Entry before saving it .
This is documented , by the way , and the documentation is your friend .
Showing only entries someone “ owns ”
The other half of the puzzle , for most folks , is limiting the list of viewable / editable objects in the admin to only those “ owned by ” the current user ; in our example blog application , that would mean limiting the list of entries in the admin changelist to only those posted by the current user .
To accomplish this we ’ll need to make two changes to the EntryAdmin class : one to handle the main list of objects , and another to make sure a malicious user ca n’t get around this and edit an object by knowing its ID and jumping straight to its edit page .
First , we override the method queryset on EntryAdmin ; this generates the QuerySet used on the main list of Entry objects , and it gets access to the HttpRequest object so we can filter the entries based on request.user :
def queryset ( self , request ) : return Entry .
objects .
filter ( author = request .
user )
Of course , there ’s a problem with this : it completely hides every entry except the ones you yourself have written , we probably want an ability for a few extremely trusted people to still see and edit other folks ’ entries .
Most likely , these people will have the is_superuser flag set to True on their user accounts , so we can show them the full list and only filter for everybody else :
def queryset ( self , request ) : if request .
user .
is_superuser : return Entry . objects . all ( ) return Entry .
objects .
filter ( author = request .
user )
This only affects the entries shown in the list view , however ; a different method — has_change_permission — is called from the individual object editing page , to ensure the user is allowed to edit that object .
And that method , by default , returns
True if the user has the “ change ” permission for the model class in question , so we ’ll need to change it to check for the class - level permission , then check to see if the user is a superuser or the author of the entry .
Here ’s the code ( this method receives both the HttpRequest and the object as arguments ) :
def has_change_permission ( self , request , obj = None ) : has_class_permission = super ( EntryAdmin , self ) .
has_change_permission ( request , obj ) if not has_class_permission : return
False if obj is not None and not request .
user .
is_superuser and request .
user .
id != obj .
author .
id : return False return True
And finally , here ’s the completed admin.py file containing the full class :
from django.contrib import admin from blog .
models import Entry class EntryAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : exclude = ( ' author ' , ) list_display = ( ' title ' , ' pub_date ' , ' author ' ) prepopulated_fields = { ' slug ' : [ ' title ' ] } def has_change_permission ( self , request , obj = None ) : has_class_permission = super ( EntryAdmin , self ) .
has_change_permission ( request , obj ) if not has_class_permission : return
False if obj is not None and not request .
user .
is_superuser and request .
user .
id != obj .
author .
id : return False return
True def queryset ( self , request ) : if request .
user .
is_superuser : return Entry . objects . all ( ) return Entry .
objects .
filter ( author = request .
user ) def save_model ( self , request , obj , form , change ) : if not change : obj .
author = request .
user obj . save ( ) admin .
site .
register ( Entry , EntryAdmin )
And that ’s it
No , really .
Although this ends up generating huge numbers of “ how do I do it ” questions , it really is that easy .
Since the beginning of the military operation in the Gaza Strip , on 27 December 2008 , the army has bombed dozens of houses , public buildings , and other structures throughout the Gaza Strip .
The principle of distinction , one of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law , states that all parties engaged in combat must distinguish between civilian objects and military targets , and are forbidden to intentionally attack civilians and civilian objects .
The First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions establishes two conditions that must be met for an object to be considered a legitimate military target : it must effectively contribute to military action and its total destruction or partial neutralization offers a clear military advantage ./>/>
Despite this , other statements made by Israeli officials in recent days raise the suspicion that the army is not maintaining the requisite distinction in its attacks in Gaza .
Prime Minster Ehud Olmert stated that , “ Israel is not at war with the Palestinian people but with Hamas , which has dedicated itself to acting against residents of Israel .
Accordingly , the objects attacked today were selected with the emphasis on the imperative to prevent harm to innocent persons . ”
In an article published in yesterday 's Washington Post , a senior military official was quoted as follows : " There are many aspects to Hamas , and we are trying to hit the whole spectrum , because everything is connected and everything supports terrorism against Israel . "
Major Avital Liebowitz , of the IDF Spokesperson 's Office , told the correspondent that the army had indeed widened its target list in comparison to previous operations , saying Hamas has used ostensibly civilian actions as a cover for military activities .
" Anything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target , " she said .
These comments suggest that the operation in Gaza is aimed against every person and entity tied in some way to Hamas , even if they are not engaged in military action against Israel .
An examination of the sites that were bombed in recent days raises questions regarding the legality of targeting many of them .
For example , the military bombed the main police building in Gaza and killed , according to reports , forty - two Palestinians who were in a training course and were standing in formation at the time of the bombing .
Participants in the course study first - aid , handling of public disturbances , human rights , public - safety exercises , and so forth .
Following the course , the police officers are assigned to various arms of the police force in Gaza responsible for maintaining public order .
/>/>
Another example is yesterday 's bombing of the government offices .
These offices included the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Labor , Construction and Housing .
An announcement made by the IDF Spokesperson 's Office regarding this attack stated that , “ the attack was carried out in response to the ongoing rocket and mortar - shell fire carried out by Hamas over Israeli territory , and in the framework of IDF operations to strike at Hamas governmental infrastructure and members active in the organization . ”
These are just examples of what appear to be clear civilian objects attacked by the army .
On the face of it , the activity carried out in these places is not military activity aimed against Israel , and the IDF spokesperson does not even make this claim .
Clearly , then , they cannot be considered military objects in accordance with the provisions of international humanitarian law - they do not make an effective contribution to the military activity against Israel and the attack provides Israel with no militaryadvantage whatsoever , and certainly not a clear militaryadvantage .
Hamas is certainly responsible for missile fire at Israeli civilians , which constitutes a war crime .
However , as the entity effectively governing the Gaza Strip , it is also responsible for maintaining daily life .
As such , it supervises the activity of all civilian frameworks in Gaza - among them the welfare , health , housing , and legal systems .
Hamas must also ensure public order and safety by means of a police force .
Therefore , even if Hamas is a “ hostile entity ” whose principle objective is to undermine the existence of the State of Israel , this does not lead to the conclusion that every act it carries out is intended to harm Israel and that every government ministry is a legitimate target .
The argument that striking at objects of this kind is consistent with international humanitarian law is untenable .
Such an interpretation , which relates to these bodies as military objects , stretches the provisions of international humanitarian law in a way that is inconsistent with the articles cited above , and contravenes the principle of distinction that lies at the foundation of international humanitarian law .
An intentional attack on a civilian target is a war crime .
The Colosseum is just one of many ancient buildings users can tour Google has added a new twist to its popular 3D map tool , Google Earth , offering millions of users the chance to visit a virtual ancient Rome .
Google has reconstructed the sprawling city - inhabited by more than one million people as long ago as AD320 .
Users can zoom around the map to visit the Forum of Julius Caesar , stand in the centre of the Colosseum or swoop over the Basilica .
Researchers behind the project say it adds to five centuries of knowledge .
" This is another step in creating a virtual time machine , " said Bernard Frischer of the University of Virginia , which worked with Google on the Roman reconstruction .
" The project is a continuation of five centuries of research by scholars , architects and artists since the Renaissance , who have attempted to restore the ruins of the ancient city with words , maps and images , " he said .
Also involved was Past Perfect Productions , which reconstructs archaeological and historical sites through virtual reality .
Joel Myers , the firm 's chief executive , said : " Cultural heritage , although based in the past , lives in the present , as it forms our identity .
" It is therefore our responsibility to ensure its conservation , to nourish it and make it accessible , with the objective of promoting global understanding .
Ancient Rome in 3D is a major step towards this goal , " he added .
' Ideal allies ' Ancient Rome is the first historical city to be added to Google Earth .
Google 's blog said the model contains more than 6,700 buildings , with more than 250 place marks linking to key sites in a variety of languages .
" Whether you are a student taking your first ancient history class , a historian who spends your life researching ancient civilisations , or just a history buff , access to this 3D model in Google Earth will help everyone learn more about ancient Rome , " said Bruce Polderman , Google Earth 3D production manager .
Information bubbles pop up on more than 250 sites in the ancient city Within ancient Rome there are some 200 buildings scholars know a lot about - classified as Class 1 - which Google says have been rendered as faithfully as possible .
The 3D models are based on a physical model of the city called the Plastico di Roma Antica .
The model was created by archaeologists and model - makers between 1933 to 1974 and housed in a special gallery in Rome 's Museum of Roman Civilisation .
The new map was unveiled at an event in the Italian capital , and the modern day Mayor of Rome , Gianni Alemanno , praised the project .
" It 's an incredible opportunity to share the stunning greatness of ancient Rome , a perfect example of how the new technologies can be ideal allies of our history , archaeology and cultural identity , " Mr Alemanno said .
More than 400 million people have downloaded Google Earth since it was launched in June 2005 .

After last week ’s flame - broiled blatant marketing ploy by Burger King , PETA has come up with their own : a meat - scented perfume that smells like rotting flesh .
PETA clearly saw the success of Burger King ’s campaign and wanted in on the action .
“ Most cows killed for fast - food burgers are castrated and branded without any painkillers , fed a diet of hormones and antibiotics , and often transported to slaughter without food or water in all weather extremes , ” reads the PETA press release .

Legend
Damage : This information comes straight from the G.E.C.K. and shows the damage caused by a single click of the mouse / trigger .
For most small guns , that 's a single bullet , but for shotguns it 's a single shell ( containing several small pellets ) , and for the Gatling laser it 's a single beam .
This stat is most useful for comparing semi-automatic weapons like rifles , where you can see the full damage caused by a single shot , regardless of how long it takes to load and fire the next one .
Damage per second :
The maximum cyclic damage dealt in one second , expressed as rate of fire times damage .
Weapons that require a reload every shot have damage per second shown including reload times , all others show sustained rates without reloads .
Rate of fire :
The maximum cyclic number of shots / attacks per second , without considering reloading .
Spread :
This is the Min Spread stat from the G.E.C.K. ( the Spread stat is not used ) .
It refers to the accuracy of a ranged weapon .
0 means the weapon can potentially fire perfectly straight , if stance , weapon skill , and weapon condition are optimal .
Anything above 0 means the shots may deviate from center by that many degrees regardless of stance , skill , or condition .
Critical chance multiplier :
The multiplier applied to your character 's critical hit chance .
This modifier applies to each individual attack you make ( e.g. each 5 mm bullet fired from your minigun ) .
For example , if your character has a critical hit chance of 5 % , and the weapon you 're using has a CRIT % MULT of x2 , then each shot has a 5 % x 2 =10 % chance to critically hit .
For automatic weapons ( assault rifles , SMGs , miniguns , etc. ) the Crit % Mult stat in the G.E.C.K. is divided by the G.E.C.K.'s Fire Rate stat , hence the very small multiplier for automatic weapons .
This is done to compensate for the sheer number of bullets being fired .
Note that single V.A.T.S. attack , with automatic weapons , only checks for critical hit once , applying damage bonus for all bullets in such attack if critical hit is done .
Critical hit Damage :
The amount of damage that is added when you score a critical strike .
The more specialized Sneak Attack Critical deals twice the damage of a common critical strike .
Action Point cost :
The amount of Action Points used per shot in V.A.T.S .
Area of effect :
The blast radius of the explosion in units of measurement displayed in the G.E.C.K .
Durability :
This is the maximum number of times a weapon can attack / fire from full health before completely breaking .
Ammunition used :
The type of ammunition the weapon uses .
Magazine capacity :
The maximum ammunition capacity of the weapon .
Shots per reload :
The maximum number of shots possible from a full magazine .
Weapon weight : Weight value of the weapon that applies to encumbrance .
Weapon value in caps : Base value of the weapon in caps .
Resale value is effected by Barter skill .
“ A New Bus for London ” was the name of competition under the cover of latest mayor of London .
Hugh Forst made one of the most interesting concept calls Freight * Bus , with a plenty of innovative .
Bus will be powerd by in - wheel electric motors that would get their power from batteries or hydrogen fuel cells .
Cutting petrol out of the equation would have the obvious benefit of improving the bustling city ’s air quality .
Revealed : Police failing to investigate 40 % of crimes - because they are too hard to solve
Police are failing to investigate almost four in every ten crimes , it was revealed last night .
The offences include sex attacks , violent robberies , harassment , burglary and drug incidents .
Instead of being pursued , the cases are simply filed away by officers who do not consider they can be solved .
Officers on the case - or are they ?
A Mail investigation shows 4 in 10 crimes are ' ignored '
Victims ' groups have condemned this practice of ' screening out ' offences - but it is alarmingly widespread .
The Met , the country 's largest force , decided that 51 per cent of crimes were not worth full investigations as there was little chance of catching the culprit .
Across the country , the average for the 16 forces which gave full replies to the Daily Mail 's Freedom of Information requests was 39 per cent .
It is the equivalent of a staggering 1.9 million of the five million crimes reported to the police by distressed members of the public not being fully investigated .
And it goes a long way to explain why the detection rates for all crimes , and burglary in particular , are so low .
On average , only 27 per cent of crimes are solved .
A spokesman for Victim Support said : ' Even if this process is justified by lack of evidence , the figures are likely to undermine confidence in the police among victims .
' If victims feel that their experience of crime is being dismissed by the very agencies that are meant to deal with the situation , that risks adding insult to injury . '
The Tories said the target - obsessed Government had forced the police to chase ' diktats ' rather than criminals .
Police forces have adopted the tactic of screening out crimes in response to Government targets insisting they must bring a fixed number of offenders ' to justice ' each year .
It has led to officers targeting resources almost exclusively on cases with the best chance of success .
Many of the most common offences are routinely filed ' not for action ' by telephone operators at the first possible stage , after the first initial call reporting the crime .
By recording it as a crime , the officer is acknowledging the law has been broken .
The main reasons the investigation is dropped are if there are no obvious leads , such as the name of the suspected offender .
Police chiefs defend the system as a way to target resources on the most serious and solvable crimes .
They insist that all crimes are ' investigated ' to some degree , even if this amounts to no more than a telephone conversation .
Serious crimes such as murder , wounding or rape are always investigated , as are crimes where there is a named suspect or obvious forensic evidence .
But opponents say it is a far cry from the days when almost every victim of crime received a visit from an officer , and an attempt was at least made to find the culprit .
The Tories said it was a symptom of a lack of public accountability within the police service .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith abandoned plans for elected police representatives earlier this week .
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' This is a consequence of Labour 's target culture which has resulted in our police being forced to chase Whitehall diktats instead of criminals .
' Conservatives would replace police authorities with elected police commissioners so that the priorities of the police reflect the priorities of the people they serve . '
Critics say it is a far cry from the days when almost every victim of crime received a visit from an officer , and an attempt was at least made to find the culprit
In London , the Met said that in the 2007 / 8 financial year it screened out a total of 437,888 offences .
These included 26,709 offences of violence , 338 sex attacks , 5,562 robberies and more than 60,000 burglaries .
For burglary , the Met only investigate one in three cases reported to them .
In Bedfordshire , which last year screened out 42 per cent of crimes , one in three burglaries does n't get a full investigation .
Although the percentage of screened out crime falls for more serious offences the force still excluded 290 offences of violence , 12 sex attacks , 32 robberies and 16 drugs offences .
In Norfolk , where 113 sex attacks were amongst the 42 per cent of crime screened out , the deputy chief constable Ian Learmonth said : ' We are making best use of our resources by investigating only those crimes which have some hope or opportunity of being solved . '
A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said : ' Before any crime is " screened out " it will have been through a rigorous evaluation procedure . '
A Home Office spokesman said the Government had reduced centrally - set targets and planned to cut red tape to free up officers .

NOT recommeneded
By Kevin Funk and Steven Fake
Few humanitarian crises have occasioned as much media and activist attention in the US as the conflict in the Darfur region of western Sudan .
* * *
Click HERE for an exclusive free excerpt from Kevin Funk and Steven Fake 's latest book , Scramble for Africa .
* * *
Major politicians routinely pay homage to suffering Darfurians in their speeches , well - heeled Darfur advocacy groups take out full - page ads in the New York Times , and commentators regularly fill op - ed ledgers around the country with righteous , indignant calls for the West to act to end the suffering .
Yet for all the rhetorical attention and concern afforded to Darfur in the US , what is actually understood about the US role in addressing the conflict ?
Further , what do we know about the historical and current nature of Washington ’s relations with Sudan , and how does this relate to our understanding of the Darfur crisis , and what we can do to address it ?
Indeed , much Darfur commentary portrays the conflict as something of a fairy tale , in which the West are benevolent entities seeking to rescue the region from conflict .
According to this logic , in contrast to the violent government in Khartoum , and its shadowy and amoral allies in Beijing , we are of pure motives — and well positioned to “ save ” Darfur .
The corporate media never raise the obvious questions : does the history of US involvement in Sudan merit such a sanguine conclusion about its intentions now ?
Is Washington really the potential saviour of Darfur that it is often portrayed to be ?
Washington and Khartoum
The US first became heavily involved in Sudan in the 1970s , forging an alliance with the rightward - turning dictatorship of Jafaar Nimeiri , who Washington came to see as a bulwark against the Soviet Union , Libya and the region ’s moves towards pan-Arabism .
George H. W. Bush , then the US ambassador to the UN , shared satellite imagery with the Nimeiri regime indicating possible oil reserves in the country ’s south , and obtained approval for the US - based energy giant Chevron to do the exploratory work .
The Sudanese government ’s desire for the oil money to flow into the central government ’s coffers , instead of to the country ’s south , reignited a north - south civil war , which would last 22 years and take some 2 million lives , mostly civilians in the south .
Such was the level of US backing for Khartoum that a senior Sudanese official noted that there was a Washington - Khartoum “ air bridge ” of weapons shipments , used by the government to wage war .
With Khartoum having demonstrated its acquiescence towards Washington ’s dictates by being the only Arab country to support the Camp David peace agreement between Israel and Egypt in 1978 , Sudan by the early 1980s was receiving more economic and military aid from the US than any other country in sub-Saharan Africa .
As a series of famines beset Sudan in the ’ 80s , Washington demonstrated the depth of its purported humanitarian concern by using its influence to ensure , with few exceptions , that Western aid organisations did not operate in rebel - controlled zones — keeping food provisions from starving people who lived in the “ wrong place ” .
For those who have called for US participation in or leadership of an invading force in Sudan ( such as vice - presidential elect Joseph Biden ) , under the guise of a “ humanitarian intervention ” to help Darfurians , how to explain the past nature of US policies of towards Sudan ?
In fact , though the US alliance with Sudan cooled after Nimeiri ’s overthrow in 1985 , and broke down entirely subsequent to Khartoum ’s verbal backing of Iraq in the 1990 - 91 Gulf War , Washington ’s disregard for Sudanese lives has continued unimpeded to the present .
US terrorist atrocity
At the nadir of US - Sudanese relations in 1998 , with then - Secretary of State Madeleine Albright having declared support for “ regime change ” in Khartoum the previous year , the US launched a missile attack on the al - Shifa pharmaceutical plant near the Sudanese capital .
Though officially justified on the grounds of the plant ’s supposed links to the Osama bin Laden network , the US later claimed to have had faulty intelligence on the plant .
In reality , al - Shifa produced a significant portion of Sudan ’s basic medicines and had no terrorist links .
Washington evinced no concern for the resulting deaths — estimated in the tens of thousands — from having destroyed one of the main pharmaceutical suppliers in a poor , sanctioned country , nor did the US send replacement medicines or even apologise .
Such blatant disregard for Sudanese lives contrasts sharply with Washington ’s current fevered declarations of unswerving support for Darfurians .
The US has consistently been the Sudanese government ’s most vocal critic , rarely missing an opportunity to make political hay out of its harsh condemnations of Khartoum — standing alone among major governments in declaring that Sudan has committed “ genocide ” in Darfur .
Yet Washington has largely failed to take even rudimentary steps to address the crisis , and in several ways , has made it worse .
Soaring rhetoric aside , the US cannot even be bothered to fully fund humanitarian operations in Darfur .
In June , the World Food Program had to cut its aid flights to the region due to a lack of funding from wealthy donor nations .
The African Union peacekeeping force that was deployed in Darfur until the end of 2007 was so badly underfunded that at times it was unable to pay the salaries of its troops .
The current joint UN - AU force in Darfur ( UNAMID ) has been searching in vain for a country to supply it with two dozen helicopters since August 2007 , while the US reportedly has some 350 transport helicopters deployed nearby in its brutalising occupation of Iraq .
Peace negotiations failure
In a textbook case of how not to pursue peace negotiations , Washington leaned heavily on participants to meet the hurried deadline for the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement ( DPA ) , even though most Darfurians were generally unaware of its content .
When only one faction of one rebel group signed onto the accord ( Minni Minnawi ’s contingent of the Sudan Liberation Army ) , the Bush administration nevertheless pushed forward .
Then - US deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick labeled the non-signatory groups as “ outlaws to the process ” , and Minnawi ’s forces , emboldened , launched violent attacks against rebel and civilian targets in Darfur .
The long - term consequences have been disastrous , as rebel groups have splintered many times over in its wake , thus gravely complicating the possibility of holding serious , participatory peace talks in Darfur .
Most brazenly , Washington has developed close intelligence - sharing relationships with some of the very same figures and apparatuses responsible for the violence in Darfur .
Under the guise of the “ war on terror ” , the CIA has held daily liaison meetings with its Sudanese counterpart the Mukhabarat , collaborating to spy on Iraqi rebel movements .
The Sudanese intelligence chief Salah Abdallah Gosh , who in the words of retired general Wesley Clark and Clinton administration official John Prendergast is “ very likely a war criminal whose policies are responsible for the deaths of thousands of Darfurians ” , was flown to the White House for meetings in 2005 on a CIA jet .
Washington also tried to block the UN from including him on a sanctions list .
Despite its bellowing over Khartoum ’s human rights record , the Bush administration ’s 2007 budget justification referred to Sudan ’s position “ on the front lines in the War on Terrorism ” , a country for which Washington “ will maintain its strong support ” .
The US and China
While Washington ’s haranguing of Khartoum for its serious crimes in Darfur serves to placate domestic groups such as the Save Darfur Coalition and increase public animosity towards the Arab and Muslim worlds — a key aim in gaining support for US foreign policy adventurism in the Middle East — the broader US interest in the conflict is the Sudan - China alliance .
The prime concerns for the US are impeding Chinese access to non-Western controlled energy reserves , like Sudan ’s , which are fundamental to China ’s prospects for independent development .
Second , Washington is concerned by the extent to which China is extending its political and economic influence throughout Africa and the global South , its ties with strategically vital countries such as Sudan being a prime example .
Across the African continent , Washington and Beijing are competing for alliances , offering economic and military aid packages to unsavory regimes in exchange for unfettered access to vast natural resource reserves .
Due to Khartoum ’s unpliant nature , its flirtations with pan-Arabism and the public relations difficulties brought about by its flattening of Darfur , Sudan
This is a major concern for Washington , as in the words of Foreign Affairs magazine , the country ’s “ geostrategic location means that changes in Sudanese political orientations have repercussions on the entire African continent and the Red Sea littoral ” .
Seeking to counter Beijing ’s moves into the region , Washington has been expanding its presence on the continent from which it now gets more oil than the Middle East , opening on October 1 its first ever military command centre ( Africom ) devoted exclusively to Africa .
Africom will manage , and seek to expand , US cooperation with a litany of human rights abusers from the Washington - allied Obiang dictatorship of Equatorial Guinea , to the US - backed Ethiopian occupation of Somalia .
Genuine assistance
With Washington ’s track record of contempt for Sudanese lives , its failure to even keep aid flights going at full capacity in Darfur , and its moves to militarise the African continent , the US is hardly an innocent bystander as conflict rages on in western Sudan , nor the honest , selfless broker that media and activist commentary often portray it to be .
Though US machinations in Darfur are not on par with China ’s devastating alliance with Sudan , Washington has also acted against the interests of Darfurians and detrimental to a just solution to the conflict .
Honest activists pursuing the noble cause of seeking to advocate for Darfur must pursue their campaigns with this in mind , and seek to confront , rather than feed into , US foreign policy — not only in Darfur and Sudan , but the region as a whole .

Poll : Support surges for gay marriage RAW STORY
Published : Saturday December 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Majority now oppose federal ban FROM A NEWSWEEK RELEASE :
" When voters in California , Florida and Arizona approved measures banning same - sex marriage last month [ the graphic at right does not include these latest votes ] , opponents lamented that the country appeared to be turning increasingly intolerant toward gay and lesbian rights .
But the latest NEWSWEEK
Poll finds growing public support for gay marriage and civil unions -- and strong backing for the granting of certain rights associated with marriage , to same - sex couples .
( Click here to see the full poll . )
" Americans continue to find civil unions for gays and lesbians more palatable than full - fledged marriage .
Fifty - five percent of respondents favored legally sanctioned unions or partnerships , while only 39 percent supported marriage rights .
Both figures are notably higher than in 2004 , when 40 percent backed the former and 33 percent approved of the latter .
When it comes to according legal rights in specific areas to gays , the public is even more supportive .
Seventy - four percent back inheritance rights for gay domestic partners ( compared to 60 percent in 2004 ) , 73 percent approve of extending health insurance and other employee benefits to them ( compared to 60 percent in 2004 ) , 67 percent favor granting them Social Security benefits ( compared to 55 percent in 2004 ) and 86 percent support hospital visitation rights ( a question that was n't asked four years ago ) .
In other areas , too , respondents appeared increasingly tolerant .
Fifty - three percent favor gay adoption rights ( 8 points more than in 2004 ) , and 66 percent believe gays should be able to serve openly in the military ( 6 points more than in 2004 ) .
" Despite the recently approved state measures , public opinion nationally has shifted against a federal ban on same - sex marriage .
In 2004 , people were evenly divided on the question , with 47 percent favoring a constitutional amendment prohibiting gay marriage and 45 percent opposing one .
In the latest poll , however , 52 percent oppose a ban and only 43 percent favor one .
When respondents were asked about state measures , the numbers were closer : 45 percent said they 'd vote in favor of an amendment outlawing gay marriage in their states , while 49 percent said they 'd oppose such a measure .
" A number of factors seem to play a role in swaying people one way or the other .
For instance , 62 percent of Americans say religious beliefs play an important role in shaping their views on gay marriage .
According to the survey , two - thirds of those who see marriage as primarily a legal matter support gay marriage .
On the other hand , two - thirds of those who see it as mostly a religious matter ( or equal parts religious and legal ) oppose gay marriage .
Moreover , the poll found significant differences across generational lines .
Essentially , the younger you are , the more likely you are to support same - sex marriage .
About half of those ages 18 to 34 back marriage rights , compared to roughly four in 10 among those ages 35 to 64 and only about two in 10 among those 65 and older .
The survey also detected a gender gap , with women more likely to support gay marriage than men , 44 percent to 34 percent .
Differences by race appear less noteworthy : 40 percent of whites approve of gay marriage , compared to 37 percent of non-whites . "

Discussing the failed auto bailout on CBS Evening News ( 12/12/08 ) :
KATIE COURIC :
And it ’s almost , meanwhile , turning to Washington , Bob , impossible to figure out just what happened to this auto bailout in the Senate .
There ’s all this finger pointing going on .
What is your take ?
Can you explain it to us in simple terms ?
BOB SCHIEFFER : I think frankly what happened , Katie , is that this is overwhelmingly unpopular , bailing out these auto companies with the public in general .
And every poll suggests that .
These leaders of the auto industry came to town first in their jet planes and now you find that the members of the union are not willing to consider a pay cut for the next two years .
It was a very easy vote for Republicans to vote to block this thing .
They were just doing what their constituents across the country kind of wanted them to do .
That may not be the right thing , but I think in the end that ’s really what did them in .
J.J. Abrams Star Trek reveals new Enterprise
Entertainment Weekly has revealed the first photo of the Enterprise from director J.J. Abrams ‘ Star Trek , opening in theaters on May 2009 .
You see not only Abrams ’ vision of the ship but his effort to evoke that sequence from the first film that so captured his imagination .
Abrams said : “ If you ’re going to do Star Trek there are many things you cannot change .
The Enterprise is a visual touchstone for so many people .
So if you ’re going to do the Enterprise , it better look like the Enterprise , because otherwise , what are you doing ? ”
I like this design .
This is very much the Enterprise , and yet , it ’s been worked over with a more modern , updated appearance .
I just hope that the ship will look great on the big screen .
Career Army Specialist sues Rumsfeld , Cheney , saying no evacuation order given on 9/11 Stephen C. Webster
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This A career Army specialist who survived the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , claims that no evacuation was ordered inside the Pentagon , despite flight controllers calling in warnings of approaching hijacked aircraft nearly 20 minutes before the building was struck .
According to a time - line of the attacks , the Federal Aviation Administration notified NORAD that American Airlines Flight 77 had been hijacked at 9:24 a.m.
The Pentagon was not struck until 9:43 a.m .
On behalf of Spc. April Gallop , who served in the Network Infrastructure Services Agency as an administrative specialist , California attorney William Veale has filed a civil suit against former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney and former US Air Force General Richard Myers , who was acting chairman of the joint chiefs on 9/11 .
It alleges they engaged in conspiracy to facilitate the terrorist attacks and purposefully failed to warn those inside the Pentagon , contributing to injuries she and her two - month - old son incurred .
" The ex-G.I. plaintiff alleges she has been denied government support since then , because she raised ' painful questions ' about the inexplicable failure of military defenses at the Pentagon that day , and especially the failure of officials to warn and evacuate the occupants of the building when they knew the attack was imminent " said Veale in a media advisory .
Spc. Gallop also says she heard two loud explosions , and does not believe that a Boeing 757 hit the building .
Her son sustained a serious brain injury , and Gallop herself was knocked unconscious after the roof collapsed onto her office .
The suit also named additional , unknown persons who had foreknowledge of the attacks .
" What they do n't want is for this to go into discovery , " said Gallop 's attorney , Mr. Veale , speaking to RAW STORY .
" If we can make it past their initial motion to dismiss these claims , and we get the power of subpoena , then we 've got a real shot at getting to the bottom of this .
We 've got the law on our side . "
The lawsuit 's full text follows .
An earlier version of this story erroneously identified Spc. Gallop as an ' officer . '
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ___
APRIL GALLOP , for Herself and as Mother and Next Friend of ELISHA GALLOP , a Minor , No. _____________
Plaintiff , Jury Trial Demanded
vs .
DICK CHENEY , Vice President of the U.S.A. , DONALD RUMSFELD , former U.S. Secretary of Defense , General RICHARD MYERS , U.S.A.F. ( Ret. ) , and John Does Nos. 1  X , all in their individual capacities , Defendants .
__________________________________________
COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS , CONSPIRACY , AND OTHER WRONGS
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
1 . This case arises from the infamous Attack on America of Sept 11 , 2001 , and especially on the Pentagon ; and is premised on an allegation of broad complicity in the attack on the part of key U.S. Government officials , beginning with and led from the top by Vice President Dick Cheney , then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and Richard Myers , then acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The plaintiffs allege that these and other government officials , whose identities will be ascertained from their proven or evident relevant roles and activities , and who are named herein as ' John Doe ' defendants , together with other known and unknown operatives and functionaries , official and otherwise , engaged in an unlawful conspiracy , or a set of related , ongoing conspiracies , in which the concrete objective was to facilitate and enable the hijacking of the airliners , and their use as living bombs to attack buildings containing thousands of innocent victims ; and then to cover up the truth about what they had done .
2 . The defendants ' purpose in aiding and facilitating the attack , and the overall object of the conspirac ( ies ) , was to bring about an unprecedented , horrifying and frightening catastrophe of terrorism inside the United States , which would give rise to a powerful reaction of fear and anger in the public , and in Washington .
This would generate a political atmosphere of acceptance in which the new Administration could enact and implement radical changes in the policy and practice of constitutional government in our country .
Much of their intention was spelled out prior to their coming into office , in publications of the so - called Project for the New American Century , of which defendants Cheney and Rumsfeld were major sponsors .
There they set forth specific objectives regarding the projection of U.S. military power abroad , particularly in Iraq , the Persian Gulf , and other oil - producing areas .
They observed , however , that the American people would not likely support the actions the sponsors believed were necessary , without being shocked into a new outlook by something cataclysmic : a new Pearl Harbor .
By helping the attack succeed , defendants and their cohorts created a basis for the seizure of extraordinary power , and a pretext for launching the so - called Global War on Terror , in the guise of which they were free to pursue plans for military conquest , full spectrum dominance  and  American primacy  around the world ; as they have done .
3 . In pursuit of the goals of the conspiracy , the named and unnamed defendants knowingly and by agreement committed a series of acts and omissions which were aimed at and did generally accomplish the following objectives :
+ To permit the men they later identified as the hijackers and any immediate accomplices to enter and remain in the country , and carry out the activities , movements and communications needed in their preparations for the hijacking , free from interference by police or counter - terrorist authorities ; and then allow the groups of these men to book passage , all on the same day , and board the flights ;
+ To cause normal operation of the regular off - course airline flight interception practice of the US Air Force , in cooperation with civil flight control authorities , to be altered , suspended or disrupted in such a way as to remove its protections , at least on that day , and thus permit three of the four apparently hijacked planes to reach their targets and crash into them ( or appear to do so ... ) ;
1
+ To cause the normal operation of ground and air defenses which guard the Pentagon from external attack to be altered , suspended or disrupted in such a way as to remove or negate the building 's normal protections , and thus permit an airliner , believed to be hijacked by possible suicide bombers , and following a forbidden , descending flight path , to reach the Pentagon undeterred ;
+ To cause and arrange for high explosive charges to be detonated inside the Pentagon , and / or a missile of some sort to be fired at the building , at or about the time the wayward airliner supposedly arrived there , to give the false impression that hijackers had crashed the plane into the building , as had apparently happened in New York ;
+ To arrange , thereafter , and fabricate , propound and defend , as part of the conspiracy , an elaborate , highly complex and sophisticated cover - up , centering around the Report of the 9/11 Commission , and continuing to this day .
To this end , defendants misappropriated the highest authority of government to block , misdirect and otherwise evade any fair , independent investigation of the evidence , and officially if implausibly explain away the evident wholesale failure of America 's defenses with misinformation , omissions and distortions , withheld and destroyed evidence , and outright lies .
4 . In the attack on the Pentagon , in particular , plaintiff avers that the official story , that a hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon and exploded ( causing the plaintiffs injuries ) , is false .
In fact , the bombing was accomplished another way , so as to limit the damage , protect the defendants , and only make it appear that a plane had been crashed into the building .
This claim is supported by data from the planes supposed black box , released by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , which indicate the plane passed over the building at very low altitude , just as an explosion and fireball were engineered by other means , a planted bomb or bombs and / or a missile .
This is supported by the lack of any photographic evidence of a wrecked airliner at the Pentagon , compounded by the record of reported refusal by the U.S. Department of Justice to release some 85 video tapes from surveillance cameras in locations at or near the Pentagon , which it has declared exempt from Freedom of Information Act disclosure .
5 . Whatever way the bombing of the Pentagon was accomplished , however , and whatever else may or may not have been done by defendants to facilitate the hijackings that day , it is clear the defendant top commanders would have had and did have , at a profound minimum , enough foreknowledge , on that day and in the intelligence information they received beforehand , to have sounded a warning in time for plaintiff and others to evacuate the building , and thereby avoid much if not all the death and injury which occurred .
In the end , more than half an hour passed after flight controllers first sounded the alert on Flight 77 , while all concerned were fully aware of the suicide crashes in New York ; plenty of time for the Pentagon to be evacuated .
 Top gun jet fighter - interceptors under defendants  command , available with time to spare , were not summoned ; and the people in the building , including plaintiff and her infant , were not
warned .
This was the result of unlawful conspiracy among these highest - level commanders , and others , who acted knowingly and intentionally to have the Pentagon attacked or to allow it to be attacked , without warning , with deliberate indifference to and in reckless and callous disregard for the fundamental constitutional and human rights of plaintiff and her child , and many other people , dead , injured and bereaved .
6. Plaintiff April Gallop brings this action for herself and as next friend of her son Elisha Gallop now aged 7 , who was a two - month - old baby in her arms on that day , her first back from maternity leave .
She was a career member of the US Army , a ranking specialist with top secret clearance , who had served six years , two - and - a - half of them in Germany , before being assigned to the Pentagon in 2000 .
Her desk was roughly 40 feet from the point where the plane allegedly hit the outside wall .
As she sat down to work there was an explosion , then another ; walls collapsed and the ceiling fell in .
Hit in the head , she was able to grab the baby and make her way towards the daylight showing through a blasted opening in the outside wall .
There was no airplane wreckage and no burning airplane fuel anywhere ; only rubble and dust .
7. Plaintiff and her baby both suffered substantial head and brain injuries , which seriously affect them still today .
Plaintiff charges that , because of the conspiracy alleged herein , she and her child and others were injured by acts of terrorism participated in by defendants .
Further , as more fully described within at Pars 57 - 59 , she and her child were and subsequently have been denied fundamental rights  including by acts of retaliation against her for raising painful questions about what occurred  as the cover - up continues .
JURISDICTION & VENUE
8 . This Court has jurisdiction of this case , as follows :

PARTIES
10 . Plaintiff APRIL GALLOP is an American citizen , resident of the State of Virginia , a member until this year of the U.S. Army , stationed at the Pentagon on 9/11 , claiming for herself and for her minor child , ELISHA GALLOP , who was just two months old on 9/11/01 , and was with her when the building was hit .
Plaintiff respectfully petitions the Court to appoint her as guardian ad litem for the purposes of this action and related matters .
11 . Defendants are DICK CHENEY , the Vice President of the United States ; DONALD RUMSFELD , formerly and at relevant times Secretary of Defense of the U.S. ; Gen. RICHARD MYERS , then acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; all sued in their individual capacities .
Additional named , unknown defendants are other persons who were and are co-actors and co-conspirators in sundry phases of the ( terrorist ) undertaking complained of herein , whose identities , and some of whose precise places or functions in the plot (s ) alleged herein are not yet known or fully known , but who certainly include high - ranking members of the Defense Department , the Military , the C.I.A. , the F.B.I. and other agencies .
Such persons are named and alleged as co-defendants , designated as John Does Nos.1 - X and hereby notified of this action , pro tanto , to be identified for the record and impleaded by plaintiffs as the particulars of both culpable and innocent acts and omissions by everyone involved in these events become known .
12 . Existence of a Class .
Plaintiff notes that a number of other persons suffered injury and loss in the Pentagon on September 11 as she did , and are similarly situated to her , plainly within the provisions of Rule 23 , F.R. Civ P. , so that she represents a Class , the members of which evidently are also entitled to recover judgment as sought herein .
She does not now assert the Class interest ; but , where it appears there could be action by the Court affecting this question , and a class could emerge , she wishes to and does hereby reserve the right , subject to the Courts approval , to act as lead plaintiff .
13 . Limitations .
There is no time bar to the claims in this action .
The Statute does not run against plaintiffs child , as a minor , under Virginia law ( Va. Code Ann. , § 8.01 -229 ) .
As to the plaintiff herself , defendants and their cohorts and agents , by means of elaborate planned and other ad hoc cover stories , public lying , alteration of records , misappropriation of official authority and other nefarious activities , have concealed and continue to conceal , fraudulently , the truth about the attacks and the way they occurred  and their own participation and complicity in the range of acts and omissions needed , in furtherance of conspiracy , to bring them about .
Likewise , the original conspiracy to act secretly in furtherance of terrorism , and lie and dissemble afterwards , in order to foment war and vengeance against the supposed perpetrators , has stayed alive and continued to harm the plaintiff , as she will show .
STATEMENT OF FACTS
I. Background : Al Qaeda and the 9/11 Attack
14 .
As the world knows , four large commercial airliners filled with ordinary passengers were reported hijacked in the northeastern United States the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
Two were evidently crashed into the World Trade Center towers in New York , which later collapsed ; a third was said to have hit the Pentagon in Washington DC , and the fourth , supposedly aiming for the White House or the Capitol , was reported crashed in Pennsylvania by its passengers , fighting back against the hijackers .
15 .
The alleged hijackers were quickly identified by US authorities , supposedly from passenger lists , as 19 men of Middle Eastern descent , fifteen from Saudi Arabia , two from the United Arab Emirates , one Egyptian and one Lebanese .
Their pictures , apparent police mug shots , were shown on TV around the world soon after the attack .
It emerged that some if not all of these men were already known to police and intelligence authorities in the US and elsewhere as terrorist suspects .
They were said to be associated with Al - Qaeda , a network of radical ' Islamic ' militants , led by the renegade Saudi aristocrat Osama bin Laden , and pledged to unremitting holy war against the United States and its people .
Al Qaeda was blamed for several previous terrorist attacks , including suicide attacks in which hundreds died , in the Middle East and Africa , and against a U.S. Navy warship in the Persian Gulf .
An earlier , precursor group of  Islamist terrorists , based in Brooklyn and New Jersey , carried out the first bombing of the World Trade Center , in 1993 .
16 .
At the time the Clinton Administration was succeeded by that of George W. Bush and defendant Dick Cheney , in January , 2001 , an extensive , complex U.S. counter - terrorism effort against Al Qaeda was in progress , involving personnel and resources from a number of government agencies , including the FBI , the CIA , the NSA , the U.S. Military , and others , requiring coordination between these agencies at the highest levels .
The Chief of Counterterrorism under President Clinton , Richard Clarke , was retained by Bush , but later strongly criticized the Bush Administration for ignoring the Al Qaeda threat , allowing the effort begun under Clinton to lapse , to the point where he felt constrained to apologize to the families of those who died , for the failure he said led directly to the devastation of September 11th .
At all events , it is clear from the accounts of Clarke and others that , once Mr. Bush and Defendant Cheney were in office , the effort to combat Al Qaeda was decisively blunted at the top , and at key points down the chain of command .
17 .
In particular , little or no attention was paid by defendants and others responsible to an increasingly explicit series of warnings , during 2001 , that Al Qaeda was hoping and planning to strike inside the US ; and that there were concrete plans  which cadres in U.S. agencies were aware of , and were in fact conducting exercises to prepare for , and defeat  which included attempting to crash planes into important buildings .
U.S. investigators were well aware that the man they believed was the enemy networks chief bomb - maker for the 1993 attack on the Trade Center , Ramzi Youssef , had hoped and attempted to bring a tower down in that attack ; and that this remained a goal of the group .
18 . Responsible intelligence officials were aware that Al Qaeda members were operating inside the U.S. , and there were a number of critical investigative leads .
Two of the hijackers - to - be lived with an FBI informant in San Diego .
The CIA monitored a meeting in Malaysia in 1999 , after which two of the participants came to the U.S. , where authorities supposedly lost track of them .
There were reports from FBI field offices in Arizona and elsewhere that figures on the suspect list were taking or seeking training as pilots  including one who reportedly said he only wanted to learn how to fly an airliner , not how to land or take off  but coordination and follow - up investigation on these and other leads was blocked by John Doe defendant CIA and FBI higher - ups and key players .
Notwithstanding such malfeasance , the signs and portents of an imminent attack were very strong in the summer of 2001 .
As the then CIA chief George Tenet testified ,  The system was blinking red . 
19 .
Despite the flow of ominous information to various sections of the US counterterrorism apparatus , however , and the danger to innocent people  and as a result of conspiracy among defendants Cheney and Rumsfeld , and other members of the Government in various positions  the many warnings of a coming attack by Al Qaeda forces ( as many as forty messages in all , according to the Commission Report , from eleven different countries ) were studiously ignored .
20 .
That is , defendants and others in the highest circles of the Government knew more than enough beforehand about the threat and gathering danger of an imminent possible attack by Al Qaeda in the U.S. to understand that they needed to take strong , thoroughgoing measures to increase the country 's protections and alertness .
Instead , led by defendants Cheney and Rumsfeld , and because defendants were callously indifferent to the rights and safety of innocents  including their own people in the Pentagon , plaintiff among them  the government did not respond .
On information and belief , no special meetings of high officials and agency heads were called , to make sure protections systems were on high alert and functioning properly , and that all needed information was being shared .
No special warnings were given to the Federal Aviation Administration , the Immigration Service , the Military and other affected agencies .
No consultations were had about possible methods of attack , including specifics about possible hijackings , and the use of planes as missiles to hit buildings , despite operational planning and training which had already occurred at lower echelons .
The FBI did not step up surveillance of suspected terrorist individuals or cells , or immigration checks , or let such people know they were being watched , in order to impede their activities ; and it appears that no coordinated , high - level monitoring and analysis of the threats , and planning for counteraction , ever took place .
Instead , the threat was dismissed , and ignored .
21 . It should be noted that plaintiff cannot and does not know with certainty the outlines of the plot at its initiation .
The attacks may have been conceived of as a false - flag operation from the beginning , with the defendants and their operatives as creators , planners , and executors , with the assistance of others as necessary .
Or , defendants may have employed Muslim extremists to carry out suicide attacks ; or they may have used Muslim extremists as dupes or patsies .
The roles of the supposed nineteen could have been to hijack the airliners , or simply , unwittingly , to be on the planes when they were crashed into buildings by remote control .
It is also possible that the defendants learned of a plot originated by Muslim extremists , and co-opted or overrode it with their own plan .
Whatever lay in the minds of the defendant conspirators at the outset , it is clear that the nineteen men so quickly identified as the hijackers , some if not all of them known terrorist suspects , traveling under their own names , simply walked onto the four planes that morning , with their box cutters , without hindrance or incident .
II . Failure of the Air Defense System .
22 . Accounts from the FAA and the National Military Command Center vary widely , suffer from internal contradictions , and are in conflict with each other ; but credible reports show that FAA flight controllers were aware of a problem with the first plane as early as 8:14 or 8:15 a.m. the morning of September 11th , and evidently called the military for emergency assistance , pursuant to routine , by 8:21 a.m. or thereabouts .
They learned the second plane was off course and not responding a short time later .
According to reports , United Flight 11 hit the WTC North Tower at 8:46 a.m. and Flight 175 hit the South Tower at 9:03 .
The Pentagon was hit at or about 9:32 a.m.  although the official version says 9:38  and the fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania shortly after 10:00 a.m .
High performance jet fighter planes stationed at various bases around the northeastern U.S.  tasked to intercept and deal with unidentified or straying aircraft entering or flying in U.S. airspace under NORAD district command , or otherwise at NORADs disposal  were available at a moment 's notice .
None were notified , however , or sent to the right place , until it was too late ; at least for the first three planes .
23 .
No interceptor planes came to stop the supposed hijackers  shoot them down if necessary  even though the Air Force has for many years maintained a practice of immediate response in which the fighters have readily been scrambled  when aircraft are seen to go too far off course , or lose radio contact with flight controllers .
The interceptor program has been an elite assignment in the Air Force , even after the Cold War ended , in which pilots fly regularly , and wait in ready rooms  near the hangars , and planes are kept in top condition , with engines warm and ready for takeoff .
The best jets are used , which can reach speeds of 1600 - 1800 miles per hour , and the personnel are so well trained and practiced that pilots routinely go from hearing the scramble order to 29,000 feet in less than three minutes .
The scramble orders are normally made by local NORAD commanders in cooperation with the FAA .
Both the FAA and the affected NORAD North East Air Defense Sector ( NEADS ) military command have radar tracking coverage of the entire airspace , and special telephone hotlines between them and with higher authority .
Nor are these forays rare , reportedly occurring once or twice a week at various U.S. locales during the past several years .
Published Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) records showed that , between September 1 , 2000 and June 1 , 2001 , interceptor jets took to the air 67 times to check on in - flight emergencies  involving wayward planes .
24 .
No interceptors came to defend the Pentagon , in particular , and plaintiff and the other occupants , because of actions and failures to act by defendant Rumsfeld , Defendant General Myers and John Doe others in concert with them , even though more than an hour passed between the time the first warning went out to the Military , at or about 8:21a.m. , and the attack on the Pentagon at 9:32 ; even though the first tower was hit in a suicide crash in New York at least 46 minutes before the Pentagon was hit ; and even though combat air patrol jets from any of several bases in the region could have reached the Pentagon  or the path of Flight 77  in a fraction of that time .
25 . Having pre-arranged a coordinated failure of the Pentagon defenses , and its warning system , the defendants hid and distracted themselves , and otherwise failed to act , just at the time they were needed to ensure defense of the building ; and they have dissembled ever since , as part of the conspiracy , in representing where they were and what they did during that time .
As with the planes that hit the towers in New York , the Military and the 9/11 Commission , while failing to cast blame , explained away the failure to launch fighter interceptors at the Pentagon as the result of a failure by flight controllers  which FAA personnel deny  to notify the Air Force of the flight emergencies in a timely way .
This was cover - up , in furtherance of the conspiracy .
26 . Likewise , by the acts of one or more defendants in furtherance of the conspiracy , no defenses at the Pentagon responded either , no missile or anti-aircraft batteries opening from the ground around the building , or the roof ; no sharpshooters deployed with hand - held missiles at stations close by ; nothing .
And , shockingly , when the towers in New York had already been hit , and Flight 77 ( or a substitute , see below ) was out of radio contact and headed back towards the capital ; and even when the plane approached , and then doubled back and headed toward the building in a long dive , no alarm was sounded .
27 .
It is evident , particularly with respect to the attack on the Pentagon in which the plaintiff and her baby were injured , that , if the building was hit by a plane that morning , or if , as appears more likely , a plane flew low over the building at the time the bomb (s ) went off inside and / or the missile hit , to give the ( false ) impression of a crash , some form of order or restriction was in force which suspended normal operation of the building 's defenses .
In particular , it is indisputable that the expected response of the fighter - interceptors failed completely ; and plaintiff avers this resulted from orders or authorization from within the defendant circle of Rumsfeld and Myers and their helpers , restraining normal operation of the protections system and armaments at the Pentagon  including but not limited to jets available at various bases near the capital .
28 . Plaintiff alleges further that such standdown orders , in whatever manner or form they had been prepared or issued , were maintained and affirmed by defendants up to and through that morning , and that defendant Cheney in particular , operating in the underground command bunker ( Presidential Emergency Operations Center , or PEOC ) beneath the White House , personally affirmed such an order .
His word kept the order in force during the period between 9:20 a.m. , when he was observed in the Bunker and the moment the Pentagon was hit .
29 .
In this connection , plaintiff refers the Court to the testimony of then - U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta to the 9/11 Commission .
Mineta testified that when he arrived at the White House , he was sent to the PEOC , and arrived at around 9:20 a.m. , to find Cheney there , and in charge .
He said he sat at a table with Cheney for the next period of time , during which a young man came in the room , three times , and informed the Vice President that an unidentified plane was approaching Washington , D.C. , first at 50 , then 30 , and then 10 miles out ; and that , when he reported the distance as 10 miles , the young man asked the vice president ,  Do the orders still stand ? 
Secretary Mineta testified that defendant Cheney responded sharply ,  Of course the orders still stand .
Have you heard anything to the contrary ?
Whereupon the young man left the room ; and a few minutes later , the hit on the Pentagon was announced .
This testimony by the Secretary has never been contested , discredited or explained away by any U.S. official .
30 .
Plaintiff alleges that the orders were orders not to intercept or shoot down the approaching plane .
If the orders had been to attack the approaching plane , it would have been shot down before it reached the Pentagon  or at least some attempt to stop it would have been made ; and the world would know of it .
Based on some two hundred years of American military history , the failure would have led to a Board of Inquiry or other public official investigation , to determine how and why the defense apparatus had failed .
Individuals would have been called to account , and disciplinary procedures followed resulting in findings of responsibility and demotions or formal charges against those found to have failed the Country .
All of these bureaucratic events would have become part of the official record , and known to the public ; none of which has happened .
There has been no publicly recorded disciplinary action against any military or civilian officer of the United States government as a result of the attacks of September 11th .
Such proceedings would have created a great risk that the truth would be exposed .
31 . The public record also shows that no meaningful follow - up questioning of Sec. Mineta occurred before the 9/11 Commission ; that defendant Cheney has never testified under oath or been reasonably questioned about these events ; and that he has given contradictory accounts , one of which --- the account he gave to Tim Russert on  Meet the Press five days after 9/11 --- conflicts with The 9/11 Commission Report .
The 9/11 Commission Report adopts an unsworn statement by Cheney that he never reached the bunker until about 10:00 a.m. ; and contains no reference to Minetas testimony , ignoring completely this contradiction between the two high government officials .
The Commission also ignores the fact that Richard Clarkes book  Against All Enemies  supports Minetas testimony and hence contradicts the 9/11 Commissions account .
32 . Plaintiff charges that , in point of fact , the orders  referred to were orders not to shoot the plane down , but to let it proceed , and that such orders were given and / or approved by defendants Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Myers , pursuant to the root conspiracy alleged herein , and transmitted down a chain of command .
The normal expected operation of Pentagon defense that day was thus prevented , allowing the attack to succeed , or to succeed  in creating a false and deceptive scenario of a plane crash .
III .
The Attack on the Pentagon .
33 .
At the Pentagon , the plaintiff was at her desk , with her baby , in her office on the first floor , when large explosions occurred , walls crumbled and the ceiling fell in .
Although her desk is just some forty feet from the supposed impact point , and she went out through the blown - open front of the building afterwards , she never saw any sign that an airliner crashed through .
If Flight 77 , or a substitute , did swoop low over the building , to create the false impression of a suicide attack , it was then flown away by its pilot , or remote control , and apparently crashed someplace else .
At the building , inside or outside of the wall the plane supposedly hit , there was no wreckage , no airplane fragments , no engines , no seats , no luggage , no fuselage sections with rows of windows , and especially , no blazing quantities of burning jet fuel .
The interior walls and ceilings and contents in that area were destroyed , but there was no sign of a crashed airplane .
A number of those present inside the building and out have attested to this fact in published reports .
34 . Instead , just when plaintiff turned on her computer  for an urgent document - clearing job she was directed by her supervisor to rush and begin , as soon as she arrived at work , without dropping her baby off at child care until she was finished  a huge explosion occurred , and at least one more that she heard and felt , and flames shot out of the computer .
Walls crumbled , the ceiling fell in , and she was knocked unconscious .
When she came to , terrified and in pain , she found the baby close by , picked him up , and , with other survivors caught in the area , made her way through rubble , smoke and dust towards daylight , which was showing through an open space that now gaped in the outside wall .
When she reached the outside she collapsed on the grass ; only to wake up in a hospital some time later .
35 . Plaintiffs injuries could have been avoided , had an alarm been sounded .
However , despite the undoubted knowledge of the defendant commanders and operators in the system that an unknown aircraft was headed towards Washington , possibly as part of the apparent terrorist suicide attack begun earlier in New York  and in spite of well - established Pentagon emergency evacuation procedures and training  there was no alarm .
On the contrary , plaintiff was directed to go straight to her desk when she arrived at work , and when she got there , and turned her computer on , the place blew up .
If an unauthorized non-military plane was headed towards the building , on a day when two apparently hijacked planes had hit the Twin Towers , why wasnt she evacuated , with her baby , instead of hurried inside ?
Why werent alarms going off , and all the people in the building rushing to safety ?
Due to the conspiracy , and defendants  actions and flagrant failures to act , in furtherance of it , one hundred and twenty - five people , members of the Military and civilian employees , died in the bombing ; and many more including plaintiff and her child were seriously hurt .
36 . Plaintiff alleges further that , pursuant to the conspiracy , the attack on the Pentagon was contrived to succeed  in only a very limited way .
Destruction , death and injuries , in comparison to what would have occurred if the building had been attacked straight on with a large plane , by enemies bent on causing the greatest possible devastation and loss of life , were kept to a minimum ; and the conspirators themselves not put at risk .
Certainly the official account of what occurred is full of gross anomalies ,
which contradict the physical evidence , the scientific and aeronautical evidence , and the laws of physics and aerodynamics .
The 9/11 Commission Report is exposed as an artifact of the conspiracy , aimed at covering up the fact that no airliner crashed into the Pentagon , and that it was bombed a different way .
37 .
The official account established in the 9/11 Commission hearings is that American Airlines Flight 77 , a Boeing 757-200 jetliner , took off from Dulles International Airport at or about 8:20 a.m. , and apparently was hijacked at about 8:55 a.m. some two or three hundred miles west of Washington .
Radio contact was lost and the planes transponder was turned off .
At that point , Flight 77 was traversing an apparent radar dead zone , located over the southeast Ohio - West Virginia borderland , where another similar plane , fitted with radio control reception equipment , may have been substituted , so as to ensure that the precise maneuvers required by the conspirators  plan could be carried out .
Whichever plane it was soon established a flight path leading back towards Washington at high speed , on a downward trajectory , until it was close to the Pentagon .
There it began a two - and - a - half - to - three - minute spiral dive , from an altitude of about 8000 feet and in a 330 - degree loop , which supposedly carried it into the northwest wall of the building .
Experts agree this dive was an aeronautically fantastic maneuver , nearly impossible for a plane of that size , which would require the most skillful and experienced pilot  or remote control .
38 .
The returning plane , according to the official version , struck the Pentagon just above ground level .
There it disintegrated  even maybe vaporized , according to some accounts , at least in part  but , paradoxically , also plowed inside .
Had it simply flown straight into the top of the building rather than making its improbable spiral dive , there would have been far greater damage and loss of life .
Had it turned only 150 - 180 degrees , it could have smashed into the East side of the building , where the office of defendant Rumsfeld was publicly known to be located on the third floor , looking out at the river , with the Joint Chiefs and other high officials all nearby .
In contrast , the ground floor area that was blown up held offices like the one plaintiff worked in , many of them empty for a remodeling project , which was said to have included reinforcement to protect against attack .
Another part of the destroyed space held financial records .
39 .
Also in the official version , the nose of the plane supposedly penetrated the distance of the three outer rings of the building , leaving a large , nine - or ten - foot - high round hole  shown in official photographs , without any sign of a plane  in the inner wall of the third ( C ) ring .
The hole was located some 300 feet from the alleged impact point , through a maze of structural pillars and interior walls .
It was also said that the wings of the plane knocked over five lampposts along a nearby road , as it approached the building , which meant the wings were a maximum of 50 feet off the ground as the plane flew past , roughly 300 - 350 yards away from the near face of the building .
40 .
This account is at odds with known evidence , and raises substantial questions about the absence of evidence  and official withholding of evidence  including the following :
a .
There are no photos of a wrecked airplane at the place where the building was hit and set on fire ; or of airplane wreckage at the hole in the inner ring where the nose of the plane was originally said by Rumsfeld to have come to rest , or elsewhere inside the building .
Moreover , the nose of such a plane contains radar equipment , and the outer shell is made of a porous , composite material that allows the radar to function .
Therefore , the nose was not capable of surviving an impact with the outer wall without being crushed , let alone penetrating all the way inside to the C - Ring wall , 300 feet away .
Although this story was later dropped , defendant Rumsfeld has never been publicly questioned about his statement that this is what occurred .
b. As noted , there is no footage from numerous video surveillance cameras  reportedly 85 different tapes are being withheld by the U.S. Justice Department  which are known or reliably assumed to have been operating at various nearby locations where some or all of the plane and the crash could be expected to have been caught on tape .
c. The official account says the plane knocked over several lampposts with its wings  two on one side of a nearby road , three on the other  which meant the wings were less than fifty feet off the ground as the plane approached , over uneven terrain , and the undercarriage even closer .
The earliest photographs , taken before the upper floors fell in , about 30 minutes after the explosion (s ) , show the front blown off an expanse of the ground floor , no marks on the lawn in front of the impact zone ; and several large cable reels standing in front of the building , unscathed .
d . The black box flight data recorder identified by the Government as coming from Flight 77 , and reportedly recovered from the wreckage at the scene , bears data , according to pilots who have examined printouts provided by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , which contradict various aspects of the official account ,  and indeed the very notion that a plane struck the Pentagon  in crucial ways , viz :
1 . It is a fundamental premise of airliner manufacture and operation that the black box only stops recording data when a flight is terminated  by the pilot turning off the engines at the gate , or by a crash .
According to the pilots who studied the printouts , however , the record showing the path of Flight 77 , etched with codes which connect it to that plane that day , cuts off , unaccountably , some 4-500 yards short of the building  a point reached after the pitched , diving loop described above  at an altitude of 273 feet .
The Pentagon is roughly 75 feet high .
Just as they will confirm the improbability of that dive , expert pilots will attest that for a plane that size to descend from 273 feet , going approximately 500 miles an hour , and then level off inside of a quarter mile without hitting the ground  let alone get down to 50 feet in time to catch the lampposts , 300 yards closer  is an aerodynamic and gravitational impossibility .
2 . The Safety Board has released a computer simulation of the flight path of Flight 77 , allegedly based on the data from the flight recorder , which contradicts a simulation adopted by the 9/11 Commission .
The Commission simulation shows the flight path of the official story , at an angle reflected by the damage inside the building , consistent with the downed light poles , and to the south of two nearby buildings housing the Navy Annex and a Citgo gas station .
The NTSB simulation shows the plane headed towards the building on a path north of the two buildings and the line of lampposts .
3 . Similarly , in the one fragment of a surveillance tape the Pentagon has released , two of the five frames disclosed appear to show an object , not recognizable as an airliner and apparently trailing a plume of white smoke , moving parallel to and just above the ground towards the Pentagon wall , followed by a bright explosion and a fireball mounting from the front of the building .
The NTSBs black box data shows Flight 77 was roughly 200 feet above the top of the Pentagon as it reached its last known position some 400 to 500 yards ( 2 - 3 seconds ) away .
Thus , it could not have hit the building except by diving into it , and so could not have flown parallel to the ground between there and the point of impact .
So it appears that , contrary to the defendants  false cover story of an airliner suicide crash , there was a different , additional , flying object , which hit the Pentagon , and was part of the terrorist bombing that caused the plaintiffs  injuries .
e. Additionally , the FBI identified the hijacker pilot of Flight 77 as  Hani Hanjour , supposedly a known terrorist suspect , who was reported to have received flight training in various places in the months before the attack .
His flight instructors , however , reported that Hanjour was such a poor flight student that he was barely able to fly a small Cessna ; and then he was so erratic that instructors refused to go up with him , and , just a few months before 9/11 , recommended he be washed out and his license taken away .
Thus it seems quite impossible that he could have flown the 757 really at all , let alone in its great uncanny dive .
There have also been repeated reports since 9/11 that several of the other men named and pictured by the FBI as the hijackers were still alive after 9/11 , and living in various locations in the world  including one , Waleed Al - Shehri , who was said to be a working pilot for Moroccan Air Lines , correctly shown in the FBI photo , whose identity and location have been verified by at least one major press outlet , the BBC .
This information has not been pursued by U.S. investigators , or media .
f. Several trained and experienced military personnel at the scene noted the distinctive odor of cordite , a high explosive used in gunpowder , in the aftermath of the attack at the Pentagon .
This suggests explosives as the cause for the destruction rather than the impact and fire resulting from burning jet fuel .
g . One investigator has documented the fact that numerous clocks in the damaged area of the building stopped at 9:32 a.m. , as the plaintiffs watch did also , supporting the idea that electrically timed or detonated explosives were used to bring about the intended damage to the building  and that the attack occurred at 9:32 , not 9:38 .
41 . All the matters alleged in paragraph # 40 are known and demonstrable , and most would have been immediately evident to the defendants at the time .
As Secretary of Defense , defendant Rumsfeld in particular was in a unique position to determine the truth and fix responsibility .
He did neither .
That he did not is confirmation of his complicity in the attack -- and his indifference to and callous disregard for the injuries and loss of rights suffered by plaintiff and others .
42 . Further , it should be noted that on September 10 , 2001 , the day before the attack , Defendant Rumsfeld conducted a press conference at the Pentagon in which he publicly announced that auditors had determined that some 2.3 trillion dollars in Defense Department funds  $ 2.300,000,000,000  could not be accounted for .
To plaintiffs knowledge and belief , part of the area of the ground floor of the Pentagon that was destroyed in the bombing is a location where records were kept that would be used to trace those funds , and where people worked who knew about them .
On information and belief , there has been to this day no public report concerning the fate of those records , or that money .
43 .
In any event , the plainly visible pattern of damage on the outside and in other photographic views makes it clear the building was not hit by a plane .
There may have been a missile strike , perhaps penetrating through to the back wall , which helped collapse the section that fell in , possibly augmented by explosives placed inside .
Photos taken before the collapse suggest this , showing a single blown - out window section , above the ground floor ; and witnesses have reported seeing a helicopter above the building , and disappearing behind it , followed by a big explosion and bright fireball .
As noted , a large roundish hole was found in the C- ring wall , some 300 feet inside the building ; and there were credible accounts , ignored in the Commission Report , of serious bomb damage in the B-ring , second from the center , and even some reports of dead bodies in the central A - ring , also ignored .
As shown on CNN television , a large military aircraft , identified as an E - 4B  the so - called  Doomsday Plane , which carries the most complete and sophisticated military command and control apparatus  was circling above Washington at the time the Pentagon was hit .
It was in perfect position to coordinate the detonation and / or missile shot with a fly - over ; and guide the airliner in its dive by remote control .
It was also in perfect position to spot the oncoming plane on its radar and sound an alarm .
Significantly , the Department of Defense has denied any knowledge of this airplane flying in that area on that day .
44 . Whatever the cause of the bombing , and the traumatic injuries to plaintiff and others which resulted , the Government , of which the two main defendants were and have been the highest , most powerful officers , pursuant to the conspiracy they led and still lead as alleged herein , has been altogether deceptive in investigating , reporting and explaining the attack and its cause ; and defendants , rather than righteously investigate and determine the derelictions which occurred , have done nothing but lie and cover up .
45 . Defendant Rumsfeld in particular has been deceptive from the start , as where , on September 13 , he reported on Good Morning , America that the plane ... went in through three rings ( of the Pentagon ) .
Im told the nose is  is still in there , very close to the inner courtyard , about one ring away ; a palpably false statement , contradicted by numerous witnesses , a total lack of photographic evidence , and evident impossibility .
Rumsfeld has also contradicted himself several times in describing his whereabouts and movements during the first hour or more of the attack .
He does not acknowledge his presence in a teleconference which Richard Clarke said he , Rumsfeld , and others were part of , beginning shortly after 9:00 a.m.  after the Flight 77 emergency was reported , at or about the time the second tower was hit in New York , and more than half an hour before the Pentagon was hit  and he contradicts himself about whether and when he went to the Executive Support Center and / or the National Military Command Center , both within the Pentagon , as events transpired that morning .
General Myers also ( falsely ) denied he was at the Pentagon in the early stages of the teleconference , as reported by Clarke .
Tellingly , the tape of the videoconference , which obviously would have been part of any good faith investigation , has been kept secret .
46 . Defendant Rumsfeld also made a striking prediction of the attack , as if speaking compulsively about his secret knowledge , that very morning , and several days later , he publicly referred to the missile that hit the Pentagon .
In testifying before the 9/11 Commission , the defendant stonewalled and double - talked egregiously , responding to direct questions ( some of them personally submitted by plaintiff herself during a hearing open only to survivors ) , especially about the Air Force fighter - interceptors not showing up , with irrelevant and sometimes incomprehensible ramblings .
Consistent with their part in the cover - up , Commissioners failed to question him closely or confront his non-responsiveness .
IV .
The Other Planes .
47 .
In spite of what the record shows was a regular , timely alert and request to NEADS commanders by FAA flight controllers at Boston for in - flight emergency response regarding United Airlines Flights 11 and 175 out of Boston , as described above in Pars.
22 - 24 , the jets were not scrambled , or properly vectored , in time to intercept the planes that hit the Towers in New York  even though there was plenty of time for the interception .
48 . With respect to Flight 93 , which was thought to be intended for an attack on the White House or the Capitol , but crashed in Pennsylvania , there remains a great deal of mystery .
Much of what supposedly happened was a made - in - Hollywood saga , where the passengers , learning of the earlier suicide crashes , gathered themselves and counter - attacked the hijackers , succeeding in heroic , self - sacrificing measure by crashing the plane ( or causing the hijacker pilot to crash it ) in a remote field , before it could approach its target .
This story was supposedly recounted to persons on the ground by passengers with cell phones ; but the science is clear that , at least in 2001 , cell phones could n't operate at the high altitude where the struggle supposedly took place .
Also , the FBI , in presenting evidence at the Moussaoui trial in 2006 , denied that any of the high - altitude calls that had been reported actually took place .
The only cell phone calls confirmed by the FBI were two that reportedly occurred when the plane had descended to 5,000 feet .
Thus , the mythic account is suspicious , to say the least .
49 .
Moreover , it appears fairly well established that one or more fighters ultimately did go aloft , and reached Flight 93 , although this was also comprehensively denied in the Commission Report .
There is also good evidence that supposed presidential authority to engage , meaning shoot down the plane , was given by defendant Cheney at or about 9:50 a.m. that morning , wherewith Flight 93 was indeed shot down with an air - to - air missile from a U.S.A.F. fighter jet .
50 .
Finally , there are multiple reports that debris from the plane was found a mile or more from the crash site , an obvious impossibility if the plane simply fell or dove into the ground .
Likewise , there is no debris visible in photographs of the crash site , despite a long photographic history of airliner crashes showing plane parts and debris spread around the point of impact .
Instead there was a crater , and no sign of the plane .
Implausibly , however , the official report said that a visa , in the name of the alleged hijacker identified as the pilot , was recovered near the crater , along with a red headband of the type the hijackers supposedly wore .
Again , available evidence shows the official account promulgated under the defendants  illicit influence is , and plaintiffs allege that it is , false and fraudulent , in furtherance of the conspirac ( ies ) alleged herein .
V. The Cover-up .
51 .
As with the other branches or phases of the conspiracy , wherein a number of John Doe defendants working on different aspects of the organized enablement of the hijacking led by defendants Cheney and Rumsfeld may not have been aware or fully aware of each other 's involvement ; so too with the cover - up , a complicated operation which those involved have maintained for these seven years , and must continue to see to , indefinitely , on any number of fronts .
That is , the skein of misrepresentations , distortions , omissions , contradictions , withheld evidence and outright lies which comprise the fraudulent official version , must be and plaintiffs allege that it has been and is assiduously , and fraudulently , maintained by the original perpetrators and various cohorts , who have kept the original conspiracy alive to this day .
52 .
In particular , the cover - up  beyond the fact that the simulated plane crash at the Pentagon was itself a cover - up  has been concentrated around the purported investigation and analysis of the attack and its supposed background by the 9/11 Commission , formally known as The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon The United States , and the Report it issued in 2004 .
There , as extensively shown by a number of critics and commentators , this official organ put forth a supposedly comprehensive account of the attacks , the alleged attackers and their history , and various surrounding events and circumstances , in a version so full of omissions , distortions and outright falsehoods , as to clinch its purpose as a mainstay of the cover - up , in furtherance of the underlying conspiracy alleged herein , and its ongoing success .
53 .
Thus the Report gives a careful account and description of some of the many warnings the Government received during 2001 about Al Qaeda 's intention to attack  in the United States , possibly with hijacked planes .
The Report goes on to describe an interview with President Bush , which occurred only after intense negotiations in which the Commissioners acquiesced to White House conditions requiring that defendant Cheney be permitted to accompany the President , and that no record would be kept and no notes taken .
There the President earnestly insisted to his Commission interlocutors that no warning of the attack had come .
All contradictions were left unexplored , and ignored in the Report .
54 . Similarly , defendant Rumsfeld  like the President himself , then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defendant Gen. Richard Myers and others  testified and said in public , repeatedly , that no one in the Government security apparatus ever imagined terrorists suicidally crashing planes into buildings .
This claim was also absolutely false .
In point of fact , the CIA , the NSA , the FAA and NORAD had planned and trained for just such a possibility .
Indeed , the record shows training exercises involving such a potential attack had in fact been carried on at the Pentagon in October , 2000 and May , 2001 , and that NORAD had begun planning in July , 2001 , for a training exercise in which the premise would be that a hijacked airliner was crashed into the World Trade Center .
The 9/11 Commission , however  with the same studied indifference it showed towards the Mineta testimony  failed even to mention these contradictions in its Report , let alone explain them away .
55 .
In any event , it is in the nature of the acts alleged that the participants would endeavor from the outset to keep their actions  and the meeting of the minds that unleashed them  the deepest and darkest of secrets , forever .
Thus the cover - up , even as it continues today , and will be manifest in the litigation of this complaint , was inherently part of the original unlawful agreement , and thereby part of the cause of the injuries and deprivations plaintiffs suffered on 9/11 , and continuing injury since that time .
56 .
As to the overall plot , with its roots in the command positions and unhinged political fantasies and intentions of the two main defendants , Cheney and Rumsfeld , plaintiff alleges that , necessarily , there were multiple meetings of the minds among the various necessary parties in various implicated locations , positions and phases of the action .
Indeed , the narrative reflects an evident form of rolling conspiracy , or multiple successive , interlocking , sub - conspiracies , by which defendants and their cohorts maintain and have maintained the original agreement to cover up the original crime (s ) of terrorism , and their part in it , to this day .
VII .
Plaintiffs  Injuries .
57 .
The injuries , loss and deprivation of rights suffered by Plaintiff April Gallop , her child and others in the bombing of the Pentagon , however it was accomplished , were the result of terrorism , and terrorist acts , and conspiracy to commit terrorism , and to violate constitutional rights , and they include serious head and brain injuries she and her child both sustained when the ceiling caved in on them , as well as the loss and deliberate denial of their rights involved in their being made innocent victims of the attack .
Plaintiffs son , Elisha , has had ongoing problems as he has grown older , associated with injury to his brain , and has required continuing medical care and other special help .
Both mother and child have had continuing difficulty , pain and suffering as a result , and sustained need for medical care , and financial and other loss ; and they evidently will continue to suffer and to need medical and other assistance for the future .
58 . Further , clearly as a result of and in retaliation for her public statement that no airplane wreckage was present in the building after the explosion (s ) , and for raising other questions , John Doe Department of Defense ( DOD ) defendants , pursuant to the conspiracy , have wrongfully caused plaintiff to be denied medical care and other benefits she should have received since the attack , and have acted to discourage others from helping her , all to her consequent , actionable loss .
Most recently , on being discharged from the Army earlier this year , plaintiffs financial account was closed out with a zero balance .
A short time later , however , she was refused service at the VA medical center , on grounds that she supposedly owed the Defense Department more than $ 14,000 ; for which no documentation has been provided .
59 .
The plaintiff and her child also will experience more general loss , pain and suffering , forever , from what was done to them by high officials of their own government , who , attacking the Country and the Constitution , were willing to see her killed , and did see many others , thousands , killed , simply to further crass political designs .
They were and are themselves terrorists , in truth , without whose crucial complicity the Al Qaeda attacks would never have occurred .
PLAINTIFFS ' CAUSES OF ACTION
One. Violation of Constitutional Rights  Bivens .
a. Conspiracy .
The defendants engaged in an unlawful conspiracy or series of interlocking conspiracies whereby they and various co-conspirators and others took various concrete steps , pursuant to a meeting of the minds around the objective of facilitating and enabling the terrorist attacks , specifically by de-activating and defaulting various normal defense systems and measures , as described and to be shown , so that the Al Qaeda hijackings and bombings of September 11 could succeed .
They thereby helped cause the attacks and the resulting injuries to plaintiff , denial of her fundamental rights under the Fourth , Fifth and Ninth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution , and death and injury loss to so many others ; entitling plaintiff to judgment against the defendants under the rule of the Bivens case , for compensatory damages in such amount as the Jury may determine ; and Punitive Damages .
b. Deliberate Indifference .
The concerted actions of defendants in their efforts to facilitate and enable the terrorist attacks of September 11 in various ways as described hereinabove and to be shown , and the defendants  deliberate indifference to the likelihood of serious injury and deprivation of rights arising therefrom , resulted in plaintiff and her child being made unknowing , defenseless victims of the attack , and thereby seriously injured and denied fundamental rights under the Fourth , Fifth and Ninth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution , entitling her to judgment against the defendants , under the rule of the Bivens case , for compensatory damages in such amount as the Jury may determine ; and Punitive Damages .
c. Retaliation .
The actions taken against plaintiff in retaliation for her speaking out with questions about the official explanations of what happened violated her rights under the First Amendment , entitling her to a further judgment against those responsible for compensatory damages in such amount as the Jury may determine ; and Punitive Damages .
Two .
Common Law Conspiracy to Cause Death and Great Bodily Harm .
The plaintiff is further entitled to judgment against the defendants , jointly and severally , for the injuries she and her child received which were caused by the acts and omissions of defendants and others pursuant to the conspiracy ( ies ) alleged herein , and by breach of defendants  duty of care towards the plaintiff , for compensatory and punitive damages in such amounts as the Jury may determine , and costs and attorneys fees .
Three .
Acts of Terrorism Causing Injury  18 U.S.Code 2333 ( a ) .
The aforesaid acts and omissions of and by defendants were part and parcel of a terrorist attack on the United States , and the Pentagon in particular , resulting from a conspiracy or conspiracies to cause and help cause , facilitate and enable the hijacking and crashing of the planes and other elements of the attack ; and these acts resulted in serious injuries to plaintiff and her child , entitling her to judgment against the defendants for compensatory damages as determined by the Jury , treble damages , and Attorneys Fees , under the Terrorism Acts  notwithstanding the provision of Sec.2337 , purporting to exempt or immunize U.S. officers and employees acting within official capacity or under color of legal authority  ; in that the agreements , acts and omissions alleged herein are outside and beyond the reach and compass of any conceivable official capacity or legal authority , actual or colorable , and therefore unconstitutional as applied in this case , as a deprivation of Due Process of Law , and of her right under the Seventh Amendment to have her claim tried by a Jury according to Law .
